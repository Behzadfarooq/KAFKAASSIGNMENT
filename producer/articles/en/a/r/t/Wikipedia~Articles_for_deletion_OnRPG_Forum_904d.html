<p><b>Keep</b> - This is one of the most popular source of free mmorpgs ever. It was even mentioned in an issue of PC Gamer. Why would you even conidier deleting it? The staff are almost active, the star/honourary members are much respected. This fourm is worthy of a page on Wikipedia. Witchunter.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - People are not trying to delete this for any bad reason, most of them are from Onrpg, they just want a more informative wiki page. I think the page was fine but the staff here at wiki decided to be as immature about the situation as the members at the place and this is very dissapointing. I thought the origonal information was fine and could have made better but that's an easy edit. Now it makes the site look bad and it truely isn't, it decides to attack Moderators that are actually quite responsive to forum problems but we feel our members have freedom to a point and we should not lock them up in to specific topics or yelling at them when they do one simple thing.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> - A large community resides in OnRPG, numbers of visitors that range from 400 to 1500 visit OnRPG everyday. Being the one of the best free mmorpg directory on internet, no doubt it's going to be 'notable' in the near future. As a web database for all information, why don't, you Wikipedia people, keep this article and propell OnRPG to a even more greater fame? I also like to emphasize this, in my opinion, the forum is 'notable' but the site itself is even more 'notable'. It has also several sites under its name specialising in CG, Anime and more. Contents that concerned the development of free MMORPGs and major incoming MMORPGs are added into OnRPG frequently, no doubt it's a paradise for gamers.</p>
<p><b>Delete</b> - I don't see any real assertion of notability. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 17:08, 7 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>LOL wtf is a sock puppet? Anyway, I say <b>keep</b>. OnRPG's huge community and its ever-expanding directory is notable in and of itself.

<dd><b>Comment</b> A <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sock puppet</a> usually means a user who creates multiple login names in order to pretend to be multiple people.

What we have in this discussion is a large number of people who are newcomers to Wikipedia expressing their opinions, presumably led here by a posting in the OnRPG forum.

<li><b>Comment</b> The OnRPG website currently doesn't have a page, and it sounds like the site may be notable enough, though not the site's forums on their own.

<li><b>Keep</b> - OnRPG has been mentioned in magizenes such as PC Gamer, and has a great community. But it's sole purpose is to provide information on all the MMOs out there, and it succedes,being one of the most informative on the web. The forums are just in place for general coversation and (mainly) for people with questions on a praticular game.The moderators are frequently active and people will generally get a reply within a few minutes.</li>
<li>The entry itself is named 'OnRPG forums',which is wrong and should just be called OnRPG or OnRPG-online MMO directory. The entry just needs some work really, and it does not need to be deleted.Give it time.</li>
<li>Please ignore the idiots who posted here with dumb responces and flames. This has been posted in our forums to make people aware of it and they are just trying to defend our website. They do not represent us as a whole. (<a href="../../../r/e/a/User%7EReap%D0%ADr_d8bd.html" title="User:ReapЭr">ReapЭr</a> 23:51, 10 April 2006 (UTC))</li>
