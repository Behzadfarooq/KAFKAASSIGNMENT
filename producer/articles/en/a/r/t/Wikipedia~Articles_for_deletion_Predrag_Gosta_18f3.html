<p>1. The username is Pgosta. The subject probably wrote this. 2. If you read it carefully it is written in a self promoting way. 3. The Awards and Recognitions section contains accomplishments which can not be verified by other sources and would only be known by the subject. This article was written by the subject. The external links are basically advertisements for his websites.</p>
<p>ALSO: Later the subject apparently edited the page two different times without logging in and his IP addresses were logged. Guess what? The IP addresses are out of Atlanta, GA, which is where Predrag Gosta lives.

<p>If you put the puzzle pieces together with him having an apparently Yugoslavian name, the above shows that the subject of this article is also the AUTHOR.

<li><b>Keep and revise</b>— Agree that the author of an article should not promote himself. And the AfD nomination makes an extremely compelling case that this is most probably self promotion. That said, the source is not automatic reason for deletion; it is an automatic reason for editing to exclude those things which can not be independently verified. There are legitimate independent internet articles confirming Predrag Gosta's existence and suggesting/supporting notability. See <a href="http://www.newtrinitybaroque.org/biographies/artisticdirector.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newtrinitybaroque.org/biographies/artisticdirector.html" rel="nofollow">example 1</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/artist/-/digital-music/277806/103-3011710-6555067" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/artist/-/digital-music/277806/103-3011710-6555067" rel="nofollow">Amazon example</a>, <a href="http://www.pbase.com/rcalmes/image/57223436" class="external text" title="http://www.pbase.com/rcalmes/image/57223436" rel="nofollow">The Gwinnett Ballet Theatre Orchestra, Predrag Gosta Conducting</a> and so forth.

<li><strike><b>Delete</b></strike><b>Weak Delete</b>. Wow... at first I was going to complain about your lengthy nomination, but it's clearly needed with such a complicated web of blatant self-promotion. I think everything posted by the author should be tagged for NPOV. I would agree with Williamborg that the Ballet has at least borderline notability and verifiability. But does this confer notability on its creator? I'm skeptical. It's also very weak on the verifiability for <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predrag_Gosta_8f39.html" title="Predrag Gosta">Predrag Gosta</a>. In another case I might be more inclined to give it the benefit of the doubt, but such an agregious violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> holds some weight as well. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 15:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and revise</b> per <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliamborg_e2f0.html" title="User:Williamborg">Williamborg (Bill)</a>. The article does a decent job of arguing for notability, although I strongly agree all awards, honors, etc need citations as quickly as possible. The article author could very well have intended self-promotion but unless s/he blocks others who make good faith edits to it, I would say let wiki-darwinism make the article what it should be. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 16:55, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm uneasy on this one. Much that I'm normally inclusionist on such matters. The self-promotion is unmistakable, and the notability is not quite evident to me. Of the prizes listed, most may just be minor student-level awards. And the early music ensemble he founded doesn't seem to have gone much beyond regional notablility. They've produced some CDs that apparently won some (modest) acclaim, but I can't quickly find much on the web in terms of independent critical acclaim for the conductor, or reviews in major music journals. The CDs were all produced by Gosta's own firm, <a href="../../../e/d/i/Edition_Lilac_fda7.html" title="Edition Lilac">Edition Lilac</a> (another article created by Gosta himself). Borderline case for me. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 21:03, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Creating an article about yourself</dd>
<dd>Creating or editing an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it will likely be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Ok, I'm not wild about the idea that he has created most of the blue links off of his page. (If anyone is interested, nearly all of his "collaborators" (remember what that term used to mean?) have wikipedia entries because he made them). I can buy CDs on which he acted as conductor, not only from his own site but from others, Amazon etc. To me that makes him notable. I'd strip his entry down to bare basics and allow others to build it back up. <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 11:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As far as my account being called a single purpose account, think of it this way: I am strongly considering taking up wikiing as a hobby as it allows me a venue for one of my favorite pastimes -- web research. I consider the debate here as test. Does Darwinism work? I am perusing Wikipedia and stumble on what seems the subject's laughable self promotion and wonder, "Is this myspace?" Now I am at a place where I wonder whether this is a place I want to contribute my time to or not.</dd>
