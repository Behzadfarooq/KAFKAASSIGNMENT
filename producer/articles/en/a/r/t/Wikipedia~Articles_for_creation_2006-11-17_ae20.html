<p>'<i><b>Nagpur Second Capital of Maharashtra as well as India'</b></i></p>
<p>Nagpur is the second capital of Maharashatra and proposed capital of demanded vidharbha state.But few people know that Nagpur can as well serve as capital of India in case of emergency.This is because as it is the geographical center there are 5 Air force bases from any side of the country which has to be crossed to reach Nagpur,making it one of the safest place in India at the time of emergency such as war</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Thomas J. Fogarty, M.D.">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Thomas J. Fogarty, M.D.</span></h2>
<p>Born in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1934. His father died when young Fogarty was 8 (or 6 - sources vary), leaving him to do home repairs for his mother. He also was a Golden gloves boxing champion with a professional boxing record of 1-0.</p>
<p>He invented the centrifugal clutch at the age of 15 and the embolectomy balloon catheter (i.e., the Fogarty catheter) while in medical school at the University of Cincinnati (or as a scrub technician before medical school - sources vary) by altering a surgical glove using techniques learned from fly-fishing. In 2000 Dr. Fogarty won the Lemelson-MIT Prize for Invention and Innovation (the world's largest single award for invention and innovation). He is named on over 100 patents for surgical instruments and is an inductee in the National Inventors Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Dr. Fogarty was a member of the surgical team under Dr. Norman Shumway that performed the first heart transplant in the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Fogarty was the President of the Stanford Medical Center from 1977-1979 and has founded or co-founded over 30 companies in the medical field. He also founded Three Arch Partners, a medical device venture capital firm.</p>
<p>Dr. Fogarty owns and operates Fogarty Research &amp; Development, and Thomas Fogarty Winery. The latter produces around 15,000 cases of wine annually.</p>
<p>In 2000, Dr. Fogarty also established the Fogarty Medical Foundation, through which he has donated over $250,000 to non-profit health research.</p>
<p>Dr. Fogarty famously said, "failure is the preamble to success."</p>

<p>The Universits of Cincinatti has been collecting new buildings by some of America's most innovative and recognized architects, and architectural firms. The campus is already home to a frank Ghery, A Peter Eisenman, and a few others. The most recognizable name to have entered the campus is Thom Mayne. The superstar architect, winner of the Pritzer Prize in 2005, has won and finished the comission for the Student Recreation Center at the University of Cincinnati. This building cost $133 million and is home to a restaurant, dininh hall, lecture halls, dorms, and bleacher seating for the football stadium. as apart of the recreational facilities, this building boasts a suspended track over six basketball courts, a lap pool, a leaisure pool, and a 'lazy river.'Students on campus will definately benefit from all the ammenities provided by this new facility.The only down side is that the dormitory rooms have been affectionately described a prision cells. The windows in the rooms are small and let in very little light. This is unfourtionate because there are four floors of student housing above the lecture halls. The building is over a thousand feet long and has the potential to be a giant slab of concrete if it wasn't for the ingenious planning of Thom Mayne. He realized that the building would need to be broken up to reduce the appearance of its size. So he took this idea litteraly and the center is comprised of three seperate, but connected pieces. In the middle of two of these pieces is the traditional 'Main street' that runs throgh campus. With the building of the Student Recreational Center, the 'street' was paved in brick and lined with benches and areas for students to gather. Thom Mayne decided to break up the building based on the land. It is a very important part of his building aesthetic to make sure the land and the building are cohesive. Mayne managed to make the giant structure have a fluid presence that is apealing to the eye and is not overbearing.

<p>Devajyoti Ray (born in 1974-) is one of India’s well known younger generation artists who had recently come to forefront with his exhibitions of pseudorealistic paintings.</p>
<p>Ray comes from a Bengali family that had traveled all over India as Ray’s father had been working for the Government of India. Ray had his childhood education at various places, and experience which brought into his art a rare variety of symbolism, folk traditions, and metaphor.</p>
<p>Ray is however best known for his Pseudorealistic works, which have been exhibited at many major galleries and have been appreciated in India and abroad with great enthusiasm. Pseudorealism of Ray involves the playing of offbeat colours in unrealistic fashion and thereby creating a comprehendible realistic imagery.</p>
<p>In Despair, Soliloqui, the tryptichs are some of the best known works of Ray. They have fetched good prices in the recently held shows.</p>

MedEdPORTAL (<a href="http://www.aamc.org/mededportal" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.aamc.org/mededportal" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) is a fundamentally new type of publication that supports the emerging trend of faculty publishing educational resources that they have personally developed. MedEdPORTAL is designed to help medical school faculty publish and share free medical educational resources that can be used by any medical school in the world. MedEdPORTAL is funded by the Association of American Medical Colleges and was designed to promote collaboration and educational scholarship by facilitating the open exchange of peer-reviewed teaching resources such as tutorials, virtual patients, cases, lab manuals, assessment instruments, faculty development materials, etc. MedEdPORTAL contains information about published resources and indicates how these materials may be accessed or obtained by interested faculty.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Publishing through MedEdPORTAL</b></p>
<p>From its conception, MedEdPORTAL was designed to serve as a prestigious publishing venue through which faculty may disseminate their educational works. An educational resource successfully peer-reviewed and published through MedEdPORTAL is comparable to a peer-reviewed research paper published through a reputable print-based journal and should be considered a compelling scholarly contribution suitable to support promotion and tenure decisions.</p>
<p><br />
Virtual Patients</p>
<p>MedEdPORTAL has indexed over 100 Virtual Patients (VPs), interactive programs that simulate real-life clinical scenarios. The VPs were collected during the AAMC VP Inventory Project conducted in 2005. With VPs, learners can take patient histories, simulate many aspects of the physical exam, and even make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. Such media-rich programs are both labor and resource-intensive to develop. Through MedEdPORTAL users can locate VPs that address a wide variety of clinical scenarios, all the way from pneumonia and obesity to Prader Willi Syndrome.</p>

<pre>
                                            <b> History</b>
</pre>
<p>Obscenity was first addressed with the Lord Campbell’s Act in 1857. Lord Campbell’s Act prohibited the publication of obscene literature, while authorizing post offices to remove the publications from the mail and indict the senders. This attack was under continuous scrutiny because people believed that it caused authors to promote a false image of society and that it diminished the values of literature. The one thing that Lord Campbell’s Act did not provide, though, was a clear definition of what was obscene, and therefore could be censored. The Hicklin Rule solved this problem. The Hicklin Rule was named after Benjamin Hicklin, a recorder in London following the Regina v. Hicklin court case in 1868. This case was brought against Henry Scott because he had created an offensive anti-Catholic booklet called “The Confessional Unmasked.” The consequence of this hearing was a definition of what was considered illegally obscene at the time: "the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences [such as small children], and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall." Hicklin allowed for passages to be judged when taken out of context, wherein if one small portion of a work was deemed obscene, the entire work would be outlawed. He also condoned the use of search warrants in the event of suspected retail or circulation of obscene materials. This English law was soon adopted by the United States and was enforced by Anthony Comstock, a special agent of the United States Post Office. In 1873, Comstock proposed that the Hicklin Rule be extended to prohibit “any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of contraception or procuring of abortion.” This became known as the Comstock Law. Although this law led to several court hearings, the outcome was usually based on the Hicklin definition of obscenity.</p>
<pre>
                                   <b>Progression of Obscenity Law'</b>
</pre>
<p>The Hicklin Rule was utilized up until the 1930s, when it was eventually abandoned for the “work as a whole” test. Two major court cases during the 1930s led to this final decision. The first of these cases involved Mary Ware Dennet, a birth control activist, and her booklet on sex education. The case against Dennet was thrown out after the agreement that sex education is acceptable when presented in a decent way. The second case involved James Joyce’s book Ulysses, which led to an obscenity case after it was forbidden to pass through the U.S. Customs. It was decided that—as a whole—Joyce’s book was not obscene. Because of this ruling, courts began to focus on the entire work when judging obscenity rather than isolated passages. In 1957, the Roth v. United States case answered the question about First Amendment protection of obscenity. Justice William Brennan claimed that sexual materials that are considered prurient and are not socially important are not protected under the First Amendment and are, therefore, open to censorship. However, the vague wording about social importance led to confusion in future obscenity court cases.</p>

Basque is an <a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergative-absolutive_language.html" title="Ergative-absolutive language">ergative-absolutive language</a>. The subject of an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intransitive_verb.html" title="Intransitive verb">intransitive verb</a> is in the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutive_case.html" title="Absolutive case">absolutive case</a> (which is unmarked), and the same case is used for the <i><a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct_object.html" title="Direct object">direct object</a></i> of a <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_verb.html" title="Transitive verb">transitive verb</a>. The subject of the transitive verb (that is, the agent) is marked differently, with the <a href="../../../e/r/g/Ergative_case.html" title="Ergative case">ergative case</a> (shown by the suffix <i>-k</i>). This also triggers main and auxiliary verbal agreement.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../a/u/x/Auxiliary_verb.html" title="Auxiliary verb">auxiliary verb</a>, which accompanies most main verbs, agrees not only with the subject, but with the direct object and the indirect object, if present. (There may also be agreement with the listener, based on gender and familiarity.) Among European languages, this polypersonal system (multiple verb agreement) is only found in Basque, some Caucasian languages, and Hungarian. The ergative-absolutive alignment is also unique among European languages, and rather rare worldwide.</p>
<p>Consider the phrase:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>Martinek egunkariak erosten dizkit.</i></dd>
<dd>"Martin buys the newspapers for me."</dd>
</dl>
<p><i>Martin-ek</i> is the agent (transitive subject), so it is marked with the ergative case ending <i>-k</i> (with an <a href="../../../e/p/e/Epenthesis.html" title="Epenthesis">epenthetic</a> <i>-e-</i>). <i>Egunkariak</i> has an <i>-ak</i> ending which marks plural object (plural absolutive, direct object case). The verb is <i>erosten dizkit</i>, in which <i>erosten</i> is a kind of gerund ("buying") and the auxiliary <i>dizkit</i> indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>di-</i> marks a verb with the equivalent of both a direct and an indirect object, in the present tense;</li>
<li><i>-zki-</i> marks the equivalent of a plural direct object (in this case the newspapers; if it were singular there would be no infix); and</li>
<li><i>-t</i> is the equivalent of the indirect object mark: "to/for me".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>in this instance an unmarked or "null case" equates to the "nork", which in most European languages would be the subject.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phrase:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"you buy the newspapers for me" would translate as:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Zuek egunkariak erosten dizkidazue</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The auxiliary verb is composed as di-zki-da-zue</p>
<p>(equivalent terms in European languages)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>di-</i> = direct object</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>-zki-</i> = marks plural of direct object</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>-da-</i> = indirect object (to/for me) {-t becomes -da- when intercalated.}</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>-zue</i> = subject (you pl.)</li>
</ul>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Verbs">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Verbs</span></h3>
<p>Modern Basque dialects allow for the conjugation of about fifteen verbs, called synthetic verbs, some only in literary contexts. These can be put in the present and past tenses in the indicative and subjunctive moods, in three tenses in the conditional and potential moods, and in one tense in the imperative. Colloquial Basque, however, only uses indicative present, indicative past, and imperative. Each verb that can be taken intransitively has a <i>nor</i> (absolutive) paradigm and possibly a <i>nor-nori</i> (absolutive-dative) paradigm, as in the sentence <i>Aititeri txapela erori zaio</i> ("The hat fell from grandfather['s head]") <a href="http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ehu.es/grammar/gram42.htm#1.4.2.2.%20%20Potential%20paradigms:%20absolut" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Each verb that can be taken transitively uses those two paradigms for passive-voice contexts in which no agent is mentioned, and also has a <i>nor-nork</i> (absolutive-ergative) paradigm and possibly a <i>nor-nori-nork</i> (absolutive-dative-ergative) paradigm. The last would entail the <i>dizkidazue</i> example above. In each paradigm, each constituent noun can take on any of eight persons, five singular and three plural, with the exception of <i>nor-nori-nork</i> in which the absolutive can only be third person singular or plural. (This draws on a language universal; *"Yesterday the boss presented the committee me" sounds at least odd, if not incorrect.) The most ubiquitous auxiliary, <i>izan,</i> can be used in any of these paradigms, depending on the nature of the verb it is used with.</p>
<p>There are more persons in the singular (5) than in the plural (3) for synthetic verbs because of the two familiar persons—informal masculine and feminine second person singular. The pronoun <i>hi</i> is used for both of them but where the masculine form of the verb uses a <i>-k</i> the feminine uses an <i>-n.</i> This is a property not found in Indo-European languages. The entire paradigm of the verb is further augmented by inflecting for "listener": even if the verb contains no second person constituent, if the situation is one in which the familiar masculine may be used, the form is augmented and modified accordingly; likewise for the familiar feminine. Notice that this nearly multiplies the number of possible forms by three. Yet the restrictions on contexts in which these forms may be used is strong: all participants in the conversation must be friends of the same sex, and not too far apart in age. Some dialects dispense of the familiar forms entirely. Note however that the formal second person singular conjugates in parallel to the other plural forms, perhaps indicating that it used to be the second person plural, started being used as a singular formal, and then the modern second person plural was formulated as an innovation.</p>
<p>All the other verbs in Basque are employed as compound verbs, consisting of a nonfinite form and then the auxiliary. This nonfinite form behaves much as a participle does in English, and declines only for <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grammatical_aspect.html" title="Grammatical aspect">aspect</a>, of which there are three: perfect (various suffixes), imperfect (suffix <i>-t[z]en</i>) and future (suffix. <i>-ko/-go</i>). Verbs of Latinate origin in Basque, as well as many other verbs, have a suffix <i>-tu</i> in the perfect, borrowed from the Latin <i>-tus</i> suffix. The synthetic verbs also have these forms, for use in perfect tenses and in simple tenses in which they are deponent. The dictionary entry for a verb is always listed in the perfect aspect. An infinitive will be found in its "stem form" (that is to say, without an aspect) only in a very few cases, the most common of which is when the auxiliary is in the potential mood, but only in northern dialects and literary Basque.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Nouns">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nouns</span></h3>
<p>A Basque <a href="../../../n/o/u/Noun.html" title="Noun">noun</a> is inflected in 17 different ways for case, multiplied by 4 ways for its definiteness and number. These first 68 forms are further modified based on other parts of the sentence, which in turn are inflected for the noun again. It's been estimated that at two levels of <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recursion.html" title="Recursion">recursion</a>, a Basque noun may have 458,683 inflected forms (<a href="http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/A/A92/A92-1016.pdf" class="external text" title="http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/A/A92/A92-1016.pdf" rel="nofollow">Agirre et al, 1992</a>).</p>
<p>Within a noun phrase, simple adjectives follow the noun. The only inflected constituent is the last, unlike in many Indo-European languages and Finnish, where all simple constituents are inflected. If there is an adjective, then, the noun and all the adjectives except the last one stay in the absolutive. A noun phrase in the absolutive will add the determiner <i>-a</i> to the end unless the last constituent is a determiner. Some determiners include <i>bat</i> "one, a (particular)" <i>hau</i> "this," <i>hori</i> "that (nearby)," <i>hura</i> "that (far or anaphoric)." The determiner is always placed directly after the last word in the noun phrase. Only its case ending and a possible particle can come after it. Complex adjectives, such as clauses and nouns in adjectival cases, come before the noun.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Word Order">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Word Order</span></h3>
<p>Basque word order is generally topic-focus, meaning that in neutral sentences (such as sentences to inform someone of a fact or event) the <a href="../../../t/o/p/Topic_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Topic (linguistics)">topic</a> is stated first, then the <a href="../../../f/o/c/Focus_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Focus (linguistics)">focus</a>. In such sentences, the verb phrase comes at the end. A more tightly binding rule, however, is that the focus directly precedes the verb phrase. Notice that this applies, too, for question words in questions. "What is this?" can be translated as <i>Zer da hau?</i> or <i>Hau zer da?</i>, but in both cases the question word <i>zer</i> immediately precedes the verb. This rule is so important in Basque that, even in grammatical descriptions of Basque in other languages, the Basque word for "focus," <i>galdegai,</i> is used.</p>
<p>Within a verb phrase, the periphrastic comes first, and then the auxiliary.</p>
<p>In negative sentences, the order changes: the negative particle <i>ez</i> must always directly precede the auxiliary, the topic most often comes beforehand, and the rest of the sentence afterward. This includes the periphrastic, if there is one: <i>Aitak frantsesa ikasten du,</i> "Father is learning French," in the negative becomes <i>Aitak ez du frantsesa ikasten,</i> in which <i>ikasten</i> ("learning") is separated from its auxiliary and placed at the end.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Periphrastics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Periphrastics</span></h3>
<p>Basque is rich in ways to modify the situation surrounding a verb. Periphrastics work much like the nonfinite forms of verbs but only have one form and have grammatical meanings. Almost every periphrastic has its own syntactical peculiarities, but in general they come between the nonfinite form and the auxiliary. Some examples include <i>ari</i> "continuous activity," <i>nahi</i> "want to," <i>behar</i> "must, have to, need to," <i>ahal</i> "can, could, will be able to," <i>ezin</i> "can't, couldn't, won't be able to," <i>ohi</i> "tends to, used to (depending on tense of the auxiliary)." Some of them, such as <i>nahi</i> and <i>behar,</i> are by nature transitive, and then the auxiliary will inflect for a singular object, namely, the infinitive that needs to be done. <i>Ari,</i> on the other hand, is almost exclusively intransitive.</p>

Microsystems are miniaturized silicon devices which perform non-electronic functions, typically sensing and actuation. Typical microsystems have mechanical parts, like microbridges in RF switches or bending cantilevers in atomic force microscopes; electrical parts like piezoresistors in airbag sensors or capacitors in pressure sensors; or thermal and fluidic structures like heaters and nozzles in inkjet printers.</p>

<p>Japanese Fish Productions is a small video production group that has gained a decent amount of reputation in the passed couple years. They were started in early 2005. They are a small group, with a low budget camera, who are just trying to produce the best movies around. They tend to try to portray problems in society in more of a comical sense. Their first movie was finished around just before the new year in 2005. This movie dealt with the oncoming disaster of the Avian Flu.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Douglas Arant">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Douglas Arant</span></h2>
<p>William Douglas Arant, a well-known Birmingham attorney, was born May 19, 1897 on a small farm in Waverly, Lee County. He was the son of William Jackson and Emma (Baker) Arant. The Arants were French Huguenots, coming to Orange County, South Carolina, and thence migrating to several states. The Alabama Arants settled in central Alabama early in the 19th century. Douglas Arant’s father was a staunch and upright man, born in rural Alabama and endowed with the virtues of his ancestry and the farming community. He had to work hard all his life, and spent a great deal of it caring for his family. A burden lightened by his incredible sense of humor. Emma Baker, Douglas Arant’s mother, was a lovely young woman of English ancestry.</p>
<p>From the beginning Douglas was a serious child. According to an anecdotal account, when he was very small he went to school one day with Roscoe, his older brother who was then in the first grade. During the spelling lesson, their teacher called on Douglas to spell cat. Douglas rose, looking very solemn and replied with dignity, “I don’t spell.”</p>
<p>Determined to get the best education possible and inspired by the accomplishments of his admired older brother, Herschel, he studied long hours and, encouraged by his teachers, he finished High School in three years (1914) and then received a scholarship given by General and Mrs. R. D. Johnston. He then enrolled at the University of Virginia. At Virginia he studied and worked at any job he could find, he waited tables, and one term worked in the Observatory measuring the parallex of fixed stars. He would go in three nights a week at mid night, work until daybreak, and then attend his classes without any rest. In May 1918 his studies were interrupted by the war. He went home at that time for the sadest day of his life, the death of his mother. From Opelika, he went to Atlanta hoping to enlist as a Navy flier, but his eyesight was poor, and so he settled for the army. He was sent to Ft. Oglethorpe where he was enrolled in a regular army cavalry unit, then sent to a ranch in Texas and to Camp Clark, where he, as the only one in his battery who could read and write, was made Clerk. By the time he’d left the military, he had attended Officers Candidate Training School at Camp Taylor, Kentucky, and was commissioned second lieutenant (1919).</p>
<p>A year later he received both bachelor of science and master of science degrees from the University of Virginia, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. In 1923 he received his law degree, magna cum laude at Yale University, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, and was instructor of political science during the summer terms. In addition to his academic degrees, he received honor doctoral degrees from the University of Alabama, Birmingham-southern College and Rhodes College. He was admitted to the Alabama Bar in 1923 and in 1927 he joined the firm of Tilman, Bradley and Baldwin, now Bradley, Arant, Rose and White.</p>
<p>Law for Mr. Arant was a profession with responsibilities that stretched far beyond day-to-day casework. He had a lifelong commitment to pro bono service, a personal concern for the encouragement and growth of young lawyers, and a deep commitment to social justice.</p>
<p>Between 1933 and 1945, Mr. Arant served as either counsel to, or a member of, a number of agencies. He became special assistant to the United States Attorney General and chief counsel for the Petroleum Administation Board, National Recovery Administration, Washington, D.C. in 1933. The next year he served as chairman of the Regional Labor Board, Sixth District, National Recovery Administration, and in 1942 was the public member for the Fourth Regional Labor Board in Atlanta. Mr. Arant was also a member of the Board of Appeals, District Two, Alabama Selective Service System from 1940 to 1945.</p>
<p>His professional interest included memberships in the American Bar Association, and its Committee on Bill of Rights of which he was chairman the term 1941-1943; Alabama State Bar Association of which he was president in 1936 and a member of the Board of commissioners from 1931 to 1940; he was also a member of the Birmingham Bar Association, the American Law Institute, and a member of the Bar Association, City of New York. He was elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa, Beta Theta Pi, Phi Delta Phi and the Order of the Coif. During his tenure as president of the Alabama State Bar, Mr. Arant urged the formation of a Junior Bar Association as a means of bringing together younger lawyers from all over the state to focus on professional issues of significant interest to them. As a result of his efforts, the Alabama State Junior Bar became a reality in 1937. Mr. Arant thereafter regularly attended meetings of the Junior Bar and came to know many of the young lawyers throughout the state. That Junior Bar is now the Young Lawyers Section of the Alabama State Bar. Mr. Arant’s concern for justice for all was apparent in his role as an organize of the Legal Aid Society of Birmingham, which he served as president. He was also an active, long time member of ST. Mary’s Episcopal Church and the Democratic party.</p>
<p>In the early 1950s, he sponsored the first African-American attorney for membership in the Birmingham Bar Association – Oscar Adams, who later became a justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. He was a behind-the-scenes leader for positive change in Birmingham in the troubled 1960s.</p>
<p>True to his philosophy of community enrichment, he served as president of the Birmingham Civic Symphony Association and the Birmingham Civic Opera Association, as a foundation trustee of Brooke Hill School and the eye Foundation, and as a member of the board of directors for Norton Center and Birmingham-Southern College.</p>
<p>He was married to the former Letitia Tyler McNeal on December 31, 1929 and they had three daughters: Adele (Mrs. Richard J. Stockman, Jr.), Letitia Christian and Frances Fairlie, to whom Mr. Arant was devoted.</p>

<p>feyukeridi yuketa esata</p>
<p>For the complete language description, go to the link at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>Esata is a reworked and simplified version of English which responds to several important requirements in todays world, among these:</p>
<p>1. to be used as a personal language by native English Speakers, allowing those familiar with the language to communicate among themselves without being understood by others.</p>
<p>2. A simplified version of English which can be used by non-native speakers of English, who want to acquire practical fluency with the minimum effort.</p>
<p>3. A basis for a standardized creole English which could have worldwide applications.</p>
<p>4. A serious suggestion for a world standard auxilliary language, based on English, but allowing all major language groups to contribute significantly to the vocabulary.</p>
<p>5. An interesting new concept in language definition which allows for the definition and incorporation of dialects from all the major language groups.</p>
<p>6. One of the only languages ever invented in which users can coin their own words, which are nevertheless intelligible to others.</p>
<p>(author's comment - this should respond to the previous reviewer's comments: "...doesn't sufficiently explain the importance or significance of the subject."</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Esata is a newly designed 'constructed language.' It is a bare bones version of the English language, which has also been internationalized to a high degree. In the target language, Esata is a 'phrase word' meaning 'know (how to) speak.' In Esata a compromise is being sought between the now globally dominant English, and the rest of the world's major languages. Many people have studied English and can speak it well, but millions of others who do not have the time or the educational background are also speaking it, badly. Less competent speakers of English represent an ever increasing user group. Eventually, we can expect that the numbers of those who speak some Creole or corrupted version of English will predominate over those who speak it well. In this context Esata is proposed as the basis for a standard internationalized 'creole English', an attempt to gain control over the 'vulgarized' form of the language, and influence its future.</p>
<p>There are several features of Esata that should interest researchers in the area of artificial languages. It is regular and highly compact, with text lengths considerably shorter than those of English. A novel feature is the use of 'phrase words' abbreviated forms allowing definition of new vocabulary and concepts, both from English and from all the world's major languages. Esata also contains an (optional) new alphabet, which can represent up to 4 normal letters in a compact yet easy to read matrix.</p>
<p>Words are formed from syllables of consonant plus vowel. The normal English alphabet is used, but vowels have only one sound, and some consonants have different sounds (c as ch, x as sh).</p>
<p>Here are some examples of phrases in Esata:</p>
<p>hubiyu who are you? wobixi where is she? vayuti what do you think? bidara is that right? hobihiko how is he coming? weyovisa when will I know? biherelanu Is it running like new?</p>
<p>wixuha tidafoda We should have thought of that zekubiqi They could be here yonotavegu I don't talk very good feyunosanose If you don't know, don't say wikegotodexa We can go to the shop yodekanorenu My car isn't running now.</p>
<p>for the primary list, short forms of English are used. When a word from another language is more concise, it is usually preferred. Approximately half of the vocabulary of Esata is from foreign sources, making the language very international.</p>
<p>A special feature of Esata is the use of 'phrase words', which are contractions of several one syllable words into a short form. Using a prefix syllable, which serves as a language qualifier, up to 100 different language origens can be defined, each with an associated list of 10,000 phrase words, so in principle up to a million foreign phrase words are definable. Other phrase words based on two syllable Esata words allow for definition of several million other special purpose expressions, many of which can replace conventional vocabulary.</p>
<p>In the examples below, the prefix letter 'e' indicates English egoge go get - fetch emunu must new - urgent renewal ejasi God see - omniscience epama past man - predecessor epoci power drink - alcohol efasi far see - telescope esohu some who - someone emalu man place - eg. men's club ewobi where be - location ebagu bad good - pro and contra ehogo how go - means of transport ekuko could come - might happen etiso think some - reflect</p>
<p>The grammar of Esata is quite straightforward, based primarily on English. In the language description online there are complete details and an adequate set of vocabulary. Anyone interested in trying the language can learn quickly the 'primary meanings list' given below consisting of all the one syllable words. From this list you can make your own sentences and phrase words as in the example above, and experiment with the language. Esata is a 'personal language', meaning you can use it to communicate easily with your friends, but others will not be able to understand you.</p>
<p>This is the kernel of the Esata language, the primary meanings list. In most cases syllables are close to their English equivalents. In some cases no English word with a similar sound was found, and so a foreign source word was adopted.</p>
<p>ba bad be but bi be bo boy bu boom ca hello ce there is, are ci drink co there is not cu eat da that de the di this do money du do fa of fe if fi feel fo for fu future ga girl ge get gi give go go gu good ha have he it hi he ho how hu who ja God je just ji high jo joy ju low ka car ke can ki key ko come ku could la like le let (object) li little lo love lu place ma man me may mi me mo more mu must na and ne a, an ni in no no nu new pa past pe pay pi please po power pu put qa there qe question qi here qo quote qu cool ra right re run, work ri read ro wrong ru room sa know se say si see so some su soon ta talk te thing ti think to to tu too va what ve very vi will vo or vu (esc/cntrl) wa why we when wi we wo where wu woman xa shop xe sure xi she xo show xu should ya yes ye yeh, refl.pronoun yi you (formal) yo I yu you za (escape/data) ze they zi easy zo so zu life</p>
<p>several changes in primary list were made on 09/06</p>
<p>Example Texts in Esata</p>
<p><br />
Now we present a few sample dialogs, with translation. Esata is intended to be a personal language, so most of these are typical conversations that you would expect to hear at street level.</p>

<p>The Type of Constans was a document drafted by Paul II, Patriarch of Constantinople. It prohibited any discussion on the one or two wills of Christ, specifically with regard to the Monothelite heresy. The Type was intended to end the controversy, however it received rejection from Pope Martin I. This later led to Pope Martin and Constans' conflict.</p>

<p><b>MAX VADUKUL</b></p>
<p>Max Vadukul (Born 2nd February 1961, Nairobi, Kenya) is a self-taught British photographer. Infamous for his surreal, quirky style, Vadukul's photography captures images with a raw elegance in the realm of fashion, music, advertising and portraiture.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><br />
As a child, Vadukul experienced unique expeditions across Africa shooing wild safari on camera with his father, a keen amateur photographer, which fuelled his fascination for photography.</p>
<p>In 1969, Vadukul was uprooted from his native soil and moved to London, England. Feeling dislocated and in the midst of a cultire shock Vadukul embraced the camera and found a haven and sense of familiarity in photography. Driven by a passion to succeed, at age 22 Vadukul left home and advanced to the fashion capital of the world- Paris. It was here that he was discovered by <a href="../../../y/o/h/Yohji_Yamamoto_1af7.html" title="Yohji Yamamoto">Yohji Yamamoto</a> in 1984 and began a collaboration that would change the face of fashion. As an artist using photography, Vadukul set out to reform the rigid structure of fashion publications deeming them as an area of innovation in photography. He produced satirical and wacky imagery influenced largely by cartoons, silent movies, and British media, and had a flair for stimulating an emotion in his subject which possessed a distinctive Vadukul signature.</p>
<p>Revolutionary fashion journalists such as Franca Sozzani of Italian Vogue embraced this 'Anti-Fashion' style and commissioned Vadukul's editorial voice by shooting for benchmark magazines such as Per Lui and <a href="../../../l/e/i/Lei.html" title="Lei">Lei</a>. His provocative and avant- garde work led to partnerships with <a href="../../../c/h/l/Chloe.html" title="Chloe">Chloe</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Emanuel_Ungaro_3a47.html" title="Emanuel Ungaro">Emanuel Ungaro</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armani.html" title="Armani">Armani</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comme_Des_Garcons_6fa8.html" title="Comme Des Garcons">Comme Des Garcons</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Mara_c602.html" title="Max Mara">Max Mara</a> and Romeo Gigli. Moreover, he was an active contributor to the emerging supermodel phenomenon and his dynamic work caught the eyes of musical legends such as <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_McCartney_c886.html" title="Paul McCartney">Paul McCartney</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/i/Sting.html" title="Sting">Sting</a> whose first iconic solo album '<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dream_of_the_Blue_Turtles_5795.html" title="The Dream of the Blue Turtles">The Dream of the Blue Turtles</a>' was shot in 1985 by Vadukul.</p>
<p>In 1995, a decision to move to New York City took Max's career to pioneering heights, shooting for magazines such as <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harpers_Bazaar_4069.html" title="Harpers Bazaar">Harpers Bazaar</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue.html" title="Vogue">Vogue</a>, Italian Vogue, <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_Fair_97ac.html" title="Vanity Fair">Vanity Fair</a>, and L'Uomo Vogue. The prestigious <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Yorker_Magazine_73c0.html" title="New Yorker Magazine">New Yorker Magazine</a> offered Vadukul a three year contract- it was only the second contract given to a photographer after <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Avedon_62d1.html" title="Richard Avedon">Richard Avedon</a> in the magazines 100 year history. This marked a transitional point for the photographer, transcending barriers from fashion to feature and journalistic photography. Vadukul captured the essence of extraordinary figures that shaped history such as <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Theresa_07ef.html" title="Mother Theresa">Mother Theresa</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salman_Rushdie_d1a4.html" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>, <a href="../../../y/v/e/Yves_Saint_Laurent_c9ee.html" title="Yves Saint Laurent">Yves Saint Laurent</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Jagger_1896.html" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> and Mayor Guiliani.</p>
<p>Vadukul's images radiate his exuberance and he continues to work with a dedicated and ardent vigor. He currently resides in New York City with his wife and two children where he remains at the forefront of fashion and has shaken up the music world with his tunning images of <a href="../../../b/e/y/Beyonce.html" title="Beyonce">Beyonce</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justin_Timberlake_c6d4.html" title="Justin Timberlake">Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Urban_6cc4.html" title="Keith Urban">Keith Urban</a>, and <a href="../../../j/a/n/Janet_Jackson_4116.html" title="Janet Jackson">Janet Jackson</a>. Photography is clearly an unquestionable passion but what makes Max Vadukul truly three dimensional is his fervor towards curent social, environmental and cultural issues. The outlet of creativity is directed towards numerous causes and talents such as drumming, producing a new photography publication and fine art. As an advoacte of green peace and anti-drugs campaigns his energy is focused upon helping to improve the current conditions of society.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-17_ae20.html" title="Edit section: Fidelity Records">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fidelity Records</span></h2>
<p>Fidelity Records was launched by Jonathan Strauss out of his New Jersey home in 2003 with the release of The Escape Engines' Celebrity Role Model, a 12-track debut release from the emotionally tinged New Jersey hardcore band. The album has been welcomed by thousands with numbers continuing to grow by sales from online companies, independent distribution companies, and merchandise sales at performances. From this, Fidelity Records is quickly being recognized as one of the fastest growing independent record companies in the tri-state area and is becoming an industry known name.</p>
<p>Fidelity Records prides itself on diversification within a niche market, building a reputation for discovering and developing innovative music while upholding its grass roots artist development. In its short history Fidelity has already introduced to the world creditable artists such as The Escape Engine, whose successes include a video that regularly appears on the MTV2 music channel, numerous articles and press interviews in national music magazines such as Alternative Press Magazine and CMJ Monthly Magazine, performing on 2003's Vans Warped Tour and CMJ Music Marathon, soundtrack credits on Warren Miller's Journey, and songs that appear on several nationally distributed music compilations. Recent additions to the roster includes We're All Broken and Race The Sun who are an exceptional set of emerging acts and are beginning to receive the same notable successes.</p>
<p>Fidelity Records has already developed its working relationships with other successful entertainment companies and publications such as MTV, Go-Kart Records, Suburban Homes Records, The Militia Group, The Syndicate, JVC Records, Sonic Unyon Records, Rive Video Promotions, McGathy Promotions, Freedom Zone, Alternative Press Magazine, CMJ Music Magazine, AMP Magazine, RadioTakeover.com, Kevin Scanlon Photography, and AbsolutePunk.net.</p>
<p>The label expanded its staff late 2003 with the addition of Kevin B. Robbins and, in early 2004, with Julie Kiefer. Kevin's previous work at MTV, his knowledge of band management and the music industry, experience in marketing, and web development have enabled Fidelity to expand its operation to accommodate growing volumes of new business. While Julie's effervescence, enthusiasm, and attention to detail with online promotions, street teams, and public relations enables our bands and audience to feel like an extension of the label.</p>
<p>Fidelity Records aspires to create and sustain value by being recognized as an industry leader; valued by our listeners, sought after by bands and musicians, and respected by the music industry and by our competitors.</p>

<p>Men are usually stronger than women, that's a fact. But what would happen if women were merciless ? What should a woman do to defeat a raper ? A good kick in the groin ? That's what they learn in self-defense classes.</p>
<p>Serial-ballbusters.com is a mixture of self-defense applied, feminism and comedy in the form of insane independant short movies. Not to be confused with an adult website, there is no sex, no porn, but only crazy violence ! And that's what TV/video games freaks love. "My girlfriend told me she likes kicking men in the balls..." says Stanley Cohen, Serial Ballbusters producer. "We are lucky to have highly talentuous actresses in our team, like Melody, Myriam, Audrey, Chealsy, Monica, Maria... I try to not forget any of them (laughs)." One year after its launch more than 40 actresses kick balls in more than 50 shorts. Some of the produced shorts are cult hits !</p>
<p>Kicking men in the balls is dangerous ! You should not try to do this at home ! But this is so impressive, hilarious and somewhat sexy when it's done by professionals. This is maybe the best way to use a beautiful female leg ?</p>
<p>Is this counter-culture ? Not really because kicking balls is part of the Hollywood movies and TV dramas culture. You can watch kick balls strikes in nearly all action movies. This is what serial-ballbusters.com tries to mimic with a lower budget, but lots of creativity and fun. Kicking men in the balls is part of our western culture. And probably part of the human culture since centuries.</p>
<p>Is groin kicking a sexual assault ? Yes it is and mothers should teach that to nasty girls who think it's only fun. It is a self-defense only strike and could cause serious injuries. Women kicking men in the testicles should be considered as rapists.</p>
<p>Is serial-ballbusters.com evil ? Or is testosterone which is evil ? ... both !</p>
