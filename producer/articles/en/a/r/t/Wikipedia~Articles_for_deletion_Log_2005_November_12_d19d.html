<li><b>Comment</b>.

<li>Probably based primarilly on listener base. We don't have articles on TV/over-the-air radio stations that just serve one town or an otherwise small audience (per precedents). I can't find such information on their site. They have about 100 listeners on a Saturday night per Shoutcast, but that's 145th of internet radio sites listed on Shoutcast, which is a considerably smaller site than some of the more mainstream radio sites. That's the best stats and I can find and doesn't make it sound terribly notable. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:21, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>Bab al-Wad is the Arabic name of a place on the Tel-Aviv-Jerusalem highway (<i>Sha'ar Hagai</i> in Hebrew). It is not a name of any convoy, as far as I know, the convoy described in this article is probably a reference to the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadassah_medical_convoy_massacre.html" title="Hadassah medical convoy massacre">Hadassah medical convoy massacre</a>, which did not go through Bab al-Wad. There is no settlement in the place, only a road interchange, and otherwise it is only notable as an old Israeli Independence War song (as the article correctly notes) which is in itself unnotable. <a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 07:42, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Lots of convoys went through Bab al-Wad during the war, because it is on the highway to Jerusalem, as I have noted, but there was no convoy named "Bab al-Wad" as far as I know. There must be thousands of songs on that website, we can't have an article for each. Is there something special about this particular song that warrants an article?--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 11:28, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agree with what you say re this being the location of ongoing conflict in the struggle for control of the highway during the blocade of Jerusalem and I can't verify this specific convoy from here. I was starting from the premise that geographic locations should be kept and still think that they should. I now feel it would be best to emphasise the location and the context rather than one incident probably not especially notable among many fairly similar. The historic specifics of this article could maybe be merged somewhere else? <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 15:12, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I think the location itself is not particularly notable, the whole corridor to Jerusalem saw fighting during the war. If the only information we have about this place is that it is on the way to Jerusalem (and thus saw fighting) and that a song was written about it, I don't thing this is enough for an article, and this information can be merged into the <a href="../../../1/9/4/1948_Arab-Israeli_War_5e85.html" title="1948 Arab-Israeli War">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a> article.--<a href="../../../d/o/r/User%7EDoron_5be3.html" title="User:Doron">Doron</a> 20:43, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I've no objection to a merge of the incident(s) - not that there's much to merge. There's a web ref <i>22 mars- Une violente bataille se déclenche à Bab El Wad (Shaar Hagaï), lors de lattaque dun convoi de trente camions et de sept véhicules blindés. (Summary: 22nd March attack on a convoy of 30 trucks and 7 armoured vehicles)</i>. There was protacted fighting between Givati and Harel Brigades with the ALA forces and irregulars later on in May. It looks to me like there was an Arab village in Bab el wad in 1948 - does that seem correct to you? For me, that would add to the interest of the place. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 22:12, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Dattebayo is currently the biggest fansub group for Naruto, an extremely popular series.

<li><b>Keep</b> informative + verifiable article. None of the "linked websites" are fake. No evidence of a "troll playground" aside from occasional vandalism of the article. --Timecop 00:59, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I see no claim to being the largest anime subbing group. You can verify the download counts presented on the torrent page of the website (yhbt.mine.nu/t/). The website and irc links are both valid. This page is only informational regarding the name, it is no less valid then any other subbing group's articles (which several of which already exist). The information is presented in an objective way, not expressing opinions.--131.128.143.182 01:36, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: article is very factual in nature, and in my opinion at least, does NOT violate any of the policies on deletion. the article isn't self-promoting or in any way a 'troll', the linked website is Dattebayo's official site and tracker, definitely not a troll site. To make a simple analogy: According to the Wikipedia guide on band listings (which release work for public consumption just like fansub groups), a band may be listed if it has had a song listed on a top 100 chart. This implies that for bands at least, fame and success (and records) are the criteria for being listed on Wikipedia. Extending this observation to fansubbing, as the single-most-downloaded group actively releasing, I believe Dattebayo has earned its place on Wikipedia, just like 3 Doors Down or the Beatles. -alx</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I think the article is informative, and would enjoy seeing other fansubbing groups start their own pages.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason I believe there are not more entries about him on the web is that the people who know him are not web literate; i.e. they can not respond to this comment. This entry in Wikipedia is intended to bring El GGoDo to a wider audience and encourage debate and discussion; though he is noteworthy - he is a private man and I suppose this may be against him.

<li><b>Comment</b> to Alex@elggodo.net. Unless a consensus developes to delete, the article will stay.

However, his 1979 catalogue and 1991 book are in several languages; just look at the quality of his artwork<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:27, 13 November 2005 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Discussion</b>. The fellow is real enough. <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&amp;linkpath=http://members.tripod.com/eu_art/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/diario_de_leon_oct_03_pg14.jpg&amp;target=tlx_new" class="external text" title="http://www.elggodo.net/imagelib/sitebuilder/misc/show_image.html?linkedwidth=actual&amp;linkpath=http://members.tripod.com/eu_art/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/diario_de_leon_oct_03_pg14.jpg&amp;target=tlx_new" rel="nofollow">This link</a> is about his latest painting and provides some sketchy biographical details (second paragraph, e.g. where he came from, the fact that he didn't want to work in the coal mines, where his name comes from etc...). Also, the book that is scanned in has a preface by Jose Camon Aznar, professor (I think) at Univ. Autonoma (Madrid). However, all that said, this is an artist of very, very local reputation. I don't think you could even go so far as to contend that his reputation in Leon is particularly significant, let alone outside of the city. I am in Madrid and a quick (granted wholly unscientific) poll has found no-one here who has ever heard of him. Finally, per the <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/es/id1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.elggodo.net/es/id1.html" rel="nofollow">website</a>, unless <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> had a translation done for the site, his Spanish should be more than good enough to put up a site on the Spanish WP. Which makes me a bit suspicious of the comment above. Also, could you clarify the relationship? Are you the grandson? I'll abstain voting for now. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 15:47, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> one of my reasons for abstain as well is that, beside what's in the web site <a href="http://www.elggodo.net" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net</a>, there are few other references about him in the Web. One seems particularly promising: <a href="http://www.museum.ru/gmii/cafer_old.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.museum.ru/gmii/cafer_old.asp" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. His name mentioned here seems to support the fact that he donated something to Russian musemus, confirming written in the article. The block of text in the linked page reads (thanks to Altavista):
<blockquote>
<p>We will be grateful for your opinion about the site and for the opinions about our museum: you will estimate, if you please, exposures, exhibition, excursion, lecture, occupation in the circles, concerts, scientific activity, conference, publication, the care of visitors. Unfortunately, museum does not have a possibility to answer the questions, which emerge beyond the framework of the designated thematics. You can present the question into the conference: Museum cafe. Examination on THE INTERNET museum does not produce, slides and electron images it does not send.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am the son of Pedro Rodriguez Fuertes ("El GGoDo"), however at birth I was taken away by my mother (Sue Alexander) to Australia. Part of the story can be found here: <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net/en/id1.html</a>. Because of the distance and my poor Spanish over the years I have had a different type of relationship with my father; than most families. Nevertheless, it greatly improved through the use of modern technologies and the creation of the website ElGGoDo.net; where we can both share in each others stories. Although, he is my father, I am able to be very objective about the quality of his work as a result of our unique realtionship. If anyone here is interested in Art then I believe if you saw his work you would see that he indeed has genius: I think this photo say it all: <a href="http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.elggodo.net/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/elggodo_with_clay.jpg</a> (the clay picture - has a double meaning, I believe it is also a protest against bullfighting)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> in 1999 when I was last in Madrid this restaurant had number of ElGGoDo's great works in the restaurant. The address is:</p>

<p>Perhaps if you have time you could check this out as well. In the meantime I will see if I can get in contact with that Prof 155.143.63.97 10:18, 15 November 2005 (UTC). Note: This is no ordinary restaurant it is a celebration of three forms of art (Food, Painting and Interior Design) and a hommage to El.GGoDo.<a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:05, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Thanks for the clarification. Having reviewed the information, my belief is that this fellow is simply not notable enough to warrant an entry. He has practically no web presence - which means that he is unlikely to have been featured in exhibitions which invariably leave some webprint behind. The fact that the article is authored by his son does not assuage concerns that he is unnotable. And I can find no-one in the country who has heard of him. I wish you the best of luck in helping spread his reputation. Wikipedia, however, is not a venue for promotion. I vote therefore to <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 10:45, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> It is true recently he has not had an exhibition. But as good as you exist he has exhibited on a number of occasions. The fact that he does not have a web presence does not mean he is not a notable artist; it simply means that he is not a generation X, Y; but rather before. On another note I have just tried to email Jose Camon Aznar to see if he can add an entry he in support of El GGoDo; hopefully, you can wait a bit longer. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 155.143.63.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.143.63.97_7ef2.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.143.63.97">contribs</a>) 11:19, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</small> Sorry, <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex%40elggodo.net_f01a.html" title="User:Alex@elggodo.net">Dr Who</a> 22:01, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think the fact that your father is not part of the internet generation is not germane.

Well, his painting is in the famous Cathedral of Leon, so it will endure for near eternity in the historical record of the province of Leon Spain.

<li><b>COMMENT</b>. The arguments are no longer about the article, but personal attacks against the users and viewers of this site. This is a reminder that this site is "The Free Encyclopedia" that "Anyone Can Edit". The negative votes probably came before I could expand the article. This article will be updated quite frequently, since this is a fast paced actor (ie. He was in the second episode of "Criminal Minds" a hot new show!).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>"KEEP!!!"</b>Evan Lee Dahl is a upcoming guest star and is seen on major television networks. This shows notability. I would like to see this positive teen's profile stay! <b>DO NOT DELETE</b> GeoDev</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep this entry!</b> Like most good character actors, Evan shows up in numerous roles, none of them a starring role, but instead each supports the action and the plotline. What constitutes a great characer actor is the value of their whole body of work, not a particular or single role. Neither Frank Morgan nor Burt Lahr had a major starring role in any movie, yet <i>The WIZARD Of Oz</i> would not have been the same movie without either of them. And those roles are not the only ones either actor is noted for. Evan is part of the newest generations of faces you know, yet can't always recall the name.

<li><b><s>Weak delete</s><u>Redirect</u></b>. Fair dinkum can have the meanings in the article in the right context, but honest and reliable is the main meaning. "He's fair dinkum"=="He's telling the truth" or "He's serious about s/t" or "you can rely on him". "Fair dinkum, Joe!" could translate to english as "You can't be serious, Joe!"

<p>Article is spam.</p>
<p>Claims:</p>
<p>According to Google's PageRank, her site gets more hits than any other BBW sites, and by a sizable margin. [1]</p>
<p>However, the PageRank is basically a measure of how many links you have to you. Links such as wikipedia.org, which counts a lot as a very big site.</p>
<p>PageRank does NOT measure hits, it measures the number and weight of inbound links. In addition, the supplied link shows very low page rank, although it is higher than the other articles in t hat directory. However, the directory makes no claim to be definitive for BBW sites.</p>
<p>In any case, a more real measure of site popularity is alexa.com, which shows it is the 587,155th site in the world <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=www.fatfemnudist.com</a></p>

<li>Excuse me, anonymous poster, but this article is NOT spam. If the reference to Google's PageRank offends you, I'll remove it now. As stated elsewhere, I think there's <i>ample</i> reason for inclusion, especially considering that Wikipedia already has pages devoted to such less-notable porn sites as <a href="../../../w/i/f/Wifey%27s_World_ae3b.html" title="Wifey's World">Wifey's World</a> and <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideepthroat.html" title="Ideepthroat">Ideepthroat</a>. For that matter, Wikipedia is filled with entries for little-known musicians, artists, and even obscure role-playing game characters. At least fatfemnudist has been seen by many hundreds of thousands of people, and I don't think I'm required to have to make articles for the 587,154 sites you mentioned before doing this one. But give me time, and I will. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 02:42, 12 November 2005 (UTC) <i>Note: <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> is the article's author.</i></li>

I actually find your claim that fatfemnudist has beenseen by hundreds of thousands of people (how do you know?) extremely difficult to believe, given that traffic graph.

<li>Delete: I don't much care one way or another about the topic, but Wikipedia is not a web guide, and several wrongs won't make a right. If we are carrying articles about minor websites with low significance, then they should be deleted, <i>precisely because they will be cited as precedent</i> and will give people the wrong idea of Wikipedia's intended scope.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, I don't claim Wikipedia should be a web guide. Not all websites are notable. I would say this one IS a trailblazer and innovator for reasons I could expound upon if anyone really is listening. Secondly, the page is really just as much about the minor web-celebrity "fatfemnudist" herself, not just her site. This can be clarified and cleaned up if deemed necessary. Thirdly, fatfemnudist's site and her posts on amateur-porn message boards are well known to, well, <i>those who know</i>. If you're not a devotee of the amateur BBW pic-post world, then you may not have heard of her, but if you're not a marine biologist, then you probably haven't heard of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicoflagellate" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicoflagellate" rel="nofollow">Silicoflagellates</a> either.

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are a number of people who <i>have</i> gained a significant measure of notability in the field of amateur porn. There is no evidence to support the claims by the article's author that "fatfemnudist" is more notable than those people, and in fact I've just done a simple experiment. On a P2P program (which of course I just downloaded <b>only</b> for the purpose of this experiment of course of course) I type in "ideepthroat" and get 410 hits. I type in "Wifey's" and get 196 hits. I type in "Dawn's" (for Dawn's Place) and get 78 after subtracting five accidental hits. I type in "fatfemnudist" and get 0. Now, consider that Wifey's World, Dawn's Place, and Ideepthroat are all <i>pay</i> sites that don't <i>want</i> people sharing their stuff; fatfemnudist <i>wants</i> people sharing -- but no one is. It kind of dispels the claim that fatfemnudist is more notable than all of those. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:54, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Mr.Feldspar, surely you can understand that commercial sites like Wifey's are far more likely to generate hits than ffn's. What I think I haven't made clear is the fact that ffn's web-popularity is largely through her posts on adult pic-post sites and XXX message boards, almost <i>none</i> of which get fully crawled by search engines. I am curious to know who you mean when you say that there <i>are</i> notable people in the world of amateur porn. Let me know and I'll do articles on them too (By definition, professional paysites like Wifey's and Dawn's are not amateur porn in the true sense). I think the <i>real</i> dangerous precedent here is the "I've never heard of her, so she's not notable" mindset. Most people have never heard of MOST of what's in Wikipedia: that's why human beings need encyclopedias. I know ffn is very well-known in certain (shady) circles of the net because I've witnessed it firsthand for several years. She's no <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennicam.html" title="Jennicam">jennicam</a>, of course, but by some people's criteria, apparently even jennicam doesn't warrant an entry here. Anyway, I won't berate the point, but I do sense an anti-porn bias here (as well as sockpuppetry). <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC) <i>Note: <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">Wikipediatrix</a> is the article's author.</i>
<ul>
<li>The fact that you choose to classify fatfemnudist as "true" amateur porn and Wifey's World as somehow not true amateur porn is really irrelevant; we're not asking "is this person notable within their league-determined competition category" but "is this person notable?" No evidence has been submitted that shows that fatfemnudist is notable; we only have the testimony of the article's author that she is. Be careful with your accusations, by the way; accusing people of being sockpuppets just because they say things you don't like is the sort of thing that damages the accuser much more than the accused. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow. Did I accuse any specific person of being a sockpuppet? No. And if I did, it would be for far more tangible reasons than "just because they say things I don't like", so <i>you</i> need to plug up <i>your own</i> emitter of accusations, okay? Okay. (Also, you didn't answer my question before, asking you to be specific about your earlier comments. My question was not a rhetorical one.) Clearly certain folks are getting cranky and all up in my face now, so I suppose I will regard this article as a lost cause for the nonce. I had hoped for a higher level of discussion than this though. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 03:36, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You don't want to just bandy around vague accusations of sockpuppetry. Levelling these claims, in effect, at everyone who voted <i>delete</i> is just as bad as accusing an specific individual. Did you mean me? Geogre perhaps? Maybe "Mr. Anonymous User"? Everyone who voted <i>delete</i> is the subject of your petty attack.

<li>I think your inflammatory and false-assumption-laden statement is far more uncalled-for than my brief and cryptic passing reference to sockpuppetry. If you really think I intended "everyone who voted delete" as the subject of my alleged "attack", you seriously might lack the reading comprehension skills necessary for Wikipedia. I said no such thing, nor did I even hint at it, so stop trying to put words in my mouth, Jack.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - if you actually looked at the web site, it is basically a personal homepage. This person called Linda wrote it, and all of the pictures are of herself. Yes, they are pornographic pictures, but that doesn't stop it from being a homepage. She doesn't have a single picture of anyone other than herself in there. Its free, yes, for a reason. Whilst there have been girls who have made pornographic homepages and then charged people for entry - and also for example famous models (and porn stars) who have had free pornographic web sites, this is not one of them. This classifies comfortably as a vanity page. Perhaps the article shouldn't have been deleted without a discussion, but it should have been deleted just the same. Unless you're is Linda or you think that Linda is hot, I don't see why you'd want this in the encyclopaedia full stop.203.122.218.47 16:16, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question</b> are decommissined state routes automatic deletes? If so fine, but otherwise I'm not sure somebody might not want info on it someday/</li>
<li><b>Weakest keep</b>. This is right on the edge of what I consider encyclopedic for roads. It's not simply surveying info, but goes into the confusion over whether the road was decommissioned and why parts of it were decommissioned. Furthermore, its western end lines up exactly with US 41, suggesting that it has some historical connection to that road and the <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_Highway_64a2.html" title="Dixie Highway">Dixie Highway</a>. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 03:21, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>So exactly how many of us are from the town in which this is occurring? Also, rather than going to a capitalist-infested establishment (ie: <i>Rolling Stone</i>) for advice on whether something is different or new, why not sample the goods? There is material linked right in the article. Chaosinterface 22:01, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't matter whether we personally like their music or not, or whether their music is different and new or old and the same. We have specific guidelines for whether a musical artist should have an article about them in Wikipedia.

<li>Believe me, I understand that, I had looked over it, and I'm certainly not trying to imply that anyone specific has to like it or dislike it. But the final sumation of the criteria that I'm seeing seems to be that what matters is whether or not the artist is notable. The fact of the matter is, this will change things. This will become known. If the issue arising is simply that it isn't known yet, or it's not felt to be verifiable, I understand. It can wait. Chaosinterface 15:23, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's exactly the point, yes. Wikipedia <i>has</i> to make a point of reflecting that which is <i>already notable</i> because otherwise we'd be deluged (hell, we still are) with the submissions of people trying to use Wikipedia to <i>become</i> notable. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:14, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A school can be noteworthy for many reasons besides academics. It could be architecturally significant. It could win sports championships. It could run a significant charity drive. It could earn a place in <i>Guinness World Records.</i> What I am saying, as with <i>any other local institution of similar size</i> is that it needs to set itself apart from the crowd in some way. Failing to provide adequate basic education only makes it more insignificant. Don't you think it would serve the purposes of education better if a school could <i>aspire</i> to Wikipedia inclusion? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 22:43, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Failing to provide adequate basic education makes a school much <i>more</i> signficant if most schools do provide it. Wikipedia articles are not supposed to be rewards or incentives for the subject, they are supposed to be a resource for people who want to understand the world better. I don't know if excluding schools for low performance would serve the purpose of education better, but it would certainly motivate a lot of vandalism. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:38, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>By what logic is any obscure institution, academic or otherwise, rendered noteworthy by failure at its primary mission? Spectacular failure may invite derision.

<li>Earning a D score from the Florida Dept. of Education isn't particularly unusual, for what it's worth. As far as I'm concerned, it's not a claim to notability, but that's only if you're worried about individual notability. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:26, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well one reason I strongly oppose trying to apply notability to schools is that people consider "less than average academics" as making a school less notable, guaranteeing a systemic bias I would find it hard to live with. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 14:34, 13 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A good point. In the (unfortunately unlikely) case that a <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> proposal that required notability was ratified, it would need to have clear criteria. While I disagree that all schools should be included, a school guideline would need to be consistent, with any inconsistencies erring on the side of inclusion. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Black</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 14:40, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Other positive factors may discount academics. A school in a depressed neighborhood whose faculty and students build houses for <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habitat_for_Humanity_272a.html" title="Habitat for Humanity">Habitat for Humanity</a> could be notable. The oldest schoolhouse in New England would be notable for historic reasons, regardless of academics. A school for homeless children in Ghana could be notable for its humanitarian mission. However it is <a href="../../../s/p/e/Special_pleading.html" title="Special pleading">special pleading</a> to protest that quality performance should not be one basis for evaluation. Wikipedia does not feature every film of <a href="../../../1/9/4/1942.html" title="1942">1942</a>.

<li><s><b>Delete</b>.</s> A story editor is a low ranking position in the world of television writers. Anyone mid-level or above would have <i>producer</i> in the title. Might be arguable on the basis of viewership, but since no episode titles are claimed this is really unverifiable. The piece is cagey about the credits. Burden of proof not met. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 18:05, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Having worked in the industry, this just smells fishy. Any television writer normally gets a producer credit after 4 or 5 years. After 10 or 12 years they become executive producers and show creators. This writer claims 20 years experience and never got past story editor? Can't list a single episode credit? There are many many people in entertainment who pad their resumes. We don't take unverifiable musician or actor bios on faith. Writers are not a special exception. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 22:30, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Doubts resolved, thank you. Lengthy television credits and three films. To answer other objections, a credited feature film writer is called <i>above the line</i> and therefore significant. A television writer holds an even higher position in status and creative input.

<li><b>Delete</b> I just don't see how this person's work on the series is important enough to warrant an article. Just because someone works on a big project or projects for a long time, doesn't mean that makes them important. Look at the credits of any move or TV series. See how long it is. I'd wager half the people on it have been in the industry for a long time and had their work viewed by many people. But we don't have articles on all of them because they are, ultimately, just people doing their job.

<p>I've noticed that the contributors aren't being objective about Kimi Finster, they are just showing their point of view about the character without letting other people to contribute on the article.</p>
<p>The Page is full of paragraphs speculating about uncertain future events which is forbidden here, they have included little irrelevant details that just help to make the article look bigger but not adding something important to it, they have enlisted skills about the character that are barely shown and instead of explaining them they just quote scenes where Kimi appears.</p>
<p>And they do not let other contributors to add stuff to the article which is very unfair becaue Wikipedia does not belong to them and their biased opinions shouldn't be part of the article either. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Tamao (<a href="../../../t/a/m/User_talk%7ETamao_664f.html" title="User talk:Tamao">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tamao_30b4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tamao">contribs</a>) 19:18, 11 November 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly it should be possible to write a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> article about Kimi Finster, who after all is just a fictional character.

Also, each person gets a maximum of one vote in an Articles for Deletion discussion; if a voter has more to say after voting, they should phrase it as a comment rather than a separate vote.

<li><b>Comment</b> I used the clean up page, so I hope this page can be finally fixed and get rid of the biased and unecessary stuff, Thanks for your help.Tamao 05:58, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Listen, I'm one of the contributors and to say we do NOT allow other contributors to add there stuff is false. Check the history of most of that which was removed. Most of it were additions that were extremely negative towards Kimi (one of which stated she was bi-polar) other additions are usually left alone. We had been trying a best to be unbiased, we never knew we were. We will make the neccessary changes asap. However, the discussions about future episodes has happened on the other AGU characters articles, like about TP+KF. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaredcraft_e131.html" title="User:Staredcraft">Staredcraft</a> 11:04, 13 Novermber 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> the page is biased because it has information that doesn't support the points you have about Kimi, plus you constantly use the same information to make it look bigger, and about the uncertain future events I mean episodes not confirmed yet, and the coupling shouldn't be included because it isn't part of the show, it's stuff from the fans so is irrelevant to the character.Tamao 16:12, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

&gt; Informative, educational topic about a growing culture. Surprising, that an ONLINE encyclopedia would move so quick to censor the acurate and truth about an established history making LAN party such as LANmaniac.

<li>While I'd love to clean up the article even further, (It's changed quite a bit since the initial post), I was unable to find the "article creation guidelines", finding only the extremely broad "Wikipedia style guidelines" which seems like a wild goose chase to determine what would sway those voting for deletion. If you could please reread the article and tell me more specifically what needs to change, I'd be happy to revise it again. As to the LASFS, I'm not really sure how that's related since it's written in the first person and not even on Wikipedia. --24.55.215.136 23:37, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: setting aside all of the other arguments for deletion, I find it hard to imagine any text taken from the Debian project itself could be a copyvio -- which is strictly limited to only GPL &amp; GFDL materials. Unless the submitter has made a mistake, &amp; these are taken from a book <i>on</i> the Debian distribution, then the copyvio chrage should be dropped immediately; otherwise, provide the non-GPL/GFDL source &amp; these materials will be a CSD on that one argument. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 20:46, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The Debian tutorial is GPL-licensed, whereas Wikipedia is GFDL-licensed, and <a href="../../../g/n/u/GNU_Free_Documentation_License_9d01.html#GPL_incompatible_in_both_directions" title="GNU Free Documentation License">the GFDL is not GPL-compatible</a>. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 02:00, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your link is informative, but irrelevant. <b>How</b> is reuse of this material a copyright violation? The whole intent of any GPL or GFDL is to permit reuse by the user as long as that freedom is shared in turn; worrying about the "incompatibility" of these two licenses is splitting hairs, &amp; hardly comparible to a copyright violation akin, say, to distributing copies of Brittany Spears' latest songs. I am pushing this point because several people have agreed to the accuracy that this is a copyright violation without discussing it, or even acknowledging the irony of the claim. And their uncritical agreement over this one claim brings into question both their understanding &amp; depth of critical reflction of the other claims made above. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 22:19, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is copyright violation because the GFDL contains restrictions which are not present in the GPL (for example, the restriction on "technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute"), and the GPL explicitly forbids distributing GPLed works under more restrictive terms (see clause 6). You may consider this "splitting hairs", but <a href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml" class="external text" title="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml" rel="nofollow">the Debian project does not</a>; according to them, the GFDL does not comply with the Debian Free Software Guidelines, and they intend to remove all GFDL materials from Debian (or move them to the "non-free" section) by the time that Etch is released. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 23:06, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Speedy Keep</b>.

Since that user did <i>nothing but</i> tag the article, didn't create a discussion sub-page, didn't transclude the sub-page, and didn't even give an edit summary indicating the reason for nomination, I have rolled back the tagging. A nomination where <i>only</i> the tag is applied, and no edit summary is given, is functionally indistinguishable from vandalism, albeit that it may have been done in good faith. Such woefully incomplete nominations should not be rolled forward to completion.

<p>This is a notable political cartoon, done by notable artists - a Texas writer and a Canadian Cartoonist. It's been read in over 75 countries, been translated and published in Israel and Germany, made editorial pages in the print media, and it is only two months old. It is read by thousands daily. Even a cursory search produces many hits.</p>
<p>It is political satire. It is not a Marvel comic, it's a political cartoon, not a webcomic of the variety to which Feydey refers.</p>
<p>It is widely republished daily throughout the world, and is the leading comic of over 400 worldwide comics hosted at a well-known site. Most of its reads are OUTSIDE the site.</p>

If you do not want your IP address exposed, then sign on to Wikipedia with your user name, and then sign your comments with four tildes (~~~~), as explained near the bottom of the edit screen. That will automatically mark your comments with your user name and hide your IP address.

</ul>
<p>Thanks for the info regarding IP addresses. The gist of your comments seems to be that you want to be certain everyone knows that the comments are all mine except those made by you and the first gentleman. I don't think anyone should have a problem understanding that.</p>
<p>You seem to know a lot of rules. Perhaps you'll be kind enough to cite the standards which you use to determine Neil Lisst doesn't meet your perception of those standards. That way we can talk about the standards, and whether they're applicable to this political comic, or whether you're misconstruing them.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. While it is not yet an official policy, we refer to the section on Web Comics in <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a> for guidance on whether a Web comic strip is notable enough for an article. If you can document that you do meet any of the criteria given there, I will reconsider my vote. I did check Alexa, and the whole of webcomicsnation.com has an average traffic rank for the past three months of 72,847. Since there are many other comics splitting that traffic with your comic, I have to assume that your Alexa score would be over 100,000. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 22:58, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you note that the traffic on that site has increased dramatically since Neil Lisst debuted? That it has shot up from somewhere above 100,000 on Alexa to its current position? Did you pay any attention to my statement that the bulk of our views are offsite and are not recorded at the site to which you refer?</p>
<p>As I have noted, and as even the casual reader would note, our comic is political satire, the variety one finds on the EDITORIAL pages, not the comic pages. It is not a comic about superheroes or funky kids.</p>
<p>You say you refer to the guidelines, but you don't cite them. Instead, you vaguely refer to those guidelines, and conclude they are (1) applicable to this circumstance, and (2) you are properly interpreting them. That process begins with you citing the actual language and authority, and then our talking about it. When I ask you to cite authority, you do not.</p>

<p>In other words, you feel badgered, in spite of the fact that this is the process set by Wikipedia, and you feel offended, therefore you vote Delete.</p>
<p>I've decided to ask that my submission be removed. I've always considered Wikipedia to be a joke, and my experiences with the amateurs of this board confirm that. It's being run by people who are not qualified to edit. There is an obvious error on one of the forms here, where a period is placed outside the quotation mark. Those kind of errors are not made by those of us who actually possess writing and editorial skills.</p>
<p>I've concluded that Wikipedia is not good enough to have a Neil Lisst entry, so let's do that.</p>

<li>Well, I do not know who he is, but here is the translation from Serbian from one of the google search results for "Petar Rakas" (<a href="http://www.cyberrex.org/rexold/tribine97.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cyberrex.org/rexold/tribine97.htm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>). Quote: "The poetry night. Outbreak of the greatest poets of modern Serbian poetry: Milan Cunkovic, Aleksandar Todorovic-Bekan, Petar Rakas, Sterije Tolic, Bozica Stankovic and others". So, there is a poet named Petar Rakas. However, the article about him claim that he is a writer of drama for theatre. I do not know is this a same person, but if it is a same person, this person could be both: a poet and a writer. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPANONIAN_cecc.html" title="User:PANONIAN"><font color="blue"><b>PANONIAN</b></font></a> <a href="../../../p/a/n/User_talk%7EPANONIAN_df46.html" title="User talk:PANONIAN"><font color="green"><b>(talk)</b></font></a> 22:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Thank you for pointing out this necessary piece of information. Since this is not an hoax, the article cannot be deleted on this ground. Wikipedia has an article on <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokoloshe.html" title="Tokoloshe">tokoloshe</a>, but this pinkie-pinkie seems slightly different.

<p><b>Comment</b>.

<dd>The first bit, describing the pinkie-pinkie, mentions traits out of the <a href="../../../t/o/k/Tokoloshe.html" title="Tokoloshe">tokoloshe</a> article, such as being very short (about a meter tall), turning invisible and having relations with women. The description really bears nothing in common with the article being debated here. The rest of the article describes the plot of the book, which includes a woman from South Africa who is frightened of the tokoloshe. --<a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScoops_f29c.html" title="User:Scoops"><em><font color="#0844D0">Le Scoopertemp</font></em></a> <font color="#000000">|</font> <a href="../../../s/c/o/User_talk%7EScoops_690b.html" title="User talk:Scoops"><font size="1" color="#0844D0">[tk]</font></a> 11:53, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

If this foundation were a significant presence then they should have been able to get at least local Oregon press coverage.

<li>I guess I can't vote since I am the one submitting the article. But about the previous user's message -- are we discussing whether or not a significant ex-Mormon movement exists or are we discussing whether or not Richard Packham is noteworthy enough to merit a wikipedia entry? I thought it was the latter, not the former -- especially since a wikipedia entry already exists for <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a>. If we can agree that the Ex-Mormon movement is legitimate, then Richard Packham would have to be one of the more prominent members of that movement. I'm not sure what search terms the previous user was looking for or seearching on but finding information about the ex-Mormon movement is as easy as Googling "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon" rel="nofollow">ex mormon</a>" (the 1st link is to www.exmormon.org, the "Recovery From Mormonism" list which currently has a link to the Exmormon Foundation prominently posted on their front page. The 7th link is a link to a Richard Packham webpage). Of course, googling "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon+foundation" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=ex+mormon+foundation" rel="nofollow">ex mormon foundation</a>", being more specific, will produce even better results. It is not surprising to me that not a lot shows up associated with Oregon and the Ex-Mormon foundation because the majority of the Foundation's activities, including annual conferences, typically happen in Salt Lake City. <a href="../../../j/a/r/User%7EJaromsmith_9acb.html" title="User:Jaromsmith">Jarom Smith</a> 07:26, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well in that case I'm probably still too much of a newbie to be able to talk intelligently about this. It seems that the consensus is to <b>Merge</b> into Ex-Mormonism and perhaps with an edit to make it more NPOV, which is fine by me. I did the best I could but I appreciate the help from the community. Just for grins, though, would the community like to take a look at <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jeff_Lindsay_b049.html" title="Jeff Lindsay">Jeff Lindsay</a>'s page and perhaps do the same thing? Jeff and Richard are more or less peers on opposite sides of the ideological fence.

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge with <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a>. I personally know Richard and agree with Jerom, Richard is one of the original gray beards of the ex-mormon movement. He is not only a true skeptic, but relies on the scientic inquiry method that focuses on fact and reason to peel back the layers of an argument to try and arrive at the truth. Richard has spent the last decade using the Internet to share researched data and information that has been largely unavailable or repressed by The Mormon Church in order to highlight thousands of inaccurate details and errors regarding the Mormon Church, its origins and doctrine. Many have thanked Richard for helping them to have access to this data. By the way, Ex-mormonism is a bonafide movement. Also, the Mormon church was considered a cult, not an established church, until just 50 years ago. Until recently, its claim to be the fastest growing church in the world had been patently accepted. Today, we know that claim is plain just false and wishful PR. <i>This is Rshiveley (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rshiveley_e51a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rshiveley">contribs</a>)'s second edit.</i></li>

<li><b>Reply</b>: I'm not sure but I think you misread my note. I did not say it was his second <i>vote</i> but rather his second <i>edit</i>. Arguments from editors with low edit counts are still considered, but they have to be weighed carefully because often editors without enough experience misunderstand the AfD process and argue the wrong criteria for why an article should be kept/deleted. For instance, it may be true that Richard Packham "is not only a true skeptic, but relies on the scientic inquiry method that focuses on fact and reason to peel back the layers of an argument to try and arrive at the truth" -- but what does that have to do with whether an article separate from <a href="../../../e/x/-/Ex-Mormon_d60e.html" title="Ex-Mormon">Ex-Mormon</a> is merited? Mistaking "X is good" for "X should have an article" is a classic mistake made by those who don't yet understand just what the goals of Wikipedia's deletion policies are. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 03:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>There already is an article on the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpson%27s.html" title="Simpson's">Simpson's</a> department store (and one on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Simpson_%28store_founder%29_d497.html" title="Robert Simpson (store founder)">Robert Simpson</a> as well). Moreover, the article is mostly inaccurate. Simpson's was never merged with Sears Canada (they had a joint venture in the suburbs, which did not affect any Simpson's stores), Maison Simons did not purchase the Simpson's stores in Quebec (Simons moved into part of the former Simpson's store on Ste. Catherine in Montreal, years after Simpson's had left), and Simpson's was founded in 1872, not 1860. Given these errors, there isn't anything left to merge with the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpson%27s.html" title="Simpson's">Simpson's</a> article. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 13:35, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Articles on school principals are inherently not notable, and this one is no exception. No real biographical info, just some quotes, and written by anons from his school who have continually vandalised the school's own page (see <a href="../../../s/t/_/Talk%7ESt_Michael%27s_Grammar_School_1c6d.html#Dispute_2" title="Talk:St Michael's Grammar School">debate here</a>).

<li><b>Response:</b> as <a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> suggests below, this is all an attempt to make Gipson out as more important than he is. He is no more notable than any other independent school principal in Australia (eg. see debate before a redirect at <a href="../../../j/2E/_/Talk%7EJ._T._Vallance_52cf.html" title="Talk:J. T. Vallance">J.T. Vallance</a> and merge at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Knight_%28principal%29_801c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Knight (principal)">Robert Knight</a>) and these conference studies aren't very important in education. Mentioning that he writes for the school's ""The Michaelean" basically says he writes for the school newsletter and people in the school read it - not at all important. Also, claiming he has national media profile is ridiculous! <i>A Current Affair</i> is widely regarded as the most rubbishy news program in Australia (this can't be denied by any Australian), and the homework issue hardly received coverage beyond the program. The issue with the Salvation Cross doesn't need an article on the principal, but rather a mention in the St Michaels article, as the issue isn't about him but rather his school. Essentially, Beyondcapricorn is presenting anything and everything that could be seen as sort-of-notable by even just one person in an attempt to keep this puff piece alive. I see no reason to keep this article, and at the very most would say Gipson could have a short paragraph in the St Michaels article to talk about him, but still see this as making him out as more than he is. I strongly consider all voters to consider these arguments. Thanks. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarro5_c654.html" title="User:Harro5">Harro5</a> 22:21, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Response:</b> Gipson IS in fact more notable than other independent school principals in Australia, as detailed by mass-media exposure, the numerous publishings of his studies in regards to education around the world, &amp; as detailed by current positions he holds OUTSIDE of his position at his school, eg. Chairman of the Association of Coeducational Schools, and Board Member of the Association of Independent Schools Victoria. Also on a side note, the guidelines speak nothing of personal opinion in regards to which outlets one speaks on, and as such, your opinions on A Current Affair are not relevant. Please remember to stay on topic and within the guidelines. I strongly consider all voters to consider how valid Harro5's arugments actually are. <a href="../../../b/e/y/User%7EBeyondcapricorn_89ec.html" title="User:Beyondcapricorn">Beyondcapricorn</a> 12:44, 13 November 2005 (AEST)</li>

<li><b>Keep:</b> Wish to point out that by Wikipedia's own biography guidelines, this page has an absolute right to be included. Quoted from guidelines which can be found here:
<ul>
<li><b>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers.</b> Simon Gipson is the most quoted Headmaster, across all media mediums in Victoria, and one of the most quoted in Australia. This is not only because of his school's reforms, but often that he is one of only a handful of headmasters willing to give an opinion or make a statement. You only have to see from the long list of articles below, on his school's website, or a simple google search of his name to realise that he is one of the most respected opinion makers on his area of expertise in Australia, Education.</li>
<li><b>Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more.</b> Simon Gipson has authored numerous studies, essays, and thesis in regards to Education. His works have been published on their own, and in many widely read periodicals such as EdTech and Educare. A quick google search for his name will again confirm this. Also prior to his position at his school, he was CEO of The Endeavour Group in Australasia, a group that reforms schools. He has given many lectures and been the guest speaker at innumerous conferences around the world about education. Also wish to point out that Simon writes for the school's periodical 'The Michaelian News' which is available via the school's website, which has a circulation in excess of 5,000 old students &amp; community members.</li>
<li><b>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events.</b> Simon Gipson has become quite well known around Melbourne, Australia for many media storms regarding the school, including but not limited to the Salvation Army scandal that recently rocked the school, and the interview he gave to the nationally broadcasted 'A Current Affair' where he was mis-represented to sound like he had removed homework from the classroom at his school. This interview sparked a national debate, in newspapers and on national radio (See Triple J's 'THe Hack'), where Simon was contstantly referenced to.<a href="../../../b/e/y/User%7EBeyondcapricorn_89ec.html" title="User:Beyondcapricorn">Beyondcapricorn</a> 21:46, 12 November 2005 (AEST)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Maybe, if the case for keeping him is his works as an educational theorist (I made that title up, but you know what I mean), <i>that</i> is what should be stressed in the article instead of his position of the head of school of an Australian secondary school. For example, the intro lists him as "a teacher, administrator and consultant" first, followed by a paragraph elaborating on his position as a teacher, followed by a paragraph mentioning his published works, followed <i>finally</i> by a paragraph about him becoming well known. With the new addition of the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simon_Gipson_9aac.html#Published_Work" title="Simon Gipson">Published Works</a> section, the focus of the page is more on that. However, it seems a relatively last-dtich effort to provide the article some legitimacy now that it's listed on AfD (and I've a sneaking suspicion that's what it is). The introduction and Infobox still focus mainly on his position as a run-of-the-mill administrator rather than one known for his unique views on education. Change the intro a little, take out the info box and make it a simple picture, you may be in business. No delete vote here, but I'm kind of leaning that way until the page is cleaned up a bit.<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> 14:36, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A better way to incorporate it into existing material would be to mention the abbreviations at the lead of the articles with the full name and create redirects from the abbreviations to the full title.

<p>The result of the debate was very close. Vote count is 9 delete, 4 keeps from registered users, 1 keep from an anon with no reason. I am closing this as a no consensus <b>keep</b> because the article has been somewhat rewritten during the course of the debate to make it look more like an encyclopedia article and less like an obituary which <i>might</i> address some of the "Wikipedia is not a memorial" concerns. I realize that this one is shaky, but I am in doubt here. A renomination of this article might be in order. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:08, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The problem with that is...the source for the information regarding the flag only came from a weblog entry in the External links section.

<li><b>Comment:</b> One more note on the weblog that mentioned the half-staff information, I browsed through it and the recent weblog entries regarding a service person's <a href="http://www.fivestarflags.com/vox/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fivestarflags.com/vox/" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> untimely death. Most of the entries regarding someone's death entry includes these lines in the end: "In honor of &lt;Insert Name&gt;, Capitol flags will be flown at half-staff." As you already know, there are a couple of thousand American soliders have died in the Iraq war. It seems Governor Schwarzenegger would announce anytime a Californian service person that has died in Iraq. He will issued a statement and announced the Capitol flags were to be flown at half-staff. Then Wikipedia should include articles about these Californian soliders: Sgt. 1st Class James F. Hayes, Capt. Raymond D. Hill II, Sgt. Shaker T. Guy, and so on... --<a href="../../../j/2E/_/User%7EJ._Nguyen_e461.html" title="User:J. Nguyen">J. Nguyen</a> 22:48, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>There appears to be some good information ( for example: <a href="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers" class="external free" title="http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers" rel="nofollow">http://twenteenthcentury.com/uo/index.php/HotTipsForEmailers</a> ) and easy peer supported forking and linking redundant components of the campus to allow for rapid expansion as demand grows.</p>
<p>I am concerned that this request for deletion, although probably motivated by the stubbiness of the article or concern that this was a promotion entry, may be viewed by others as fear of competition and undue influence by the Wikimedia Foundation. Since this project appears to peer based (perhaps based upon mnet, gnunet, groksters et. al. and other emerging peer technologies) and encourages participants to set up and manage their own servers it has the potential to scale up rapidly once it hits critical mass.</p>
<p>Considering the methods whereby Wikipedia and Wikimedia starts as attempts to bolster a failing dot com and then work organized by the cabal off the mailing without participation at the meta site (which was being used to stall energetic newcomers with busy work .... or perhaps as a site to harvest others notes, homework or entrepreneurial efforts) I think we (Wikipedia) would be well advised to bend over backwards to avoid the appearance that we hampering or discouraging other volunteer/participatory sites prototyping other organizational and business models. We do not wish to present the misimpression that we view the planet as big enough for only one wiki and we intend to own/control that wiki/modern grid.</p>
<p>I vote NO. Do not delete competitions article. Rather I intend to embrace and expand the stub while I keep an eye on the site and explore its material, processes, licenses, etc. <a href="../../../l/a/z/User%7ELazyquasar_f6df.html" title="User:Lazyquasar">user:lazyquasar</a></p>

I very much doubt the nominator was trying to suppress any competition - he probably thought the article was a hoax. So did I at first.

<p>Started out as a vanity article by "Vonbluvens" himself, but has since been turned into a mug slinging match between his friends and foes on blogs and forums.

<li><s>Keep</s>. Vonbluvens is a well-known figure in the field, hosting a long-time internet radio show. Given the fluid nature of fringe politics (he's now feuding with the VNN, with whom he formerly worked) Vonbluvens may not stay attached to the NSM which makes merging with that article is problematic. The story made more than the local media, and he is considered important by websites that watch neo-Nazis. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> 01:03, 13 November 2005 (UTC)

However my standards as an editor remain unbiased: he <i>is</i> part of the larger organization.

<li><b>Keep</b> Actually VonBluvens has made the news on more than one occassion including being kicked out of a neighbourhood watch organization for his nazi beliefs. His hosting a numbe of media shows as well as frequent clashes with fellow white supremicists has made him a well known and notateble figure in the neo nazi arena. 14211022732 15 Nov 2005 <small>(142.110.227.32 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.110.227.32.html" title="User talk:142.110.227.32">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.110.227.32_1c89.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.110.227.32">contribs</a>))</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> VonBluvens has been a noteworthy player in the neo nazi movement for about 8 years. I think he warrents an entry. And as willmcw states he may not stay with the NSM. VonBluvens has a history of making enemies and burning bridges (NIM, VNN, Hal Turner) so it is a real posibility he may split with the NSM. Thus the article should not be merged. 15 Nov 2005 <small>(198.53.150.56 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_198.53.150.56_57cb.html" title="Special:Contributions/198.53.150.56">contribs</a>))</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> Delete it, and this article will be back in its due time once the Wotmaniad is in print, if that's what it takes to have an "effect on the world." Seeing as I have read it in its entirety (unreleased portions, included) I would submit that it indeed affects a real community of people among whom it is quite famous, and grossly transcends fanfiction in its scope. Nevertheless, this article was perhaps ill-timed and had not been fully fleshed out to present the exceptional quality of the story, and will return in a more appropriate season, I'm sure.<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistressSazha_489e.html" title="User:MistressSazha">MistressSazha</a> 01:47, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
