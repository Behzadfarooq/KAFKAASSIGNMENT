<li><b>Keep</b> -- notable (and prolific) webcomic artist, as well as a major contributor on SomethingAwful.com. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 02:25, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Kelly's notability has not been verified so far (see response to <a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> below), and prolificacy is not a sufficient criterion for establishing notability. Being a major contributor to <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> simply means the he merits a mention within that entry, not an entire entry of his own. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The notability of <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> itself has still not been established conclusively. Most of its justifications don't hold up to careful scrutiny. It has survived several AFDs, but so did GNAA... --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 08:35, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the one AfD for Something Awful that's listed was an overwhelming Keep, so I don't really see your grounds for making that statement. And to Jacj: browbeating Keep votes is bad form. Please don't do it; it annoys people. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 15:44, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> definately passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> as there have been more than 2 non-trivial media mentions in the past. I don't think debating votes over policy issues is brow beating and I don't think it is good form to stifle debate by saying it is rude. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 16:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If Something Awful indeed has non-trivial media mentions, they should be cited as sources in that article. It is woefully lacking of external citations, and should be cleaned up. --<a href="../../../a/f/e/User%7EAfed_b194.html" title="User:Afed">Afed</a> 20:43, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you believe it's "browbeating" and "bad form" to explain why wrong and misleading reasons for a decision are wrong and misleading, it would be prudent to avoid any discussions where people might have to explain why they disagree with each other.<br />
<br />
Since the AfD process is not, in fact, a democratic vote but more like a weighing-up of the reasons for and against deletion, it makes sense that only genuine reasons for keeping or deleting should be considered. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 19:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How can I put this... it gives the impression that you're jumping on people, pigpiling. It seems to only happen in cases where someone is really dead set on there being a specific outcome to the AfD debate. I really only can say that it doesn't look good for your side that you're not willing to let your original arguments stand on their own merits. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 07:32, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Entirely growing sick of seeing people nominating things as "non-notable" simply because they haven't heard of them. Notable webcomic artist sporting multiple well-known comics, some of which were on Keenspot, which alone should be enough even disregarding everything else he's been involved in. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 03:50, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What makes you so certain that my judgement of Kelly as non-notable is based solely on not having heard of him? In fact I <i>have</i> heard of him from being a member of the <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_forums_4c70.html" title="Something Awful forums">Something Awful forums</a>. Your claim to his notability rests on his comics being (1) well-known, and (2) an important feature of Keenspot.<br />
<br />
(1) doesn't really hold up. If Kelly's comics were sufficiently well known as to be notable, then there would be references to the comics from sources other than websites Kelly has a hand in running. As it is, the three citations given in the article are all links to sites Kelly runs. So his comics are apparently not well-known enough to be considered notable.<br />
<br />
Regarding (2): Kelly certainly does have a webcomic affiliated with <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a> (or at least he <i>did</i> — the latest strip was uploaded six months ago), but that only justifies listing it on the Wikipedia entry for <a href="../../../k/e/e/Keenspot.html" title="Keenspot">Keenspot</a>; it does not, in itself, establish notability for the comic, nor for the creator, who is two degrees separate.<br />
<br />
Additionally, you haven't addressed the problem that the article consists of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 05:13, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Does something not being recent make it not having been notable, or even notable in its time? Shakespeare hasn't been updated in hundreds of years, by that estimate.&#160;:P And you seem to claim that the only websites which ever mention him or his comics are his own. That's extremely not-true as well, as a quick google search would have indicated if you had bothered actually looking, as I was able to find numerous sites unrelated to him discussing such in under a minute. --<a href="../../../k/e/o/User%7EKeolah_f37e.html" title="User:Keolah">Keolah</a> 08:10, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I went through checking each notability test I did search for reliable sources on Dave Kelly. I did not find any, I search google, google news, blogsearch, google news archives. I found nothing that wasn't a blog. Please read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and my <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDavid_Kelly_6262.html#Wikipedia:_Notability_.28people.29_failure" title="Talk:David Kelly">post</a>, it is very clear by policy that there is no established notability. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuirex_283a.html" title="User:Quirex">Quirex</a> 16:41, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Shakespeare is documented on media other than the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">WWW</a>. And it is nonetheless true that the only citations in Kelly's entry refer to sites he runs. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacj_756e.html" title="User:Jacj">Jacj</a> 19:12, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
