<li><b>Comment</b> This band seem to me like a lot more than just 'another local band'. If read into the article you can see without the source being bigheaded he has managed to describe a rather pioneering group. I have seen them play at the Make poverty history gig. Thier achivemnt was impressive alongh with others and made it into their my local paper (I have the article but not permission to print it yet).

<li><b>Keep</b> This article details an upcoming band who may not yet be known to everyone, but as stated in the article, this band is in fact a musical "<i>movement</i>", and although they have not yet released any albums (which you seem to believe is the only thing that quantifies a "band"), one is in fact in production (as stated in the article), on a small record label. Disregarding music because it does not fulfil your 'criteria' would be a shameful attempt to classify art. For example, the <b>Arctic Monkeys</b> last weekend played a sold-out gig to 2,000 people at the <b>Hammersmith Apollo</b>, although they, too haven't released an album. How many bands do you know that:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>a) Didn't start "local".</dd>
<dd>b) Are as radical as this band? This is not just another 'local band', this is a very unique way of expressing music, one which has not been seen in quite sometime. I personally, am a follower of this band (I began the article) and am very intruiged by their musical style and persona. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Notch (<a href="../../../n/o/t/User_talk%7ENotch_d2b5.html" title="User talk:Notch">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Notch_08ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/Notch">contribs</a>) 08:16, 14 October 2005.</small></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't know anything about this band but their entry is a hell of a lot more amusing and well designed than most of the 'proper' band entries on this site. Have we really become a bunch of boring busy-bodies with too much time our hands? Let it stay, and if they don't come up with some stuff in the next few months we can reconsider.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Comment</b>. More importantly, the criteria apply to generic music bands. This isn't really a band (as the article states under 'opposition'), thus the criteria for a band are invalid. This is a new innovative way of looking at music, not an "album, album, gig, gig, single, EP, album, gig" band.They are unique and therefore the article should stay.

I bet the last girl you talked too was your mum who came around to drop of the clothes you got her to wash. I bet you can recite the entire script of neon genesis evangelon.
