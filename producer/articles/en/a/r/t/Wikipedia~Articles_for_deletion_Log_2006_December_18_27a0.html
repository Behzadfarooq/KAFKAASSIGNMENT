<p>Nothing notable enough about this tour to make it worthy of getting its own article <a href="../../../j/o/l/User%7EJoltman_f40c.html" title="User:Joltman">Joltman</a> 19:25, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, can I just state that I made this. Please keep this article up for a while for the other mods to decide. I think this article is worthy, for a couple of reasons:
<ul>
<li>This is probably a farewell tour</li>
<li>Other bands (like Coldplay and ahem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Concert_tours" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Concert_tours" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Concert_tours</a>) have these articles.</li>
<li>The concerts (and I know this sounds biased) are more than simply vehicles for performing songs, they are also almost plays in themselves, in that they reenact the film.</li>
<li>I have cited this a bit too</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - just because there are 300 others, doesn't mean this one should be included. If it <i>is</i> the farewell tour, then I would be inclined to abstain, but "probably" doesn't cut it with me. --<a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidnighttonight_662c.html" title="User:Midnighttonight">Midnighttonight</a> <small><i>(<a href="../../../m/i/d/User_talk%7EMidnighttonight_d19a.html" title="User talk:Midnighttonight">rendezvous</a>)</i></small> 21:58, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Not just another random tour. It is notable because Tenacious D is not a "band" in the traditional sense--It's made up of two actors, one of whom is a huge Hollywood star, so it's not like they go on tour all the time. I would say this tour is pretty rare, and was more than likely conceived to coincide with the release of their movie. <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 22:04, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - a concert tour will of course get reported on in music magazines and publications. This provides verifiability, but I remain unconvinced of notability.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I would delete individual articles aboout the groups, but I think it is reasonable to have an article about them collectively. I object to the absence of any independent sources (other than the choral groups and the university). The university sources are at least verifiable if not wholly independent. There must have been newspaper articles about the groups or their albums. Serious and encyclopedic music groups at least get independent reviews of their public performances at cathedrals, concert halls, etc. I expect the article and articles like it would get more support if multiple independent reliable sources were provided, because they would then be notable by traditional Wikipedia standards. If it is just a recreational group of no demonstrated artistic merit then it is as non-encyclopedic as a recreational softball or bowling team. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:36, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Articles in their college newspapers are insufficient. They establish existence but not notability for anyone outside the college.

<li>College newspapers intentionally promote campus activities like the arts. They should be treated skeptically at best for such activities, not assumed to be independent sources. As <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> states, "An independent source is a source which describes a topic from the outside." Groups that have achieved notoriety through outside publications, like Skull and Bones, can lay claim to independent sources. I don't think Wikipedia has reached the point where any person or organization mentioned in a college newspaper deserves an article.

<li>Even if were going to accept <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> as an authority (which it's not), the essay specifically says "for a recording artist, an independent source would be a review of the artist rather than album sleeve notes or a press release". A college newspaper is <i>not</i> these a cappella groups' press releases or album notes. To be on the "inside", the source would have to be a publication of the a cappella group itself - which the Cavalier Daily is not; it's an independent student newspaper with no official links to the a cappella groups. If you contend that a college newspaper, because of the very nature of its focus, is not a sufficiently independent source, then does that mean the <i>New York Times</i> should likewise be treated skeptically for its coverage of Manhattan news? Or we shouldn't consider <i>USA Today</i> independent in its coverage of U.S. news, but should rather consider the foreign press? There is nothing in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> that indicates college newspapers are not reliable sources. In terms of exaggerating the institution - I'm sure there are plenty of college newspapers/alumni publications which larger circulations than plenty of other, non-school-affiliated "reliable sources". I don't see why these sources should be treated "skeptically" just because their community of readers is based on an educational institution rather than say, a county. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 08:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with a lot of the previous post. I don't think anyone is arguing that we should assume that facts sourced to college newspapers are false. However, the existence of a college newspaper article about a college club does not establish that clubs notability, even if the article tosses around adjectives like "premier", "internationally-known," etc. It's not that we can't trust sources within the geographical jurisdiction that their name implies, it's that <i>small</i> sources tend to cover their local beat generously. Thus, a college club that manages to get an article in their college newspaper does not automatically warrant a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 09:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>schi, as someone who has personally experienced the low bar of college-newspaper journalistic integrity of by having entire sentences invented by a "reporter" and attributed to me, I think it's outrageous to compare the <i>New York Times</i> and <i>USA Today</i> to them. And, anticipating the next riposte, I advise against using <a href="../../../j/a/y/Jayson_Blair_fd29.html" title="Jayson Blair">Jayson Blair</a> or the like as a yardstick of <i>NYT</i> and its ilk. It's precisely <i>because</i> such incidents are outrageous scandals, not the business-as-usual of amateur student writing, that we consider professional publications reliable sources. Personally, I'd prefer to have outside sources for just about <i>anything</i> cited in a college paper. But savidan again reminds us that the issue here is notability, not factual accuracy. The issue of other, outside sources for college material becomes moot because the subjects are of only parochial interest. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 13:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> College newspapers typically are very critical in their reporting of the cultural efforts of on campus groups. There is no incentive for the campus reporters to slavishly praise every musical group on campus. It is purely a strawman argument to go from the statement that a campus paper counts as a source to saying "I don't think Wikipedia has reached the point where any person or organization mentioned in a college newspaper deserves an article." No one has even proposed that "any group or organization mentioned in the New York Times deserves an article." Substantial reporting of a campus group in a campus paper counts fro as much toward notability as an equivalent reporting of an off campus group in the local town newspaper. Also a strawman argument is reference to <b>"an article"</b> in the campus paper not being enough, since outr standard is <b>multiple</b> sources. But <b>an article</b> can certainly be one of those sources, in combination with other sources. Please do not use a sliding scale to disallow coverage in campus papers. At colleges I attended, they were not a mouthpiece to do public relations. The reviewers ridiculed lame efforts by student groups as much as they ridiculed stupid policies of campus administrators. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 15:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Jeffq, for the record, I did not attribute a similarity in journalistic integrity between the apparently monolithic establishment of college newspaper journalism with such institutions as the <i>NYT</i> and <i>USA Today</i>. (Nor do I particularly appreciate your presumption that I was going to next invoke Jayson Blair, as that is <i>obviously</i> an irrelevant and extraordinary circumstance.) My point is that college newspapers should, generally, pass <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> with flying colors, just as much as <i>NYT</i> or <i>USA Today</i> would. The assumption that just because an independent, reliable source covers a particular community makes it de facto unsuitable for determining notability seems to me to leave the door wide open for systemic cultural POV. You may call a school-affiliated publication a "small" source, or a particular-school-affiliated subject a parochial topic, but where do you draw the line/set the arbitrary level of granularity? (!<a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">Pokemon</a>, but...) To consider notability as something that must be geographically affirmed (nationally recognized, etc.) privileges arbitrary geographic formations that aren't necessarily relevant to the scope of the topic. I'm sure you would agree that a topic doesn't have to rise to the level of being covered by a state or national newspaper to be considered sufficiently notable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, as in many, many cases that would be totally irrelevant, but that's what these arguments sound like. I guess we have a fundamental disagreement, which I think I'm sure I've seen in other Wikipedia discussions like this. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 18:33, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response to Edison</b>: Please be careful about accusing people of making <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments. My statement, "I don't think Wikipedia has reached the point where any person or organization mentioned in a college newspaper deserves an article", was specifically about <i>Wikipedia</i> articles, not campus paper articles. I said nothing about "'an article' in the campus paper", and turning this into a denial of the "multiple sources" standard can itself be construed as a straw man. I am saying that <i>any</i> amount of reporting in a campus paper is not inherently reliable or notability-confirming. It must be judged on its merits and double-checked for accuracy, since the authors are not professionals, and the oversight of collegiate news is in general less rigorous than the professionals and varies widely from school to school and year to year. But this whole line of discussion is a straw man, because <i>there are no such college-paper articles</i> cited in A Cappella Groups at the University of Virginia. Currently, its sole "sources" are group websites, which can be useful but can't be the only means of justifying notability. It is certainly <i>possible</i> for student reporters to do a good job, but the proof is in the pudding, and we have no pudding at the moment. I would also like to make clear (not that you suggested otherwise!) that I do not believe that we should delete all college a cappella group articles on principle. To use your example above, the Virginia Sil'hooettes have an arguable case for notability, having won 2 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Contemporary_A_Cappella_Society_6eee.html" title="Contemporary A Cappella Society">CARAs</a> — a verifiable factual tidbit from the <i>Cavalier</i>.

<dd><b>Response to schi</b>: I apologize for offending you with the Blair comparison, but I believe it was an obvious next argument for someone who is pushing the geographical-context comparison between <i>NYT</i> and UVA's <i>Cavalier</i> without acknowledging the editorial-concern argument, given my point that I have personal experience with reporters-in-training making stuff up to serve their agendas. I concede this is an extreme example, and that reporting on college music groups is probably not usually this biased. I also apologize for any implication of a "monolithic establishment of college newspaper journalism". As I mention in my above response to Edison, college papers <i>can</i> have useful material, but they must be double-checked because they are far more prone to favoritism and simple ineptitude by fledging reporters. (The change at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">Wikipedia:Notability (music)</a> was done with far too little discussion or any meaningful consensus, and opens the door to the promotion of any local artist or group that catches the fancy of the student staff.) Finally, I <i>don't</i> agree that a topic need not "rise to the level of being covered by a state or national newspaper"; I think this is a useful yardstick for notability in a global encyclopedia. I take this position because Wikipedians are, in general, atrociously bad at creating proper citations for reliable sources, mostly believing that (A) "truth" is all that matters; (B) bare links to self-promotional websites, fansites, or user forums are sufficient; or (C) mentioning correspondence or a newspaper without giving specifics is more than enough for "sourcing"; when none of these are adequate for <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. I am <i>not</i> saying <i>you</i> are doing this; that's just the experience motivating my hard line on solid, neutral, professional sources. (My point can be easily demonstrated by observing the sore lack of proper sources in the first 10 articles one fetches through "Random article".) If we had more folks doing a thorough job of vetting sources, I'd be much more willing to accept very local sources, as I am an inclusionist at heart. Until that time, I'm a practical deletionist in order to force that vetting. But as I mention above, we currently have absolutely zero independent sources cited in this article. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:13, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Jeffq, I wasn't really offended, but I do appreciate the civility. <i>Finally, I don't agree that a topic need not "rise to the level of being covered by a state or national newspaper"; I think this is a useful yardstick for notability in a global encyclopedia.</i> - Perhaps I shouldn't have said "rise", as my point here is that the fact that an information source is geographically-based is often irrelevant to its usefulness as a reliable source (to establish notability). Esoteric/academic/highly-technical topics that are routinely not covered in general (geographically-based) newspapers but are discussed in academic journals/conference proceedings are considered sufficiently notable for an encyclopedia, even though such sources can have very small audiences and are not geographically-based. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 00:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Consistency" is a common but erroneous argument for inclusion.

What's more, this is not a discussion about the groups themselves, but rather whether we should have an article collecting the groups. This list article currently has <i>no</i> independent, reliable sources whatsoever. (Actually, after examining the Hullaboos article, I see that the use of bare links disguises the fact that most of the "sources" are either <i>Cavalier</i> articles or clearly not wiki-reliable sources.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Edison's conditional statement is misleading. The Holland citation explicitly states "mentioned as one of several newer glee clubs at Yale". The Freedman citation doesn't even state whether the article mentioned TBD, saying instead "The Baker's Dozen sang the Louis Jordan song "Ain't nobody here but us chickens" as part of the recruiting of highschool students" (clearly not a quote from the article, given the use of the non-existent compound word "highschool"). The Fisher article is about <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Ferrazzi_dfbe.html" title="Keith Ferrazzi">Keith Ferrazzi</a> (himself a subject of arguable notability), saying only, "Ferrazzi loves singing, so 'I do piano-bar parties, where I have Lionel Richie and the Yale Baker's Dozen come and hang out,' he says." The actual quote doesn't even specifically say that Richie and the Baker's Dozen were there at the same time for a single party, while the citation implies a much stronger connection: "they performed along with Lionel Richie at a piano-bar party". (Such expansive interpretations of cited material are exactly why proper citations and quotes are necessary, to avoid reading too much into trivial items.) These are clearly passing references, not "prominent mention". ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:55, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>College newspapers intentionally promote campus activities like the arts. They should be treated skeptically at best for such activities, not assumed to be independent sources. As <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a> states, "An independent source is a source which describes a topic from the outside." Groups that have achieved notoriety through outside publications, like Skull and Bones, can lay claim to independent sources.

<dd>Another comment about this point, college newspapers (despite Edison's assertions below) do have a vested interest in promoting campus life, and while they are usually not just arms of the administration, they are still far more likely than, say, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> to be full of fluff pieces exhorting students to check out this or that performance.

<dd><b>Comment</b> (with a feeling of deja vu) At the colleges I attended, the campus paper had an independent editorial board and was often critical of administration policies, the sports teams, and campus arts groups. Maybe at some college, the President hires reporters and tells them to praise the chorus. I think that is the exception rather than the rule. They had as large a circulation as the town paper, and operated at perhaps a higher journalistic level. It is unreasonable to claim that an article in such a paper does not count as one of the multiple, verifiable, independent sources for notability. Otherwise a Cleveland paper could not be a source for notability in Cleveland. And it is a straweman argument to start talking about the impossibility of having an article for "everything mentioned " in a campus paper, since we are judging by the standard of multiple coverage. The campus paper is an independent source; the chorus newsletter would not be. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a></dd>

This may be splitting hairs, but the Cleveland metro area has a million people; there are about 5,000 undergrads at Yale. Furthermore, college newspapers indisputably and rightly give coverage to all kinds of trivial things; the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleveland_Plain_Dealer_4b72.html" title="Cleveland Plain Dealer">Cleveland Plain Dealer</a> generally does not write articles about local knitting societies and community choruses unless they are involved in something that meets a higher standard of notability.

<dd>Also, I went to very "good" schools for ugrad and grad school and they both did, in fact, have papers of very low journalistic quality, one of which frequently instates and then removes an editorial policy not to provide critical coverage of performing organizations. So I do not think it is totally off base to question them a little more closely, just as we should question the Small Town Times a little more closely.

<dd>I would certainly agree that college newspapers, regardless of the quality of journalism or stature of the college, report on a very closed sphere of interest and necessarily give coverage to elements of campus life that would not feature in even a local, let alone a regional or national publication. Reports in college papers and glancing / trivial mentions in mainstream media do not satisfy the spirit or the letter of our notability criteria. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> <small><a href="../../../d/e/i/User_talk%7EDeiz_2388.html" title="User talk:Deiz">talk</a></small> 16:52, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>WP:N and WP:MUSIC indicate that multiple, non-trivial discussions in reliable sources establish notability; editors here contend that multiple, non-trivial discussions in college newspapers do not establish notability. That sounds to me like you don't accept college newspapers as reliable sources, at least for the purpose of establishing notability. If that's the case, you need to raise it at WP:N or WP:MUSIC, not here. Also on the topic of splitting hairs, while there are about 5,000 undergrads at Yale, there are 120,000+ living alumni who could be interested in topics covered by the Yale newspaper. Further, the article in the <i>New Haven Advocate</i> about the attempt at evicting The Baker's Dozen's is not glancing nor trivial - they're the subject of the article. As for the policy's intent concerning a topic's notability extending beyond its "immediate sphere" - again, I question that "immediate sphere" extends to the entire communities of, in this case, Yale, New Haven, and/or a cappella-affiliated/interested people. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 18:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would argue, though perhaps not strenuously, that college a cappella groups touring are not automatically guaranteed notability. My a cappella group in college toured all the time, often "cross country" or "internationally" but it was always on the coattails of a larger choir or simply going to a bunch of other colleges and getting hosted by their a cappella groups and having a dual concert. This is not "touring" per se, in the way that the Harvard <a href="../../../k/r/o/Krokodiloes.html" title="Krokodiloes">Krokodiloes</a> tour.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 20:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article was nominated for speedy deletion per A7, non-notability, but doesn't qualify. The subject meets WP:MUSIC with a tour through Canada, the US and Japan, and with the outside coverage. That's imo enough to avoid speedy deletion, but the issue is whether it's enough to meet the notability thresholds. That's why I'm moving this to AfD instead.

<ul>
<li>With all due respect, while Dan Bryk could be considered a "commercial" artist, if you had read our mission statement in your research, you might have noted that Urban Myth is a 'recording collective'. While we ultimately serve some of the facilitating functions a record company might, we are a non-profit 'artist collective' that serves as a resource for the artists who do the commerce. (FYI Urban Myth sells no products directly or from our website.) Semantics and issues of self-interest aside, I really don't see how you can dispute Dan is a notable artist (cf. new link to COVER Feature Story from Now Weekly, a 395,000 READER CIRCULATION city weekly and a major Toronto cultural signifier). I have supplied the baseline data and links there, please feel free to put your mad skillz to use and re-write for Wiki style. Merci. Umrecs 1:55, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>With all due respect, non-profit is still commercial -- but <b>we don't care if you're non-profit</b>. We're not here to provide free hosting and promotional services, let alone <i>rewrite</i> services, and if you persist in acting like our rules do not apply to you for some reason (believe me, we've seen them all), and we're just here to provide you a soapbox, you will run into problems -- I guarantee that. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:07, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Dhartung, I'm not sure why you appear to taking this so personally. As you should realize from the proposed entry (or even a cursory Google search) Dan Bryk has plenty of other avenues for commercial promotion. My original entry was quite simple, factual and non-promotional, and it was immediately tagged for quick deletion. I then supplemented Dan's entry in hopes of enhanced notability, and was immediately attacked by yourself for alleged commercial promotion. Apart from my role at UM, I PERSONALLY believe Dan deserves a Wiki entry, assuming Wikipedia considers noteworthy alternative music artists to be worthy of entry, and it is up to editors like yourself to debate that. I'm still not sure how that equals "persist(ing) in acting like the rules do not apply to me." Really, hurling threats(!!!) at a first-time wiki author for admitting "Sorry, it's our first wiki entry" seems a little out of line. Umrecs 22:28, 18 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not taking this personally. I am telling you that Wikipedia has a conflict of interest policy and reminding you to abide by it. When an editor has an interest in an article, any article, their objectivity is likely to be called into question; in this case, had there been any question of notability, then for me (and others) the fact that it was written by a connected entity could easily have tipped argumentation the other way. It's really better to <i>avoid this problem</i> by <i>not editing the article in the first place</i>. Now, we really don't care whether you "personally believe" Bryk should have an entry. We only care whether he meets the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines such as notability. I have not attacked you, nor have I made threats, if you will reread my comment. I have been firm, and other Wikipedia editors and administrators may be far less forgiving of any violations now that you have been told about our policies, so you should base your future participation in Wikipedia on that. If you don't understand how your editing of the article is a conflict of interest -- and you have not said that you do -- then I will be happy to explain it again. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:02, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fully Understood. (I apologize for the cavalier tone of my "mad skillz" quip, since obviously these protocols are critically important to you.) The bottom line is, Dan Bryk, acclaimed, loved indie rocker he is, did not have an entry. My intial proposed entry had nothing but objective, factual data that you yourself _could_ have written based on one or two of the cited articles (and that's a selective sample; a Google or EBSCO search will return many more). It was IMMEDIATELY marked for speedy deletion. When augmented with _subjective_ data to DEFEND _notability_, the interest flag came up. Does NO-ONE else here find that process flawed, or at the very least problematic? Umrecs 13:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Placement of the speedy deletion tag is a <i>nomination</i> open to any editor who believes it is warranted. It is an implicit trust of the administrators that when they are closing speedy deletions, since only the nominator and the closing administrator are involved, that the admin take care to abide by the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">criteria</a>. That was done. The admin had questions about the nomination, so placed it here for a community consensus, rather than leaving it between two people who disagree. To the contrary, that process worked wonderfully, and from your point of view, succeeded -- because here editors found sufficient notability to vote keep (in fact not one editor has voted "delete"). I find no flaw in this process, nor in the way it proceeded in this case. If had been a procedural flaw, we have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> as a sort of appeals process. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:56, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Help</b>. Hi everyone, thank you for helping me improve the article by providing information here on this delete page. Thank you in particular to Amarkov, Justin (Authalic), Metropolitan90, Robertissimo, PMAnderson, and Just H. I just got out of an interview with CBC Radio One. They did a segment on "The Shiny Diamonds Controversy" after they read the Washington Post article. Just so you know, I have never met anyone in the Shiny Diamonds band before... in fact I just heard their music for the first time today (on myspace). I live in Paris, they live in Vancouver. You can google me if you don't believe me. I'm just very passionate about keeping this type of information in wikipedia. It makes me sad to think of wikipedia as the sum of SOME human knowledge. Can someone help me out with improving the page so that it is less likely to be deleted. I don't even know how to reference a radio broadcast. I could really use some help. Thank you in advance. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeigh8959_ce32.html" title="User:Leigh8959">Leigh8959</a> 03:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>But if I thought that a rewrite could possibly make this good enough to keep, I wouldn't have said to delete, and I probably would have rewritten it enough to establish notability. But there is no controversy, therefore there aren't sources, therefore no rewrite could make it better. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 05:19, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I actually think if there's a radio interview on this issue (raising the number of sources to three) that would probably be enough to keep it.

<li>I heard about this whole thing on the radio this afternoon and thought it was interesting enough to start up a Wiki page for. It's not even really an issue or news but if these guys were talked about on CBC Radio 1, which is as relevant as it gets for Canadian broadcast, it warrants a mention either in their own page or a 'Shiny Diamonds Controversy' page. I looked on Google and there are dozens of articles quoting or elaborating on the whole thing. I liked what the guy in Paris said about the sum of all knowledge. If the internet has fairly limitless potential, why should Wikipedia users be waging some sort of battle against this very Wikipedia-related issue being mentioned on the site? It's all very strange and I expect to see more news articles popping up daily about this, as they seem to have been doing for weeks now.--Mercury0T 07:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC) <small>— Mercury0 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mercury0_72a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mercury0">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

Let's not lose our sense of perspective here: To call this a true controversy, or to even say that Shiny Diamonds is the main focus of these articles, is misleading. They are being used as a current example (one of many, it should be noted) for an opinion article, and they are then mentioned (very briefly) in another editorial (about the original opinion article). -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 10:41, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> With lists such as these, there are always thorny issues about categorization. For example, I was very surprised to discover that <a href="../../../h/2E/l/H.L.A._Hart_fb1c.html" title="H.L.A. Hart">H.L.A. Hart</a> was a homosexual, until I made the further discovery that he was married with four children and that it is some unnamed, unsourced "biographers" who claim that he's gay. I'm not going to do anything about it because doing that would involve a revert war and most likely some nasty attacks on my own motives. I would like it if someone would properly source this list and indeed leave out the ones whose sexuality is based on conjecture, or by a claims made by a minority of their biographers (who after all often make such claims to generate attention; if you don't believe me think of Albert Goldman's scandalous biography of John Lennon [which ironically enough accused him of homosexuality-- add Lennon to the list of LGBT Britons!]), but this <i>is</i> wikipedia after all and it is expecting too much for people to follow historical methods. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi

<li>After looking further at the list, I'm changing my vote to <b>Delete</b> because many of these people are not sourced (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, etc.).

<li><b>Delete</b>. This kind of list-making is too easily abused by those who wish to promote, vilify, or "out" people — depending on one's agenda — regardless of unbiased evidence of this socially powerful categorization. One major benefit of using Wikimedia categories instead of lists is that the claim for inclusion or exclusion is made in the subject's article (with the cat tag), not an external list. This means that the people most likely to have sourced information to confirm or refute this categorization will see the claim as it is made or removed. The usefulness of this approach renders the "list can include source info" argument, which is already largely bogus, superfluous as well. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 23:34, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As someone who hangs out at CFD, this amuses me because CFD has been moving in the direction of getting rid of categories like this because they cannot be sourced. Jeffq wants to get rid of the lists because people who edit the articles won't see the information posted in the list. So nobody really wants to deal with this problem. I see a few possible ways to solve it:
<ul>
<li>Avoid having lists OR categories for controversial subjects that require verification. This option probably has no possibility of garnering community approval (I wouldn't support it either).</li>
<li>Change the WikiMedia software so that lists can be created dynamically from database entries, and those entries would come from any article. So in effect the list entry for a person would be maintained in their article, and anyone looking at the article would see all the information that is posted about that person in lists.</li>
<li>Keep the info in lists.</li>
<li>Keep the info in categories.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Since the first option is unlikely and we'll have to wait for the second, that means either lists or categories. The big advantage of lists is that there is a history, you can see the citations, and the history shows who was added and who was removed. While it is possible to dig and find who added someone to a category, it is near impossible to find out who has been removed from a category and by whom. The relevant citations might be buried in the article or talk page. For these reason, I'd say, keep this info as a list and not a category. Require citations and remove anything that is uncited.

<dd>For the most part, yes. But I am highly skeptical of the agendas of folks so very interested in categorization by sexual preference, especially since much of the vandalism I revert at Wikiquote appears to be from people who perceive homosexuality as a slur on a person's character. I've done a lot of research on people for articles on WP and WQ, and while I find their professions, their nationalities, and sometimes their ethnicity and gender important, the only people for whom this tidbit seems important are people on the forefront, voluntarily or not, of the pro-homosexuality/anti-homosexuality melee. Is there some encyclopedic purpose for identifying the sexual preferences of all Jews covered in Wikipedia?<br />
If so, I think a category would be easier to maintain (and prevent vandalism or unsourced rumor-mongering), because the people who know the subject best will see the addition, deletion, and alteration of this information.<br />
Samuel Wantman's point of the source of this information being "buried" in the article actually bolsters my argument, as the cat tag would be in the place where the sourced data is, rather than having to duplicate the source in both the article and the list for each and every person. His no-history point is only valid if you assume the people maintaining this information are list watchers, not subject watchers. It's like assuming that you need a list for trumpet players because the editors working on each trumpet-player article can't be trusted to categorize their subject, when the reverse is actually more accurate: subject editors are far more likely to command accurate information than list editors. But I appear to be in the minority on this opinion. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 07:43, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think this list is too difficult to source because the classification of so many on the list rests on usually unverifiable claims made by biographers of homosexual liasons. Also, I find the definition of Jewish POV: is it an ethnic or religious definition? I think this list, finally, forces Wikipedia to take a position on <a href="../../../o/u/t/Outing.html" title="Outing">Outing</a>. Is it morally justifiable to "out" people who don't want to be perceived as gay? How much should we respect the decision to "stay in the closet." When Wikipedia lists men and women as "gay" (without the context and qualification provided by a full biographical article) who wished to keep their sexuality a guarded secret, I think WP is sending a message that sexuality is inevitably a public affair and that it is okay to "out" people. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b> - I will remain as a delete vote for now. Most of the sources given are not reliable sources for the purpose of an article on a scientific topic, and should be removed. MSNBC and the San Diego Union Tribune just aren't appropriate sources for this type of article. The only source that might be remotely considered reliable is the AAAS symposium. I'm concerned that there are no references to papers in proper peer-reviewed journals. Why is this? It also seems that Cramer might be trying to use a concept that he calls "retrocausality" as an abstract formalism for dealing with entanglement, and the popular press is presenting it as traveling back in time. But even then, some of the things don't make sense to me. Cramer's presentation says "the present can affect the past, and the future can affect the present ... retrocausality is perfectly permissible within the known laws of nature". I would very much like to see an explanation as to how this does not violate causality, and how one can have that sort of "retrocausality" without tachyons that cause a breakdown in energy conservation.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of general interest, not a dictionary of science. It'd be highly pedantic to delete the entry altogether.</p>

<p>Prod was contested.

Only claim to notability is performing concerts at their own Cornell and travelling; travelling only if it rises to the level of a "concert tour reported in reliable sources"; not if the only one who took note of it was the group itself or its local college newspaper. Multiple, non-trivial secondary-sources are required to establish the notability of a group. Claims from their own website are insufficient. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 07:05, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Unsourced article presents itself as science, misrepresenting the information it throws out there. The energy equation is thrown in, creating the illusion of meaningful when it's actually irrelevant. Article is poorly written, violating rules regarding OR, neologisms, and probably POV. POV is invoked if this is simply an interpretation instead of deliberate misrepresentation. At best, the information that would remain after deleting the bogus part of its contents would barely merit a dictionary entry. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> Wikipedia is not a dictionary. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 07:10, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know about that "within the fandom" . . . there's not that many furry sites that have a sub-100,000 Alexa rank (80,000 avg, venturing into 60,000 territory occasionally) and which have been up almost five years.

<li>I know we're not supposed to invoke precedent here, but my point - perhaps expressed rather too subtly - was that compared with (say) FA or FN or VCL or Yerf, all of which went without a whimper, Yiffstar isn't _the_ most significant of furry sites, and it would (IMO) be perverse to keep this article while the most important sites are deemed non-notable.

<p>I created this article. The <a href="http://catholic-hierarchy.org/" class="external text" title="http://catholic-hierarchy.org/" rel="nofollow">Catholic-hierarchy.org</a> website is a very useful, and, as far as I can tell, reliable, resource for data on Roman Catholic ecclesiastical organisation and for biographical information on the higher-ranking clergy. This article is <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Catholic-Hierarchy_8de1.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Catholic-Hierarchy">internally linked</a> from a number of different Wikipedia articles, including <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_Benedict_XVI_f9c4.html" title="Pope Benedict XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=catholic-hierarchy.org" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=catholic-hierarchy.org" rel="nofollow">Some more pages</a> link directly to the website. And I am pretty sure it would be useful as a source for many additional articles.</p>
<p>Now an anon has tagged it with {{db-web}}. I don't think a useful quality resource such as this should be treated the same as some random ephemeral forum for teenagers, just as we don't (or shouldn't) treat academic journals the same as Barbara Cartland novels. On the other hand, I can't quickly find any good third-party references. I would be grateful for some help with that. Is it really possible that nobody has written about this database? In case no references can be found, I would suggest keeping it and moving it to project space, as it remains a useful resource that Wikipedia editors should know about. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">U◦p◦p◦l◦a◦n◦d</a> 08:48, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep'</b> This is an extremely accurate, up to date, reource on the heriarchy of the Catholic church throughout the world.

<li>That's a good reason for having an external link to it in <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_church_hierarchy.html#External_links" title="Catholic church hierarchy">Catholic church hierarchy#External_links</a>, not a reason for it having an article itself. Indeed, pretty much all of the current contents of this article are little more than summary information that would annotate that external link. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is for determining whether something should have an article in its own right, and the fact that a book or a web site is a useful <i>source</i> for information used to build other articles doesn't mean that that book or web site should have an article in its own right.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> or <i>chainsaw merge</i>. The reason I'm now grudgingly saying this should go is basically the same reason I gave for Yiffstar's deletion. I'm standing by my position from the previous AfD that the site is widely known. However, I feel that an external link, possibly a very brief discussion, in an appropriate article is all that is <i>really</i> needed. Non-furries aren't likely to find the history of the site fascinating enough, and furries are probably there just to look at the pretty pictures. We have WikiFur for this sort of stuff. And <del>Carthago must be deleted</del> I hate verifiability as the only deletion argument, no matter how you phrase it it comes across as a cop-out. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't particularly enjoy just using 'V' as an argument either, AFD discussions should be more than that. However, when trying to hold the balanced view (IE holding up WP's rules against its own bedrock of being about providing information and discussing that comparison in AFD), this is often used as leverage to keep articles which do not belong. It shouldn't be, but it is, making it more difficult to hold balanced discussions when they are indeed necessary, more's the pity. I quite agree with you that VCL is an important website within the furry community, but that there's no material out there to make an article from. What is there to say about this site? "It's full of furry pics - if you want furry pics go there." That's it, in a nutshell. The way to provide that is as an external link from the main furre article or by providing a link to WikiFur which will doubtless have an article. I would have liked to have summarised all that in my 'vote', but I grow tired of some contributors insisting the grass is blue and the sky is green, just to keep articles which are clearly not suitable for WP. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 13:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>I see, I see. I misunderstood; thinking you meant the game had no assertion of notability. I still don't think it should be deleted as it's relevant and technically correct. Maybe <b>merged</b> with the Lineage 2 article? Due to its subject matter, it would fit perfectly in Section 5 entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_2#Botting" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_2#Botting" rel="nofollow">Botting</a>.</li>
<li>- How about the fact that l2Walker allowed for some of the most profitable real money trading companies like <a href="../../../i/g/e/IGE_53a0.html" title="IGE">IGE</a> to become not mere 'gamers with bucks on ebay' but full-fledged businesses?</li>
<li>Great references! Unfortunately they are for Lineage II (which I do not doubt is a notable subject) and not L2Walker which is the subject of this AfD. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 09:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>A huge problem with tracking down l2walker usage or stories about it come in part from the fact that most people (even players who use the program for non-monetary purposes) will deny using it, since even suggesting that you might use it could get you banned. Most forums dedicated to the game actively censor discussion about the program, and the official lineage 2 forum policy dictates that any discussion about it can get your thread locked or deleted, with your account having the same done to it. Mentioning the program any other way than referring to it in the third person (That program, The program, IT, the program which shall not be named, etc) can get your post edited and/or deleted. NCsoft NA representatives in official threads on the subject even refrain from mentioning it, except by slight reference:</li>

<dd>l2walker is infamous in that regard, because it *is* the one that hasn't been stopped, and has not been stopped during the last several years of Lineage 2's existence. Its kept the real money traders in business in lineage, and kept legitimate players from competing normally against others. In short, its usage has been a constant plague upon the players of Lineage 2. Removing this article would just serve to further censor a product that, for good or worse, affects the majority of the million-strong player base for this game across the world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, talk about the program has been published. When I get home I will find the actual article, but its use was mentioned in a gaming magazine article about real money trading during 2005, specifically mentioning Lineage 2. <small>12.110.71.30 22:22, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></dd>

Do we have a reference to say that the Belgian blogosphere is different from the blogosphere generally? Not as such. Do the blogs discussed have articles? Seems not. Is it full of lovely weblinks to blogs? For sure. Do any other articles link here? Nope. I'd say this is a type of article that we used to think might one day become useful, but we've now decided is not as useful as we thought and rather too prone to <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruftisement</a>. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 10:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, the statistics has sources (be it badly formatted). And since most of those blogs are written in Dutch or French, I don't see lack of notability outside the Belgian blogosphere as valid reason to delete it. Wikipedia is an international project and anything with a national notability in the country of origin is an acceptable subject. That's probably the reason why individual articles on the relevant blogs haven't been created too. Not enough people with the relevant language skills to do it. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:53, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Widespread is subjective. The fact the Dutch language is pretty small makes for few blogs in that language, but that doesn't make it any less important.

LexisNexis wasn't helpful as it gave me no articles on the guy and Google lists a lot of links, but non I can see relevant to the mobster. I might be missing something, so <b>no opinion</b>. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 11:46, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

(At the same time an anonymous user added information to the <a href="../../../l/e/v/Lev_Leviev_ea46.html" title="Lev Leviev">Lev Leviev</a> article that Leviev is founding NeshAir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90785159&amp;oldid=90784914" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90785159&amp;oldid=90784914" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> which User:Frummer affirmed adding Leviev's interests in "aviation" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90883359&amp;oldid=90785159" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lev_Leviev&amp;diff=90883359&amp;oldid=90785159" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> and the <i>only</i> mention of "Leviev and NeshAir" on Google is a link to the Leviev article on Wikipedia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Leviev+NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Leviev+NeshAir&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>) So we go full circle and Wikipedia thus becomes the ONLY source for all this baloney as Wikipedians and the world are "taken for a (sky) ride" on "NeshAir"! All this is highly suspicious and violates a number of things.

<li>Have you read it at all Frummer? It's about how you have tried to create PR for a company that does not exist and unfortunately it fits into a pattern of how you operate, and all I have done is state the places where you have caused much trouble.

It's relevant here, because this is part of a series of his deliberate disruptions of Wikipedia. So does anyone who puts up exactly one incomplete "under construction" web page with no information on it, have the right to have a Wikipedia article based on it? You make no sense. Did you notice that he lied when adding: "...and promoting the new Haredi Neshair airline..." in the <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Al_26f7.html" title="El Al">El Al</a> article (which is a serious article) when no such thing happened?

<li>Hi Mets: Don't misunderstand me. Notch it up to my sense of mercy that I have not gone the RFC route at this time, which I consider to be a very serious procedure. I would much prefer that User:FrummerThanThou would moderate his ways and avoid his irresponsible style of editing and writing , with which I have unfortunately become well-acquainted in recent weeks. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 06:32, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>IZAK: Suggesting that someone gets blocked is also very serious, as you have done with frummer. I had a conversation with him last night...he seems like a nice guy, although a little misguided lately. I think he needs a break for a bit, but not a block. Weren't you blocked in the past? I'm sure it wasn't fun. As such, stating that he should be blocked might not be considered mercy as you were in that situation. C'mon...it's the holiday season. This isn't necessary right now. =) <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 13:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi Mets: Sure he's a nice guy, that's not the issue, it's his wild pattern of editing, writing, nominating, and un-nominating articles relating to <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jews</a> and <a href="../../../j/u/d/Judaism.html" title="Judaism">Judaism</a> back and forth, that I have had the dubious pleasure of having to struggle with. I am not judging him as a person, I am judging his work, that's all. Furthermore, it is out of a sense of responsibility and of not wishing to see Wikipedia and its Jewish content articles mangled (as Frummer tends to do) that I am keeping a careful watch on what he does with Judaic articles. I can't watch his edits to non-Jewish articles, let other people take him up on that. And as for my history on Wikipedia, I started in December of 2002, four years ago <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryeh_Kaplan&amp;oldid=536245" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aryeh_Kaplan&amp;oldid=536245" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> and at that time we had a number of virulent and scheming <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemites</a> who were sabotaging Jewish and Israeli articles and in the course of a bloody slug fest over a long time I got blocked for about a week for repeatedly calling them antisemites. (Since then I am NOT <i>that</i> blunt, as there are more ways than one to skin a cat), and eventually a few of those characters were in turn blocked and banned for a long time as their true colors and Jew-hatred eventually did them in -- so I don't think that you or Frummer want to be gloating in their company -- nor do I suggest that <i>anyone</i> open that can of worms, they'll just get burned (by the worms&#160;;-})! And yes, Happy <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> to all! <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:24, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi IZAK: I am definitely not gloating in anyone's company and this is not about anti-semitism. This is about how you tend to lose control way too much. Instead of jumping on someone, why don't you take the time to find out what the problem is, instead of plastering it all over wikipedia. Obviously, if someone is deliberately causing problems (i.e. frummer), then they should be dealt with in the proper forum. This is an AfD, not The Jerry Springer Show. Anyway, my email is on here so maybe we should continue this through there. All I can see of our debate is just clutter. And also a Merry <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a>! <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 15:03, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If your son died in a car accident, that may be notable to you. Why should this kid be listed but not the one on the 'local' news? Today's TV market has become oversaturated with media coverage. A story may be run and played, but is that really significant? Five years from now, this article will look quite silly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it doesn't offer much information, not even a birthdate.</p>
<p>Biography is supposed to give people examples of notable lives of important achievement. Instead, we have a youth-oriented culture that self-glorifies itself before even achieving anything of real or lasting value. Playing a game at a minor league level and then accidentally drowning is a news story, but not a biographical article that people will need to know about. At least that is the way I see it here. Those that insist on "keep" are really watering Wikipedia down...if we include everyone, why not ourselves?→ <a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>R</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Young</font></a> {<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sup><a href="../../../r/y/o/User_talk%7ERYoung_2409.html" title="User talk:RYoung">yak</a></sup></font><font face="arial, helvetica">ł</font><font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ryoung_5c64.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ryoung">talk</a></sub></font>} 07:34, 24 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep-- Notability, Verifiability and WPDictionary objections answered</b> Already in Wiktionary, of course, but I have given a somewhat more adult discussion, along with 2 unmistakably academic references--one even non-US--one law review article and one Master's thesis, along with 3 examples of notable mainstream use, in classic films and novel, and one presumably notable adult film already in WP. (and a link to the pornography and blogs) I had thought that the term was somewhat old-fashioned, but my teen-ager told me it was still in use. (smile) The non-academic stuff took half an hour, as did the academic. I'll add some song texts from mainstream artists. I think this was what you asked, WilyD, &amp; Chris, and I find it easier to work with even a poorly done stub than to start afresh; for one thing, when it comes up for AfD, there's some pressure to get it done.

<dd>No he's not. First you vandalize the article because you don't like the character, and then when your vandalism is reverted, you put the article up for deletion? You have NO basis for doing this, and are making a nomination based on personal feelings rather than because it's appropriate. If Dodoria is a minor character, then so is Zarbon. Both only appear in a few (read: many) episodes, after all, as well as an hour long TV special that reveals a lot of background information about the Saiyajin, and Goku's father.

<dd>You have nominated the article for deletion, and are now suggesting to keep it, with everyone else suggesting to delete it (so you can hardly have changed your mind based on what is said in this AfD).

<dd>I found the article inadequately referenced which is why I made the nomination. The sources are not clearly referenced in my opinion. I hope its sources will be specified more clearly and then deletion unnecessary. The genesis of Ido from Esperanto has been the object of scholarly study by the philosopher Couturat as well as linguists. I suspect that the article may in some places be a bit OR, but that could be cleaned up by sticking more closely to original sources. <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENov_ialiste_f3ef.html" title="User:Nov ialiste">Nov ialiste</a> 22:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> Wikipedia has several articles comparing auxiliary languages – Ido and Interlingua, Interlingua and Esperanto, and so on. Comparison in itself doesn't make an article original research. A few points in the article are questionable at best. Sidney Culbert’s figure of 1.6 million Esperanto speakers is certainly not the “most reliable estimate.” Culbert provided too little information to evaluate the accuracy of this figure, and even if it was once accurate, it is outdated now. But these details can be addressed without deleting.</li>

<p>Michel Bauwens is at the forefront of the P2P movement. There is not a single reason thinkable to delete his entry from Wikipedia, on the contrary. Rik Maes, University of Amsterdam</p>

Had this article not existed, I would have been stranded. I think he might be more important in Europe than we know, so I would like to hear a European POV.</p>

<dd>"Michael Bauwens belongs to this new generation of progressive, involved and hyperconnected intellectuals who develops a deep and continuous analysis of the social web phenomena, particularly how P2P impacts people and society at large, and what potential for positive change this sharing sphere comprises.

<dd>"Michel Bauwens is the author of the most visionary piece on peer-to-peer I've ever read, published his much-awaited new essay on P2P, entitled P2P and Human Evolution: p2p as the premise of a new mode of civilization. As expected, his excellent and path-breaking treatise is all-encompassing, critically exploring P2P in all its possible manifestations and linkages, that is, with respect to its political, social, economic, spiritual, cultural, and technological implications. It is at the intersections of all these spheres and their interactions that P2P holds the potential to emerge as the basis of the new civilisation premised on self-realisation, autonomy, creation, eros, and sharing. It's either that or a return to barbarism, writes Bauwens. Read on and marvel at the mental syntheses that this essay invokes."</dd>

It's long and much of it goes far over my head, but reads like a P2P manifestoï¿½? Bauwens even concludes by calling it a guide to an active participation in the transformation of our world, into something better, more participative, more free, more creative. Really quite fascinating."</dd>

<dd>"What Michael Bauwens has achieved in a very short space fullfills the same function as the Communist Manifesto once did: a call for a worldwide movement for social and political change, firmly rooted in the objective and subjective changes of contempary society, and articulated as a practical and insightful model of human value and power relations that is ahead of its time. If we listen more carefully to Bauwens than we ever did Marx, however, it just might lead to a smooth evolution for humanity rather than revolution, or at worst, destruction. Bauwens has traced out real contours of hope for Western civilization. His presentation of a P2P perspective includes a clear theory of human power and value relations, a practical appreciation of its relationship to the current orthodoxy, and an inspiring vision for viable, sustainable, and desirable futures. Just as Bauwens notes the limited social acceptance of Marx at the time of his writing, it may well be that in years to come Bauwens's articulate and deeply considered insights will not only be as profoundly influential and valuable but, crucially, a lot more workable."</dd>

<dd>"I rarely enccounter essays addressing Integral Theory in the context of emerging technology. But if there's one thing out there worth reading, this essay is one of them -- P2P and Human Evolution: Placing Peer to Peer Theory in an Integral Framework (via IntegralWorld). This very long essay describes P2P in detail, covering the interior and exterior aspects, and its incompatibilities with Spiral Dynamics and Integral Theory. There are a lot of heady stuff for me to digest in this essay. And I'm still not done reading it."</dd>

<dd>"What I appreciate is your clarity with regard to the following: your basic definition of p2p; the way you trace this definition, and any compromises and departures from it, within its many manifestations; and toward the end of your account, forms co-existence and of possible political strategies. All of this is very valuable food for thought and action. You make a most effective and persuasive case for the widespread significance of the p2p phenomenon, in diverse fields, and with due regard for the underlying epistemological shifts involved. This work is indeed a major achievement of scholarship, insight, moral vision and political imagination."</dd>

<dd>"I have been reading your essay. The information in book form is far easier to approach than the online newsletter, of course. This is truly a great introduction to this field of thought. A major accomplishment, even in its present "a work in progress" stage. Thank you very much for making this available. One of the very useful aspects of P2P&amp;HE, I find, is contextualization of the notes with their many website referrals. This allows me to follow out the ideas in a coherent fashion. A significant body of this material has been available only in French, which I do not read, and much of it remains untranslated. However, much information is now available in Englishon the net concerning what remains untranslated, and P2P&amp;HE is an excellent guide.ï¿½?</dd>

<p>This article seems to be about the historical opinions of one lecturer. "Desmond Fernandes" isn't a major historian, and the article treats what he says as consensus. It is my opinion that this article (whose title misleads as to the consensus around this issue) will never be able to avoid being either a soapbox or a PoV-fork, and is in any case a non-notable term for the event. I know this doesn't mean much, but searching for the "Kurdish Genocide" on google gives 50k links (compared to about 1 million for "armenian genocide" and a whopping 40 million for "Holocaust"), nearly all of which talk about Saddam's, not this. The accepted content (i.e. people died and it wasn't by accident) is already in the relevant articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> Added several references. There is a wealth of published material on this topic, and the article can be further improved beyond the comments of one lecturer. The topic is very important: <i>Turkey genocide Kurd</i> gets 24 articles in the New York Times alone, and I see 21 more in Proquest. Naturally some say the actions arre genocide and others say they are justified. The article should perhaps be retitled Alleged Kurdish genocide (Turkey) since the other side says the villages were bombed to get rid of guerillas. Deleting it because the Holocaust get more Google hits does not make a lot of sense. Any genocide is notable, and the stats might reflect the relative paucity of Kurds with blogs. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:51, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is an excellent point.<br />
In WW2 some say the German bombing of London and Allied bombing of Berlin were justified. I'd be uncomfortable calling it "genocide" because some don't feel it was justified.<br />
The United States assimilates (naturalizes) any immigrant. They too 'genocide' Kurds and others as they immigrate. I'd be uncomfortable renaming the US naturalization process as a genocide.<br />
The original source is the 'Armenian Forum'. I do not see it as a neutral source. Article talks about a 'violent repression of any Kurdish resistance'. That <i>Kurdish resistance</i> is considered as terrorist attacks by the NATO and EU nations as well as others.

<li>I meant if you was to do a research on people's experiences who lived in Anatolia they'll be more than happy to tell you their stories and academics who do the research and became the "reliable sources" do not do much more work then what I've mentioned; but of course "any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source". I know such research hasn't been done but the results are obvious to me because I've interviewed many people in many Kurdish communities on the same matter for various projects and non of them contradicted the issue so I didn't hesitate to say it in my previous post.

<p>There seems to be a confusion as to the meaning of the word genocide. Take for example, the German occupation of France. Lots of French people were killed. A few were guerillas, but most were not. Entire villages were burnt to the ground. Torture was common. But this <b>was not</b> genocide. There's a difference between brutal repression and genocide, and from what I've read in the various links provided and googled, the consensus on this is that it was the former, not the latter. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 08:17, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Niko, you cannot contest something which is an extreme pov. We cant create a fictitous debate on whether Kurds suffered genocide in Turkey when there is no such debate. You employed the same argument on the Pontian greek "genocide" article, it has the convenience of confirming the extreme pov as 'unchallenged' when in fact it so minority that there exists few people to counter such claims. The problem is the claim still lacks authoratitave and verifiable sources. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 12:29, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

If i created a sourced article on a genocide of Turkish Cypriots, and asked you to show me sources explicity claiming otherwise, would you be able to do this?

<p>Let's not let this turn into yet another regional argument. As an academic view, it should be presented. I'm just not sure that it merits an entire article. The previous gSearch was flawed, as it gave mainly links to Iraq. "kurdish genocide in turkey" gives 47 hits, all of which are dodgy (either "Desmond Fernandes" or "cultural genocide" allegations or Kurdish sources). I'd say that a redirect and a paragraph in "Human Rights abuses in Turkey" is enough, but then again maybe this academic view has more proponents than my (admittedly crude) research has shown. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYandman_8146.html" title="User talk:Yandman"><font color="red"><b>yandman</b></font></a> 13:21, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Hesitant keep to neutral</b>. 'Hesitant' because more information is needed. 'Keep' because for over 20 years there has been constant criticism in the media about the fate of the Kurds in Turkey. There are reports that over 3,000(!) villages have been emptied, of armed campaigns by the Turkish army, pictures of Kurdish refugees fleeing, cross-border attacks against refugee camps in Iraq, etc. 'Neutral' because the term genocide seems to be evolving; also, because there seems to be a cross-over between understandable Kurdish resistance and outright Kurdish terrorism (against innocent Turks and tourists) that has to be rooted out.

<li>Some Turkification circumstances, sadly, imply a genocide like those events in maras, sivas, diyarbakir, hakkari.

<li>Just to add a few notes. Baristarim there are some references on this issue, some which are already in the article, some which are not and are waiting to be added and for you to note that no huge research has been done mainly because of the corruption of Turkey's higher education system. You say there's millions of Kurds still living in the Turkey, as if how could this be, after a genocide; well look at Germany there's still millions of Jewish people living there after the Holocaust. I also find it ignorant for you to mention some voters ethnicities and say that it reflects their opinion on the matter. Please let's remember Wikipedia does rely on realible sources and books but we write those books and it's time to understand that this issue has been restricted long enough, let's be open about it. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 01:54, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ozgur, of course I will mention the ethnicities, since it seems to me quite interesting that ten Greek editors turned up here, in the AfD of a page created two days ago, in the space of a couple of hours. It doesn't write "Stupid" on my head, if I didn't mention it, then I would be really ignorant as you claimed. And you are wrong again Ozgur, there are not millions of Jewish people living in Germany after the Holocaust!!! Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND? Did you just take that number out of the air or do actual research on this? And your claims about the lack of research is completely off the charts. Where were the Europeans? They could have done research.. Half the article is a POV FORK of Human rights in Turkey in any case. You are confusing the meaning of genocide with something else. Turkification does not imply genocide, I am afraid. Ozgur, you are living in a completely dream world! What genocide? Do you even know what that word means?

<li>Baristarim, if we was to decide these things depending on peoples ethnicities then we couldn't decide anything because we will be stereotyping; which means that we nor the greek nor the turks nor kurds could give an opinion on this matter. You're complaining about the amount of greeks voting for an article considered for deletion which is completely not logical when we think about the amount of turks that have voted here, how about them? is the turksish opinions always right ha? is this what you're going to say next? Check on your sources again there's millions of jews in germany and EU. Of course we aren't a forum but we are here to discuss matters and decide and stop accusing me of not knowing the meaning of words please. I'm here to do research and put some useful information backed with reliable sources on an issue that has, in my opinion, happend, with many Kurds backing it. You have your opinions I have mine, here's the arena, let's prove it with academic sources if we can't, don't be angry and sad about it we'll be here in one month. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 02:35, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>What non sense. This AfD was proposed by an <b>Englishman</b>, and there have been editors of other nationalities that have voted for delete. Take a look at the votes a second time please. There are not millions of Jews in Germany, that is FALSE. You don't seem to have an adequate grasp of the subject matter, therefore I see no reason to continue my debate with you. This is not about our opiniong my dear fellow.

<li>Ozgur, I agree with Baris. The turkish editors vote here because Turkey is a side in this genocide allegations, therefore they are voting for it. It is probable that Turkish writers have a better understanding of the issue. For you, due to your ethnicity, you are also at a side and you have a greater knowledge on the issue, therefore you vote in this discussion. Greek writers are not directly related with the topic, but interestingly numerous editors from Greece vote here. I do not want to conspire on the issue, both Baris and me might be wrong, but the ethnicity of the voters seem funny to me. <a href="../../../c/a/g/User%7ECaglarkoca_4bc9.html" title="User:Caglarkoca">Caglarkoca</a> 03:21, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>per Neurobio. This utter nonsence is a waste beyond comprehention.

Despite documentation and international concensus we dont call terorist to several organisations.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - I must admit I'm quite surprised that the question of keeping is even being discussed. Honestly, it seems a big joke, with a Mr. x leaving a declaration that a "genocide". And the best part are his arguments for defining genocide: "Forced assimilation program", "banning any organizations opposed to" assimilation, "violent repression of any Kurdish resistance", "assassination of various journalists and intellectuals". Now let this be clear: is such standards are accepted for defining a genocide, hundreds of "cultural genocides" articles will end being created by editors, and every single act of organized persecution or opression of a population will risk being renamed "genocide". Give a look also at <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">Genocide</a>; the article completely fails to awnser the standards exposed there.--<a href="../../../a/l/d/User%7EAldux_3597.html" title="User:Aldux">Aldux</a> 12:52, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Despicable tactics and <i>votestacking</i> by the "so-called" "pseudo"-members of the cooperation board</b></p>
<p>I am not stupid, neither are other people. I know exactly what went down with the article that Dirak created, and most importantly, also know why it was created. It was created two days ago, it was AfDed by an Englishman, with even a Swiss editor voting for delete, and BOUM <b>ten Greek editors show out of nowhere one after another and vote keep</b>. There is no way that so many Greek editors would be aware of that page since it was created only three days ago. <b>That's not possible.</b> This is <b>despicable</b>. I would kindly request that all those editors strike their names out of the cooperation board participants list. There is no need for editors who engage in such charades for such blatant attempts at disruption of Wikipedia to use that board as a smokescreen. That's not why it exists. It is not the roll call of every Greek and Turkish editor on Wikipedia, it was created for a purpose. I am sure that those with self-respect and dignity will heed my call. What is even more disturbing is the reason for the creation of the article in question. It is blatantly obvious: The debate in the PGG article has been heating up for the last week after a two month sleeping period and BOUM this article comes. Real class. We are not at a carpet store: if there are those who envy carpet-selling techniques, they can open a carpet store. When the AfD is completed, you can be sure that there will be a report filed at ANI, and a probable RfC. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 07:14, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, I was not referring to anyone in particular. I cannot change your opinions, but if a simiar thing had happenned with Turkish editors, ie if a Turkish had created a Albanian genocide article, then ten Turkish editors who had signed up to the coop board jumped in (some who had not even edited since November 11 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalogeropoulos" rel="nofollow">[55]</a>, then I am sure that you would have felt the same way. Especially, if the article in question was created per WP:POINT because of a dispute in another turco-greek page. Of course you have the right to browse any page you want in Wiki, but it might be nice if you explained how you actually learned of this AfD. I really would like to know what you would have felt if the situation was inversed between Greeks and Turks. Have any Turkish coop board members created an Albanian genocide article, emailed each other and all showed up in the space of ten hours to vote keep? Are you honestly telling me that there isn't anything fishy? How did all those users learn of this so quickly? Personally, I was contacted by a non-Turk over this after ten Greek editors suddenly showed up and voted keep. This user emailed me because I was at the coop board and also because he thought that there was something "extremely fishy" going on (his words). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 09:51, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Could <b>everyone</b> calm down, please? The main argument here seems to be that most people think that the content of the article is important and needs to be discussed. Well, to be honest, the main argument seems to be about Greco-Turkish relations, but let's pretend it's not, mmmmokay? I've merged the article <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">here</a>, and I propose redirecting this page to that specific chapter. Does anyone have a <b>valid</b> argument against this (i.e. a BBC article calling it a "genocide", or a Nobel Prize given to this Fernandes guy, etc... <b>not</b> an article talking about Fernandes' views or Kurdish sources)?

I think this article deserves a seperate article, since the human rights status of Kurds in Turkey is a major issue towards Turkey's accession in EU. The current article we discuss could be renamed as I propose and expanded, inlcluding the 3 bullets above I mentioned. The section <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a> could link to this article like that:Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey.

<dd>No, half the article already falls into the scope of the Human rights in Turkey, and such allegations of genocide etc are <i>always</i> talked about in the human rights sections of countries. "History of human rights abuses also falls into the scope of that article. Human Rights in Turkey article is not even a "long" article, you cannot expect another article to be created that incorporates two paragraphs of a Spanish guy's thesis. As for the current status of Kurds in Turkey, there is an article at Kurds in Turkey. Huamn rights of Kurds is not a major issue in TR-EU accession, have you been following the subject closely? There are already four articles: HR in TR, Kurds in Turkey, Turkish Kurdistan, Casualties of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, why do we need a fifth article except for POV:FORK? Are these articles filled to the brim already? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:09, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No, my friend. It is a major issue for EU and for Wikipedia, unless you close your eyes to the violent manifestations in Turkish Kurdistan concerning the human rights violations of the local population, the manifestations against Erdogan, the incident in the local police station involving the current chief of staff of the Turkish armed forces, the restrictions concerning the use of Kurdish language in Turkey. These issues definitely deserve a seperate article, including also:</dd>

<ul>
<li>The history of violations of their human rights.</li>
<li>The alleged genocide.</li>

<dd>There is no need to mention every single event, Wiki is not a newspaper. Can I add all sorts of incidents to the HR in GR article? EU doesn't care at all about the situation of Kurds in Turkey, you should check that again per realpolitik. The restrictions on teaching another language as a first language other than the official one is also banned in many EU countries, and the HR in TR article also covers this issue, and I was the only one who actually dug up the references and rewrote the section, btw. There is no need to move it to somewhere else, since it is only two concise paragraphs to begin with. There is no such official thing as Turkish Kurdistan, so cut down on the political overtones. There are already four articles that relate to this, what is the fifth one for? The other articles are not even half-Long. If you were so interested in this, then why am I am the only one practically to have edited the HR in TR article in the last two months? I have <b>never</b> seen any of the voters above to have actually matched their statements of "i think this is important!" with any sort of act on the ground, so why should I believe that this is not just an attempt to create a bastard POV fork that will lay there for ages right after the AfD has closed? Am I wrong? There is no such thing as alleged genocide. Does the article Cyprus include "Turkish cypriot genocide allegations"? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 10:27, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Only an editor of an article has the right to be interested in it? Of course not! The fact that there is a section somewhere else does not mean that we cannot add another article providing further analysis. You argument does not outdo notability. And, in order to prove my interest in this topic, I can be the one who will create this article. And, say if I'm wrong, but the problem with the Turkish language is not just teaching, but also use of language in public places.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 10:40, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>?Again, an insufficient grasp of the subject matter: what public places? on what are you basing this? There are tons of music stores in Turkey that sell Kurdish music, in Istanbul there are many people who speak Kurdish in cafés or in the streets! Are you joking? It seems that none of the keep voters are not even sure what the subject matter is! Ozgur, for example, tried to prove that this was a genocide by saying "there were millions of Jews in Germany after Holocaust!!" (twice), to counter what I said about there being millions of Kurds in Turkey! That statement was utterly false, the same way with the relation of "public places" in languages. The notions are so confused, I might as well be arguing that Pyramids were built by Martians. I suggest to follow Yandman's version: the relevant text of this article has already been incorporated into HR in TR, let's redirect this to that article. <b>However</b>, keep in mind that the inclusion of genocide thesis in any article will be carefully scrutnised by WP:V, WP:POV and WP:OR <i>no matter what</i> zombie article it goes into. In any case, this won't be a healthy discussion if people who are participating will not reveal how they came across this AfD.

<dd>From <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds.html" title="Kurds">Kurds</a>:"Until 1991, the use of the Kurdish language — although widespread — was illegal. As a result of reforms inspired by the EU, music, radio and television broadcasts in Kurdish are now allowed albeit with severe time restrictions (for example, radio broadcasts can be no longer than sixty minutes per day nor constitute more than five hours per week while television broadcasts are subject to even greater restrictions)." Do you understand now what I mean? Can the Kurds create a channel broadcasting 24 hours a day in Kurdish? Can they form a party advocating autonomy in Turkish Kurdistan? Are the Kurds <b>officially</b> recognized by the Turkish governent as a seperate nation and a minority? I do now what I'm speaking about. And I do now that a judge who tried to reveal the truth in the "fiasco" in the police station in Kurdistan is no more a judge.--<a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYannismarou_16f4.html" title="User:Yannismarou">Yannismarou</a> 13:06, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

Is this A JOKE? The only thing you can be prosecuted is for <i>actively</i> (physically) supporting PKK et al. That is normal since it is recognised as TERRORIST, and such prosecutions have also happenned in Turkey. STOP! If the keep voters in this AfD are asking such basic questions, how can their comments even be considered as serious?! First it was Ozgur who tried to prove that this was genocide by saying "There were millions of Jews in Germany after the Holocaust" and now this? Are there any arguments out there that come this close being serious?! Yannismorou, if you do not know the answer to this, why are you asking this after voting? Why haven't you asked this to me before the vote? I could have easily told this you! How would you like it if I asked you "would I get prosecuted in Greece for saying "I am an Albanian - not a Greek""? as if Greece was some sort of Talebanic shithole.

<dd>I'm not joking at all. After all, I'm also a jurist. If you are right, then on what grounds was Pamuk prosecuted? And all these Kurdish members of the Parliament, who lost in the past their seats and were put in jail? And what is the nature of the crime of "seperatism", based on which many many human rights fighters and Kurds proud for their national identity have been persecuted (and not just prosecuted).

<li>I agree with yandman and Fut.Perf. This very brief article is basically about acts of violence apparently committed against Kurds in Turkey that one writer apparently calls a genocide. To prevent a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">WP:POVFORK</a>, it's absolutely sensible to include this in another article that already deals with these subjects, such as <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a> or <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurds_in_Turkey_c5e2.html" title="Kurds in Turkey">Kurds in Turkey</a>.

The resistance should not be restricted to PKK. This prevents the discussion of the problems of Kurds in Turkey on neutral grounds. This kind of genocide allegations just causes provocations. It's obvious that there is no reliable sources, no data, no consensus among the mainstream of historians but just the baseless claims.

<dd><b>Comment</b> For those who are interested, I also included above how some "so-called" "pseudo" members of the Greek and Turkish Wikipedians cooperation board <b>deliberately attempted to disrupt Wikipedia by creating such grave articles per WP:POINT and engaging in blatant votestacking campaigns that led to ten Greek users voting in this AfD in the space of ten hours. An AfD for an article that was only created <i>three days ago.</i> ALL THE KEEP VOTES HAVE COME FROM THESE USERS, WHEREAS MULTIPLE ADMINS, ALONG WITH MANY NON-TURK EDITORS HAVE VOTED FOR A CLEAR DELETE.</b> This <i>despicable</i> campaign included bringing back a Greek user who hasn't edited for 1.5 months. If some people have some fantasies that they actually want that there was a genocide inflicted upon the Kurds, this is not the right forum. I will definitely file a report at ANI. <b>This article was created per WP:POINT because of disputes in a similar article</b>. This is unacceptable behaviour. None of these users have explained how they ran into this AfD at the same time. As I have said, if some people cannot fulfill the criteria required for the coop board membership, then they SHOULD REMOVE THEIR NAMES. Nikos's response to my question as to where he heard of this is simply making a mockery of Wikipedia. I am sorry folks but this failed coup attempt (no pun intended) is not going to succeed. Won't these users be warned to cease playing with this AfD? Have they been warned at all? There is no rational explanation as to how a Greek editor came back from a sleep of 1.5 months to vote in this AfD, along with the fact that so many Greek users all voted at the same time, out of <i>nowhere</i>. <i>This attempt to portray a whole nation as genociders is simply racist, if any Turkish users tried to do this for some other country, blocks and ArbComs would be flying off the bat.</i> <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:31, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Comment</b> It is becoming easier and easier to attach the <b>legal term</b> genocide next to every ethnic group who has beef with Turks. Armenian, Assyrian, Kurdish, Pontic Greek Genocides, I've heard Bulgarians claim genocide by Turks, I am sure Serbian and Ionian Greeks will folow. These accusations and misuage of "genocide" is becoming harder and harder to take seriously. Of course it finds support from the Greeks -who in my opinion are better off dealing with their own minority problems: Albanians, Macedonians and Turks who they call Muslims- and from other interest groups and those who have little knowledge concerning the subject and its depth yet like to be the <b>good guy</b>. You may not like what I am saying but I sure am behind what I wrote and believe in its truth.--<a href="../../../d/o/k/User%7EDoktor_Gonzo_bed0.html" title="User:Doktor Gonzo">Doktor Gonzo</a> 14:29, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OK. This is an AfD, not an RfC. I've moved the page to <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey_a9ca.html" title="Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey">Human rights of Kurdish people in Turkey</a>, mixed it with some of the content taken from <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_rights_in_Turkey_da3b.html#Kurdish_people" title="Human rights in Turkey">Human_rights_in_Turkey#Kurdish_people</a>, and made it clear that only one academic believes it's a genocide. However, this article as it stands is still absolutely awful, and I hope that all those who have participated so virulently in this discussion will help bring it up to standard, lest one think they were just engaged in petty nationalistic disputes.

<p><a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">User:Rossami</a> <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a> the article, and whilst clearing the backlog I disagreed and removed the tag. But fair play, I reckon both positions should be heard and afd is the best place for that. Rossami prodded it with the reasons:</p>
<p>The article does not demonstrate that the subject meets Wikipedia's generally accepted <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The article claims that the subject is "one of the world's leading experts on GLBT cinema" but does not substantiate that claim. No sources are provided to allow any other editor to confirm the claim.</li>
<li>Authoring a book with a current <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Queer-Movie-Poster-Book/dp/0811842614/sr=11-1/qid=1165961502/ref=sr_11_1/103-0413457-2487802" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/Queer-Movie-Poster-Book/dp/0811842614/sr=11-1/qid=1165961502/ref=sr_11_1/103-0413457-2487802" rel="nofollow">Amazon sales ranking</a> of &gt; 300,000 is not considered sufficient to meet the inclusion standards. (Note: This author has published a second book but its sales ranking is even worse, currently standing at &gt; 877,000.)</li>
<li>Producing a single movie is also not generally considered to be sufficient to support an article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I think the biographical details listed at <a href="http://www.sfjff.org/sfjff17/filmmakers/d0719c-a.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sfjff.org/sfjff17/filmmakers/d0719c-a.html" rel="nofollow">this bio</a> are probably enough to merit inclusion. I take Rossami's points, but I think once you consider that whilst each individual claim itself seems minor, their sum is greater and allows more merit. Note the above linked bio claims the subject has been "profiled, interviewed, photographed, and reviewed in scores of periodicals including The New York Times, The Village Voice, Variety, The Hollywood Reporter, Entertainment Weekly, Out Magazine, The Advocate, The Los Angeles Times, and Time International." It also claims the subject has written for "such periodicals as Out Magazine, The Advocate, Filmmaker, Girlfriends, Curve, and The Bay Area Reporter". Anyway, that's the cases for and against so far. It'd be nice to have someone with US newspaper access chip in on whether the press coverage is substantial and would allow the article to be improved. The best I get in a British library search is a usage of the book <i>The Ultimate Guide to Gay and Lesbian Film and Video</i> as a source: "A recent book calling itself The Ultimate Guide to Gay and Lesbian Film and Video, by the American Jenni Olson, ignored Pasolini's films altogether, yet included Ostia" <small>("Dangerous liaisons" <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Independent_de8a.html" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> (London); Jun 5, 1997; Roger Clarke; p. 10.)</small> I also think the incoming links to the article merit a look, they indicate to me that there is some substance to the subject as an article.

<p>I'm pulling down a rewrite, halfway there, so I hope people will revise their opinions in the wake of this rewrite, which I hope addresses all concerns. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 14:53, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Okay, Olson has been noted as writing an historically valuable book, her film has received good reviews and three awards, as well as having cultural impact with regards the Golden Gate Bridge, whilst her roles as a festival curator and founder, website founder and maintainer, collector and her importance to her field have all been established through verifiable citations in reliable sources. I would hope people will now reconsider their opinions. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 17:00, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The existence of one article does not justify that of another. This is considered a very weak argument in an AfD discussion. Indeed, it suggests that perhaps the FA article(s) need to be reconsidered for deletion as well (cf. the centralized discussion noted on its AfD page). Please explain why you believe the article should be kept, citing policy/guidelines, and by responding to the issues noted by those recommending deletion. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 17:46, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The <i>List of Japanese Army Officers (WW2)</i> was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Japanese_Army_Officers_%28WW2%29_804a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Japanese Army Officers (WW2)">previously nominated for AfD</a> in August 2006. It survived by virtue of there being no consensus, thus defaulting to keep. In the four months since, absolutely no attempt has been made to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> any of the information on the list or to provide any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">sources</a>. Without verification or reliable sources, this compilation is essentially <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. I have since discovered the companion article, <i>List of Japanese Navy officers (WWII)</i>, which suffers the same fatal flaws as the army “article”. Both articles fail all three essential content policies of wikipedia. I could also add that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">wikipedia is not a directory or memorial</a>. These are indeterminate lists that do what a Category:Japanese Army Officers or Category:Japanese Naval Officers ought to be doing. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:41, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Lists and categories are separate animals and can work in tandem. That said, I see no need for listing all officers below the rank of General or Admiral respectively. Below that, it should only be notable officers with blue links or reasonable red links. This seems more like a tag/cleanup issue than one for AFD. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:45, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Weak <b>Keep</b> and cleanup — Agree with Dhartung, although Captains would also be acceptible. Many of these entries may never have an article, so better a list than a category. That being said, however, it'd be good to have more information than a simple list on this page. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 20:57, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> If this were a matter of cleanup, I'd have tagged it with {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}}. However, these articles are contrary to the main content policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. As those have not been addressed over the lifespan of these articles, and as it does not appear that it will be addressed, these articles cannot remain. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 21:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> we've been through this before. Not only an unmaintainble list, but also vague listcruft of the worst sort. Where do you set the bar for inclusion? And by whose standard? <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 00:18, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> As there is no "bar" for inclusion, this would be a totally unmanagable, and probably unverifable list. Make it a category - not a list. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH">SkierRMH</a> 04:28, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><small><b>Note</b>: This debate has been included in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Japan_10b0.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Japan">list of Japan-related deletions</a>.</small> <small>-- Huwe 6 04:39, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> and let it get cleaned up. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">There is no deadline.</a> <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> 07:36, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above. Making it a category and not a list does nothing to address verifiability, except spread the problem out. Categories and lists co-exist peacefully in most cases, and I don't know what makes these two lists particularly unmaintainable. The bar for inclusion is probably set too low for these two lists, but AFD is not for cleanup. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 07:58, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not advocating cleanup. I am advocating deletion based on the paramount policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, among other things. I am also not advocating moving all the listed names into categories; the suggestion is merely that the <i>very few</i> verifiable people on this list can be categorized as such. Unless and until the content policy issues are addressed, these articles simply cannot exist. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:44, 19 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, I am not arguing against cleanup either. I'm arguing against deletion. I don't see how <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> applies to this list at all. From that page, original research is any of the following:
<ul>
<li>It introduces a theory or method of solution;</li>
<li>It introduces original ideas;</li>
<li>It defines new terms;</li>
<li>It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms;</li>
<li>It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position;</li>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>
<li>It <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_neologisms_5320.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid neologisms">introduces or uses neologisms</a>, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As for verifiability, history books are awash with the names of generals, etc. <a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> probably has a list by rank of every soldier who fought for Japan. If there is a questionable name on the list, then tag it with {{cite}}; there's no need to delete the entire list. The higher the inclusion bar is set, the more sources are likely to be found. That's why I agree with a couple of others above who recommend deleting names from the lower echelons of the lists. <a href="../../../n/e/i/User%7ENeier_2b13.html" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> 13:01, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires those wishing to keep the article to provide the verification (please refer to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="WP:V">"Burden of evidence"</a> in that policy). The article provides no verification or reliable source. As for tagging with {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_7db3.html" title="Template:Cite">cite</a>}}, it was simply more efficient to tag the whole article with {{<a href="../../../v/e/r/Template%7EVerify_1f97.html" title="Template:Verify">verify</a>}}, a template that has been there since August 15. In fact, the better alternative is to delete every unverified name from the list (again, see "Burden of evidence"). As for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, as far as I can see from the lists, they appear to be unpublished data or a sythesis of information from unverified, uncited sources. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:47, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The list was created just for the sake of having such a list, the list is a violation of Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, the content is unverifiable, the list is unlimited and/or unmaintainable, the list has no content beyond links to other articles, so would be better implemented as a (self-maintaining) category, and the list is unencyclopaedic, i.e. it would not be expected to be included in an encyclopaedia. This statement concerns me: "<a href="../../../y/a/s/Yasukuni_Shrine_834e.html" title="Yasukuni Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> probably has a list by rank of every soldier who fought for Japan." It seems very much like an advocation for a data dump. This type of thing would be great for Wikisource or Wikibooks, but not for Wikipedia. To quote the founder "An encyclopedia is not a data dump. It serves to give readers a quick essential summary of what they want and need to know. In order to do this effectively, we must exercise careful and thoughtful editorial judgment, and one part of editorial judgment is an understanding that treating irrelevant data as on equal footing with the essentials, is confusing and a disservice to the reader.--Jimbo Wales 16:32, 16 October 2006 (UTC) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Havok&amp;oldid=81810155" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Havok&amp;oldid=81810155" rel="nofollow">link</a>" While the original argument was about notability, I believe his argument applies to this case as well. Certainly creating an article or mentioning the name EVERY Japanese military officer from WWII is counter to Wikipedia's notability goals. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 02:24, 23 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

They understandably won't have been familiar with Wikipedia's notability standards, and while that doesn't mean we have to keep non-notable articles, it does mean that comments like "I can't believe this!" could please be phrased differently.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, let's break down <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and see if this website and article meet the critria.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>From <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>-</dd>
<dd><i>Web-specific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria</i>:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>1)The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Nothing sourced in the article. Non-Trivial works are like articles which report on only the site. Trivial works are 'in-passing' mentions, or mentions where another website shares the news article or a group of pages share an article.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd><i>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper and magazine articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, nothing cited to prove this is true.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>except for the following</i>:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site.</i></dd>
<dd><i>Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the internet address, the times at which such content is updated or made available, a brief summary of the nature of the content or the publication of internet addresses and site or content descriptions in internet directories or online stores.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>2)The website or content has won a notable independent award from either a publication or organization.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Nothing I can find with a search</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>3)The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Obviously this site does not meet this critieria</p>
<dl>
<dd><i>The article itself must provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section. Even if an entire website meets the notability criteria, its components (forums, articles, sections) are not necessarily notable and deserving of their own separate article.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>And no, the article does not provide proof of this.</p>
<p>A user above posted "<i>this website has been visited by <a href="../../../a/y/u/Ayumi_Hamasaki_2a42.html" title="Ayumi Hamasaki">Ayumi_Hamasaki</a>. in a show ayumi said it was the most visited site of hers of all time.</i>" First, what show? When did it air? What channel? Next, even if that was answered, it wouldn't matter. Just because someone famous says they visit the site (in an interview via newspaper, magazine, online, radio, or TV) it doesn't matter.

<li><b>Keep</b> Claims "Elfwood is the largest science fiction and fantasy art site in the world" which would make for a notability argument. This is not OR, but autobiographical statement.

I'd say any site that makes it into a top list of sites on the internet is a keeper. And frankly see for yourself is NOT original research.

<dd>I disagree with "see for yourself" not being OR. It requires a user to make a subjective interpretation about the significance of a site. The claim that it is "the largest science fiction and fantasy art site in the world" is also a claim that needs to be sourced (that's not a trivial assertion). <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 05:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, it is sourced. To them. Was what I said not clear to you? That's what I meant by autobiographical statement. Besides, looking at a subject is important in making a determination about an article. That's not OR, that's called being informed. If you reject the idea of doing your own examination to see what there is to know about a given subject because it's original research, then I'd say we've got an entirely different concept as to what things mean. Now certainly, a simple google search won't reveal the good sources from the bad, that requires some real effort, but as the link above shows, they can be found. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:17, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The site's size, user-base, community and vast collection of user-created content means it is very well known and it's an excellent example of what the online fantasy community get up to. I would say it's similar in many ways to deviantART, which we certainly don't seem to have an issue with writing an article about. I would be confused if Wikipedia represented deviantART but not Elfwood, even if the latter is obviously not as large or as all-encompassing as the former.--<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStoneColdCrazy_f1f7.html" title="User:StoneColdCrazy">StoneColdCrazy</a> 18:48, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It has. However, if the site is popular enough, it's the duty of people who know anything about the site to research sources and write about it. If people say "This site is more popular than that famous religious figure, why don't you have an article about it?" and we say "We don't have an article about it because we don't trust anyone but honest people, plain and simple", we're on dangerous waters. When people think of "No information is preferred over unsourced information", they regrettably think of the Nuke instead of Getting Rid of the Dubious Stuff. Verifiability is <i>not</i> a deletion reason in case of deviantART; at worst, it'd be time to trim away anything that's completely unattributable. Stub about a famous website is better than no article at all. Likewise here. Why is it that people really don't seem to want unsourced material to live in the article history? In closing, AfD is not Cleanup and in 90% of cases, lack of sources is a cleanup issue, not a deletion reason. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 22:48, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> The publicity section of the article is a claim to notability. If the creator of the longest running animated series in television history says you're a better continuity resource than his own writers, well... And, we don't really expect other web-sites to maintain Wikipedia's copyvio policy. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 19:43, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> snpp.com is one of the oldest still-operational sites on the Web. While it's true that the <i>article</i>, in its current state, does not correctly provide references to demonstrate that the Archive meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the Web site itself clearly is more than notable enough. I would prefer to see this article be tagged as needing work on references. Deleting it, given the notoriety of the site, seems absurd IMHO. <a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESeventypercent_9424.html" title="User:Seventypercent">Seventypercent</a> 20:22, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> SNPP+"The Simpsons Archive" gets over 20,000 Google hits, and over 500 of the first 1,000 are unique. The BBC lists it as <i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/links.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/links.shtml" rel="nofollow">the</a></i> unofficial Simpsons web site. Of the 44,600,000 Google hits when simply searching "Simpsons", snpp.com is third, only following the official sites of the film and the TV show. Smaller claims of notability: <a href="http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/popculture.htm" class="external text" title="http://publish.uwo.ca/~dmann/popculture.htm" rel="nofollow">This college course</a> apparently uses SNPP as a source (sidebar: I want to take this class!).

<blockquote>
<p>The ten recipients were selected from among more than 200 nominees by the MATC Award Committee, which included Berners‐Lee, Mitchell Baker (CEO, Mozilla Corporation), John Seely Brown former Chief Scientist, Xerox Corp.), Vinton G. Cerf (Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google, Inc.), John Gage (Chief Researcher and Director of the Science Office, Sun Microsystems, Inc.), and Tim O’Reilly (Founder and CEO, O’Reilly Media).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>$50,000 to the Plymouth State University (Plymouth, NH, www.plymouth.edu), for the development of the WPOPAC online public access catalog (<a href="http://wpopac.blogs.plymouth.edu" class="external free" title="http://wpopac.blogs.plymouth.edu" rel="nofollow">http://wpopac.blogs.plymouth.edu</a>). Plymouth State University was recognized for its development of WPOPAC, an innovative online public access catalog system that allows any library to make its online catalog interactive, by turning each library record (e.g., each book or serial) into a blog page onto which users can post their own comments and content. The Committee noted WPOPAC’s ability to enable online library access in libraries of any size, as well as the project’s potential to engage patrons more deeply and interactively with libraries and their offerings. Plymouth State plans to use the award to purchase catalog content from the Library of Congress and make it freely available to all, thereby eliminating a substantial cost barrier to the online publication of catalogs by small libraries.</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> WPOPAC has been gaining momentum in the library community and has generated much conversation since the Mellon Award announcement. It is poised to become a player in the world of online access provision. Possible facilitating libraries' presence in the social web - libraries have long been stewards of social capital and, so far, have lacked the tools to participate in this forum. WPOpac could help that. Let's give it a chance! <small>— 71.233.252.61 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.233.252.61_3176.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.233.252.61">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>If Wikipedia is to include pages about soap opera characters, then I would say that this page needs to stay. Although the character appears in only a limited number of episodes, she is important to understanding Stephanie Forrester, one of the central characters of the soap.

<p>This is a bizarrely titled mini POV fork of <a href="../../../f/r/e/French_fried_potatoes.html" title="French fried potatoes">French fried potatoes</a>. Everything is copied from there, and then slightly rewritten to put all the emphasis on Chips instead of French fries, going as far as removing all the history except for the British part. Many other sections are remomved, no info is added, so there is nothing to merge, the name is not a likely search term, and the page seems to have no purpose but to replace "French Fries" with Chips (see e.g. the related changes to the disambiguation page <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chips.html" title="Chips">Chips</a> by an IP address <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chips&amp;diff=95127323&amp;oldid=94499652" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chips&amp;diff=95127323&amp;oldid=94499652" rel="nofollow">[76]</a>.

<p>The secretary of a charitable not-for-profit company, who once self-published his own non-notable book. Of course, expect a wave of 'keep' votes as this is the exec secretary of the Wikimedia Foundation! If Moeller were on the board of trustees of any other NPC, the article would have been deleted within five minutes of creation. We should be striving to <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoid self reference</a>, not ignore our own policy because the NPC this guy is secretary for happens to be the one that is behind Wikipedia. If anything, we should have higher standards. Please, look beyond the fact that this man is an editor of Wikipedia, and consider that whether or not you believe the assertions of notability - secretary for a charitable not-for-profit company, and a book that appears nowhere except for buried in a website for the German National Library (not bookstores, <s>not amazon</s>, nothing). <small>note, it's on amazon.de</small> The article has been deleted in a previously AFD found <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Erik_Moeller_207a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erik Moeller">here</a>, but was recreated after Moeller attained the secretary post, and despite being tempted (as it's not significantly different from before) to delete it under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a>, I brought it here instead.

<li>Although my feelings here are quite mixed, I think it ought to observed (which observation Bramlet himself probably makes) that the proposition of Proto that <i>this article would exist if Moeller were secretary of any group other than Wikipedia</i> and that of Bramlet that <i>any secretary of a similarly significant NPC should be kept as well</i> need not to be understood as contradistinct; it is quite possible that the Möller article exists principally because of our knowledge of and familiarity with him but that an article about any similarly-situated secretary/board member ought to exist as well. I wonder whether it might be useful to remember the oft-repeated injunction of <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> that the absence of articles apropos of a given topic ought not to be construed as evidence of the non-notability of such topic (I recognize, though, that Proto doesn't make such argument here, but others may). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:51, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The Executive Secretary role is largely irrelevant in practice; it's the Board member role which I spend most of my volunteer time on. By now we have 7 Board members and we'll probably have 9 soon, so being a Board member of the Wikimedia Foundation is no longer as significant as it used to be e.g. when Angela and Florence were elected to the Board.

<dd>Nope, the criteria requires coverage <i>about</i> the subject for a reason. The article is supposed to be about the subject, and coverage about the subject lets us write an article about them. (I'm sure this is discussed somewhere in the archived history of WP:BIO's talk pages, but WP:BIO was established before I became an editor. It is also visible in essays like Uncle G's one on notability and <a href="../../../i/n/d/WP%7EINDY_f555.html" title="WP:INDY">WP:INDY</a>.) A publication where they are a source lets write an article about whatever they are talking about, assuming that they are a decent source.

It now seems Mr. Thanabalan is a real journalist, and since it is quite likely the fake references attributed to him were added by a misguided fan (as opposed to him personally), we should be careful in not accusing him of anything unethical.

This "theory" is one of his most popular, especially among the type of people who are into <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012.html" title="2012">2012</a> crap (which is a significant number of people). The article does not endorse the theory and efforts have been made to treat it in an NPOV manner. A good argument could perhaps be made to MERGE the article, but a deletion is completely basless (keep in mind, this is coming from someone who thinks Terence Mckenna is full of crap...see the discussion page for the article to see my efforts to make sure it hasn't been treated to lauditorily.) Gene Ray I don't think even has a published book. Lots of people, read Terence Mckenna and take him seriously--albeit few scientists. Before you nominate a article for deletion do a little research to make sure it really is <i>not</i> notable. Terence Mckenna is inarguably influential in certain circles.

<dd>The popularity of McKenna's writings is documented. His books are sold in Borders, and lots of other places. Plenty of independent sources make mention of him (often to say he's wrong, but that's fine, too). That's all why <i>he</i> has an article, and why it is not up at AFD (as an aside: it needs some work, though!). None of that means that any given idea of his meets the standards for its own article unless independent, reliable sources have addressed the idea. Without anything <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>, there's nothing we can even merge, although a redirect should remain due to the value as a search term on the topic. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 05:31, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Certainly not science, but interesting and notable as a product of its time and as the work of a fascinating individual whose books are still in print. Wikipedia is not an encylopedia of science, it is a general purpose-encyclopedia, and should default to inclusion rather than exclusion. The article itself seems balanced, and does not present the "theory" as fact. To disagree or disapprove is fine; that's what discussion pages are for. To remove it is completely unnecessary. If for no other reason, the article should be retained for historical and literary reasons. -- <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveSeidel_45ec.html" title="User:DaveSeidel">DaveSeidel</a> 12:37, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There's enough noteriety/interest to make it a reasonable point for look-up. Voideater 20:28, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Sure this "theory" is unscientific by its very nature, which is an attempt to quantify the ratio between that which conforms to the scientific universe versus that which is outside of (or in paradoxical relationship to) science. I think some confusion arises because of the scientific-sounding presentation of the theory itself. If Wikipedia was a purely scientific or mathematical journal, then any accompanying social phenomenon would be irrelevant and the unverifiable and unscientific basis of novelty theory would warrant deletion. In my opinion though, what's important about the theory is that it exists, it has a following, and it's a significant part of a much larger social phenomenon around the belief in a major approaching event in 2012. You don't have to subscribe to these ideas to acknowledge that there is a social movement that does. As such, I find it very interesting, and I'm glad you didn't delete this article before I found it. Also, I just looked and there are articles about both warp drive and the christian rapture, both of which are spoken of by their respective followers as if they were scientifically and literally true, and neither of which would withstand scientific peer review.

<li>My problem is not that it isn't <i>science</i> (unquestionably true, but a great many things aren't science). My problem is that there is no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> of the topic from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, and I was unable to locate any in a reasonable effort. As it stands, the article does not show that anyone independant has written about the topic. Perhaps we should merge to its creator's article instead? <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 13:55, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You know what Mr. Choice, you do have a good point. I found the article because I was searching on the general topic. I had not heard of either the theory or the author when I started, and I would have been just as happy to have found the two in a single place under the author's name.Walksintwoworlds 19:51, 25 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The fact is that Novelty Theory is an idea by a popular philosopher. As such it deserves at least some mention on Wikipedia. If nonsense weren't allowed on Wikipedia, what would happen to all the articles about religion? I have to agree with <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveSeidel_45ec.html" title="User:DaveSeidel">DaveSeidel</a>; it should at least be included for historical purposes. Judging an article (and by extension, a particular idea) to be irrelevant just because you don't agree with it is nonsense. --<a href="../../../k/o/o/User%7EKooky_7c52.html" title="User:Kooky">Kooky</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/o/User_talk%7EKooky_6ca9.html" title="User talk:Kooky">talk</a>) 03:43, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Novelty Theory is not specific to Terrence McKenna, Timewave Zero is. Robert Anton Wilson, author of 26 books, has what he calls The Jumping Jesus Phenomenon which is also a theory of novelty, and he never mentions Terrence Mckenna throughout his entire hour and a half long explanation of his theory even though they are very similar in aspect. I think that not only is novelty theory psudoscience but fringe psudoscience and so the availability of information on it is scarce. That being so, actually making an all inclusive page on it would be difficult but should be attempted. I have a recording of the Seminar that Robert Anton Wilson gave on his novelty theory, and will use that as a basis to form a section on that. If at least 2, possibly 3 separate but similar novelty theories can be accounted for and referenced The title of the article and basic overview should be changed, and separate sections for each persons theory should be formed.</li>

Also Wilson mentions novelty theory in his book, "Prometheus Rising".WombatOnslaught

<li>Pare down and <b>merge</b> as above. Non-notable people dying in a fundamentally non-notable way does not make them notable. Wikipedia is not a memorial.

<li>SAVE save svae!!! I DO have death certificates for some of them and Obits for the others. The important thing about them dying of Lyme disease is how many *different* wAYS they died yet all died of Lyme disease- the way they died IS NOTABLE- because they died in SO MANY different WAYS!!!! From the ALS presentation- from the MS presentation- from anoxic encephalopathy to the dilated cardiomyopathy presentation- from the sudden heart attack presentation- from the suicidal presentation- from the lupus presentation- from the Alzheimer's presentation- from the ARDS presentation-&#160;!!!!!!! It is a beautiful example of infectious disease!!! That is the point- it is why there are all the autopsy reports included! It puts forth the myriad presentations in SUCH an illustrative way-- Sarah aka CaliforniaLyme

<dd>OK, looking into this I can see why you might have an argument that he is notable as a result of his 'customer base' in South East Asia. You need to source it in the article - I shouldn't have to do your sourcing for you by Googling its subject.

<li><b>Keep</b> Roger Israni is popular in Houston. He is responsible for more perfect SAT scores from students than any other instructor. He was recognized by Mayor Lee Brown of Houston in front of the Houston City Council for this acheivement. He has been interviewed on ch. 11 in Houston (KHOU) and NPR.

<p>I nominate this article for deletion on the grounds of a lack of <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a>. I tried to look up some sources for it on the Internet, but the <i>only</i> sources I found are on Wikipedia, or on mirror sites of Wikipedia, with only one (which is a blog) that wasn't related to Wikipedia. I know that a person on the article's talk page said that the story came from a 1980 magazine, but this search leads me to suspect that this topic has very little, if any, significance in the field of paradoxes (so little <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the <a href="../../../b/a/l/Balls_and_vase_problem.html" title="Balls and vase problem">Balls and vase problem</a> article appears to be a more well-known variant of this infinity paradox. It deals with the same topics: a specific number of numbered objects put in one place, then one taken out, over an infinite amount of time, and the question on how many of these objects would be left in that place after infinity. A Google search on the vase or urn problem turns up much more results and verifiable (aka professional) sources than the bank and mermaid problem does, so I believe that this article covers everything the bank and mermaid article says, in a more familiar context.</p>

<li><i>Comment</i> - It appears that Bank and mermaid and Monty Hell problem both have <i>no</i> sources other than newsgroup postings.

<p><b>Speedy delete</b> - ordinarily I would tag this for speedy delete as spam, but there is a twist to this case. Before this article was hijacked, it was a redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/e/Oregon_Vortex_cb5f.html" title="Oregon Vortex">Oregon Vortex</a> because of a paragraph added to the end about a <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_%26_Max_Hit_the_Road_e5b3.html" title="Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road">Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road</a> game feature.

<p>Totally not notable. A conference/convention with 1900 participants? That happens every weekend in several major hotels in any major city. Also, unsourced except an external link to it's own advertising page.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Quite notable within the genre - the second largest of its kind, in fact, second only to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthrocon.html" title="Anthrocon">Anthrocon</a>. Compare <a href="../../../b/a/y/BayCon_397e.html" title="BayCon">BayCon</a>, a "large" science fiction convention at "two thousand attendees", for example. I can't find any reliable statistics for <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philcon.html" title="Philcon">Philcon</a> - one of the oldest SF conventions, having been established in the 1930s (!) - but <a href="http://fanac.org/Other_Cons/PhilCon/q03-rpt.html" class="external text" title="http://fanac.org/Other_Cons/PhilCon/q03-rpt.html" rel="nofollow">one source</a> says it was somewhere around 800-1200 in 2003. I don't know what you're comparing against, but whatever it is, it's probably an excessive standard.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is not up to standards, but that's not what AFD is for. Significant, long-running genre conventions are typically considered to meet WP standards.

<li>It's worth keeping in mind that the convention doesn't go looking for news coverage - unlike most professional conventions, media representatives are not generally welcome. (Attendees were highly incensed about the 2005 article, which they viewed as an intrusion.) The fact that it's been covered at all says something. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 21:13, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> and Improve. Notable as second largest furry convention in existence. Sci-fi conventions with less attendance have articles, so there's no reason to single this out just because it's a furry convention. At least three news articles exist that reference it.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is one of the largest and longest-running conventions in <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>.

<li><b>Merge.</b> While a generic con of 2,000 people has arguable notability this one is notable because of its nature. People and the meida are quite interested in the "furry lifestyle" and this is the second largest gathering of those folks. I'd say this is worth mention but I was thinking of merging this, along with the other furcon artilces, into the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_convention.html" title="Furry convention">Furry convention</a> article because they are only notable within the context of the furry lifestyle and most of these articles (this one included) don't have enough independant sourcing and content to really make quality articles. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 18:12, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article does not assert the notability of the film. It looks as though it has been written with the intention of promoting the film. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChovain_e53a.html" title="User:Chovain">Chovain</a> 00:55, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> "It caused uproar when it was released as the world was not ready for it. Many felt trapped by its awesomeness and others ran towards it like moths to the flame." Riiight. Let me guess: another group of kids with a digital camera and a Youtube account. Also consider Have a Balloon (film). <a href="../../../w/a/v/User%7EWavy_G_9d03.html" title="User:Wavy G">Wavy G</a> 03:08, 19 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, noting edit conflict. Major COI for an obscure film that does nothing more than self-describe its "awesomness" as its assertion of notability. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 03:11, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as insufficiently notable; no coverage whatsoever by reliable, third-party sources. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 05:34, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
