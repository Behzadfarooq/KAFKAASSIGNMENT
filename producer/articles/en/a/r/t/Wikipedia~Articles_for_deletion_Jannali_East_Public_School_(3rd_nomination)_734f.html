<p>School with no assertion of notability and insufficient independent reliable sources. (I'm uncertain whether a private member statement by a legislator qualifies, but I'm willing to accept it -- it's still only one source, though.)

Its <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jannali_East_Public_School_40b6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jannali East Public School">first VfD</a> was a year and a half before that.

<li><small><b>Note</b>: This debate has been included in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Deletion_sorting_Australia_fc25.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Australia">list of Australia-related deletions</a>.</small> <small>-- <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 21:20, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - yet again, this is being used as a substitute for <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_expansion_6da0.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for expansion">Wikipedia:Requests for expansion</a> and there is no valid rationale for deletion. There have already been two AfDs on this article, one very recently, and I'm tired of articles being renominated just because it's to a particular user's fancy to delete a certain type of article this week, or because they can't be bothered doing some research and improving the article themselves, or because they disagree with the previous outcomes, so they just keep nominating the article until it goes their way. That's not the way to do things on Wikipedia. There are plenty of other tags to cover those sorts of situations, so why aren't they being used? As I said in the last AfD, there are some significant articles on a newspaper database that I found about the school, such as it being caught up in an education funding dispute in the early 2000s under Bob Carr's Government, but no one seems to take any notice of that - everyone uses the Google search and that's it. There are plenty of print articles - why doesn't anyone look for them? It's because people can't be bothered doing any work - it takes far longer to write an article than to delete it, but the deletionists get impatient and say that if we can't get a good enough article in three or so weeks, then it should go - too bad for anyone who's done any significant work on the article. And to be honest, although I would have liked to improve the article, I haven't had time, so I'm annoyed that yet again, rather than anyone doing some work on the article, it just gets nominated for deletion because no one understands that people need time to improve articles. And while the nominator claims that he tried a merge tag, in truth he suggested that we merge the article to the local school district, and if he had read my edit summary when I got rid of that suggestion, he would know that I got rid of the merge tag as Australia does NOT have school districts, and so it's impossible to merge the article to such a thing. I have a compromise though - I'm prepared to merge this to the local suburb article (<a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a>) (which is a sensible and realistic merge proposal, as opposed to the last one). Let's stop this silly and ridiculous debate, and I'll put in the references needed to make the section of the Jannali East article on the school a good one. Alright? <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 21:56, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>As Shimeru stated in the nom, many of the keep&#160;!votes in the AfD seven weeks ago were solely based on the nominator being an spa. Without those&#160;!votes, there was much more of a consensus. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:07, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The tag says "school district or locality," but I can see how that might be missed. I'm willing to <b>withdraw</b> the nomination in favor of a merge/redirect (or expansion from reliable sources, if you have the time now to do that). I don't particularly care whether we do or don't have an article on the school -- only that, <i>if</i> we do, it's one that shows why the school is notable, with reference to multiple independent sources, like we'd expect of practically any other article. This one was first written in May 2005 -- that's a bit more than three weeks to wait for sourcing. But a merge is a good compromise until a sourced article can be written, and that approach seems to be building consensus. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShimeru_e0c5.html" title="User:Shimeru">Shimeru</a> 22:58, 26 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - ok, considering I have a few sources on the school from newspapers and the like, though not enough at present to support an independent article, let's merge this to <a href="../../../j/a/n/Jannali%2C_New_South_Wales_f5a9.html" title="Jannali, New South Wales">Jannali, New South Wales</a> and keep everyone happy. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 02:28, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The likelihood of this becoming a significant article is pretty small, considering the school has 175 students. The article in its present state makes no assertion of notability, and frankly, I can't see how it ever will. The fact that it is a school does not make it instantly notable. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairman_S._cc1b.html" title="User:Chairman S.">Chairman S.</a> <span style="font-size:75%"><a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairman_S._c158.html" title="User talk:Chairman S."><font color="#E32636">Talk</font></a> <font color="#177245"><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chairman_S._1280.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chairman S.">Contribs</a></sup></font></span> 23:11, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If a school article is not strong in the beginning, chances are good it will never improve.

<ul>
<li>When an article is kept in part because people hoped that it might improve, that presupposes that the article can be renominated if it does not improve. When an article is kept in part because of defects in the nomination, that should be no barrier to a proper nomination. In theory, the closing admin should ignore <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> keep votes, but sometimes they don't, and those decisions should not be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decisions_c105.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decisions">binding</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 12:21, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
