The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. The numerous anonymous "keep" votes were discounted, as their veracity was not nearly as impressive as their sheer numbers. <a href="../../../j/o/y/User%7EJoy_Stovall_1ade.html" title="User:Joy Stovall">Joyous</a> 22:56, Jan 22, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Asside from being difficult to read, which I've done my best to improve during wikification (see the page history), and is not a reason to delete, it feels like a vanity page to me (which is a reason to delete). <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 15:02, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> the part about "International Society for Molecular and Cell Biology Protocols and Reasearchers, Inc" certainly sounds impressive until one realises that it's on a Geocities page. Org likely to be imaginary or very small, and even if beyond all likelihood the org is notable, that doesn't necessarily make its president notable too. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 16:50, Jan 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am not making any judgments. I have simply stated facts and that I have a suspicion. My username is <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">User:Thryduulf</a>, my real name is Chris McKenna. I am not the subject of any wikipedia article under either realname or username (at least, I wasn't when I checked a few days ago, and I'd be amazed if anyone had created one since then). I make no claims as to my notabilty or otherwise. I am not an administrator on this site, and so do not have the power to make any decisions about this article. Like all users I do have the power to state facts and my opinions to assist the administrators. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:47, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> I remembered in one of his articles he stated that "two insane could establish a culture of their own."-- something like that.. it is about an insane mother who reared her child and until now they have their own set of "insane" cultures. It is exciting to learn something new about behavior. It really help us.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> In addition, he stated the "impermanence of sexual phenotypes" because of the "environment". Environment is of two types there... In other words there is no such thing as a real "he" or "she". Environment oh environment. So to look at it closely, culture has a role, etc etc (whatever environments .. could be placental) in life to shoot to that type of sexual orientation. He also stated (in his web) about the compromising brain which could direct to the type of sexual orientation ( as an example--- it is my example) as what the case is. Compromising brain could have a therapeutic role then.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Yes, It was just one line(in his personal web) but it gives a lot of lessons... He meant, when he discussed it "Your Genes are Your genes and That is What you are Forever" Which means that changing a part of our bio system-- nose, eye lens, bust etc. means continous maintenance because it is not a part of our genetic system. Thats a problem with people from less developed countries who went to the usa to have a part of their bio-system changed ... they needed to go back to the usa for maintenance , check or change for new. Our own genes could not repair that new material added.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> By the way, I would suggest that individuals who would like to read his overpowering articles must have enormous background in molecular and cell biology for great understanding. Thumbs up for him and his articles!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Whatever material whether cheap or expensive as long as you know the "central dogma" , you will later realize the importance of this article. The above users who commented look only at the "COVER" of the "Books" not the content. And if they look at the content, they thought its a comic book because they can't integrate it molecularly and cellularly in their brains!! POOR GUYS! Better brush up. Enrol at Harvard!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> he has done something in the world in establishing a society. That's good work!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> It's the golden rule: Don't do it to others if you don't want others to do it unto you. I like his articles and his numerous scientific talents.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> I find him intellectually enchanting!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Great!!!</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Though the users (i see a lot of them) are anon deep in their hearts they really mean it. But I want to have a user numerics, pls Thryd give me one. I find something new in the understanding of my life by reading his articles. He also have some publications on lichens (Biologybrowser). He seems to have just so many. Thryd assign the above anon with user numbers, they must be treated as living individuals.</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> If Some Science has to change completely or be modified, He is the FIRST to do it. Look for literatures if there are more basic ones than what he has written.</li>
