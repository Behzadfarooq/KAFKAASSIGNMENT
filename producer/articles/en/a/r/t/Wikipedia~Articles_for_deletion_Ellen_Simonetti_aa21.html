<p>Though a short article may be appropriate, all the tiny bits of information eagerly and meticulously collected by some very focussed fellow wikipedians do not meet the relevant content criteria and in parts violate the subject's privacy, so a discussion regarding <i>fairness of tone</i> or <i>npov</i> is not even requirred – it would strongly be, though, if this article wasn't deleted. -- <a href="../../../n/y/x/User%7ENyxNyx_7cba.html" title="User:NyxNyx">NyxNyx</a> <b>⌘</b> 23:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>COMMENT</b> There clearly should be a Wikipedia article for Ellen Simonetti - her experience has highlighted important issues regarding blogging and employment. The article as it stands now (3/7/07) is just fairly pathetic, however - some seem to have launched a hatchet job on Ms. Simonetti. I suggest distilling the article down to the basic facts and then perhaps write protecting the article for a time until things settle down. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.41.39.124 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.41.39.124.html" title="User talk:24.41.39.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.41.39.124_4327.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.41.39.124">contribs</a>) 13:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC-8)</small></p>

<p>It appears that the subject's problem with the article (which she submitted herself, originally), is that it does not continue to be employed as personal puff piece and mechanism for conducting online sales of the subject's books and other ebay sales. The current form of the article (5 Mar 07, 17:41 GMT) is both factual and relevant. -Not Dilbert</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note from user chulcoop - soory dont konw how to do this any other way to add to the debate.<br />
Nearly all references are to comments made on Ellen Simonetti (aka) Queen of Sky's OWN BLOG.<br />
As she herself put them there then "privacy" issues do not apply<br />
Ellen is an internationally famous fired flight attendedant, her story was shown worldwide.<br />
The first reference was to a BBC News story on her suspension and then her firing.<br />
The first Entry for this item was by the woman Queen Of Sky herself.<br />
On the Shilpa Shetty entry it talks about mafia links, extortion and other things.<br />
If there are specific sources you dont agree with then make that argument.<br />
Is th BBC not a good source, Her own web journal?<br />
Indeed on the BBC site it links to her journal.<br />
I feel this is censorship by fans of hers and it must be stopped.<br />
Keep the page. Check out the references. Read her Blog.<br />
Also if you check out <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm</a><br />
then on this bbc website it links to her blog (Queen of The Sky but she calls it queen of sky) mentions her name Ellen Simoetti<br />
There is a BBC source what more do you want? Additional by ch: also if you do a google search <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti</a> then you will find lots of news articles about her case. She has also appeared on Elder,Montel and Talkradio and given lots of TV appearances. Some of these, including Montel and Talkradio can be found on her blog at <a href="http://queenofsky.net" class="external free" title="http://queenofsky.net" rel="nofollow">http://queenofsky.net</a> (also the same as <a href="http://queenofsky.journalspace.com" class="external free" title="http://queenofsky.journalspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://queenofsky.journalspace.com</a>) On her blog she has even set up an email address she has asked the media to write to if they want to "book" her. As stated if you scrap this entry for puttin unwanted truths in you must also scrap the shilpa shetty article for stories about racism, shilpa poppadom, shilpa fuckawala [sic], an apparent indecency complaint and other things. If you dont you are a hypocrite. I have provided sources for all things stated. The SWDYM site i have also linked to the Terms and Conditions on their website. What more do you want? QofS has gone out of her way to promote herself in the media,in fact she wants as much media work as she can get. So why should you censor a Public Figure? Also she has written a hardback novel which is on amazon about her firing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1</a><br />

<p>reply by chulcoop. I am new to wikipedia so hope you will be understanding in this.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty</a></p>
<p>Please, just do it. If you think the contenet there is relevant then why is mine not? I talks about exact words said during a british TV show and as i said talks about popadoms and someone being called a "cunt". Check out the entry for yourself.</p>
<p>If you dont want to then why not? Why do you only want to police Ellen Simonetti, who is afterall just a fired flight attendant rather than allegations about the former British Miss England, an Indian film actress and a pop singer in the UK?</p>
<p>In the latter, the British Prime Minister was involoved, the Indian Government were involved, the British Chancellor was involved, the Indian Film company was involved, an efigy was burned in India.</p>
<p>Allow the good and the bad. It is a topic ABOUT someone based on articles THE SUBJECT has written.</p>
<p>Why do you care? If it is true what is the problem?</p>
<p>Ellen aka QofS was in worldwide news about 2 to 3 years ago. She did lots of interviews. If you check out her website and look at the "famous fired pics" you may even remember the story.</p>
<p>If anything i did was infactual fine.</p>
<p>But dont allow the Shilpa Shetty entry to remain intact while moaning about this one.</p>

<p>COMMENT</p>
<p>chulcoop's words above reveal his/her true intention: to assault and harras rather than inform. For example, chulcoop purposefully distorts the content found on the referenced advertiser. In truth, the site is an adult matchmaking site that allows adult content to be posted within a user's profile. By claiming it is a hardcore "porn" site chulcoop is distoring reality at the expense of Wikipedia's credibility.</p>
<p>The entry at hand should be rolled back to its most nuetral entry. chulcoop is free to continue seeking his/her agenda elsewhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.83.176.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.83.176.54_b484.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.83.176.54">contribs</a>) 06:24, 5 March 2007 (UTC-8)</small></p>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Strong Delete</b> She does seem just about notable, although it is very marginal, but starting your own article is a no-no and if we don't follow this there will be a free-for-all.

<dd>No, a public person generally cannot make a page about themselves. If you "broke" the "story" about the website, and you are currently battling with her, then you too are have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> and should not be editing the page. As it is, you are subverting Wikipedia for your own petty squabbles. If you "broke" the "porn" scoop, then you are aperforming <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> which also not allowed. We absolutely positively cannot take your word for any of these statements, and we have no reliable proof that a single thing you have said is true. As it stands, the only thing we can ascertain at this point is that you are here clearly pushing a very baised agenda. Please stop, and take your dispute elsewhere. There are plenty of websites that offer free blogs and hosting where you can post any fact or rumor that you dare. I remain convinced that this is a notable subject, but I'm not going to cry if it gets deleted. I do recommend that the closing admin consider <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salting</a> as well, as Chulchoop has already stated that he is willing to re-create the article again with sockpuppets if he has to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEllen_Simonetti&amp;diff=112682914&amp;oldid=112681522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEllen_Simonetti&amp;diff=112682914&amp;oldid=112681522" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>comment by chulcoop</p>
<p>the entry Heather Armstrong</p>
<p>is also just an article about a famous fired blogger.</p>
<p>If her page can exist why not this one?</p>
<p>There must be consistency on Wikipedia and peeps need to know the truth.</p>
<p>COMMENT While each entry must stand on its own merits, the Heather Armstrog entry is distinquishable from the Ellen Simonetti entry as the Armstrong entry is not repleat with harrassing edits from an unethical, self-serviing maniac who has no regard for the Wikipedia rules. Here, the Siminetti entry would be fine if it was limited to a nuetral presentation of relevant facts. Unfortunately, the barely literate chulcoop insists on inserting drivel, minutia and distortions. 68.245.197.0 03:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>note from chulcoop</p>
<p>OK then. It is all tidied up now I think. Someone can possibly improve on the spelling and Grammar.</p>
<p>Her entry is now similar to that of Heather Armstrong.</p>
<p>Shame you guys dont like having facts when the Shilpa Shetty entry alleges links to the mafia and other stuff.</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference? Why has that entry not marked for deletion? It talks about "cunts" and "fukawalas" and other things.</p>
<p>Please explain the discrepency.</p>
<p>Is it cos one is indian and the other is a yankee?</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - thank you - the article is much better now. There is still some cleanup to be had, but we can take care of that with tags. Everybody who&#160;!voted delete, please review and reconsider your vote on the cleaned up and netural article with regards to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Chulcoop - please note the extensive list of references at the bottom of the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilpa_Shetty_564b.html" title="Shilpa Shetty">Shilpa Shetty</a> article - most references are to a mainstream news site in India and the UK, and every single one is to a website with some sort of editorial oversight. This is different then a personal blog where an individual may post anything they wish, true or false, without any sort of editorial control. Just because something gets posted on a blog, does not mean it is true.

<p>note from chulcoop</p>
<p>Wik rules state however that a subjects own blog CAN BE USED AS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THE SUBJECT.</p>
<p>I was trying to point out things that Subject had said on their blog with the source being the Subjects blogs.</p>
<p>Blogs are not generally considered reliable souces but if it is the Subjects Own Blog then this is different.</p>
<p>Somewhere on here of discussion i provided a wik link to prove this.</p>
<p>But ive had enough.</p>
<p>You can read about "Wogs" on a terry wogan entry and as i said on the shilpa entry.</p>
<p>All i was doing was stating fact as sourced on the subjects own blog.</p>
<p>I think you need to understand the difference between general blogs and a subject's official blog.</p>
<p>Wik rules state that subjects own blog should override any other evidence unless the latter is clearly over self promotion.</p>
<p>DOnt blame me thats what wik rules state.</p>
<p>I wanted to try and provide a balanced view esp as i read about fukawalas popadoms and cunts on Shilpa Shetty.</p>
<p>maybe different editors have differing views of what should be on here.</p>
<p>Some are more traditionalist and think this should be like the enc britanica others think more modern and honest sourced comments and minutae for example cunts and shilpa derupa is acceptble.</p>

<p>It seems some actually prefer the "contraversial" version so i have done a compromise version at</p>

Which does NOT have any contentiousness on the "contents of blog" section but does link to Ellen's blog, the contents of which are beyond the control of Wikipedia.</p>
