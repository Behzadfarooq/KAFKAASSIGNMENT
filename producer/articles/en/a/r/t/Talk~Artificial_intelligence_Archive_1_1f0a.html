<h2><span class="mw-headline">Modern AI</span></h2>
<p>I've modernized this page a bit -- AI has moved on a long way since the sci-fi days of HAL and artificial brains etc. (I'm a doctoral student in AI, I did my MSc in AI too, and it is now a fairly rigorous engineering discipline, which sadly still has a bad name due to its former image.) If you want to discuss silicon brains, androids, etc (which I am indeed a fan of!) please do it on the 'strong AI' page. If you want to discuss modelling humans per se, please do it on the cogsci page. Please don't degrade my profession by assocating it with these things though -- don't get me wrong, I love those ideas (especially the quantum brain hypothesis), and indeed have written bits of their wikipedia entries, but I dont think it does anyone any good to conflate them with professional engineering AI work. Modern AI research is more concerned with identifying Al Quaida suspects on subway camera images than sitting around in armchairs talking about the nature of mind.</p>
<p><a name="Missing_Topics" id="Missing_Topics"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Missing Topics</span></h2>
<p>Some of the more technical parts of AI are missing such as links to the Rule based languages, fuzzy logic, Rete Algorithm, forward chaining, backward chaining, expert systems, perceptron, neural networks, simulated annealing, etc.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to add a subtopic such as "AI Implementation" or "AI Technology"</p>
<p><a name="Ethical_problems" id="Ethical_problems"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ethical problems</span></h2>
<p>I don't know if you'd agree, but I think the original vision of AI has by now been thoroughly discredited by ethical problems. Creatures that satisfy the original definition of "intelligence", e.g. Great Apes, are not accorded the respect of personhood. Meanwhile, stupid programs of bad research continue to propagate themselves due to funding inertia and influence of top researchers like Minsky, who haven't produced anything worth a damn in years. Welcome to tenure, I guess, but the people building robot insects or hooking up humans into cyborg colonies (woops forget to mention Steve Mann under collective intelligence) or talking about augmenting apes witih speech synthesizers just don't believe any of the nonsense that Minsky believed...</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Steve Mann is a moron with cool toys. Minsky, on the other hand, was a visionary.</dd>
</dl>

<p><a name="Great_Apes" id="Great_Apes"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Great Apes</span></h2>
<p>Deception is the key difference between humans and Great Apes. Like four year old children, Great Apes do not have a "theory of mind" that enables them to lie *convincingly* by imagining how the other will think things are. Human children acquire this at four and a half or so. Great Apes never do. They lie very badly.</p>
<p>The thing called "intelligence" seems to me to be a combination of perception, planning, empathy, cognition and deception. One decides for oneself which to test for, and what to emphasize, and what to extinct. AI is a nonsense goal, just "infinite symbol manipulation" really, some of which symbols are maybe good enough maps to walk over rough terrain in a robot insect, but none of which are good enough to deceive a suspicious adult human.</p>
<p><a name="Specific_nitpicks" id="Specific_nitpicks"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline">Specific nitpicks</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, thanks for the edits. The argument is now much more readable.</p>
<p>I still have some serious problems with the article as it stands, however.</p>
<p>Firstly, some specific nitpicks:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>good, I'll answer in depth, although we might want to fix <a href="../../../c/o/g/Cognitive_bias.html" title="Cognitive bias">cognitive bias</a> first as some of these same issues are mentioned there... relating AI and cogsci is easy enough, relating AI to cognitive *bias* might be harder... may require good articles on <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_bias.html" title="Culture bias">culture bias</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Notation_bias.html" title="Notation bias">notation bias</a> first... personally I believe strongly that recognition that "oh, that's intelligent" is a combination of cognitive, culture, and notation bias. That we will give up the word and concept soon when we realize we're engaged in a hate exercise. So, my bias here revealed, here's why I believe that:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Turing also helped author the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church-Turing_Thesis_42e0.html" title="Church-Turing Thesis">Church-Turing Thesis</a>, an important advance in the philosophy of mathematics , which seems to imply that adult human linguistic or symbolic intelligence can be no more complex than the process of creating a mathematical proof itself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I believe Hofstader and Daniel Dennett claimed that this was one implication of the CTT - that to understand "intelligence" as understood in the Western world we had to understand the process of mathematical proving and discrediting of proofs... as cognitive, social or notational/formal as that may be. This would not be a controversial position w.r.t. proofs and intelligence given other beliefs in the <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a> - and the experience of Erdos which seems to prove that mathematics is at least to some degree "a social activity". So the bad word here may be "creating"... it's maybe "discovering", or "inspecting", or "discrediting"... is "creating" a sum of these? Hmm...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Modern theorists often reject the assertion that this, or playing chess, is in fact what humans mean when they recognize each other as being concious, wise, or aware. Turing's Test highlights these questions by suggesting that adult humans perhaps assume too much based on mere language - while paradoxically rejecting or ignoring the intelligence of Great Apes, who can master 2000-4000 word vocabularies.</p>
<p>Firstly, all the Church-Turing thesis actually says is that anything that can be effectively computed, can be computed on a Turing machine. Many people do draw the implication that anything the brain "computes" can be computed on a Turing machine, so any limitations of a Turing machine are also limitations of the brain. Beyond that, I can't see your contention. Your earlier</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It's the relationship between what mathematicians and scientists understand as "computed" versus what living creatures with bodies walking or swimming around with other bodies in ecologies would say had been successfully decided. Difference between "decided" and "computed" being bodily commitment. Key distinction made by body philosophers back to Wittgenstein. Turing and Wittgenstein talked about this but in terms most people don't seem to understand as being "about this"...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>comment that "all forms of symbolic or linguistic intelligence as being equivalent to the Turing Machine, which in turn was equivalent to "mathematicians doing proofs in the usual way" isn't directly reflected in the article, and the second part of that comment isn't obvious to me. Could you spell it out for me really slowly and clearly?</p>
<dl>
<dd>I'm best to dig for my Locke, e.g. <a href="http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/Projects/digitexts/locke/understanding/chapter0414.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/Projects/digitexts/locke/understanding/chapter0414.html" rel="nofollow">"...Human Understanding"</a>, "Men often stay not warily to examine the agreement or disagreement of two ideas which they are desirous or concerned to know; but, either incapable of such attention as is requisite in a long train of gradations, or impatient of delay, lightly cast their eyes on, or wholly pass by the proofs; and so, without making out the demonstration, determine of the agreement or disagreement of two ideas, as it were by a view of them as they are at a distance, and take it to be the one or the other, as seems most likely to them upon such a loose survey. This faculty of the mind, when it is exercised immediately about things, is called judgment; when about truths delivered in words, is most commonly called assent or dissent"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I guess if you believe Locke, it's obvious that judgement is involved in the acceptance of the CTT or any mathematical proof of same. Assent or dissent to it by any given mathematician, "delivered in words" or otherwise made clear. So, whose judgement is involved in determining if something is intelligent... in science, largely, the mathematician, or the experimenter, or the *funder* (an underexplored problem only now getting serious attention). So:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Hmmm. Whilst it doesn't appear to be crucial for your argument, if I'm reading your comment correctly you are misunderstanding the CTT. It is a thesis, not a theorem. It can never be proven.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"It can never be proven"? Well, perhaps Dennet and Hofstader intended to make it into a theorem. Parallel to what happened in <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_theory.html" title="Gaia theory">Gaia theory</a> when the <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Hypothesis_0a9b.html" title="Gaia Hypothesis">Gaia Hypothesis</a> (untestable to any ethical player) evolved into <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gaia_Theory_a1dc.html" title="Gaia Theory">Gaia Theory</a> (proper). It isn't crucial to this argument, but I think a thesis that cannot be proven is not a thesis at all... no <a href="../../../f/a/l/Falsifiability.html" title="Falsifiability">falsifiability</a>?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the funding and experimenting decisions we would recognize as guided by some very-hard-to-formalize situational and bodily ethics and constraints... leaving only the mathematician to decide if something is "intelligent" without such obvious constraints... his is the most "neutral point of view".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>the fact that they are "the experts" on logic and proofs, and decide if any given evidence has invalidated a thesis via mathematical prediction, makes the community of mathematicians and its collective assent or dissent critical. How do they "commune"? "By doing proofs in the usual way", e.g. the social way of Erdos, the inspirational way of Galois, the instructional way of Euler... "Read Euler, he is the master of us all" - advice to Galois.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Secondly, who are "modern theorists", and what is the "this" in the phrase "the assertion that this"?</p>
<dl>
<dd>"this" being "symbolic or linguistic intelligence" of adult (&gt;5 years anyway) humans. The "modern theorists" are sometimes called post-linguists, many are primatologists or others doing field studies with animal subjects, or building insect robots, etc. - basically a mixed bag of people who reject the Turing test, consider Great Apes to be "people" in every moral/emotional sense and are pushing for this legal status (<a href="http://personhood.org" class="external free" title="http://personhood.org" rel="nofollow">http://personhood.org</a>), *OR* are determined to work only on survival-type intelligence like that of insects... ignoring language as irrelevant. Chomsky sits firmly in the linguistic camp. However Chomsky also thinks Great Apes aren't "intelligent" in the sense of humans, which seems like "whatever computers haven't done yet, and Great Apes can't do" type of human racism. Best known people here? Those concerned with timing in language, like Goffman,</dd>
</dl>
<p><br />
Thirdly, whilst it's hardly a peer-reviewed academic journal, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/chimps980603.html|this" class="external text" title="http://abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DailyNews/chimps980603.html|this" rel="nofollow">ABC news article</a> credits chimpanzees with a 240-word vocabulary, an order of magnitude less than the 2000-4000 quoted in the article (a stat that tallies with my own recollection of the topic). Furthermore, from what I remember of my undergraduate psychology studies, signing great apes can't construct actual sentences - the best they can do is possibly construct two-word phrases - "tickle me" and "feed me" being by far the most common&#160;:)</p>
<dl>
<dd>seems to be limited to direct-object (mostly two word) verb phrases, <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m1175/6_32/56883557/print.jhtml" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m1175/6_32/56883557/print.jhtml" rel="nofollow">old studies gave rise to the figure "125"</a>, a more modern</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/000000005549.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/000000005549.htm" rel="nofollow">one lists 150-1000, and is written by anti-personhood experimenters</a>. Seems to argue equivalent of two year old human child's skills - while the advocates argue that they're more like four year olds. The famous Koko the gorilla had 1000 words in ASL. One group claims that <a href="http://www.orangutans-sos.org/archivenews/archnewsmisc.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.orangutans-sos.org/archivenews/archnewsmisc.htm" rel="nofollow">adult orang-utans could master 2000 words</a> "he already has a 2000-word vocabulary in sign language" and is shifting apparently to satisfy skeptics, bonobos trained from childhood can master 4000, according to the people doing the keyboard work. Can't validate the 4000 - maybe they withdrew it until they can satisfy all the skeptics - or maybe they projected that number based on comparisons of early progress? It does seem to require intensive training to get this far. There seem to be no challengers to Koko's claim to naming and simple direct verb object skills. There is some question whether she can invent words. but not all of this is interesting to AI except insofar as differences between species may eventually tell us much about cognitive skills of the highest order of living creatures closest to us... but ok enough, let's limit claims to the 150-1000 and note the "disputed claims of 2000 or more" arising from sign language.</p>
<p>What difference does it make to AI whether chimps, gorillas, dolphins or parrots are "intelligent" or not? It might matter to ethicists, theologans, and psychologists, but to me it seems of little philosophical import to the practice of building systems to solve problems which computers currently don't do very well but which humans (and to a large extent animals) do well, which to me seems to be the practical goal of AI.</p>
<dl>
<dd>to have "artificial intelligence" the naive mind expects you must be able to measure or recognize "intelligence". <a href="http://www.interweave.org/the_guide/guisu98a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.interweave.org/the_guide/guisu98a.htm" rel="nofollow">this is a good summary of non-linguistic "intelligence" that apes share with humans</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Ah, this is where I disagree with the "naive mind". Consider a machine translation system. Who really cares whether it's intelligent or not, as long as it accurately translates prose from the source to the target language? The definitional arguments are certainly fascinating, but you can do lots of very useful and interesting things without getting caught up in them.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>who is judging "accurately"? Avoiding these arguments is utterly unethical - it leaves the realm of science and enters mere technologies of persuasion to get more funding to do more persuasion... If you submit a message direct from God that is seeming gibberish, and a program translates it as "Vote Green Or Die", that is quite good enough for me...</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>As to your "ethical argument", you're absolutely right - I disagree. Whilst the "personhood" of the great apes is certainly open to debate, it has no relevance to AI research. As to the frankly disappointing research of AI research to date, that is certainly true - AI research haves't achieved nearly as much as many thought it would. However, I don't see that it follows that AI is fundamentally impossible.</p>
<dl>
<dd>some scientists call this a moral hazard, others an opportunity: extinct the culture that wild chimps and gorillas live in, and then you don't have to address their wild intelligence either - you can define intelligence to get grant money for whatever you can convince another human "intelligence" is... while I would say that preserving those cultures to understand intelligence as such is an opportunity, and probably driving the falsifiability disputes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think AI "progress" is "disappointing" because it sets up a false goal - deception itself - honest assessments of intelligence would set the Great Apes up as benchmarks and assume that humans are the deluded ones making up criteria for their own prestige (as a species, or as researchers specializing in that criteria).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Finally, AI that doesn't respect nearly-human creatures won't respect us either - it's not like we can patch in a moral code when we notice that it wants to slaughter us all as we are slaughtering apes... has to be part of the <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_ontology.html" title="Foundation ontology">foundation ontology</a> to recognize certain empathic common grounds... so this is an extension of the insect-makers' argument that you must solve the problems of getting around, finding food, getting along with others of your kind who find the same food in the same place (and maybe fight over it) before you can look at these absurdly abstract problems like chess or "go"... which are meaningless as tests of anything a living being would care about.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>WRT your discussion of "whether a system should be described as intelligent" or not, you can debate until the cows come home whether something is truly "intelligent", but, for many AI researchers, there is a big shrug of "who cares"? If it does something useful, isn't that significant in itself?</dd>

<dd>I'm a living being, and I care about chess&#160;:) More seriously, AI researchers lost interest in chess a very long time ago, as it became obvious that brute-force search, a technique basically useless for the more real-world problems, is the most effective method for computer chess.

<dd>perhaps a comparison chart that sets up "ant, bee, bird, rabbit, lesser ape, great ape, human" degrees of intelligence and uses the <a href="http://www.interweave.org/the_guide/guisu98a.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.interweave.org/the_guide/guisu98a.htm" rel="nofollow">criteria here</a> for non-linguistic intelligence?

<h2><span class="mw-headline">The goal is</span></h2>
<p>Firstly, the goal of this article, like any other article on Wikipedia, is to present the topic fairly and accurately, and let people draw their own conclusions. When the topic is an academic discipline or school of thought, a fair and accurate presentation includes fair and accurate coverage of the criticisms of such a school of thought, attributed to the people who make them.</p>
<p>Given that, we need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define the goals of AI (as there are quite a few definitions, present some of the major ones and compare and contrast).</li>
<li>Discuss the different methodologies used to try and achieve them, with some sense of the progression of AI research.</li>
<li>Present the results of using those methodologies, both applied to the original goals and elsewhere.</li>
<li>Discuss how, clearly, the original goals have not been achieved in their entirety, and some of the speculation as to how the original goals might yet be achieved.</li>
<li>Discuss speculation of what it might mean if those goals *are* achieved.</li>
<li>Discuss the views of the AI skeptics - including people who believe it can't be done with existing methodologies, believe it can't be done, full stop, and people who think it's unethical to do so.</li>

<dd>The <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy_of_mathematics.html" title="Philosophy of mathematics">philosophy of mathematics</a> asks if adult human linguistic or symbolic intelligence is any more complex than mathematical proof itself, and whether this is in fact what humans mean when they recognize each other as being concious, wise, or aware. Turing's Test highlights these questions by suggesting that adult humans perhaps assume too much based on mere language:</dd>
</dl>
<p>Taking the second sentence first, that's a rather novel interpretation of the significance of the Turing Test, to say the least, and one that doesn't really fit with the reading of Turing's original paper IMHO. It might be a more reasonable response to some of the counterarguments raised about the Turing Test (notably the Chinese Room).</p>
<p>As to the first sentence, I can't parse it. --<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Merkel_dd17.html" title="User:Robert Merkel">Robert Merkel</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Fixed. The "mere language" issue is now illustrated by the apparent "human racism" of the theorists who reject Great Apes' intelligence. It's not that Turing's paper highlighted the issue of what matters in language but rather than Turing's Test itself did - by failing to convince people it was decisive.</p>
<p>The first sentence is also fixed, and refers more directly to the CHurch-Turing Thesis, which was the specific contribution, and which defined all forms of symbolic or linguistic intelligence as being equivalent to the Turing Machine, which in turn was equivalent to "mathematicians doing proofs in the usual way"</p>

<dd>In brief, the neat/scruffy distinction was created before connectionism, or other numerical AI techniques, were. The distinction was between formalists and those that used heuristics.

<p>Im afraid some of us have to disagree on that. As shown in Planet of the Apes, soon apes may take over for humans at the end of the humans' rein.

An exploration of why these mistakes have been made (the confusion caused by the superior calculating capabilities of machines, for instance) would be valuable.

<dd>Artificial intelligence, commonly abbreviated as AI, also known as machine intelligence, is the practice of developing algorithms that make machines (usually computers) able to make seemingly intelligent decisions, or act as if possessing intelligence of a human scale.</dd>

<p>No. That's like saying <i>evolution</i> is the practice of working out how the different species came to exist. I deliberately choose a controversial (in the US at least) topic. <i>Evolution</i> <b>is</b> thought by some (most!) to be the way that different species have come to exist, it isn't <i>the practice of describing how</i>. Now please do not argue with me about evolution: I was just trying to find a controversial subject to compare with AI.</p>
<p>Similarly: AI is <i>artifical intelligence</i>, whether you believe that such a thing is possible or not. It is not some process of trying to make something appear intelligent, however unlikely you thing AI is. Just because <b>you</b> think AI unlikely doesn't mean you can deny what it is (or might be).</p>
<p>Another example: <i>UFOs</i> is not the <i>practice</i> of faking the photographs. AI, similarly, is not the practice of making something (i.e. artificial) appear intelligent. It is the <i>artifical intelligence</i> itself, whether you believe in it or not.</p>
<p>One or two of the contributors to this article seem to have an axe to grind. Wikipedia is supposed to be neutral. I am going to re-write that 1st paragraph.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline">Regarding Wikipedia edits by Murray</span></h3>
<p>Arthur T. Murray, a.k.a. Mentifex, is a notorious <a href="../../../c/r/a/Crank_%28person%29.html" title="Crank (person)">net.kook</a> who has been spamming and mass-mailing his pseudoscientific writings for over thirty years. He is now repeatedly adding to Wikipedia pages inappropriate references to his own work, and repeatedly removing from pages information which presents an opposing point of view to his theories or gives evidence which may cause others to see them in a negative light. For example, he has repeatedly inserted his own name in the "List of Prominent AI Theorists" section of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">AI</a> article.</p>
<p>As no serious AI researcher considers Murray's work to be anything but crackpottery, please help keep this page and others related to AI free of kookery.</p>

Murray/Mentifex FAQ</a> for further details on Murray's claims and posting history. This FAQ links to much of Murray's own writing so you can make your own independent assessment of it.</p>

<dd>Kooks can be a big pain to deal with. Are you and the rest of the Wikipedia community going to take responsibility for watching and changing a Mentifex article on a daily basis to prevent Murray from introducing his own bias?

<dd>"In my view, although Arthur sometimes *presents* his ideas in a somewhat kooky way (by the standards of the mainstream scientific community, and even by the standards of this list), the ideas themselves are significantly better than most of what passes for cognitive science and AI. There is some deep thinking there. If anyone else but me is trying to survey all serious thinking on AGI, Murray's two papers I cited above should be looked at for sure. -- <a href="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0205/3829.html" class="external text" title="http://www.sl4.org/archive/0205/3829.html" rel="nofollow">Ben G</a>.

<p>Tristan Miller is not a decent human being. As Psychonaut of DFKI, he tries to smear, with slanderous appellations and outright lies, a Wikipedia participant who seeks not to bias the encyclopedia but to contribute pertinent information.

<p>Wikipedia and DFKI are doomed to failure if Tristan Miller (Psychonaut) gets away with his vicious and malicious cyberstalking. Remember, the Internet interprets censorship as damage and routes around it. But what will become of Wikipedia and the DFKI which shelters the vicious and malignant cyberstalker Tristan Miller?</p>

He is a known haunter of many many different discussions on wide ranging topics not related to his crazy ai theories (and lies about his jargon-spewing software).

<dd>I'm amenable to the idea of banning persistent vandals, but since Murray always makes his edits from anonymous IP addresses from a variety of ISPs, this would entail locking out a large number of potential users. As for psychiatric treatment, Murray has mentioned on a number of occasions that his father is a psychiatrist. Perhaps some kind Seattle Wikipedian could try phoning all the Dr. Murrays in the Seattle area until he finds the right man, and beg him to put his son away (or at least on the appropriate antipsychotic medication). —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 11:19, 4 Jul 2004 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is the content of this page really appropriate for its topic? You'd think that the page "Artificial Intelligence" would act as an overview of the field and a gateway to subtopics in AI (which may not exist yet) -- and would be in understandable English. The sections and topics are still badly opinionated, too. The arguments aren't presented in anything resembling order. And what's with the "Electronic wavelet holographic interference" stuff?</p>
<p>Maybe this page's problems stem from its position as a major topic page, or it could just be people wiki-stomping on it all the time. Whatever's gone wrong, however, it needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>I'm halfway tempted to rewrite the page from scratch, if nobody minds. It's a bloddy mess.</p>

<p>I do agree that we need some more coverage of the field, rather than <i>only</i> the philosophical controversies, which are well-known in the field but generally don't take up much of its time (if only because many of them are basically intractable—"yes computers can be sentient" or "no computers can't be sentient"). In particular, a good overview of the symbolic vs. subsymbolic controversy is a necessary starting place, and then some overviews of various other approaches within the field. I'll try to start adding some when I get some time. --<a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelirium_b0dc.html" title="User:Delirium">Delirium</a> 18:40, Sep 27, 2004 (UTC)</p>

<p>I find the third paragraph to be pretty annoying. It currently reads:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Historically, AI researchers aimed for the loftier goal of so-called strong AI, of simulating complete, human-like intelligence. This goal is epitomised by the fictional strong AI computer HAL 9000 in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. This goal is unlikely to be met in the near future and is no longer the subject of most serious AI research. The label "AI" has something of a bad name due to the failure of these early expectations, and aggravation by various popular science writers and media personalities such as Professor Kevin Warwick whose work has raised the expectations of AI research far beyond its current capabilities. For this reason, many AI researchers say they work in cognitive science, informatics, statistical inference or information engineering in an attempt to distance themselves from such charlatanism.</dd>

He appears to just be a minor character (at least his notoriety is recent) in the field though I grant he could possibly be aggrevating. Why aren't we mentioning here, for example, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvin_Minsky_9305.html" title="Marvin Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a> or Japan's <a href="../../../f/i/f/Fifth_Generation_4fca.html" title="Fifth Generation">Fifth Generation</a> project? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlHallowell_86e5.html" title="User:KarlHallowell">KarlHallowell</a> 20:12, 22 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Criteria for AI researcher?</span></h2>
<p>I was checking out the latest entry, <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sankar_K_Pal_8041.html" title="Sankar K Pal">Sankar K Pal</a> to the list of AI researchers. His publication list (on Citeseer) is rather small (though several other people on the list have similar records) and he appears (at a glance) to have written at least one book and have a long career as a founder and administrator of AI-related research programs in India. OTOH, it's somewhat pedantic, but his research does seem rather limited.</p>
<p>So what qualities does someone need to warrant inclusion on this list? -- <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlHallowell_86e5.html" title="User:KarlHallowell">KarlHallowell</a> 14:45, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Names I have marked <i>(Ref to publications?)</i> lack references to publications. I removed them in the corresponding portal article. --<a href="../../../m/o/x/User%7EMoxon_4ee1.html" title="User:Moxon">moxon</a> 01:20, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There are thousands of researchers in this field. For these researchers I suggest them to be added to the Category link. For researchers to be mentioned here, some criteria is needed e.g. significant academic publications on the subject.--<a href="../../../m/o/x/User%7EMoxon_4ee1.html" title="User:Moxon">moxon</a> 20:35, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>here here (agreed). Only famous reserachers should be listed on this page (published major works on the subject or who have concepts named after them, etc) . One thing though, why are many famous researchers (Alan Turing for one) not in the category? Is this an oversight or a statement? <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 20:40, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I have started a AI portal. The idea is that the information in this article not concerning the definition of AI be moved to appropriate sub-articles. Assistance in this process will be appreciated. --<a href="../../../m/o/x/User%7EMoxon_4ee1.html" title="User:Moxon">moxon</a> 16:56, 9 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please do. I hope the preliminary new links I created are sufficient. The idea is not to expand the portal to much. --<a href="../../../m/o/x/User%7EMoxon_4ee1.html" title="User:Moxon">moxon</a> 01:20, 11 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Delete section?</span></h2>
<p>The "Machines displaying some degree of intelligence" section is silly. There are many programs which display some level of intelligence. Also most of those listed are actually programs not machines. I suggest replacing it with "Famous implementaions of AI" and include deeper blue and other famous AI bots (and excluding links, if it doesn't have an article it doesn't deserve to be listed). Objecions? This article does need a lot of work. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><b>B</b>roken</a> <a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><b>S</b></a> 20:21, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
