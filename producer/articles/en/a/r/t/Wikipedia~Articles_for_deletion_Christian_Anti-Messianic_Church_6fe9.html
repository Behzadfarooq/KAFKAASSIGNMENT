<dd>I, your Brother in our Lord the Anti-Messiah Jesus of Nazareth Brother Fryear, am Proof that we Exist. I, along with our Brother in our Lord the Anti-Messiah Jesus of Nazareth Brother Karcher, are currently the Only Knowers of our One Sacred Truth, for it has only been in the past Month that we have Learned that we are Permitted to spread our One Sacred Truth to Others.

<dd>The thing is, Wikipedia is trying to be a fairly reliable encyclopedia, and thusly has some standards about what can be in it in terms of reliable references. And part of those standards is that there have to be sources for articles that are notable for some degree, for instance, stuff like blogs or personal websites really aren't acceptable. Trying to reference oneself is even worse, unless you're like some super awesome notable professor of religiosity or something, and by the encyclopedic standards that I presume Wikipedia is going for, referencing oneself really isn't considered useful.... <a href="../../../h/o/m/User%7EHomestarmy_5e94.html" title="User:Homestarmy">Homestarmy</a> 15:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This is obviously just a joke/sarcasm. The capitalizing of random letters is poking fun of how Christians capitalize He/Him/His/etc when referring to God. The self-referential proof that they exist is poking fun of Christians using the Bible as evidence for the historicity of Christ. There's no real point in humoring (bad pun intended) him. It's a bad joke/sarcasm/religious bigotry. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2x_2820.html" title="User:Born2x">Born2x</a> 15:16, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Its a dumb article. All "sincerity" issues aside, its a dumb article. Its 2 lines long, and is completely uninformative. It covers a movement that nobody has ever heard of. So please just <b>Delete</b> it. And Esa29, chill out dude. If you're serious, then keep your religion, but keep it off wikipedia.--Padawan3000 15:38, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I can write More if you would like. Other Faiths are covered on Wiki Pedia; why should our One Sacred Truth not be as well? If you wish that I not Proselytize on your Web Site I will not, but why should there not be a Factual Article? 16:15, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because your church doesn't exist. It is poor satire. If you were writing about George Bush's long lost twin brother or some such nonsense, we wouldn't be having this discussion, your article would have been deleted by now. But religion is confusing enough to some people that they can't tell the difference between patent nonsense and something that someone somewhere might actually believe. Granted, with some of the cults out there, that line is pretty blurry ... but in the case of your article, it's just silly and an obvious hoax. --<a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorn2x_2820.html" title="User:Born2x">Born2x</a> 20:23, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, let's see. A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Christian+Anti-Messianic+Church%22&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Christian+Anti-Messianic+Church%22&amp;hl=en&amp;filter=0" rel="nofollow">google search</a> turns up four links - three here on Wikipedia, and a forum. That's not only a lack of proof of notability, that's lack of proof that it exists. That you exist does not constitute that this group exists - and even if you have created it, maybe it does, but it still is nowhere even remotely near notable. Let's then discount the fact that it reads like a usenet post on alt.christnet.*, and also discount the inherent sarcasm. And let's also completely and utterly ignore the fact that you seem to think that existence alone connotes a qualifier to be included on Wikipedia. If you believe that, I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for sale for you. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennisthe2_d99a.html" title="User talk:Dennisthe2">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dennisthe2_268f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dennisthe2">contribs</a>) 23:19, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small>
