<p>As the publisher of the already discredited-on-wikipedia <a href="../../../r/e/v/Review_of_International_Law_and_Politics_3b95.html" title="Review of International Law and Politics">Review of International Law and Politics</a>, the "International Strategic Research Organization should be deleted along with it. The organizations director created this page for no other reason than to promote it and as a vanity page. It is not appropriate for wikipedia, it is not any kind of leading world organization as it claims. Vartan84 19:37, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a serious and respectable organization. I don't buy the "already discredited-on-wikipedia" argument. First, the jury is still out. Secondly, if a bad entry is written on (for example) the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Business_Review_0d9b.html" title="Harvard Business Review">Harvard Business Review</a>, so that the consensus is: <i>delendum esse</i>, should that then really imply that the article on the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_Business_School_d2ff.html" title="Harvard Business School">Harvard Business School</a> should also be deleted? What about this hypothesis: the director of ISRO created this page <i>because he believed it would enhance the value of Wikipedia as a repository of encyclopedic information</i>? Why this hostile approach? Assume good faith. Although it is not recommended to write about yourself, it is <i>not</i> against policy. The article can be improved, but it is serious, not gone overboard. It does not claim that ISRO is a leading <b>world'</b> organization, but a leading <b>Turkish</b> organization, which is true in its field. The "pure vanity" lines you removed were not added by prof. Laciner but apparently by <a href="http://barissanli.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://barissanli.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Barış Sanlı</a>, IT editor for <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_Weekly_e03c.html" title="Turkish Weekly">Turkish Weekly</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:48, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Look, parts of the article are even written in the first-person plural, as it describes the guidelines for accepting submissions. The link to the allegedly famous ISRO goes to some Indian Space Organization. And most of all, if I try to find any cooberating information about this organization on Google I find no more than 10 unique hits, many of which being to its listing on wikipedia or affliates. The only pages that mention it seem to be: once on a Turkish newspaper site (the Turkish Weekly in fact, someone from whom has helped to updated the Organization's wikipedia page), one or two other (sometimes broken) links, and funniest of all a porn page. A sign of its notability would be it showing up multiple times on Google being referenced by outside sources, but that just doesn't seem to be the case. Sure if we want to enhance wikipedia as "a repository of encyclopedic information" that's just fine, however that does not mean we put everything and everyone in existence on it. Claiming it was done to enhance encyclopedic knowledge is just a nice way to gloss over the fact it appears to have largely been done for the sake of self-promotion by the journal's publisher. Vartan84
<dl>
<dd>What exactly is your problem? <i>This</i> article should be deleted because the organization publishes a journal on whose page the editor wrote "We welcome" instead of "The journal welcomes"? That is a clearcut reason for deletion if I ever saw one. Did you check? Maybe that qualifies for a speedy! As to Google: try this: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Uluslararas%C4%B1+Stratejik+Arastirmalar+Kurumu%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Uluslararas%C4%B1+Stratejik+Arastirmalar+Kurumu%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search" rel="nofollow">"Uluslararası Stratejik Arastirmalar Kurumu"</a>. If your <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkish_language.html" title="Turkish language">Turkish</a> is not up to par, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22International+Strategic+Research+Organization%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22International+Strategic+Research+Organization%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">"International Strategic Research Organization"</a> gives enough hits from outside sources.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> with lots of eyerolling. Quite obviously this is a project by the members of this group to publish every single tidbit of information about themselves and their institute (including the ever-popular notability-by-association info: We're notable because someone from Northwestern stopped by), but as an Institute they might actually be above the notability threshold. Now can we agree that we keep their entries restricted to the institute itself and its <a href="../../../t/a/y/Tayyibe_G%C3%BClek_bc0c.html" title="Tayyibe Gülek">most prominent member</a>, and not give every "world famous" second tier executive valuable cyberspace too?

<li><b>Keep</b>, its content is problematic, but USAK itself is well known, especially in Turkey. It is a respected research organization, it can stay. - Kubra 18:48, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>per Kubra and Trialsanderrors. Must however be rewritten, and all the sub branches of this think tank should be merged with the mother article. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 19:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thats intriguing. However your feelings towards the organisation is of no concern to wikipedia. If you can source your claim please feel free to add it to the article in perhaps a criticism section. Also please see the article <a href="../../../t/h/i/Think_Tank_211c.html" title="Think Tank">Think Tank</a>. Such criticism aplies to many other think tanks and they all have their articles. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 23:27, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I perfectly know what a think tank is. Apropos, i did not vote for the deletion of the article, but i added a comment (for which i got no answer, though...). My feelings towards this or other organisations or whatever, is noone's business, and that's why i am not pushing POV in Wikipedia. As for the sources of my 'claims', i have provided links about the article mentioned above (common! everyone can see it is POV!). since the users who have voted for keeping it, are probably aware of USAK, can someone tell me if the figures provided are from this organisation? (cause if they are not, i am obviously wrong about it...) --<a href="../../../h/e/c/User%7EHectorian_d70e.html" title="User:Hectorian">Hectorian</a> 16:25, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
