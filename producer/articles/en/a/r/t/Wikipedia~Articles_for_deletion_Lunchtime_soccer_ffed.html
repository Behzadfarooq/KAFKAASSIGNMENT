<li>The page lunchtime soccer should not be deleted. It is a good place for people to reference when they are in dispute of the rules which they play by. Particularly at my school the players are very passionate. They have even become violent because they are not clear on the rules. This page is a reference to stop these things happening. It is also a log of luchtime soccer/football communities around the world. There are many other wikipedians i know who have found this page a good reference. Therefore it should not be deleted because it doesn't breach any of the wikipedia rules and it only ever helps people. The verifiable source is other wikipedians. And the millions of people across the world who play the beautiful game, the world game. A reaonable person would know how popular soccer/football across the world is. More people play unofficial soccer than any other sport. - jensen 198 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensen_198_4321.html" title="User:Jensen 198">Jensen 198</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/n/User_talk%7EJensen_198_238c.html" title="User talk:Jensen 198">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jensen_198_afb9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jensen 198">contribs</a>) 2007-02-24 01:43:42 (UTC)</small>

<li>Agreed, This is for the minors. To share their experiences on a minor scale. Why should Frank lampard or Ronaldinho get their own page but not us? They are not special and nor are they more importatnt than us. At our school (the Friends' School) it is great fun and very passionate. Sometimes weve even stayed fifteen minutes after were supposed to be in class! What you say about our school and its competitions is dirtying our legacy. We want people to know just how important, soccer(thats not even on a major scale) is to the people in a small city in Australia. There is nothing wrong with this page, anymore than there is something wrong with Harry Kewell's page, it is merely us sharing our views off soccee andwhat is wrong with that?

<li>Frank Lampard and Ronaldinho both have won awards for their expertise and performance in soccer and Harry Kewell has had media coverage from multiple, verifiable sources- just look at the articles! Importance does not put one in Wikipedia, notability does. Also remember that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a group of proses. I find nothing offensive or wrong with your article- morality does not govern whether an article stays or not. But verifiability and notability through multiple sources keeps an article in Wikipedia. <b><a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a></b> <b>(<a href="../../../s/r/1/User_talk%7ESr13_4dc1.html" title="User talk:Sr13">T</a></b>|<b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sr13_98de.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sr13">C</a></b>) <sup><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Sr13_d5bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Sr13">Editor review</a></sup> 02:30, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment-</b> How is <i>notability criteria guideline</i> not Wikipedia rules? Again, you contradict your argument by saying "...everyone plays soccer during there breaks. And, in effect, they all have similar if not the same rules..." Why don't they just read the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Soccer.html" title="Soccer">Soccer</a> page for info? If you want to keep the article here, you need to present <i>multiple, verifiable sources</i> by the <b>media</b> (newspapers such as the New York Times, news channels such as CNN, or even an independent report).

<p>Fry and Oats are famous Quakers. I'm sure if you google search their names you will get some information on them. The rules for soccer do not vary and they are not for an individual school.

<li><b>Delete</b> in its present form. An articles about informal games of soccer would be appropriate, if sources could be found, and regional variation could be accommodated.

<li><b>Delete</b> However, I don't know if I'm just making more of a mess here, Note that there is already an article for <a href="../../../s/t/r/Street_football.html" title="Street football">Street football</a> which covers the ground of the massive popularity of informal football games.

<p>Street football. Lunchtime soccer. Aren't they the exact same at the end of the day. Just leave both of the articles alone and stop wasting everybody's time. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJensen_198_4321.html" title="User:Jensen 198">Jensen 198</a> 01:23, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not in the least bit. The Street football article seems to deal with an international competition. This article, on the other hand, deals with the rules that a bunch of friends play by. There's no proof that the variant of the game under discussion here is played anywhere but in one school - such sources as have been provided simply show that other schools exist. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:32, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Dear Wikipedia, I don't think that you grasp the knowledge of how important it is to keep this arcticle. Your statements mean nothing compared to the vast seriousness of my arguement. Please, for the good of all, don't delete it. Orlando Mason</p>

<dd>Dear Mr Mason (or Jensen198),</dd>
<dd>The editors of Wikipedia are yet to see the argument that you claim to be vastly serious advanced anywhere. What has been said (ad infinitum) so far is that this article is about a variant of soccer/football played by some friends at a certain high school. No proof of that has been provided, and no proof has been provided that it is played anywhere else. If you believe that the article should not be deleted, please provide sources showing its existence and its notability forthwith. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:47, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The sport of lunchtime soccer is an extremely interesting variant of normal or even casual soccer.
