<li><b>Delete</b> <i>The Temptations</i> are highly notable, but every reference to them isn't. This is just another compilation without any redeeming notability of its own. It might rate mention in the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Temptations_2852.html" title="The Temptations">The Temptations</a> article, at the very most. I do not understand <a href="../../../n/i/m/User%7ENimbat230_cb82.html" title="User:Nimbat230">Nimbat230's</a> reasoning; listing song titles of an album does create notability for the album, even if these were new songs. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 00:35, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Compilations of notable artists have precedence for being kept (the many for <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush.html" title="Rush">Rush</a>), for example). A little work will fix this article. <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrshawk_a0ba.html" title="User:Skrshawk"><span style="color:green"><b>skrshawk</b></span></a> ( <a href="../../../s/k/r/User_talk%7ESkrshawk_c0ff.html" title="User talk:Skrshawk"><span style="color:purple">Talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Skrshawk_7816.html" title="Special:Contributions/Skrshawk"><span style="color:purple">Contribs</span></a> ) 03:52, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, just reproducing a tracklisting is not sufficient for an article. If the article asserted why this compliation was particularly notable, then it would be suitable. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 12:42, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, just another "Very Best of Greatest Hits". IMHO, compilations even by very notable bands aren't automatically notable. To be sure of its notability, I'd like to see information on chart performance or links to independant non-trivial reviews. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxSem_bf93.html" title="User:MaxSem">Max<font size="+1"><i>S</i></font>em</a> 14:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I recommend <b>Deletion</b> for this article which is nothing but an advertisement for a non-notable company. The company primarily rents out trailers for the Canadian oil fields. The article has subsisted in the Wikipedia since August. It has no links to it except for the four redirect pages, which should also be deleted.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can you explain why you AfD-listed this album, and not the other by the same artist, <a href="../../../t/h/i/Third_Eye_Vision_4a6d.html" title="Third Eye Vision">Third Eye Vision</a>? Wikipedia seems to have more than a few album-stubs like this, and I don't understand the need for this AfD. It seems to me that you could merge the content into <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hieroglyphics_%28band%29.html" title="Hieroglyphics (band)">Hieroglyphics (band)</a> and redirect without the need for deletion. ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 01:36, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Re the first post by Booyabazooka - only reason I AfD'd this &amp; not the other, was that this was the one the random article brought up. Didn't want to go straight ahead and merge just in case this was the 'Sgt Pepper' of hip hop and I'd just not heard of it, as I'm not a hip hop fan. <font face="comic sans ms"><a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="gold"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 11:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, I just restored the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full_Circle_%28Hieroglyphics_album%29&amp;diff=97941972&amp;oldid=97891783" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full_Circle_%28Hieroglyphics_album%29&amp;diff=97941972&amp;oldid=97891783" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> as it was redirected today by Booyabazooka to <a href="../../../h/i/e/Hieroglyphics_%28band%29.html" title="Hieroglyphics (band)">Hieroglyphics (band)</a>, which is not appropriate as the AfD is still ongoing. --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt.

<li>Appears I missed the above statement by Booyabazooka, but I still think the redirect should wait until the AfD is over (if that is the conclusion). --<a href="../../../r/e/i/User%7EReinoutr_0a7f.html" title="User:Reinoutr">Cpt. Morgan (Reinoutr)</a> 14:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am not concerned with notability as much as with article content. These albums have none. Since there are only two, and the band's article is not particularly long, what's wrong with the merge? ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 22:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Logistical comment</i>: Deletion is definitely not going to be the result here. Was I wrong in stepping over the AfD bureaucracy? We don't need AfD for this discussion. (Btw, I have reverted my changes to the other two articles for consistency) ~&#160;<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooyabazooka_79a9.html" title="User:Booyabazooka">Booya <sup>Bazooka</sup></a> 22:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> AfD is not an appropriate forum for improving article content. To improve article content, you can make edits yourself; you could mark it with things like {{expert}} in hope that someone with subject knowledge will improve it (as well as a number of similar tags); or you could initiate a discussion on the talk page of the article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 23:20, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> Somebody had merged the content of the two albums into the artist page. This was a good merge. The page didn't become overly long or anything of that nature, and the content was still present on WP. I'm not seeing the problem. GassyGuy 06:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm new to the Wiki thing; I only added the initial article becasue there was a link to it from Stratton's Alma mater sentry. I'm a serious fan of his work, but have no ambitions to be a regular Wikipedia contributor; I apologize for my clumsy work. You can find reviews of Kip Stratton's books in the L.A. Times on Sept. 11, 2002, and October 30, 2005; the Boston Globe on May 8, 2005; Publishers Weekly, March 3, 2005, and September 15, 2002; and Kirkus Reviews, February 15, 2005 and June 15, 2002. Author's profile is contained in Contemporary Authors, Volume 242. New contract with Harcourt (for the Patterson book) verified in Publisher's Marketplace, November 28, 2006. --Aitchmark 10:25, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep &amp; rewrite</b> I found a few independent non-trivial sources; however, in one the mention alludes to notability in a brief mention comparing another book to his. Not overly compelling evidence of prominence, but I think we are looking for notabilty not prominence. This has potential way beyond vanity; his books are sold through Amazon and other major booksellers.</li>

Clicking on the links for each individual character shows that creator and first appearance of each is prominently displayed on their respective article infoboxes.

<li><b>Expand and move</b> unless there is another list out there that choronologically compares sidekicks, i think we should keep this. This list only suffers from intrinsic POV because the author did not follow <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> guidlines in being more specific with the title and beginning with a lead that stated exactly what the scope of the list would entail. It could be solved simply by writing a lead section and moving the article to a more descriptive title. Also, it doesn't seem any of you scanned more than just the first few entries, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> is listed as well, I think the orginal editor just contributed his own knowledge, not intentionally leaving superheroes out.

<li>what this suggests to you is purely subjective, even though i realize the comic industry has an ugly history of creative rights, the person who came up with a character is not usually called into question. If it is, then that can be noted within the list. This is no more redundant than creating a list by aspect A and a list by aspect B, which is not against any wiki guideline or policy and does indeed help in navigation. -<a href="../../../z/a/p/User%7EZappernapper_ad66.html" title="User:Zappernapper">ΖαππερΝαππερ</a> <sup><a href="../../../z/a/p/User_talk%7EZappernapper_cf32.html" title="User talk:Zappernapper">Babel</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zappernapper_a171.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zappernapper">Alexandria</a></sub> 05:13, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Handjob</b> - <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> states that <u>all article claims must be sourced to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.</u> Moreover, per the section "Reliable sources for neologism" mentioned, <u>To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term</u>. In evaluating the references in in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, #1, #2, and #3 which is all 3 of the references in the article, they are not books or articles about "Handjob" but are only articles that use the term trivially as a neologism and without discussing it as such. All of these references thus fail <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. In the External links section, a link is posted to a Usenet posting, which not only fails the heightened reference criteria of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> but the general criteria for all Wikipedia articles at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Bulletin_boards.2C_wikis_and_posts_to_Usenet" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources#Bulletin_boards.2C wikis and posts to Usenet</a> which states Usenet posts may not be used as references. The second External link points to a website that uses the word "handjob" to describe sexual technique but it is not a reliable secondary source. Therefore, and "even though there may be many examples of the term in use", this article must be deleted per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and any pertinent content placed into <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foreplay.html" title="Foreplay">Foreplay</a> / <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heavy_petting.html" title="Heavy petting">Heavy petting</a> where it belongs. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 01:54, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I was adding the reliably sourced content it did seem to me that a merger to <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> was in order, given what the sources were actually saying about hand jobs. However, there have been two proposed mergers discussed on the article's talk page, both of which were opposed. I suggest that all of the above editors review the several arguments already made against merger on <a href="../../../h/a/n/Talk%7EHandjob_c98e.html" title="Talk:Handjob">Talk:Handjob</a> and comment on them, because they have yet to be addressed and countered by any editor in this discussion.
<p>Incidentally: <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> is missing the point of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> in the nomination. If this were an article about a neologism, then we would need sources that discuss the word. But it isn't. ("<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hand_job" class="extiw" title="wikt:hand_job">hand job</a>" isn't even a neologism, as the fact that one of the sources dates from 1975 should clearly imply.) It's an article about <i>the actual thing that the phrase denotes</i>, a hand job. So the fact that the sources simply <i>use</i> the phrase in their discussions of hand jobs is entirely proper. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:43, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Dhartungh stated that <i>handjob</i> "is longstanding sexual slang" yet he uses a reference <i>in which it is used to describe a slang term, a neologism at the time,</i> <u>in an article that is not about its use as slang but treats it like some scholarly encyclopedic term for Manual stimulation (sexual).</u> It falls under neologism, therefore.

<li>This is obviously pointless. You're proceeding from a completely unsupported contention that the word falls under our definition of neologism, and saying that it fails to meet the guidelines, but you have not presented any credible evidence that it is a neologism. Obviously we can continue going around in "is! is not!" circles. If you had a better rationale for deletion -- and you obviously don't, you think the topic is valid and should be given a different name -- you would have put it in the nomination.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> The article is not about mutual masturbation, it is about masturbation of a male as a primary sexual activity, often in the context of commercial sex. I know of no better term for this--and the apparent attempts of others to find one show their similar inability. it is not "mutual" anything, it is much more specific than "sexual stimulation", and more specific than "masturbation", and much more specific than petting, and not necessarily or even usually part of foreplay. it is much too old to be a neologism. It refers to an activity--it is not just about the word. RANorton &amp; Edison have it right.

<li><b>Comment</b> - To clarify: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> is a colloquial term for Manual-Genital Stimulation, the term the consensus of scholarship uses to describe the act. The yet uncreated article Manual-Genital Stimulation should mention that one of several colloquial terms for the act is "handjob". Therefore, since handjob is a colloquial term for Manual-Genital Stimulation, an article titled Handjob needs to be about the term as a colloquialism. Does that clear things up? <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 09:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, because it's wrong, being based upon an incorrect idea of what the article should be about. An article entitled <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> should be about hand jobs. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, not a dictionary</a>. An article about the <i>word</i> (more properly, the phrase) is a dictionary article. As previously mentioned, the dictionary already has a stub article about the phrase at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hand_job" class="extiw" title="wikt:hand_job">hand job</a>. Encyclopaedia articles are not about the words or phrases but about the people, concepts, events, places, or things that the words or phrases denote.
<p>If, as you assert, manual-genital stimulation and <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> are the same thing (which requires evidence that females can be given hand jobs, given that the literature talks about manual-genital stimulation of females), then the one should redirect to the other, since two articles about a single concept are <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">Wikipedia:Duplicate articles</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If, as UncleG says, a handjob is different from Manual-Genital Stimulation, then <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">handjob</a> needs to be about the term as such. <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28common_names%29_764d.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (common names)</a> is one reason why.

We use the common scholarly name. A dictionary entry and an article like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> that covers the etymology and history of a word are very different matters. Both male and female manual-genital stimulation can be covered in Manual-genital stimulation, and colloquialisms such as "handjob" and "third base" can be cited as colloquialisms for the act. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Putting all of these topics at <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> would be confusing.

<li><b>Keep or merge</b> Possible merge to <a href="../../../m/u/t/Mutual_masturbation.html" title="Mutual masturbation">mutual masturbation</a>, but the term 'fingering' is NOT a neologism, it's been used in numerous publications (any 'about your body' book ever written that covers masturbations I'd guess), and it's a distinct act. Saying this all belongs in mutual masturbation is something of a transitive error of logic, just because fingering is a kind of manual stimulation and often used in mutual masturbation play doesn't mean it's not a distinct act. I would only caution that it should be careful to avoid wp:NOT a how-to guide, there are enough sites for that as it is. I see nothing in WP:not that would preclude this article, it is a notable concept, verifiable, researched (Kinsey study, various studies of female sexual response, ect.) and discussed, performed in bedrooms across the world on a nightly basis and in no way unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> - For defenders of this article "as is", instead of wasting your energy here, I suggest you expend it making the article worthy to keep as titled <i>Fingering</i>. "A topic is notable if and only "if it has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other." "The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention or use <i>Fingering</i> <u>as a colloquialism or slang term</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research. I suggest if you want to keep this article, you best expend your efforts finding sources where <i>Fingering</i> *AS A SPECIFIC TERM* "has been <u>the subject of</u> multiple, non-trivial published works with sources independent of the subject itself and each other", or else concede that any adequately sourced material belongs in Manual-genital stimulation. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability is not subjective</a>.

<li><b>comment</b> I disagree. It is the subject of the article (the act or concept variously called "fingering", or a particular kind of "manual genital stimulation") that needs to satisfy the quotes you emphasize ("... multiple, non-trivial published works"). It is not the case that someone needs to publish a work <i>about</i> "fingering AS A SPECIFIC TERM".

<li><b>comment to all the above</b> Please don't take this the wrong way, it's hard to say this without sounding a bit terse, but if you're going to argue for deletion, a valid argument is vital. Neologism is a valid argument, one I dissagree with, but a valid argument; "disgusting" (so are many things, subjective criteria and violates wp:not censored)"unlikely to be searched for" (so are a lot of things, that isn't a deletion criterion) are not valid deletion arguments founded in wiki policy. Wikilawyering the exact definition of "subject of a non-trivial work" is unessesary and serves no purpose. A merge would eliminate the uniqueness of the two articles. Renames with redirects would be a suitable compromise, to me, creating Manual Genital Stimulation (male) and Manual Genital Stimulation (female). <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a></li>

<li><b>merge</b> and redirect. Both are informal usage not formal phrases for this, and the reuslt is duplication. The first major section in hand job seems to be a piece of local nonsense that has no obvious relevance outside of that one town.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Per the <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> arguments, that page says neologisms are "words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities." One has been in use for at least 35 years and the other at least 15, and both appear in dictionaries. The merge suggestions ignore the fact that the two articles examine two completely different acts.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Unfortunately I feel that this AfD has been horrifically tainted with inappropriate comments on several sides of the debate. I'm afraid my original intention of closing the Fingering AfD was misapplied, it should have been closed <b>not</b> merged. We should have slowed down and waited for the Handjob AfD to reach a consensus, then use it as a precedent to apply to other articles. Instead we're running into another cluster-fuck discussion where it will be impossible to reach a clear consensus. Let's all calm down and make intelligent arguments that are backed up by wikipedia policy. Articles that attract vandalism (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W_Bush_83e6.html" title="George W Bush">George W Bush</a>) or some deem as "<i>inappropriate</i>" (<a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">Homosexuality</a>) are not valid arguments for deletion, and neither is it a valid argument to keep an article because you heard of it before. There are policy backed arguments to use on either side of the table, let's try to debate guidelines instead of morality. -- <a href="../../../w/t/f/User%7EWtfunkymonkey_476f.html" title="User:Wtfunkymonkey">wtfunkymonkey</a> 22:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As I see it, there are two separate issues: (a) Is manual masturbation sufficiently distinct from masturbation in general to deserve its own article? (b) Are male (<a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>) and female (<a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a>) manual masturbation sufficiently different from each other to deserve their own articles? I would answer "No" to both questions, and support a merge of both disputed articles into <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">Masturbation</a>. However, I would also regard answering "Yes" to (a) and "No" to (b), and merging the two disputed articles into a new one, Manual masturbation, to be an acceptable solution. <a href="../../../t/e/v/User%7ETevildo_7971.html" title="User:Tevildo">Tevildo</a> 03:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unless sourced. Fingering can be a form of masturbation, but is not always. The term <i>fingering</i> also has some sociolinguistic significance. An article separate from masturbation concerning the term and the act may thus be justified. However, with no sources, this article is unverified and ought to be deleted. <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Graves_78e0.html" title="User:Nick Graves">Nick Graves</a> 16:14, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> from CyberAnth</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone above said, "Who could possibly write a whole work about the name of something?"</p>
<p>Fact is, articles constantly appear in various journals of linguistics (and related disciplines) that trace the origins, usages, and meanings of slang words, neologisms, and the like.</p>
<p>An entire book was written about the word "Fuck", <i>as a word</i>. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/F-Word-Random-House/dp/0679764275/sr=8-1/qid=1167890142/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3657703-4961632?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/F-Word-Random-House/dp/0679764275/sr=8-1/qid=1167890142/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-3657703-4961632?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books" rel="nofollow">Jesse Sheidlower, The F Word ISBN 0-375-70634-8</a>. The WP article <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> is a nice example of an article about the word "Fuck" as a word, although it is duplicated in <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_word__fuck__cf34.html" title="History of the word &quot;fuck&quot;">History of the word "fuck"</a>.</p>
<p>Do research with a University library's databases.</p>
<p>I searched with <a href="../../../e/b/s/EBSCO_9f27.html" title="EBSCO">EBSCO</a> with &lt;- handjob -&gt; and found two articles - both about <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punk_rock.html" title="Punk rock">Punk rock</a> that mentioned the band <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Morris_c626.html" title="Keith Morris">Midget Handjob</a>.</p>
<p>I then searched EBSCO with &lt;- fingering AND sexual -&gt; and then &lt;- fingering AND sex -&gt;. Nothing came up.</p>
<p>I then searched it with &lt;- genital stimulation NOT self-stimulation NOT masturbation -&gt;. 17 articles.</p>
<p>I then did with <a href="../../../j/s/t/JSTOR_27a2.html" title="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> what I did with EBSCO above. Keep in mind these are two of the most major databases of academic journals in English in the world.</p>
<p>&lt;- handjob -&gt; brought 2 results. Article #1 was about college student behaviors. It quoted a student using the word "handjob" as a slang term. Article #2 was a study of prostitutes. It quoted a prostitute using the word "handjob" as a slang term.</p>
<p>&lt;- genital stimulation -&gt; brought 275 articles.</p>
<p>The references cited in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> are from articles with prostitution as their subject, and in that context the slang word <i>handjob</i> would of course appear. No additional comment needed here.</p>
<p>Actually, I will. The references are themselves an argument for treating <i>handjob</i> as a neologism, a slang word, in an article about it as such, because that is exactly how it is treated in the references.</p>
<p><a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a> does not have any references.</p>
<p>Miriam-Webster Dictionary is considered by Wikipedia policy, along with the Oxford dictionary, to be the most authoritative.</p>
<p><i>Handjob</i> does not appear in the Miriam-Webster Dictionary, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/handjob" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/handjob" rel="nofollow">see here</a>. Neither does <i>hand job</i>, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hand%20job" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hand%20job" rel="nofollow">see here</a>.</p>
<p><i>Handjob</i> or <i>hand job</i> does appear in other non-slang dictionaries. The definitions all say "<i>a slang word</i> for masturbation." And it appears in every slang dictionary I checked.</p>
<p><i>Fingering</i> turns up no specific sexual definition in Miriam-Webster, <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/fingering" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/fingering" rel="nofollow">see here</a>, nor any other one I checked.</p>
<p><i>Fingering</i> as a sexual act appeared in several slang dictionaries I checked.</p>
<p>"Neologisms are words and terms that have recently been coined, generally do not appear in any dictionary, but may be used widely or within certain communities" (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>).</p>
<p>Yes indeed, <i>handjob</i> and <i>fingering</i> are certainly "used widely or within certain communities". The policy says that is not enough.</p>
<p>It might be argued, however, that <i>handjob</i> and <i>fingering</i> have been around for 20 - 40 years, so that is not "recent'. The objection is irrelevant. Neither are in any dictionary <i>except as a slang word</i>. This means they have not been around long enough to move from the slang to regular lexicon of any reliable source.</p>
<p>Articles titled "Fingering (sexual)" and "Handjob" need to be like <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a>, i.e., <i>about the word</i>, its etymology, history, etc.</p>
<p>The <i>acts</i> the slang terms denote should be covered in Genital stimulation. <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">Oral sex</a>, manual-genital stimulation, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> should all have coverage in that one article.</p>
<p>Specifically, Genital stimulation needs to be created. Material in <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/n/Fingering_%28sexual_act%29.html" title="Fingering (sexual act)">Fingering (sexual act)</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oral_sex.html" title="Oral sex">oral sex</a>, and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a> needs to be incorporated there, and then Handjob and Fingering (sexual act) deleted for the reasons outlined above.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> CyberAnth: creating one singular topic for ALL genital stimulation isn't a viable solution in my opinion. That would lump sex, oral sex, masturbation, mutual masturbation, electro-gential stimulation and more that I probably can't think of right now into a topic that would get so big it'd need to be spun off into seperate topics immediately or shortly after creation. I think that 'manual genital stimulation (female) and' 'manual genital stimulation (male)' might be more appropriate topics, but the use of a clinical neologism invented as a pure function of wiki categorization isn't for me as valid as using the common colloquial term. For reasons described above, mutual masturbation is not equivilent to manual genital stimulation (fingering and handjobs if you will&#160;:P) or masturbation, they are distinct acts. Masturbation is self-induced sexual arousal and climax, whether it's manual or not (IE it is possible to masturbate without actual manual stimulation, IE by shower head or vibrator) and mutual masturbation is not equivilent to genital stimulation in that it involves both partners masturbating each other simultainiously (in the same way the 69 position is distinct in meaning from oral sex). In response to the first AfD, a handjob is identical in meaning to male manual genital stimulation, but "fingering" is a distinct activity, seperated from other methods of female manual genital stimulation. Lumping dissimular articles into a single polyglot whole serves no identifiable purpose in my opinion, and would be akin to combining sex, anal sex and oral sex into a single topic in terms of the dissolution of unique articles for distinct acts. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 17:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the articles were just stubs I could see merging them, but when medium sized articles get merged it creates more problems than it solves. I get redirected to a page and have to search the page until I find what I am looking for, never sure if I am at the correct page until I find (or don't find) what I came for. Header redirects: <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex.html#Masturbation" title="Sex">Sex#Masturbation</a> work only as long as the header names remain unchanged, which isn't long. Each of these articles already has its own set of external links and usage sections. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 02:12, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. CyberAnth writes: "The acts the slang terms denote should be covered in Genital stimulation. Oral sex, manual-genital stimulation, and masturbation should all have coverage in that one article." This really sums up the entire argument, doesn't it? You want to roll everything into one article. <i>You are <b>not</b> arguing that the topics are not valid. You <b>are</b> arguing for a move or a merge.</i> This is not what AFD is for; this is a bad-faith nomination, and should be treated accordingly.</li>

<dd>On a more diplomatic note, it is very disappointing that you did not look at this problem and think in a collaborative manner. An appropriate way to handle the problem that you see would be to start at <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Sexuality_0186.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexuality">Wikipedia:WikiProject Sexuality</a> and ask, "Is there any way we can improve these articles? I have some ideas about reorganizing them." You didn't do that, you came up with an argument based entirely on the articles' <i>titles</i> and not their <i>content</i>, and now you're trying to reach consensus on the basis of that wholly inappropriate argument, not giving an inch, even though you have long since conceded that the content belongs on Wikipedia. <i>You just don't like the article name.</i> Please don't waste people's time like this in the future. It's very frustrating to deal with the articles that truly do not belong. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:01, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do not have a problem with an article entitled "handjob", but an article as such needs to be about the slang term, as with <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>. Obviously, some people are not willing to give an inch to concede this and are highly connected to <a href="../../../h/a/n/Handjob.html" title="Handjob">Handjob</a> as presently constituted. <a href="../../../c/y/b/User%7ECyberAnth_1ea4.html" title="User:CyberAnth">CyberAnth</a> 00:48, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That simply makes no sense whatsoever and has absolutely no basis in policy. If the topic itself exists and meets WP:V and WP:RS, which <i>hand jobs</i> -- manual manipulation of the penis -- certainly does, then naming should be per <a href="../../../n/c/_/WP%7ENC_b5d6.html" title="WP:NC">naming conventions</a> and at the "most common name", not at some made-up supercategory. Again, you are arguing that the article should be written such that it must be deleted, which is ridiculous, and basically bad faith. With your newest batch of noms, well, you're showing that collaborative processes are not in your kitbag. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Neutral</b> I agree with the nomination that the notability is divided between the business and the man, and individually each is really weak; collectively the notability is marginal.

Perhaps a rewrite could explain why he is notable other than the notability of his clients.

<li>It should also be borne in mind that ideally an AfD Del vote expresses the view that the topic named is inherently unencyclopedic, on the logic that otherwise reducing it to a stub would be appropriate. E.g., if the article reads like an ad, the probem is not that, but (possibly) that the thing advertised is either non-notable or non-verifiable. I'd guess that the standards for what constitutes consensus to delete reflects some kind of a point of balance between the collective outrage levels of the deletionists and of the inclusionists among dedicated editors. But the presumption of keep-worthiness is IMO a reflection of the options that remain after a de facto decision to keep, including the potential for saying "this hasn't improved since the last two deletion debates, so can those who said it was redeemable still say so with a straight face?" If you think this on a probably notable topic, so that the article is likely to be sufficiently improvable, IMO you should vote "keep" without needing to be sure, and if you're wrong, we'll eventually figure that out.<br />

<li><b>Keep <u>only after replacement of COPYVIO content</u></b> The Chelsea Flower Show is a contest with substantial significance in British culture.

I'm not used to these policies, so I go and read them each time, and it appears that this is nominated based upon Conflict of interest, which says that the editor is "irrelevant so long as" the article is otherwise worthy, and that the Google test should not stand alone. The capitalization should be corrected, but I don't understand that it is a cause for deletion. This is an interesting guy, fairly well known, if in an obscure field. As I said, I didn't know him by name, but the linguists I know are thrilled about this dude, the guy who translated <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> into Albanian, and courtesy of Wikipedia, I intend to name drop Kurti ASAP.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article describes quite a noteable person, so if we assume good faith there is no reason to delete the article. In addition, the fact that Amazon carries two books by him (both Albanian language books), and the independent recognition of his translation work in this thread are both evidence that the description in the article is accurate, and, therefore, noteable. <a href="../../../e/n/u/User%7EEnuja_0ca9.html" title="User:Enuja">Enuja</a> 02:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Nomination for deletion</b> No assertion of encyclopedic notability as far as I can tell. Subject is a 18th century colonial churchman. Article was created by new account User:Foleyef. The article mentions that the history of the Rheas is outlined in <i>"The Descendants of Rev. Joseph Rhea of Ireland" 1996 by Dr. Edward F. Foley</i>. Mr. Foley is described as "an amateur historian and a member of genealogical societies in South Carolina and Tennessee... [who is] married into the Rhea clan" in this <a href="http://www.heritagebooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=HBI&amp;Product_Code=F0526" class="external text" title="http://www.heritagebooks.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=HBI&amp;Product_Code=F0526" rel="nofollow">link</a>. Mr. Foley's genealogical project is no doubt a fine and well-intentioned one, but unfortunately there isn't sufficient assertion of encyclopedic notability as the article stands at the moment for inclusion in Wikipedia, I believe. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>Contested prod by <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> with the comments "<i>cleanup is done by editing or merging, not deleting</i>". However, there is nothing in these stubs which in any way suggests (whether in terms of height or construction) that these are but very pedestrian and uninteresting structures. The exception is Mont du Chat claims to have "<i>very special design. It consists of a concrete tower, which is surrounded by a lattice tower</i>", but does not explain why this construction is so special. Another editor has used the {{local|community}} tag on it. I say "Yawn". There is ample precedence for deletion of this collection of useless stubs.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The tower at Mont du Chat, in Savoy, may be viewed in the article <a href="http://panneauxcols.free.fr/Relais/relais.htm" class="external text" title="http://panneauxcols.free.fr/Relais/relais.htm" rel="nofollow">"Les relais hertziens"</a>, it does not appear exceptional, just one of a common radio tower type. The Salbert Transmission Tower is more interesting from an architectural point of view. Image at <a href="http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0013691" class="external text" title="http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?ID=s0013691" rel="nofollow">"Salbert Transmission Tower"</a>. My problem is that this AfD is just for four of a large class of articles that detail radio masts, see <a href="../../../g/u/y/Category%7EGuyed_masts_a8db.html" title="Category:Guyed masts">Category:Guyed masts</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Category%7EMast_stubs_4f1c.html" title="Category:Mast stubs">Category:Mast stubs</a>, most of the articles are at present of the short type like these five, but some are quite detailed like <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swisscom-Sendeturm_St._Chrischona_890b.html" title="Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona">Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona</a> which is on the request for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Swisscom-Sendeturm_St._Chrischona_a074.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona">deletion list of 29 December</a>. I find these infinitely more valuable than stubs about individual Eurovision song titles, but I would classify them similarly, namely of particular interest to a small group of widely geographically separated individuals. As such I would question the "of local interest only" tag. In many ways they might be compared to the articles about individual botanical and zoological species. Now rather than piecemeal pick at these radio tower articles, it might be appropriate to ask those interested to develop guidelines for inclusion of individual tower articles, as opposed to general articles like maybe, Radio Towers of France, or maybe by mountain range Radio Towers of the Pyrenees. The general articles could have tables that provide the information now provided by these stubs, and where a full article is appropriate, say like <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swisscom-Sendeturm_St._Chrischona_890b.html" title="Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona">Swisscom-Sendeturm St. Chrischona</a>, then they could provide a link. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 18:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The continued push to cleanup appears to be flushing out a good, sensible debate, but we have yet to hear from those who planted the stubs. Of course, views of those creators are welcome, but they must only help shape and not override wikipedia's policies. I have tried to make my approach and justifications clear, and I had hoped that <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">my essay</a> would help further that understanding. I felt that these masts (above) were slightly different from those delete before <i>en masse</i> in that they are not the huge American monsters, and that someone clearly opposed their deletion per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>, so I took the liberty of listing them separately. I would appreciate it if you wouldn't hold me responsible for the [over]zealous efforts of other editors wanting to delete all masts in an undiscriminating manner. I would urge you to concentrate discussion on the deletions proposed here. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Yes, if those who created the articles would say in the first place what was notable, as Bejnar has just done, these continual discussions would not be necessary. I do not think there would be objection to keeping articles about structures that can be shown to be of particular interest by outside documentation. So I'd say</li>

<p>Bundling these three dealings by Hitler with particular Jews under the title Adolf Hitler's contacts with Jewish people is a clear case of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> and therefor does not belong in Wikipedia. As one can see in the reference list none of the sources deal with contacts of Hitler with Jews in general. The three dealings should be and probably are included in the respective biography articles, the interaction with the doctor may also be included under possible sources for Hitler's antisemitism. The latter is also a clear secondary focus of the article. This lack of focus is another reason to delete it. <a href="../../../g/i/d/User%7EGidonb_d5ad.html" title="User:Gidonb">gidonb</a> 03:06, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>For anyone reading the article and wondering what IZAK is talking about, it takes a bit of review of the history of the article in question. Although the huge redlinks that initially spurred some of IZAK's remarks are no longer evident in the article, they're painfully visible just 24 hours before this AfD was opened. The fact that they're no longer there should not be construed as a rationale for dismissing his opinion, since red links themselves are not the core of his opposition. Any further defense of IZAK's position I'll leave in his capable hands. &#160;:-) <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 05:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Is the subject worthy of the coverage it received? No, it's not. The sources that covered it are extremely questionable in this case.

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Tarinth. I looked at the references and read through the referenced articles. For the most part they appear to be independent of the subject and the discussions are non-trivial.

The reason blogs can't be used as a reliable source for information is the lack of editorial oversight and the fact that its a self-published source.

<dd>The notability guidelines specifically address reprints of the press release. It makes no exception for how many or who reprints the press release.

<dd>As its been pointed out Next-gen is trivial coverage per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> very clearly addressed as just a brief summary of the content of the site and a reprint of the press release.

<dd>The following statement is linked from the bottom of every page in what you are calling the "GameDaily blog": <a href="http://www.gamedaily.com/contact-us" class="external free" title="http://www.gamedaily.com/contact-us" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamedaily.com/contact-us</a> . This page documents an editorial staff. The top of every page includes an American Online an logo. Further, I'm unable to find any disclaimer that states that "blog" content does not reflect the opinions of the editorial staff. Even if this editorial information was only linked from the main page of the GameDaily site, I would argue that it is unreasonable to ask that every sub-section of a site contain a separate assertion of editorial authority. It's clear that the staff and writers of any part of the site are subject to management by an editorial staff, and ultimately answerable to the corporate oversite of America Online. A similar structure is common in many websites in general, and the gaming media in particular. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 21:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think we can all agree a blog is a self-published source. For it not to be a self-published source it needs to include an assertion of editorial oversight. The burden of evidence is on the person wanting the information included, not those wanting it removed. While every page doesn't need any assertion of editorial oversight (like a general story like other stories that write has done and I linked to) any section would could be seen as self-published do. As it is we don't know HOW they run the blog section of their website, so it makes the source suspect. Since we have no other source out there to bolster its credibility that makes it even more suspect. If we had a few other good sources that clearly demonstrated notability, it would lend credibility to the blog entry, and you could be more lax on requiring a mention of editorial oversight. Which is kind of the way that works. There is more than one way you can lend credibility to a blog to be used as a source, but it needs something. Even with something, its still only a single mention at best. Reviewing WP:WEB and the Next-gen article its clearly addressed by WP:WEB as being trivial. It only describes the content and the rest of it is a reprint of the press release.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:02, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I wouldn't agree to that at all. If it was his personal blog, on his myspace or livejournal or something, then I would agree. This blog is part of an established company's website, and it would make sense to me that there would be editorial oversight on a commercial page. JN322 05:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The burden of evidence lies with those who want the material in. We have no idea how that site works and unless there is some evidence to how it works, the source becomes dubious, but even still we don't have a second source.

<dd>Let me pose a hypothetical to you then. If a prosecutor calls a witness who states "I saw the defendant commit the crime". Then you would argue that the witness's testimony shouldn't be admitted until the prosecution can somehow prove the witness isnt' moved by mercenary motives or isn't some sort of pathological liar? From this matter stands presently it would appear to me that it is an internet publication of AOL (certainly well-known and independant of GuildCafe) and the website's contents has editors (thereby editorial insight), and accordingly it is reliable, and would fall under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> #3. But then again, I'm not too familiar with these rules. (forgive my poor grammer, I just got home from a lacrosse game and I'm still a bit alcoholified)JN322 06:49, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>No. In this case we have a source which is normally not allowed at all, a blog. Regardless of where its hosted. These are typically only allowed as sources in a very limited capacity in sourcing something about the writer, i.e. the author of that article warranted an article on wikipedia and announced he had cancer in it, that could be used as a source for that. In order for it to be used as a source for anything else it has to meet one of the criteria in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> which give it credibility, so far it only meets things which take away from credibility, namely the fact that no other site has deemed the subject notable enough for any in depth coverage. One can easily assume that in a publication the stories which are "printed" as stories have editors. If you want to draw the conclusion that that means all blog postings have editors and get their content approved, you can do that, but you need something to back it up. As I pointed out above, it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to say "Post what you want so long as its not anything that is going to get the company in trouble".--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:17, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess since you don't want to look at his blog as having editorial insight (which is your guess, and something we still dont' know for sure yet) then Under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> we have <b>"When a well-known, professional researcher writing within his or her field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications..."</b>. The author of that blog is a well-known net journalist covering gaming information (he's not interviewing presidents, but he's ceratainly a professional in his field). Accordingly since the author of the article is an established online journalist, even his blog can be said to be a reliable source. JN322 02:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And what is it you're using to establish that he's a well known journalist? As far as Steven wong's go, he doesn't show up to the second page <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Steven+Wong%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Steven+Wong%22&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. And he seems to have written only a very tiny amount of articles for gamedaily <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Steven+Wong%22+site:gamedailyxl.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Steven+Wong%22+site:gamedailyxl.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Most of those results are pages which have "most recent bloggers" listed on the right hand column. He only made his first blog post in november, and doesn't seem to really be there before that. Simply writing a couple articles for an internet game site doesn't make one a well known journalist. See <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter_S._Thompson_04b5.html" title="Hunter S. Thompson">Hunter S.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cite</b>. This is a stupid reason to delete this article. This is just a partial list of links to Wikipedia articles on copyrighted works and with some information on them, which is common in Wikipedia. There are already articles about emulation and ROMs, which are indisputably illegal. Wikipedia already has lists of old video games, which SeizureDog believes are lists of games that people can search for to steal. If the vast majority of the fan translations are not notable, then the vast majority of the games in the list are what many are unlikely to steal. Deleting this article will do you no good against piracy. Deleting this is like deleting other game lists. Fan translations are distributed with only the translated data and the directives for where it is to be placed in the original copyright material, without the original copyrighted material itself. Even though "fan translations are indisputablly illegal", the article <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_translation.html" title="Fan translation">fan translation</a> also points out "it is unusually for copyright holders to object." For verifiability, I suggest you use Romhacking.net to cite whether the game is fan translated. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 08:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>"Fan translations are distributed with only the translated data and the directives for where it is to be placed in the original copyright material, without the original copyrighted material itself."<br />
So you take the illegal translation patch and put it into the illegal ROM copy. I hardly see how that's any better. The simple fact is, this list is not useful for anyone who doesn't plan on searching for these patches, who shouldn't be in the first place.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 09:51, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The illegality of the game is accounted for the original ROM itself. There are already lists of games for people to steal. There are already lists of games for discontinued platforms. When they read the article on a game that is no longer commercially exploited, they might steal it. Therefore, deleting this article will do you no good. Copyright holders usually do not object to fan translations, which have been on the Internet a long time. The fan translation community also has an anti-piracy attitude, which may have made copyright holders turn a blind eye. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedius_Zanarukando_3729.html" title="User:Tedius Zanarukando">Decimus Tedius Regio Zanarukando</a> 09:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not following your logic. A list of games that include stealable games (such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nintendo_64_games_2a3b.html" title="List of Nintendo 64 games">List of Nintendo 64 games</a>) is not the same thing as a list of games you can't play without breaking international copyright laws. The fact that copyright owners turn a blind eye carries no weight on Wikipedia. Anyways, let's forget I used the word "steal". It may not be theft, but this list certainly promotes copyright infringement.--<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 10:09, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

The article on <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_translation.html" title="Fan translation">fan translation</a> is bad enough, but this is a list of (at least mostly) non-notable fan translations of games, which doesn't justify the existence of the list. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 09:59, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>- I don't agree with all of SeizureDog's reasons for nominating this article. Firstly, we should not be deleting content simply because people might misuse it. Secondly, even if all the translated games are copyright infringements, that does not make the list itself a copyright infringement. Nevertheless I say <i>delete</i> because in my opinion such a list is unencyclopedic. It's an indiscriminate collection of information and that is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> what Wikipedia is about. By all means include a small selection of the most relevant fan-translated games in the <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_translation.html" title="Fan translation">fan translation</a> article and maybe an external link to a fuller listing, but just because the fan translation phenomenon exists does not mean we need to slavishly record each and every instance of it. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk"><font color="maroon"><b>Reyk</b></font></a> <sub><a href="../../../r/e/y/User_talk%7EReyk_b86e.html" title="User talk:Reyk"><b><font color="blue">YO!</font></b></a></sub> 10:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I object to the deletion. Many of the games on that list are notable or becoming notable. Japan-exclusive computer and video games are historically non-notable in English speaking worlds. There are justifications for this list. I might say that the list should include only fan translations that are notable or becoming notable. An alternative to deletion is to merge with the article <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fan_translation.html" title="Fan translation">fan translation</a>, and include only the notable fan translations.

<p>I would first draw attention to comments made the last time this was debated [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_characters_in_translations_of_Harry_Potter" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_characters_in_translations_of_Harry_Potter" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>]. Having done that, i would draw attention to the irony that these lists represent one of the best collections of such information I have seen, and thus a unique contribution to the very wide field of general interest in the subject of Harry potter. Most of our content on Hp, while informative, is not unique. From the scholarly point of view this actually represents a resource as an example of how concepts in one book have been translated into different languages. So, as I say, an irony that people should seek to delete it as 'fancruft'. Well, yes, perhaps that is exactly how the work of university professors of literature ought to be described.</p>
<p>The other specific importance of (parts) of these pages was to the ongoing puzzle set by Rowling at the end of the most recent book, as to the identity of a character known solely as RAB. The cross referencing of characters names in different languages is one of the more important, and officially verifiable, ways of eliminating candidates (by having the wrong translated initials).</p>

<p>Mikka is wrong. This is not fandom. It is real world information. CJ King is wrong. The point is to record the international reach of the world’s most popular literature series. YechielMan is wrong. The lists are needed as a resource for subsequent improvement Fbv65edel: The existence of information outside wikipedia is no reason to remove that information from wikipedia.. What is the point of “merge”? The question is “delete”. Yes or no. John Reaves, like Mikka is wrong in that the information is not ficticious, fantasy speculative creation. It is real world information. It is data that should be allowed to evolve from a draft into a good article. Muhaha is wrong. Most of the information does not belong in a dictionary. Kappa; Robert Ullmann; Sjakkalle: By “Transwiki” I assume you mean “do not delete”. Agreed, the information has worth, even if it looks like appendix data at the moment. DGG: Agree. It is easy to see future use of the information. I also note that the page is almost two years old. Lets not be hasty.

This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia.

<p>Self Written&#160;?? this was written by me.. my name is Paul Iddon,, so why say the article was self written&#160;? the aticle has come about because I added Sam Han lee to the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddha_claimants" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddha_claimants" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Buddha_claimants</a></p>
<p>Although someone keeps deleting it,, what is it about&#160;? List of Buddha Claimants&#160;? If someone claims to be buddha then they go on that page&#160;? So why keep deleting it.. Sam Han Lee not only claims to be Buddha, but is the only one who has any proof.. proof by having the third eye on his forehead,,,, proof in his actions that he travels non stop around the world teaching others,,, proof in his words that nobody can deny, proof that he is the only one that does not "sell" or profit from teaching.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I believe there is some notability here. ( My third eye tells me so! LOL) It seems to me that the author has a bit of a language barrier that he/she may be struggling with. The author needs guidance regarding appropriate writing style and standards for Wikipedia. Perhaps some editors who have worked on articles related to mysticism and Buddha can take a look at this and give the author some help? I sense there is something here worth saving. <a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleo123_d48f.html" title="User:Cleo123">Cleo123</a> 08:36, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, so she does. Still it seems like an arbitrary criterion with no reasons offered to explain why it qualifies a performer as famous. There are hundreds of porn stars like Franklin who have these horribly written stubs about them on Wikipedia simply because they appeal sexually to some contributor. Drafting the pornbio notability criteria was a good-minded effort at cleaning out some of these stubs by subjecting them to several clearly stated guidelines. However that effort is merely a codification of the judgement that minor porn stars (performers who make movies for several years, keep their real names private, and never break into the "mainstream" world of acting) should probably be excluded. An article about one of these stars, especially one that includes a useless and graphic transcription of a lesbian sex scene but does not offer any real biographical details, not even a filmography, is basically a crappy stub with no reason to exist. ˉˉ<sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnetode_cbff.html" title="User:Anetode"><b>anetode</b></a></sup><a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnetode_6721.html" title="User talk:Anetode">╦╩</a> 06:12, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The ICCA is certainly a legitimate competition. Having participated in six ICCA events, I can say they consist of the best collegiate a cappella. It is also not restricted to 22 groups. Last year over 100 groups participated in the semi-final round, with even more applying to reach this level of competition.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, placing in an international collegiate competition does seem marginally notable. The conflict of interest is a problem, but is not a reason for deletion.

<p>I'm telling you people I, and others, will do what it takes to make this page as unbiased as can be. Please let me know what part of this page shows a conflict of interest. Also, the competition is considered the biggest of its kind for this type of music, so placing 2nd out of 22 (not even looking at past results) is a huge deal to people in this field of music. Also, this page is NO different than any other collegiate a cappella's wikipedia page. I do not see what the difference is between those groups and this one.</p>

<dd>As far as the "major competition" criteria, the ICCA does seem to be major, but the Chorduroys do not appear to have placed in the usual sense, as in the overall <i>final</i> competition.

<dd>The "conflict of interest" refers not to specific content in the article, but to the fact that there is an inherent conflict of interest in members of a group editing the article about that group.

<p>I had originally <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PRODed</a> this article in early December 2006. My reason was: <i>"While certainly tragic, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not the place for memorials</a>. Currently doesn't meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and searchs for Fletcher and leukaemia produce 67 hits on google mainly as memorials to his death; Needs to assert notability through <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable non-tivial sources</a> besides being missed."</i> The prod was removed and there was mention at the talk that there would be further sourcing. I have contacted said user recently, but haven't heard back yet. As I mentioned on the talk page, the statement that he was involved with charities was never confirmed, just an article that mentioned that he present a trophy at a regalla race. -- <a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoeron_c492.html" title="User:Moeron"><font color="darkblue" size="2" face="Constantia"><b>moe.RON</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../m/o/e/User_talk%7EMoeron_169b.html" title="User talk:Moeron"><b><font color="red"><i>Let's talk</i></font></b></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moeron_ba14.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moeron"><b><font color="green"><i>done</i></font></b></a></sup> 05:23, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>...which appears to be the inside-page spread of the EDP, 17th November 2006.</p>
<p>Although I cannot confirm its authenticity personally, it looks perfectly legitimate, and has many important quotes supporting the case for {WPBio}, including:</p>
<p><i>'...working with the Anthony Nolan Trust across many fundraising events.'</i> --Reverieuk 19:13, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>'The young man was an inspiration</i> ' - on the subject of the Regatta and subsequent registering of every member of the U16s Sudbury Rugby Team on the bone marrow donors register.</p>
<p><i>'...throughout his life, which he spent raising awareness for his illness...'</i></p>
<p>Thus, as <a href="../../../e/j/1/User%7EEj159_1d9d.html" title="User:Ej159">User:ej159</a> stated on the disscusion page <i>'The criterion that Mathew complies with is of being "[a person] achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" as he was involved in much charity work and featured many times in the Eastern Daily Press.'</i> is now sourced.</p>
<p>Your thoughts on this? --Reverieuk 19:14, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>As a side note I think the original close as delete was fine, since the only keep opinion did not give a meaningful reason to keep the article.

<li>I'm pretty sure the original closure would have been endorsed at DRV but I figured it'd be easier to just get five more delete votes so there'd be no argument against a strong consensus. Also I dislike how even though DRV is supposed to be meta-discussion about the procedure of the closure, in practice it's often more of an appeals process where DRV participants voice their own opinions on whether to delete. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small>2007-01-02 06:20Z</small></i></span></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As the author of the page, I of course have a bias. But when I look at other bios for other news anchors or media, what makes them any more important? The fact they work in a larger more popular city as New York? Shall we delete Shepard Smith? I wonder if coming from a unimportant state as Arkansas makes one not as worthy of a bios. I had researched Miss Sheats info and it was not just a simple thrown togethr stub like a lot of wiki entries are. I don't see deletions of articles are that are one line sentences. In the catagory of Television Presenters, some of which are LOCAL news people, here is but a few articles that you must delete if you want to be considered fair and unpartial</li>

<li>For what its worth, having looked at a few of these articles I agree that at least some of them should be deleted on the same grounds as the Jancey Sheats article. Please feel free to nominate those articles for deletion too. That being said we are talking about the Jancey Sheats article here and the question is: does <i>this</i> article meet Wikipedia's standards. The fact that there are other articles that don't meet our standards can never be an excuse to let this article slide. Its only an argument to discuss the deletion of those articles too.

<li>I may be a fool, but what makes one more notable than another? The info in this article was researched. It is verifable. It was not created by Miss Sheats, so it is not self promoting.

<li><b>Comment</b> The reason I listed this AfD is, simply put, there are way too many local television personalities in the United States for every single one of them to have a page. Should Jancey's co-anchor have a page? What about their weekend team? All the anchors at the other stations in Little Rock as well? All the other stations in Arkansas? The Southeast? I give credit for the work done on the article, but it's simply not about a notable subject as per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> -- think of it this way... is somebody in, say, Montana going to know who Jancey Sheats is? <a href="../../../a/m/n/User%7EAmnewsboy_59fc.html" title="User:Amnewsboy">Amnewsboy</a> 01:20, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Point taken, but half the articles in Wikipedia go the route that some, somewhere in this world will not know or care about some subject. We have a very large article on lightsabers. While for some this might be a much needed or interesting article, there are many that couldn't care less and might think it is a waste of time and space. While Jancey might not be popular or known in Montana or Michigan, she is known in Arkansas and Texas. Who's to say people in those states might not want a article on her? We have articles on governors or local politicians that most would have no desire knowing about, but they still exist <a href="../../../k/e/r/User%7EKerusso_d23d.html" title="User:Kerusso">Kerusso</a> 02:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This script is only used by the game GraalOnline, which is in itself a non-notable game (the article was deleted at AfD as failing <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, then endorsed at DRV once immediately after the close, then endorsed again only recently - I can't find the links because the DRV archiving system isn't great...)

<dd>Heh. The "misnomers" category in Wiktionary is rather small. IMO, this is because no one could agree on what a misnomer is. Wiktionary's own definitions are: "The wrong name or term", which depends on one's notion of "wrong"; "An unsuitable or misleading name (for something)." which is just a bit less subjective and in line with the working definition in the present article; "<i>(Wiktionary jargon)</i> A term whose sense in common usage conflicts with a technical sense." which reflected the way people categorizing things as misnomers seemed to be using the term; "<i>(non-standard: see usage notes)</i> Something that is not true; a myth.". The usage notes just say that the usage is considered incorrect.</dd>
<dd>So not much help there. Eventually the category fell out of favor and most of the items tagged misnomer were untagged. This is yet another battle in the long-running descriptivist/prescriptivist war in Wiktionary land. The descriptivists appear to have won that one (full disclosure -- I'm a descriptivist ex-Wiktionarian).</dd>
<dd>A wider-ranging discussion of what a misnomer might or might not be, with examples, was considered more appropriate to Wikipedia, and I tend to concur. I would like to see more of a discussion than just a raw list, but I strongly lean toward trying to fix the article rather than gunning it. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a> 05:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I dislike the original laundry list of "Why do we park on driveways and drive on parkways?" trifles, and I particularly dislike the "I know something you don't" angle, which is always very selectively applied to things the particular critic happens to know. However, there are a couple of interesting phenomena at work here. First is the process of linguistic change (by which, for example, the term <i>steamroller</i> comes to be applied to something that doesn't run on steam, but we <i>don't</i> call any train engine a <i>steam engine</i>). Second is the selectivity by which only <i>some</i> of the many, many possible candidates actually come to be regarded as misnomers. Some have complained that the list given is too long, but what stands out to me is how <i>short</i> it is.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>A misnomer is something that "everybody" uses incorrectly, but "everybody else" knows is "wrong". If I decide to get on a high horse about "down" no longer referring to hills, that's my own private crotchet. But if a generation of school teachers teaches that Koala bears (as they were once called even in Australia) aren't bears, or a widely-read language maven claims that "awesome" should only refer to things inspiring awe, <i>then</i> we've got ourselves a misnomer. This is a social phenomenon worth noting, and it's not material for a wiktionary definition.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is why I went to the trouble to try to categorize the raw list and to try to tease out what does and doesn't constitute a misnomer (taking into account other editors' edits to my changes&#160;:-). Whether this is cataloging or original research is a bit fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure that actual psycholinguists have studied this same phenomenon. Which is why I left a hook for such research in the intro.</dd>

<dd>I've been able to scrape up a couple of citations. I would expect that Western psycholinguists are not particularly concerned with "misnomers" per se, but lump it in with the larger question of the perception of "correct" usage.</dd>
<dd>Here are a the cites so far. The first one appears the more relevant: "Ghotra,Balvinder S . On riding the phenomenon of borrowing of misnomers . Indian Linguistics . Vol.61(1-4), pp.9-12 ." (found on <a href="http://www.languageinindia.com/jan2003/indicarticles.html" class="external free" title="http://www.languageinindia.com/jan2003/indicarticles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.languageinindia.com/jan2003/indicarticles.html</a>). "Misnomer and the acceptance of misnomers as right ones" (<a href="http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/qikan/periodical.Articles/hfgydxxb-shkx/hfgy2004/0405/040529.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/qikan/periodical.Articles/hfgydxxb-shkx/hfgy2004/0405/040529.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wanfangdata.com.cn/qikan/periodical.Articles/hfgydxxb-shkx/hfgy2004/0405/040529.htm</a>), main article is in Chinese. -<a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmh_6fde.html" title="User:Dmh">Dmh</a></dd>

<p>Following precedents (see <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts</a> for fuller list) of mast stub deletions, I'm nominatiing this batch of US masts below 520m in height. None of the masts that I am nominating are notable in any way whatsoever, as far as I can tell. Most stubs are over a year old, and have remained in the same, sorry vegetative state since creation. None of these articles have any substantial additional information other than their name, location and height. This information already exists albeit in more concise but no less informative tabular form in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a>, so I see no point in redirecting. <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:00, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whilst I've generally agreed with most of the mass removal that has gone on here, and thank you for your effort, I'm interested at what point you intend to stop. When do these become notable for their height alone, whether or not they are stubs? I also believe that greater clarity and definiteness on this point will help you gain support for whichever remaining ones you intend to nominate, as several people clearly feel we are nearing that point. <a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkihabara_ccca.html" title="User:Akihabara">Akihabara</a> 08:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Replying to Akihabara's comment, I can't speak for Ohconfucius, but I don't see a reason to set a height limit for notability - if the article only contains the info from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_masts.html" title="List of masts">List of masts</a> then scrap the article. If there is more to be said about a mast, which can't fit into the list, then it gets its own page. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquiddy_078f.html" title="User:Squiddy">Squiddy</a> | <a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquiddy_b0de.html" title="User talk:Squiddy"><small>(squirt ink?)</small></a> 14:24, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> - and, as in the prior prods (in answer to Akihabara) it doesn't appear that height alone has been a criteria in these, as long as there was something notable about the tower (architecture, history, notable controversy) it was removed from the AfD and handled on its own. <a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH"><font color="green">SkierRMH</font></a>,<font color="purple">00:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</font></li>

<p>Following the same principles established as precedent (see <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts</a>), I am seeking consensus on these two shared masts. I do not believe that these are in any way different to the others which have been swept out of wikipedia, but am willing to be proven wrong. These masts appear to be in use by several small radio/tv stations. but AFAICT, they are still just two non-notable masts. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 07:14, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

These two tower articles are about particularly uninteresting towers, unlike some that have been put up recently for deletion. I am disheartened by the language of the requester in his article <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_Far2manymasts_c9a5.html" title="User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts">User:Ohconfucius/Far2manymasts</a>, where he says "I am not embarked on a vendetta or crusade, but merely performing a systematic purge." Before we perform a systematic purge, I think that we should ask the radio/television tower people to draft their own guidelines for what requires an individual tower article, and what can be satisfactorily dealt with in a table in a list article, or in a more detailed, but more general article such as Radio towers in France. In many ways I view these radio tower articles like the Eurvision song articles, I would classify them similarly, namely of particular interest to a small group of widely geographically separated individuals. In many ways they might be compared to the articles about individual botanical and zoological species. Now rather than piecemeal pick at these radio tower articles, let us get some guidelines. --<a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 19:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would appreciate it if you did not quote me out of context. The systematic purge is of useless stubs. Nobody so far has demonstrated how/why these stubs are useful, only that it <i>could be useful</i> or <i>someone might find it useful</i>, in a rather <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystal-ballish</a> fashion. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:18, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Does "freedom of speech" mean that you can go down to your local newspaper and demand that they print your manifesto? No? Then why does "freedom of speech" mean that Wikipedia needs to have an article about a website which can't demonstrate that it meets Wikipedia's pre-existing criteria for notability? Sorry, but the freedom-of-speech issue is a total red herring. There's no freedom of speech being impinged here. When someone is preventing you from saying what you want to say using <i>your own</i> resources, <i>then</i> there's a freedom of speech issue. This isn't one. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 07:25, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Find sources to state that CJ is as big as some users above claim it to be. According to alexa.org, it is in the mid 2000's rank or so. Thousands of websites are larger, and there surely arent thousands of article dedicated to every one of those articles that outrank CJ in terms of traffic. <sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I think this discussion has been poisoned by CJ, the website users there tend to be a bunch of wanna-be tough dudes and wanna-be sick people who think it's heroic to screw with a discussion with a legitimate website like Wikipedia. I saw if this fails, we do it again, most of the supporting users have no history at all with Wikipedia, and we ought to keep our eyes wide open for shill votes and arguments pulled from thin air.</p>

<li>Keep: Unless our function is to prevent those people who are too weak to prevent themselves from clicking on a site that might offend them. This is an information site, not a censor.

<li>Dictionary.com is an information site. Should it have an entry for consumptionjunction? Google Maps is an information site. Should it have an entry for consumptionjunction?

<li><b>Delete</b> with a chainsaw. There is nothing in this discussion that even mildly comes close to qualifying as a legitimate reason to keep it. Contrary to the claim that Wikipedia is an "information site", <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is, in fact, specifically <i>not</i> a collection of information</a>, it is an encyclopedia. The assertion that removing the article constitutes "censorship" is ludicrous--first because using that as a rationale for "keep" is a blatant admission that the WP article is nothing more than an advertisement, second because it clearly indicates an abject failure to understand the meaning of censorship. When WP goes out and tries to get this website shut down, then that silly argument will hold a little bit of water; until then, it's crazytalk. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 20:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Stile project has an entry, and no request that its entry be deleted. CJ is at least as prominent, and shares similar history and user base (mentioned online by Howard Stern, outrage over the Nick Berg video that garnered national media attention). At most, CJ should be combined into a single page for the SickSite Network, like StileNet's entry.</p>
<p><b>GALVINIZED KEEP FROM FORMER AND DISGRUNTLED CJ WRITER!</b> Humbly stated, for all this vaunted, anacronym laden attempted highbrow "discussion" and back and forth is clearly over an issue that is most certaintly not about what does or does not constitute a valid Wikipedia article, but rather what a minority of individuals find to be intellectually palitable. Oh how shallow the depths of the mind become in action; in the short and sweet, if CJ was a site representing a financial quarterly that just happened to pull in an estimated 1.4 million unique IP per day audience, I grately doubt there would be such a fuss to be made. Consumption Junction created a legitimate cultural phenomenon, and whether the fruits of its proliferation would be welcome in the living rooms of the happily veiled "Moral" financialy secure class is utterly irrelevant. If Wikipedia is to be a depository of information made "by actual and average/real" individuals, it is at best elitism and at worst blatant censorship/revisionism to so calously delete the existence of this very real part of american media and culture, regardless of the fact that the entry was put together extremely poorly and was in desperate need of copius amounts of re-working, most likely due to the fact that Aaron "Phil" Dinin was involved, and should probably made to wear a helmet when he leaves the house, as everything he touches on CJ instantly turns to a parodoxical mix of attempted low brow humor and hidden high society roots. I have read the words, in great majority, calling for the reinstatement of this article, and here I add mine, even though I left the site, even though I would rather practice corporal mortification than work with the current editorial administration, no one can take the site away from its millions of patrons, nor can they take away what it was, and what it may again be in the future. <b>Carlin</b></p>

<p>In what way is it vanity? For whom that is? implying that the artist himself wrote the entry? I find that highly unlikely, it may seem vanity but according to his forum he has some 600 odd registered members, and I draw the conclusion he has a much larger fanbase, and not only domestic but foreign as well (I for one am residing in Iceland and fans of his I know here reach perhaps triple digits.</p>
<p>And perhaps the sources are scarce due to the fact the artist strives to keep a low profile outside his published work.</p>
<p>Still, I have just finished registering to Wikipedia and if I am in any way misunderstanding the rules then I apologize.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by DagurKGJ (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_DagurKGJ_feb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/DagurKGJ">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a real artist and I have a few of his albums. The description of his prank calls is relatively accurate.

<li>You're right. I was misled by the article's wording (I'll edit it in a moment to make it clearer).

<li><b>Keep</b> With the many obscure articles here, I don't see why there'd be desire to delete someone like this out.

And for that matter, why shouldn't the site contain a directory of "big bust models and performers" (the definition of either of those terms being sketchy of course) when that is, let's face it, likely to be of interest to a fair number of people.

<li><b>Neutral</b>: Bornmann is certainly notable for his involvement in the Liberal Party in BC, the public relations industry in BC and the Paul Martin Liberal Leadership Campaign. However it is obvious that this page was first created by persons interested posting libelous information about Bornmann with a clear view to discrediting him in advance of the criminal trial where he is expected to testify on behalf of the Crown. The continuous and malicious posts of one or two posters has compelled a number of us to return to this page on a regular basis to make corrections. At this point it is fruitless to debate who started deleting what first, but it is safe to say that the ensuing discourse has very much resembled that seen on many other pages profiling politically active persons. While others may have different ideas I suggest that the neutral Bornmann page, which was locked for editting by a previous Admin in the spring, be reposted and again locked for editting (maybe until after the trial) or that the page be deleted. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERascalpatrol_d018.html" title="User:Rascalpatrol">rascalpatrol</a> 21:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> Both "The Teacher 101" and "Titus Pollo" have only contributed to <i>this page</i> and have no other presence in Wikipedia. This is typical of the manipulation of information by SPAs which has plagued the Bornmann page. I have been trying to shorten my vote/statement as it's fairly lengthy but may just post it in its entirety, as it explores the misleading and false claims made by such SPAs in the history of this page, and I do not put it past other supporters of Mr. Bornmann to create Wiki accounts to vote in this process <i>and for no other reason</i>, as The Teacher 101 and Titus Pollo have done. Such votes should be discounted as irrelevant. Deletion would only serve the interests of those who wish to conceal the record of information manipulation and censorship by covering-up their activities in undermining Wikipedia's integrity and content by systemic vandalism and POV opinionating.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:40, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Further comment</b> It's worth mentioning that the political party Mr. Bornmann belongs to is <i>well-known</i> for bulk membership drives in order to advance candidacies and otherwise manipulate party democratic processes. That they would seek to do the same on Wikipedia - signing up new members in order to influence a vote (see towards the end of <a href="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>- comes as no surprise to me at all.<a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkookum1_e767.html" title="User:Skookum1">Skookum1</a> 20:44, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, Restore, and Protect</b> This article’s uncensored, un-neutralized comments constitute<b>d</b> valid encyclopedia content regarding an important current legal case and political scandal which is in the news on a regular basis. I feel the suggestions to delete are redirect are based in the manipulated, "neutralized" content (to use rascalpatrol’s term) of its current status. I also feel rascalpatrol’s post above is manipulative and deceptive, as the materials he and others deleted from the page were not "libelous" but are immune from defamation proceedings by dint of being from public documents (police reports/press releases, court documents, news copy) (see [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel#Privilege_and_malice" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libel#Privilege_and_malice" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>]).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Issues of core wiki principles – non-censorship and freedom of speech as well as civility and other principals linked/appended below – should be critical in deliberating the value and survival of this article and those connected to it. It is not incidental that the "neutralizing" camp here has counterparts on <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">BC Legislature Raids</a> who regularly work to keep Mr. Bornmann’s name from <i>that</i> article as well, or indeed any significant and already well-publicized and well-documented details currently made vague or left out entirely, as well as entirely valid media links and cites which were deleted by the Bornmann faction (on the basis that, in one case, the author belonged to a different political party). The allegation that occurs repeatedly in <a href="../../../e/r/i/Talk%7EErik_Bornmann_9b71.html" title="Talk:Erik Bornmann">Talk:Erik Bornmann</a> and in edit histories of that page and its article is that a concerted effort is being made to discredit Mr. Bornmann, which is entirely unfounded, as are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Crown_Witness" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Crown_Witness" rel="nofollow">allegations by his supporters/promoters in the talk page that those attempting to add relevant materials are in league with “those criminaly charged” (sic)</a>, when in the course of posts on the talkpage rascalpatrol (now deleted, or hidden in deleted materials) describe themslves as a group of people who are actively seeking to patrol and “neutralize” the article. There is a fine line between neutralization and censorship, but "neutralization" as used by rascalpatrol <i>et al.</i> means nothing like what <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> is supposed to mean in Wiki; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> can be observed so long as only materials in police documents, court evidence etc or concerning the public interest are what’s there.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>To delete this article on the grounds that it (currently) contains nothing worthwhile would be to unwittingly collaborate with a campaign of active and admitted censorship of material that, although unbeknownst to you outside of BC, concerns the public interest and is not a personal matter as rascalpatrol and others maintain that it is. Redirecting it to <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">BC Legislature Raids</a> is currently a non-starter partly because that article has <i>also</i> been persistently "neutralized" (as rascalpatrol puts it) by supporters of Mr. Bornmann, and also because each of the principal players in the case will (eventually) have as detailed an account here as well.. Admittedly Mr. Bornmann is and was not an elected official as with other political bios, but he is still a prominent party supporter/activist as well as a corporate lobbyist involved with the sale of public assets and with companies doing business with the government – and the sale of assets in question (the <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crown_corporation.html" title="Crown corporation">Crown-owned</a> <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Rail_8b62.html" title="BC Rail">BC Rail</a> was eventually sold to American-owned <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_National_Railways_eeab.html" title="Canadian National Railways">Canadian National Railways</a>, not Mr. Bormann's client <a href="../../../o/m/n/OmniTRAX_b004.html" title="OmniTRAX">OmniTRAX</a>) was and is a highly controversial sale the debate over which is still on the public agenda. Mr. Bornmann is a public figure whether he wants to be or not!! Backroom politics <i>is still politics</i>. Other lobbyists and party organizers in the US and Canada and other countries have valid Wiki articles that have not (always) been so "massaged" and worked-over.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The entire scandal is also framed by <a href="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" class="external text" title="http://bctrialofbasi-virk.blogspot.com/2006/12/robin-mathews-fifth-part-rcmp-raids-on.html" rel="nofollow">mounting allegations of a cover-up</a>. The mutilation of the Bornmann article which has resulted in the circumstance of this AFD has greater consequences which should be considered in this light: i.e. deletion would be an unwitting cooperation with politically partisan cover-up efforts and "information washing" as much as tolerating the existing "neutralized" version of the page. It is not only Mr. Bornmann’s reputation that’s at stake here, it’s a matter of the public record and of civil democracy. Only POV material on Mr. Bornmann should be deleted (including the flummery that’s there now) - but NPOV <i>citable</i> material should be restored, <i>and protected</i>. Rascalpatrol and his allies also repeatedly and <i>falsely</i> alleged I am a returnee from previous edit wars on the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96914601&amp;oldid=96858857" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96914601&amp;oldid=96858857" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> and have throughout the history of the page deleted talkpage comments by their opponents (including the section linked in the second reference just previous, which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96915014&amp;oldid=96861110" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AErik_Bornmann&amp;diff=96915014&amp;oldid=96861110" rel="nofollow">bulk deletion by Randy3</a> with the PAIN comment "a mind is an awful thing to loose" (sic), and this deletion was discussed approvingly and further disparaging comments made by Randy3, another Bornmann supporter or "patroller" like rascalpatrol and SaintNickIX and JGGardiner) claiming that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Erik_Bornmann#Editing" rel="nofollow">I am just a returned former opponent in the page</a> (along with another disparaging comment), which is quite ridiculous and can be proven by an examination of my User Contributions as to the date I first edited the article, and admins could confirm that my IP address has not contributed to that article under any other alias.

<dd>NB: Deletion of this article will result in destruction of the edit history, which documents what constitutes a history of active and deliberate censorship, media muzzling and cover-up of the broader scandal surrounding the subject of this article by accomplices and allies of same – the story of the cover-up is itself becoming part of the <a href="../../../b/c/_/BC_Legislature_Raids_9885.html" title="BC Legislature Raids">Ledgegate scandal</a>, and the attempts to censor this and related webpages can only be seen as part of that cover-up. Any deletion will, in effect, serve as part of the cover-up effort every bit as much as the euhemerization and bowdlerization of this article’s contents to its current state of flummery and irrelevance. The repeated deletions of any newscopy related to the case and their replacement by Mr. Bornmanns’ personal photo gallery speaks volumes as to the priorities and ethics of those who have been “patrolling” and “neutralizing” this page.

I am not soapboxing - I am standing up for genuinely NPOV principles and for "the right of the the public to know"; I do not have a partisan affiliation, unlike the SPAs who have perpetrated this fiasco, and only intervened in the interests of fairness and open information because of my interest in fully covering BC political history in Wikipedia, as part of my extensive contributions in history, geography, and biography as well as in many other areas of interest - I have over <b>12,000 edits</b> in Wikipedia and entire and extensive bodies of infrastructure/topic content are due to my participation. Omar Jack, rascalpatrol et al. have done nothing to contribute to Wikipedia other than violating several of the above-cited Wikipedia principles. This is not a partisan cause; it is a case involving open democracy and freedom of information, being painted by those seeking to conceal it as if it were simply a personal matter, and they regularly denounce anyone disagreeing with them with "soapboxing" and worse. The insinuation in Omar Jack's post above that "I am a person with an interest in the BC Rail trial", as if I were another principal or player in the case, is <b>outrageous</b>, as even more is <i>Wikipedia should not be a forum for parties embroiled in a criminal trial</i> - these are clear examples the <a href="../../../p/a/i/WP%7EPAIN_2701.html" title="WP:PAIN">WP:PAIN</a> this cadre have perpetrated in the article's talk page and thoughout the edit comments of the article. It also makes a mockery of their various allegations that those seeking to present a complete article are indulging in slander and libel, as Omar Jack's comments clearly fall into that category (since I am not a party "embroiled in a criminal trial". Why should a citizen not be interested in the suspect sale of BC Rail and the police reports which document Mr. Bornmann's own admitted attempt to influence it on behalf of OmniTRAX? I am not a person "of interest" as Omar Jack implies (without directly saying so): I am citizen wanting the public record concerning these events, of which Wikipedia is a part, to be full and complete.

<li><b>Comment</b> Everybody makes a first post sometime. I would suggest that Wikipedia would not be so successful if everyone that posted for the first time was attacked as I have been. If you disagree with me, just say so. I think my post is rather uncontroversial, especially for this article. BTW, the fact that the Georgia Straight has covered the issue is indicative of how much of a partisan issue this is.

<li><b>Comment</b> I do not think "Skookum1" will be happy until we have a page dedicated to Skookum1's understanding of Erik Bornman and other matters. Am I the only one who sees the hypocrisy of this user lecturing this discussion on the inappropriateness of using wikipedia as a battleground? I post on this page because it appears the only way to deal with the high volume of FALSE and OPINION information routinely added by a very small number of posters (Skookum1 included).

<li><b>Comment</b> As much as I'm tempted to not reply, given the absurdity of your counter-allegations, but speaking of "false" your allegation/insinuation above that I am one of the charged in the trial in question is <b>very offensive</b> and utterly <b>false</b>. It is not even opinion, it is <i>cant</i> and typical of the paranoid behaviour of the Bornmannite faction on the article's talkpage and in its edit history comments. It is also clear from the response of the other Wikipedians above that I am not the only one who wants to see this article dealt with properly, instead of shuffled off into the dustbin as you want it to be. You're not saving face at this point, you're embarrassing yourself. This is really getting tiresome; I'm not the first regular Wikipedian to work on this page, just the first to not give up when it became very evident that a "very small number of posters" (yourself included) have been attacking anyone who dares disagree with your version of what the article's content should be.

<li><b>Delete</b>: My two cents: the fact that "Skookum1" wrote <i>"It's worth mentioning that the political party Mr. Bornmann belongs to is well-known for bulk membership drives in order to advance candidacies and otherwise manipulate party democratic processes."</i> just shows how partisan his intent is. This is the Liberal Party we're talking about, not some obscure anti-democratic entity. Clearly the entry/profile of this one organizer is being used to tar the Liberal party and tie it to scandal rather than provide insight on relevant issues. The fact that after three years there are no entries for anyone else involved in this raid - including the people acutally charged - highlights the fact that this whole entry should be scrapped. People shouldn't use Wikipedia to advance their political interests. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETompettyfan_0e67.html" title="User:Tompettyfan">- TomPettyFan</a> 02:58, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, Langara College, he <i>wasn't</i> charged, and <i>nobody's</i> been convicted yet.

"The subject of" <u>does not</u> equal <u>merely mentioned in</u>. Right now, the cold hard facts mean the article does not meet that criteria. <b>Note:</b> Culling together sources that merely mention or use <i>Vanilla sex</i> <u>as a colloquialism or slang term</u> only asserts that the article is, in fact, Synthesis and Original Research.

<li><b>keep</b> "vanilla sex" has been discussed at least by implication in essentially everything written about other flavors; the use is universal, and the content real. I remind Cyber that the verifiability has to be about the <i>subject</i> &amp; what is said about the <i>subject</i>. The term merely has to be shown to be the standard term, and that is surely clear enough.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> "Vanilla Sex" is not in and of itself a topic or thing that can be talked about beyond mere definition. "Vanilla" is commonly used to describe something ordinary or boring, thus "vanilla sex" is just ordinary or boring sex. I can't see how something like that can ever move beyond the Dictionary stage (which I think is borne out by the article as it stands) and therefore is inappropriate for Wikipedia. Nothing in the article purports scholarly use or cites any sources--it's just a colloquialism for unexciting intercourse.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 07:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The car does not exist. Please check out the previous AFD, where you can see more information. An unknown company brought a concept car to an auto show in July 2006, claimed it was the fastest car in the world, and then disappeared; their home page has been down since August. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 12:41, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I don't think it was a hoax. I think it was a failed business venture that never actually produced anything. If we had reliable sources saying that it was a hoax I would probably consider that notable, depending on the circumstances.

<li>Yes, incorrect. They are proposed, so they are for the moment not "policies or guidelines". Furthermore, there is not much chance of them becoming a guideline, and there is completely no chance of them ever becoming a policy (not one notability guideline, not even the most used ones like <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, is a policy).

<ul>
<li>The clear consensus among both proposals is to merge and redirect where articles do not meet notability criteria. It's probably the only thing they agree on. As you indicate and acknowledge that there are apparently no policies in Wikipedia guiding this issue (or apparently any other issue), your failure to follow a clear consensus is completely contradictory to Wikipedia policy and completely and totally incorrect. Why not try to work together with other editors who aren't quite so vindictive as you are in destroying information.

<p>Almost all the content in the article is about her relatives (she is daughter/stepdaughter of somebody, somebody is half-brother/sister etc.) Apart from this, the article has only one line about her: ("is featured on the reality television show, <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_the_Barkers_6a56.html" title="Meet the Barkers">Meet the Barkers</a>"). According to her <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1896683/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1896683/" rel="nofollow">IMDB entry</a>, she featured on one episode of Meet the Barkers.</p>

In the first nom, somebody argued that "if she and her immediate family have their own television show called <a href="../../../m/e/e/Meet_the_Barkers_6a56.html" title="Meet the Barkers">Meet the Barkers</a> then she is notable enough for inclusion as a standalone article". In the second nom somebody claimed that she passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because "both Barker and de la Hoya have a large fanbase, so the show has a large fanbase, so she meets the qualifications..". I couldn't find any reliable sources for her having a "large fanbase".</p>
<p>I don't think that being featured on a television show makes a person notable enough for an article on Wikipedia.

<li>Articles on Wikipedia are required to be "notable", which is a term we use in a very particular and frequently confusing manner. "Notable" here means that other well-respected and responsible publications have devoted significant attention to the subject. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> defines the specific criteria for establishing the notability of web-content; <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a> describes what the kinds of publications we're looking for. Something that's <i>popular</i>, with thousands of Google hits may not be <i>notable</i> because most of those hits are going to be brief mentions on blogs and forum posts, which are not checked for accuracy or subject to an editorial process that filters out trivial material.</li>
<li>Articles are also required to be verifiable, in that all of their content should be attributable to the previously-mentioned reliable sources. <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is one of our core content policies which essentially states that we can't say anything that hasn't been said by someone else already. If there are no reliabe sources to drawn upon, we'd have nothing to say, so there's no point in having an article.</li>

Thinking that they are relevant is making the error of thinking that we are somehow required to provide a complete set of articles, instead of discussing the subjects that the sources discuss.

<li>No, Unc, you're completely failing to understand the point. Let me make it quite plain to you: Crz's proposed name is ridiculous. Not only does the article have nothing to do with conversion from Judaism to Islam (the process for which is unexcitingly identical to the process for converstion from any other religion to Islam), the proposed namechange still doesn't deal with the problems inherent in the article itself. You'll notice, I'm just commenting here, I haven't bothered to vote...I'm in complete agreement that what we <i>should</i> be discussing is more appropriate names for the article. I think the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_converts_b298.html" title="List of Muslim converts">List of Muslim converts</a> IZAK points out below covers the topic quite well, but if there's some pathological attachment to keeping this unremarkable article, it should really be at <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_converts_to_Islam_441a.html" title="Jewish converts to Islam">Jewish converts to Islam</a>...although I would propose that a better way of handling such a classification fetish would be by creating instead Category:Jewish converts to Islam as a subcat of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Category%7EConverts_to_Islam_cc75.html" title="Category:Converts to Islam">Category:Converts to Islam</a>, and the remarkably little independently noteworthy information contained [<i>i.e.</i>, that which isn't more appropriately included in other articles] can be put in as heading text for that category. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tom</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">e</font></a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">r</a><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><sup style="font-variant: small-caps; color: #129dbc!important;">talk</sup></a> 23:36, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I know from personal experience that Catharsis was a well-known band in the East Coast and North Carolina hardcore scenes around 2000. I can't find any articles online to verify it--mostly because the hardcore scene has tended to be focused around print publications/fanzines until very recently.

<dd>I know, it was wishful thinking more than anything. I dug around to see what I could find to help out here but, admittedly, it's not much. The stuff on the homepage linked from the article has some stuff: the interviews archived here <a href="http://www.crimethinc.net/urbanpirates/?cat=15" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crimethinc.net/urbanpirates/?cat=15" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> indicate headlining overseas tour(s?).

I think the fact that they could do multiple trips to Europe and Canada and that at least one flyer has them playing with the unquestionably notable <a href="../../../c/o/n/Converge.html" title="Converge">Converge</a> at least gives evidence of notability within a scene. Other than that, though, the info's limited to myspace tribute pages, random album reviews, and the occasional post on an mp3 blog. I do think it's important to keep in mind, though, that although specific music scenes certainly exist and can be notable it's difficult to document them when they are already within a niche market like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Hardcore_punk.html" title="Hardcore punk">hardcore punk</a>.

It is someone's opinion that it does just because they are influenced by old band, which doesn't make this true.

<dd><b>Comment</b> What about all the bands from the 90s that fit the retro metal description (like <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep_%28band%29.html" title="Sleep (band)">Sleep</a>, <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spirit_Caravan_abbd.html" title="Spirit Caravan">Spirit Caravan</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Count_Raven_e334.html" title="Count Raven">Count Raven</a>) or all the bands from the 80s (<a href="../../../s/a/i/Saint_Vitus_%28band%29_10f0.html" title="Saint Vitus (band)">Saint Vitus</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Obsessed_ec3c.html" title="The Obsessed">The Obsessed</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trouble_%28band%29.html" title="Trouble (band)">Trouble</a>). Should all these now be retroactively placed into "Retro Metal". This scene has been around since the 80s so why should new bands coming out suddenly be at the forefront of some overhyped music revolution? Bands in the article like <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witchcraft_%28band%29.html" title="Witchcraft (band)">Witchcraft</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_a09f.html" title="The Sword">The Sword</a>, and <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witch_%28band%29.html" title="Witch (band)">Witch</a> are doom metal.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article has a serious <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> problem: Notes do not contain information they are cited to contain, and might even be considered faked. Notes 1 and 2: Trivial mentions of the term "retro metal" on a page about <a href="../../../w/o/l/Wolfmother.html" title="Wolfmother">Wolfmother</a>. Note 3: Theilluminati.net, a band's (The Illuminati) own website, containing Revolver screenshot which is titled "Heavy Meta", and the article starts "Hipster rock acts Wolfmother, Witch and The Illuminati...". Thus, magazine article is not about "Hipster Metal" as claimed in the WP article and also, does not verify the sentence before it: <i>It is not entirely clear the origins of the term "hipster metal", but music journalists have been using it in popular magazines such as Revolver, Classic Rock, Guitar World and Kerrang! since around 2005.</i> Note 4: Again, about Wolfmother and used as a source for sentence <i>Bands in this movement take influences from the originators of heavy metal such as Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Blue Cheer and Deep Purple.</i> Incorrect. Note 5: A commercial link (Amazon.com) to a compilation album, that could be considered promotional and spam. This seems both unverified and unverifiable. Also, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> clearly states that "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <i>about</i> the term — not books and papers <i>that use</i> the term." Trivial mentions do not help the fact that the article is original research, and the only way to avoid that would be turning it into a one-sentence stub, a <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">dictionary definition</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProlog_962f.html" title="User:Prolog">Prolog</a> 08:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Destructoid seems to be on par with sites such as Kotaku and Joystiq, even surpassing them at times with their coverage of the Bully trial and as Andersonanderson said, the comment count that they get seems to be nothing to scoff at. Looking at their technorati, they also seem to be fairly syndicated by a number of sources. My one gripe is the sourcing material. 66.94.89.148 18:56, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Definitely not the typical blog site, but it obviously has a huge following. If Capcom is willing to go to such great lengths to help them with weekly Lost Planet contests that surpass those on Kotaku, then it clearly has more than just Alexa and Technorati numbers. They've even been on G4TV several times in the past.68.225.92.123 18:58, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This song is very much often heard around my school, as when someone finds a funny video, they make it malware which spread to the whole school. While the song is undeniably odd and seemingly (well, really) without reason, its spawned several parodies, including one found by a friend just today, the beaver song. That, among the others, and the aforementioned fact that its used to cheer workers up, means in my eyes it should be kept. It, at least to me, <i>is</i> encyclopedial in nature, as peple I know found it here first, having heard it and wondered what it was. the previous comment is rather off i think, as it is a certantly a notable song, by a (now) somewhat-notable person. Delete it if you will, but i think that people will continue to restore and rename and rework the article, all in the name on human curiosity, i.e. people who look in encyclopeidas, online or otherwise. Or you could simply merge it, making it easier so we don't have to discuss it anymore.&#160;:P --<a href="../../../%21/d/a/User%7E%21Darkfire%216%2728%2714_1450.html" title="User:!Darkfire!6'28'14">Darkƒire Rules All!!!</a> 03:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The above summary of the history of the article is somewhat incomplete. In fact, the article was first created in November 2004, speedied immediately, recreated in March 2005, put on VfD (since renamed to AfD), deleted, recreated at a different title in October, moved to its current title in December, speedied immediately per <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#G4" title="WP:CSD">CSD G4</a>, and recreated again four days later. My restoration of the previously deleted revisions occurred four months after the latest recreation; I felt that the version at that point was no longer substantially identical to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../t/h/e/The_Llama_Song_a6e2.html" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org../../../t/h/e/The_Llama_Song_a6e2.html" rel="nofollow">the version the original VfD had been for</a>, and thus no longer qualified as a G4 speedy — and since the article didn't seem to be going away, I saw no reason to keep the old versions deleted.

<dd>Let's set something straight in what you said. Your reference is a blogspot entry that is named "lancelet.blogspot.com" and is written by an individual.

<dd><b>Blogs do count</b> just read the guideline from Notability (Web) "Web content includes, but is not limited to, webcomics, podcasts, <b>blogs</b>, Internet forums, online magazines and other media, web portals and web host" (emphasis added)</dd>
<dd>The blog on the Science web site , as with similar blogs at other professional sites, is sponsored by the society and moderated. Established email lists of that sort are accepted and so are blogs (especially because they tend to be the exact equivalents). We adjust to new media--if anyone should, it's us. I mention that Notability (Web) is a guideline, not a policy. Even as a guideline, I note the wording "if the content itself is notable" it does <i>not</i> say: "if the site is notable"</dd>
<dd>I also take issue with the concept that the article has to assert notability. it has to demonstrate notability. I've seen articles listed for deletion because the editor didn't think of using the exact words. Aside from an obscure listing in Speedy, I do <b>not</b> see the words <i>the article has to assert notability</i> in any policy or guideline. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

And, no, the website for the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_5dd2.html" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> is not rated the same as some anonymous blogger's website, it counts as an independent website of high credibility. Also, if it's spam what the heck is Palaeos selling, I want to buy some. T-shirts? I'd love to wear one. Anyway, it's surprising this nomination coming from someone with an interest in geology, as the many geologists I know love this website and its creators, and we even use it for research, like a specialized encyclopedia, it's a great place to start looking for information about life in the past. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:26, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>See the above comment re:Spam. Also, bringing my personal interests into this has no bearing upon the discussion.

<dd>Science's Netwatch citation will also appear in the hardcopy magazine. That plus Johnson 2003 means Palaeos is discussed (not just cited as a reference, or an <i>annotated reference</i> as in the other <i>Science</i> articles) in two <b>print</b> non-trivial published works in the references. As for my POV in this debate, are you saying Hatch that I am uneligable as a wikipedian to vote on this issue or to provide evidence in favour of keeping this page? btw I agree with Firsfron that the page should be rewritten to better establish notability <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 23:15, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First, the article is most certainly not spam. Whether or not it is notable enough to avoid violation of the linked Wiki policy, I don't know. The way I read that policy, it doesn't seem that the references listed are sufficiant. It seems to mean something more along the lines of independent published articles <i>about</i> the site, not those that mention the site in passing or use it as a source, as Benton does. I'd support a delete unless some more prominant sources discussing the site are presented. I would, however, advocate the site being used as a reference more often in vertebrate articles. If it's good enough for Benton, it should be good enough for us! <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDinoguy2_fb24.html" title="User:Dinoguy2">Dinoguy2</a> 22:47, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>So people should resource the site (and, heck, I agree, if it's good enough for Benton....), but when people want to know what is being resourced, folks can't come to Wikipedia and find out what it is? <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There's simply not much anyone can do if the world's largest scientific society deems a topic notable and Hatch68 deems the scientific organization unworthy of determining notability.

<dd>I consider what you just said an unfair attack on me. I have no bias as to whether the subject of this debate is notable or not. As I've said several times, notability requires references. You seem to be making arguments without being familiar with the underlying Wikipedia policies. If the proper references are made and notability is asserted, I have no problem changing my position to a strong keep for this article. Please avoiding attacking me in the future and focus on the discussion at hand. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> 22:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>But that's exactly what is going on, I asserted a reference, and you, without any evidence or citations that <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_5dd2.html" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">AAAS</a> is not notable, dismissed the reference I provided. I <i>gave</i> a reference. <i>You</i> dismissed it without any proof of its non-notability--that is <i>your</i> POV, as you have NOT provided any evidence to back up the non-notability of <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Science_5dd2.html" title="American Association for the Advancement of Science">AAAS</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> There seems to be confusion about what constitutes a non-reliable blog. According to guidelines, a blog can't be considered as a reliable source only if it is essentially a "personal web site" with no editorial control. Simply because something is published in a blog or journal-style presentation does not invalidate it as a source; the things that Science publishes in a "blog" on its website are subject to a considerable amount of oversight and editorial control. Saying the Science magazine blog is unreliable borders on silliness. As for the argument that it apperas to be spam--I think that's patently false, specious wholecloth--or "bullshit" in the common vernacular. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:57, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did read the discussion, and that's why I mentioned the fact that Palaeos is in the process of providing phylogenic trees of living and extinct organisms, as the main intent at the site is to have them as public reference. If it's a problem of notability, then how come the American Association for the Advancement of Science's opinion is not valid for determining notability? Does Palaeos need two or three more independant organizations to be deemed notable by Wikipedia? <del>Furthermore, if spam is not the issue, then why does it still say that one of the reasons for deletion is that it "verges on spam"?</del>--<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApokryltaros_82b1.html" title="User:Apokryltaros">Mr Fink</a> 23:09, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Palaeos.<i>com</i> is a well-respected site which I use regularly as a source for Wikipedia articles. The current article does not establish any sort of notability, and thus is eligible for deletion. However, the links above give some claim to notability, and really should have been included in the article in the first place. Article needs a good re-write, establishing the notability the site apparently has (used by well-respected professional paleontologists? Notable). As for Palaeos.<i>org</i>, it is an unfinished wiki with no real claim to notability. It could be mentioned at the end of the article, as a brief note. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 23:02, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Right. Based on the evidence above, and knowing this article lacks the assertion of notability required for a Wikipedia article, I've rewritten this article so that it should now conform to the policy, with notability asserted, with inline citation.

<li>In the current form I have no problem with the article and this debate can be closed. I would like to bring attention to the numerous <a href="../../../s/t/r/Straw_man.html" title="Straw man">straw man</a> arguments and misdirections by a few of the persons involved in this discussion so far. At <b>no point</b> did I assert that the Palaeos web site is non-notable. I said in the original nomination that it failed the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> policy. This was due to notability not being asserted and a lack of <b>multiple</b> non-trivial published works cited as references to back up the notability. I erred in believing that it was a possible case of link spam, but I quickly admitted this during the debate. It appears that many of the people injecting themselves into this debate have little or no understanding of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or the notability policies in general. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHatch68_1537.html" title="User:Hatch68">Hatch68</a> 02:08, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I wasn't sure, that's why I read the policy and asked questions about other policies. Here are the criteria for <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>==Criteria==</dd>
</dl>
<p><i><b>Web-specific content</b></i><sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> <b><i>is notable if it meets</i> any one <i>of the following criteria:</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li>The criteria for the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> policy, that you state it fails ("Fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.") ARE subsections of notability. So, if you state it fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and I go to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> to see what's going on, and the big ole <b>Criteria</b> section starts with the statement, "Web-specific content is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the following criteria," it's reasonable that I would expect you are asserting it failed notability. That's what this policy is about, and it clearly states this in the article, which I went and read. If <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is not about notability, it should not so clearly, purposefully and obviously list notability as the deciding factor. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 02:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, everyone calm down please. It's clear the original article didn't <i>assert</i> notability, but it now does. The citation for verifiability of notability is in place, and there's no sense in beating a dead equine, right? Hatch has admitted s/he erred in thinking the article was linkspam (the original article was in pretty bad shape; still could use some work, BTW), and KP admitted s/he wasn't all that familiar with the assertion of notability policy. It happens; let's move on, ok?&#160;:) If you want to continue the discussion about who was right, maybe take it off this page. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFirsfron_bff1.html" title="User:Firsfron"><font color="#0000FF">Firsfron of Ronchester</font></a> 02:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Some sections of the sciences have historically had long-standing traditions of interacting with the lay community, paleontology, botany in regards to native plants, and astronomy come to mind. One of the important things that an encyclopedia like Wikipedia can do is honor this relationship. There are a handful of paleontological websites designed either for the lay community (UCMP) or for the lay and professional community both. These websites should have their article pages on Wikipedia for the utility of users being able to find reliable information <i>about</i> those websites. An egregious omission in Wikipedia, for example, is an article about <a href="../../../o/c/e/Oceans_of_Kansas_31f2.html" title="Oceans of Kansas">Oceans of Kansas</a>. It's somewhat hard to find sources <i>about</i> these websites, though, making it difficult to argue for including an article about them. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 21:52, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I have been having similar difficulties with standard online reference works. They sound exotic, a fair description tends to sound like an advertisement, especially since pricing is relevant as a guide to availability to our users. The major professional websites speak for themselves, just like major computer ones do, and sourcing is almost impossible. The computer-oriented ones have no problem. Perhaps an approach of demonstrating number of links from university department sites might work. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Clarification</b> I never intimated nor meant to imply that the ADL and SPLC were racist organizations. However, they are not mainstream news organizations. I have clarified and fixed my nomination reason to reflect this change. Also, the MSNBC link isn't about Mr. Turner but about the killing of Amy Lefkow and the white power movement. The Nation article is about Sean Hannity's coddling of racists.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is an incredibly useful article. I first found it because someone posted a Hal Turner article in another forum, and I needed to verify the source.

<p><b>Delete</b> There is nothing to indicate that this is a notable contest type and the article lacks verifiable sources. A cursory search fails to show the availability of sourcing, with Wikipedia (and Wikipedia mirrors) featuring among the top ten hits. The article was created on March 8th, 2006 and shows only 14 edits, 2 of which are the adding and subsequent removal of a Proposal for Deletion. At best, this warrants a sentence or two about this in the <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">Roguelike</a> article. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 19:16, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> well-known within roguelike community. During the two 7drl contests this year, 19 new roguelikes were produced, which is about 2/3 of all new roguelikes which appeared this year. If roguelikes are notable then this subtype of roguelikes must be notable too. Also, Google Groups is far better search tool for this kind of content. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue"><font style="background: black" face="Courier" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;Grue&#160;</b></font></a> 20:55, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Given that Usenet postings aren't reliable sources (since, for one thing, their authorship is usually impossible to prove), it actually isn't. Google Groups is a useful search tool at Wiktionary, but not at Wikipedia. Are you seriously suggesting that a Wikipedia article be based upon nothing but Usenet posts? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:18, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to point out that, since it's creation and according to the article, this contest has attracted a grand total of 47 participants in a period spanning almost two years, with only 32 of those participants happening this year. That certainly doesn't indicate notability. However, if you're willing to source your article with sources which verify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, and/or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, I would consider changing to Keep. Until and unless that happens, I must maintain my own voice in the consensus as Delete. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 21:22, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Roguelike games are a notable area of game development, rooted in the lore and history of the game industry. If this article doesn't survive, I could see merging most of the content to <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roguelike.html" title="Roguelike">Roguelike</a>, but for organization's sake it is probably a better to keep separate. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 22:34, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Indeed Roguelike games are a notable area of game development (Castle of the Winds was one of my favourite games before I even knew what a roguelike was), but that doesn't necessarily make this challenge notable. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 23:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>As a holiday single, it is not a "true" single (because it is essentially time-limited. As it is a non-notable "plain" cover, I feel the information can easily be merged onto the <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Christmas_4433.html" title="Last Christmas">Last Christmas</a> article, especially since there is very little info on the single. As far as I can tell, it is simply an iTunes release, and although a user recently put "Current Single" on the page, I see that there is already a followup single. I prod'd the page, and it was removed after the 5 days (well, on the 5th day), so...yeah. I propose <strike>a <b>merge</b></strike><b>deletion</b>. <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Christmas_4433.html" title="Last Christmas">Last Christmas</a> mentions the cover, and that's enough. It's not really a notable release. <a href="../../../s/k/s/User%7ESKS2K6_b393.html" title="User:SKS2K6">SKS2K6</a> 20:25, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>:I went to the next single's page, and it is listed as the singer's first single.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Well, it would actually be deleting, because there is very little info to merge. All there is "Ashley Tisdale has released a cover of Last Christmas, officially released on iTunes in December of 2006", if that. <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Christmas_4433.html" title="Last Christmas">Last Christmas</a> already mentions that she did a cover.

<li><b>Delete</b> There is no reason why this requires its own article. The notation that she covered it at <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Christmas_4433.html" title="Last Christmas">Last Christmas</a> is about all that needs to be said, thus, no reason to merge. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 00:50, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> That she is mentioned in a list of people who covered the song is enough mention, since there doesn't appear to be much to say about this version. —<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 06:10, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

If we find some sources, keep, if not, delete.

<dd>Are you referring to this misinformed, misspelled and discriminative comment from the history tab: «<i>07:13, 5 December 2006 RWR8189 (Talk | contribs) (not only is the forum non-notable, its in Russian)</i>»? First, the site is not simply a forum, unless you call Slashdot a forum, too. Second, a lot of independent site owners integrate RSS-feeds from Linux.org.ru onto their own sites, or otherwise reprint articles from Linux.org.ru, which shows that Linux.org.ru is notable. Third, articles in this wikipedia are not limited to describing resources that have English references. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> 00:00, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please see the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_collegiate_a_cappella_groups.html" title="List of collegiate a cappella groups">list of collegiate a cappella groups</a>. Many of these groups have Wikipedia entries that are similar to this one, and are not being considered for deletion. I would like to know what makes this page different, so it can be rectified. Collegiate a cappella groups are an important part of the cultures of their colleges, and 36 Madison Avenue is extremely important to Drew University. Craazycarolyn 22:05, 2 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. Collegiate a cappella has become a big part of the popular music scene in colleges and universities. The annual Best of College A Cappella albums are extremely popular CDs on college campuses and beyond. The popularity of webpages such as <a href="http://www.acatunes.com" class="external text" title="http://www.acatunes.com" rel="nofollow">Acatunes</a> is also proof that collegiate a cappella groups are in the public eye. I think it is clear that 36 Madison Avenue is no less notable than the other collegiate groups with wikipedia entries. PixiesAreNice 22:11, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">Inclusion is not an indication of notability</a>. Or in simpler terms, just because other <i>a cappella</i> groups have articles on Wikipedia right now, doesn't mean they <i>should</i>. It's just no one's got around to deleting them. Please see <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion of articles on musical groups</a>. Basically, if you can find multiple articles in real newspapers (not school newspapers) written about your group, then it deserves to be kept, and I'll change my vote. Otherwise, I endorse the nominator.

<li><b>Keep</b>There are countless articles on wikipedia about subjects that may not have huge mainstream popularity. A lot of the time when somebody hears some obscure reference, like "crying wrestling fan" or even the aforementioned Luger video, where do they check? Wikipedia of course. Now if people just go hog wild deleting everything they don't see as significant, we'll be stuck with a very incomplete encyclopedia. I say, if somebody takes the time to make a page for something, and if as many people as have commented on it and edited it do so, it is definitely noteworthy. It's not like somebody made up a page just to vainly showcase their own minimal accomplishments. Are people worried that the internet is going to run out of space or what? <small>— 4.246.230.190 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.246.230.190_c3c8.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.246.230.190">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> I fail to see how a little blurb about something that got some media attention has to be deleted. Compared to some of the vast useless information on here, I think this is just fine the way it is. That's my view on it. And also, if the "I don't know" comment be striken then the "I think so" comment should as well. Hypocrisy shouldn't be becoming of a supposed unbiased site. <small>—The preceding unsigned comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.17.46.8_adbc.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.17.46.8">130.17.46.8</a> (talk) 07:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very well-written, "dave wills" wrestling gets 1,800 ghits. The clip is one of the most famous clips on the internet, and not just with wrestling fans. He also appears at major independent shows in ring announcing roles and such. Being on Jimmy Kimmel is pretty big, and he has done radio interviews.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's a well-written article and Dave Willis is probably the most well-known wrestling fan within the large Internet Wrestling Community (without being a one-time joke like the Cena-Fan-in-Shock), as well as being a special guest on radio programs and at southeast indy shows.24.228.59.90 07:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Of course it is known within the wrestling community... so is Lex Luger's selling ability... does that mean people outside of the community care about it? "I Don't Think SOoooooO!", as your boy Lex would say. Bottom line is that it fails notability. The only reason the anon IP(s) want the inclusion is because they argue "well if Dave Wills has a page then Lex Luger's viral video should be included" Well then when this page went up for nominition, they pulled a Sid Eudy and decided that they need to vote for them in order to keep their wrestlecrap meme going. And of course as you can see from <a href="http://realwrestlecrap.proboards89.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=wrestling&amp;thread=1167982028&amp;page=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://realwrestlecrap.proboards89.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=wrestling&amp;thread=1167982028&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">[63]</a> they even posted a campaign telling people to vote for this... so if we see alot of contributions from people who's only edit is on this page then this is why (like the person who was wise enough to sign his post in his wrestlecrap forum name). <a href="../../../4/9/e/User%7E49erInOregon_0564.html" title="User:49erInOregon">49erInOregon</a> 12:55, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly disagree that the keep votes are just a way to "keep the Luger info". These people have given valid reasons to why it should be kept. We can't control the fact that someone started a thread on the message board about it. Your vote should probably be discounted b/c you are just on a vendetta to make people upset and try to gain some power. We have a right to vote and discuss this article, and every valid reason should be considered. There's already been 2 attempts by anons to delete the keep votes, which is a pretty shady practice. <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBooshakla_a61e.html" title="User:Booshakla">Booshakla</a> 13:19, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Are you serious about the "vendetta" comment to gain power? Where do you get that from? I'm not even on here enough to care about any form of power. That is ridiculous. If you read the thread and their thread about Lex Luger you can clearly see that is their point. Here's an example from Dave's talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Wills_%28wrestling%29&amp;diff=98378540&amp;oldid=95970227" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dave_Wills_%28wrestling%29&amp;diff=98378540&amp;oldid=95970227" rel="nofollow">[64]</a> from the same IP that voted keep here. As far as the GHits go, I guess it would depend on where they are coming from... if they are gorillamask and wrestling site hits then I don't know what to tell ya. Should we put up an article about every video on gorillamask? And for the one anon IP that deleted the info... how do you even know where that is coming from and what he/she is trying to cause with that disruption? <a href="../../../4/9/e/User%7E49erInOregon_0564.html" title="User:49erInOregon">49erInOregon</a> 13:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I see no evidence of anything called the "Argument from Beauty" which merits an encyclopaedia entry.

Where is the evidence that the "Argument from Beauty" is a concept that has occurred in the literature, or is a phrase widely used as a justification for belief in a god?

<dd><b>Keep if drastically rewritten</b> I do not think it is the best written piece I have ever seen. It is hard to read. Some of it is probably their own paraphrasing of the text in the arguments but not well sourced. However, this is a classic argument for the existence of God. The editor/editors have not dug very deeply into the literature and have not sourced their statements very well to tie the statements in the article to the references. This needs better citing, and more sources and more material. How about more on the history of this argument? It has a long rich history in philosophy I know. I think that the comment of the author above that "this is a fork of the creationism-evolution controversy and we have more than enough of that shit already" betrays a severe bias which makes me not take his comments very seriously. In fact, they color my opinion of his rationality quite negatively. Where does this article talk about evolution? Where does this article talk about the creationist myth? This is an argument for a deity. It is too much of a stub and needs to be filled out considerably. It needs better references. I am tempted to respond to "we have too much of that shit already" but that is inappropriate in the interests of comity. However, I will state that such a statement displays this editor in a very bad light indeed.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 22:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - it is a form of teleological argument and I have edited the article to say that and it is an argument specifically addressed by other notables. I do not feel it is a POV fork of teleological argument as long as we keep in both for and against sides of this specific example. That aside, beauty is in the eye of the beholder so an infinite entity would fine all things "beautiful" even the most ugliest of creatures e.g. my personal fav the <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinea_worm.html" title="Guinea worm">guinea worm</a>. That we find some things beautiful and other things ugly and then some use this to prove the existence of an entity who would not make that distinction shows the true value of this argument. I like this argument as you can drive a train through it. Toot toot....<a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 07:51, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Ttiotsw. Though the whole point of the AfB is that, <i>according to classical Theism</i>, Beauty is not simply "in the eye of the beholder" and that God distinguishes rightly between beauty and ugliness, as well as betwen truth and falsehood. You can hold that Premise (1) is mistaken, but if it is true then the argument is valid and the conclusion follows.

Even if not, please take my thoughts into consideration) GoKrida's Google Search may return only 14800 results, and it definitely has less than 1000 participants. However, <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, a very popular online game, only returns 512000 results with about 175000 players online when I wrote this. GoKrida has many more results per player. With regards to reliable sources, GoKrida has little to nothing for official reference, since the point of the game is for the players to discover information. I would gladly cite some references made by respected players, but I do not know if that is good enough. I think it would be a shame for Wikipedia to lose an article about a unique game due to a lack of verifiable sources, so hopefully we can find a solution. --75.129.241.82 22:28, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Like the other user pointed out, verifiability is non-negotiable. Your analogy is also flawed since book reviews tend to hash out the plot or book contents and any relevant details. I don't see the connection between books and games, or how <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are counterintuitive at all.

<li>If by pointing out that book reviews overdo it on summarizing the plot you're making a comparison to the "Player-created culture and history" section of the article, then I agree; most or all of the information there is actually unneccessary to anyone just looking to familiarize themselves with the concept of GoKrida but not actually intending to participate.

<li>Perhaps there are no reliable sources as Wikipedia policy goes. But those editing this page didn't make this stuff up. Users of Wikipedia seem to have a different concept of Wikipedia than some of its editors do, and consider Wikipedia itself to be a "reliable source". I've heard of several players who started GoKrida by finding it in a Google search (yes, apparently it can be found with the right keywords), and checking it out on Wikipedia to find out more about it, as there seem to be few other informative resources currently available to those who haven't created an account there. Since it seems you may have overlooked the link in my last post, let me make it clearer that I believe that this article falls under the policy <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 16:26, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Online games are notoriously hard to find sources for outside of the official site and fan base. <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html" title="RuneScape">RuneScape</a>, for example, didn't have any third party sources in the Wikipedia entry for quite some time. Many other game entries still do not. Bear in mind that the spirit of the policies that have been mentioned is directed towards more scholarly assertions that are or could be disputed and argued over. Therefore I don't find the lack of sources to be a problem by itself. Although I vote to keep this article, I will add the provision that improvements should be made to it in the coming months. If it is still in the same state in several months time I would agree that it should be deleted. More specifically I think some of the information is only relevant to players of the game and should be deleted. Other topics are not expanded upon enough (for example the "GKF" is only mentioned in passing). But the talk page is more appropriate for such a discussion. 81.79.95.66 19:47, 8 January 2007

<li><b>Comment</b> I am less familiar with this argument than the argument from beauty. I am less persuaded by it. As in the case of Argument from beauty, the article is too scanty and needs to be fleshed out. The history is not described adequately. I am unsure of its importance in philosophy and its venerability. If it can be demonstrated to have an extensive history like the argument from beauty, it could be kept. I wonder if might not be smarter to <b>Merge</b> this with the argument from beauty or similar arguments? However, that might not be the best option. I am unsure. Perhaps the article should be drastically fleshed out first so that it can be more properly judged, and its relevance would be better understood from that perspective? If it is removed, I would favor the editors working on it in draft form and then trying again. How many other arguments are there? There must be many.

<li><b>Comment</b> - on that basis I would be happy to retract my nomination for deletion - but the article must <i>demonstrate</i> that it is an "argument with its own name". It needs considerable rewriting to turn it into an explanation and discussion of a notable argument used by others. At present it still consists largely of blog-style musing, and appears to be trying to persuade the reader of the existence of a god. As it stands it is unsuitable for inclusion in an encyclopaedia. Unless this is changed within a reasonable time I will renominate for deletion. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 09:30, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I had mistaken this for the <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argument_from_beauty.html" title="Argument from beauty">argument from beauty</a>, which survived the AfD, so I also added this one the <a href="../../../g/o/d/Template%7EGod_Arguments_45c9.html" title="Template:God Arguments">Template:God Arguments</a>, but I have since removed it. I have no idea, if this is a notable argument or not, and I didn't remove it because I don't think it is notable, I simply don't know... I think it should be added to the template when this RfD has been decided. On the other hand if anybody might want to put this back on it, to get more traffic to this debate for example, it is fine with me. Anyway.... I will make a relevant comment or rather ask a question here, the argument from beauty has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Argument_from_beauty&amp;diff=99355654&amp;oldid=95054597" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Argument_from_beauty&amp;diff=99355654&amp;oldid=95054597" rel="nofollow">changed drastically</a> since the AfD, but this one has not.

<li><b>Weak keep or merge</b> I would rather tend towards keeping this one. Unless we have things that are blatantly self-promotions, such as an argument that is simply the title of somebody's essay, etc. I'm hardly offended at having too many arguments for or against the existence of God. This is not a less significant question than the fictional characters in the World of Warcraft&#160;;) The question is of course, and this is mainly to supporters of this argument. NBeale for example, you have worked hard at asserting the notability of this argument, but you also have to ask yourself: are you willing to maintain so many independent articles at a high quality? Thus merging love and beauty into "The arguments from love and beauty" is probably just simpler to maintain! --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 19:11, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Since my "Delete unless referenced and rewritten", the article has been referenced. However, the text gives the impression that the Argument has a more-or-less logical, formal structure. While there are plenty connections between the perception of love and the notion that God exists in literature, what the article needs in its current form is a reference to where it is spelled out in a more or less formal manner. --<a href="../../../e/t/h/User%7EEthicsGradient_384b.html" title="User:EthicsGradient">EthicsGradient</a> 23:51, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've been involved in the game and with its administrators since its first age (I'm an operator in its IRC channel, and an admin on the official game forum)... The information is pretty much accurate. And if I were to ask an administrator to verify it would it satisfy this debate? If you wanted to argue that pages on games are pointless; that could be a valid argument, though the counterpoint to that would be that pages on TV Shows are also pointless.

<li>No, we need secondary sources, which are defined by being non-trivial third party sources that go through an editorial process- no interviews or forum posts or descriptions from the game's website/fanpages/personal pages/etc. Otherwise it's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.

<ul>
<li>Perhaps this may be news to you... You probably won't find a secondary source on an online game, as it really isn't interesting enough to be in a professional journal, or a book written about games. If an administrator of the defacto KoC communities (someone that would be in a position to do online puiblication or editation of information on the game), an administrator of the game (a primary source), and the KoC community as a whole agree with the content of this article it's a good chance it's accurate. By precluding a primary source such as an administrator of the game, who exactly would be qualified in this case to talk about it; since obviously no third party is going to do a legitimate publication on it. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> 05:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You could also verify the existance of 4 races in the game, attack turns, etc by visitting the kingsofchaos home page. The argument that something that obvious isn't fact because someone didn't publish it should be considered to be bad; since it is verifiable by visitting the homepage. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> 06:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Of course there is also the point of random players showing up and editting themselves into the history. In which case yes that is bad. Perhaps the page should be restructured and moderated in some way (locked?) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Snoop0x7b_cac0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Snoop0x7b">contribs</a>) 06:08, 4 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li>(edit conflict) Actually, lots of third parties publish information on video games. Typically these come in the forms of online or print magazines doing reviews or talking about popular games (<a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_dacf.html#Footnotes" title="RuneScape">RuneScape#Footnotes</a> and <a href="../../../u/r/b/Urban_Dead_f5a4.html#External_links" title="Urban Dead">Urban Dead#External links</a> are examples). Some shows such as <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_of_the_Show_45ce.html" title="Attack of the Show">Attack of the Show</a> also feature online games. Articles cannot be based on primary sources. Sorry, but this is fundamental to the encyclopedia, in particular to keeping <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>. I won't budge on this, and neither will any administrators. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 06:10, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm willing to admit that in game history is non-encyclopedic and should definately be removed. However I think information such as the races, the turn based nature of it, and information on weapons, etc; should be included. Something such as this: <a href="http://www.kingsofchaos.com/help.php#" class="external free" title="http://www.kingsofchaos.com/help.php#" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsofchaos.com/help.php#</a> covers it all and should be cited as a source. When writing a research publication a user's manual for an instrument is admissible as a citation; and that is written by the engineers that made said item. Thus I'd make the argument that it is possible to have verifiable sources for things such as that. However the nonverifiable information such as, goings-on in game should be removed. BUT the heavyhanded suggestion of the complete removal of this article is just bad. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnoop0x7b_ef1a.html" title="User:Snoop0x7b">Snoop0x7b</a> 06:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is a hoax because when I searched in Google, I found no specific confirmation on this new "animal." I even checked a few reliable new sources (e.g. CNN, Fox News, Reuters, New York Times) and those places don't have articles about it either. Another reason this is a hoax is because the island of Jecke doesn't exist, nor does the fruit mwa wa. Note that I previously proposed deletion, but someone removed the tag and replaced it with the clean-up tag. <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquirepants101_2dbc.html" title="User:Squirepants101">Squirepants101</a> 23:04, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<br />
<b>Creator</b>: Actually I didn't know that an article could also be put here ... hmm. Well I still think the article should be kept seperate, if added to the Yorktown High School page (linked above) I believe that page would become cluttered. There is a full category for Student Newspapers, quite a few of which are high school newspapers, and I see no reason why this shouldn't be in that category. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielfolsom_5631.html" title="User:Danielfolsom">Danielfolsom</a> 23:07, 2 January 2007 (UTC)<br />

<dd>This is the official forum for discussion of this article, to see if there's a consensus for delete/merge and keep.

<p>A non-notable wiki with 600 article. There is not even a single reliable source discussing it. The only thing they have is being <i>linked</i> by a couple of Iranian directory sites.</p>
<p>It claims that "Articles by WikIran continue to be mirrored, referenced, and copied by various other sources such as factbites.com." But factbites.com is a search engine! Being indexed by a search engine also does not make one notable.</p>

<li>Don't you guys ever get tired of the <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">bad faith assumptions</a>? The discussion you referenced so far isn't much of a discussion, but a series of allegations made by Hessam, and some inquiries from others. From what I can see of wikIran, there is nothing to suggest that it's a "POV fork" similar to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a> or <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizendium.html" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>. Many of the articles there look original to the site, and I see no evidence of "POV-warrior" edits there. I suggest that you and others tone it down big time. Like I told another editor on a different AfD, this is a dicussion, not a <a href="../../../v/i/c/Vicious_circle.html" title="Vicious circle">vicious circle</a>, and your attitude, and the attitude of others displayed here which would frighten away the casual reader, is not conducive to the spirit of Wikipedia. metaspheres 12:49, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is a double-standard here. By some peoples standards here, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikispecies.html" title="Wikispecies">Wikispecies</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikiversity.html" title="Wikiversity">Wikiversity</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/r/Persian_Wikipedia_c844.html" title="Persian Wikipedia">Persian Wikipedia</a> and <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Wikipedia_d191.html" title="Kurdish Wikipedia">Kurdish Wikipedia</a> cannot have articles here, but since they are <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikimedia.html" title="Wikimedia">Wikimedia</a> sites, I guess the rules don't apply, yes? But like another editor says here those rules are not "rules" but guidelines and they are viewed in a different ways by different editors. From what I see, it is notable and significant project as others have shown especially as it is the only Iranian wiki. On the Admin Noticeboard it is interesting to note that someone suggests that WP and WikIran have "interwiki" and then when he finds out that WikIran is not Wikimedia, says that since it is not an "official wiki" (whatever that means) that any links to WikIran are "wiki-spam" and should be "nuked". That's very nice, but is a hostile attitude and I agree with others who say that this is against the spirit of Wikipedia. I am 100% sure that most people on WP do not agree with attacking other wikis or editors because they are involved with other wikis or add links to other wikis. If an article on a wiki is sourced and has references, there should be no problem. A site like WP is no more or less reliable than a site like WikIran. I have looked at articles on WikIran and they have just as many sources as WP articles and alot of them use the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia_Iranica_91ff.html" title="Encyclopedia Iranica">Encyclopedia Iranica</a> as a source. I see good arguments for and against but the people against look more concerned with attacking the project and its editors and mocking them than anything else. I have been on WP awhile and I don't care how anyone wants to justify it, but those are <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> and just because its against another wiki or off-wiki editors doesn't make it right. Also the nominator is <i>incorrect</i> in saying that <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is a policy - <i>it is a guideline</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> As someone who used to be a large participent of the group, I'll refrain from placing my&#160;!vote. I just wonder when the criteria for a notable newsgroup would be -- and if you think about it, are they any less notable than certain web forums? I wonder. Because usenet used to be what forums now act as, so I wonder if it's simply a matter of the fact there was, I guess you could say, no real documenting of them back then.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but clean up perhaps. Not sure how others stumbled into this, but I was actually in an real discussion about "who has heterochromia?" and landed here. Also, as a new editor, I (inappropriately?) added one of the photo links in question, (but the column header does say, "link to photo".) It may apply to most AfDs, but it seems that there is a lot of information that nobody/most people don't care about, but exists nowhere else; exactly what I was looking for!

<li><b>Comment</b> I happened to come across this page <a href="http://www.punweb.com/article/New_Orleans_VooDoo" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.punweb.com/article/New_Orleans_VooDoo" rel="nofollow">[71]</a> listing Kinkella as part of the New Orleans VooDoo in the AFL; and this page <a href="http://www.arikah.net/encyclopedia/Arizona_Rattlers" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.arikah.net/encyclopedia/Arizona_Rattlers" rel="nofollow">[72]</a> listing him as presently or formerly part of the Arizona Rattlers in the AFL. Most of the hits for Kinkella point to Wikipedia and mirrors, though. I'm not going to cast a&#160;!vote at this point, since I can't say with confidence whether Kinkella really is a notable AFL player (and I'm not sure what precedent says about the notability of Arena Football players). --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 00:34, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> He's not an Arena Football player at all. According to the page itself he's only 18 years old. If he were an AFL player - which he's not - it would be a large news story in the league, the youngest player ever to play. That news story doesn't exist anywhere, because it's not true. There is no Mike Kinkella on any transaction list, any roster, any player database (including the comprehensive ArenaFan.com website, which lists statistics for all players) for the AFL. This article was voted for deletion once before, and it should be again. Dhmachine31 04:37, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The two pages listed in the above comment are just rebranded Wikipedia pages, so most likely those were just vandalism. I checked the player database on my site ArenaFan.com and we do not have a record of him at all, and while the player search only returns players who have been in a game, our data entry area did not return a record, which would exist if he had appeared in any transactions. Furthermore, a player cannot be "signed to the practice squad" until the regular season rosters have been finalized.</li>

<p>This article was proposed for deletion on August 1, 2006, and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_The_Dear_Hunter_8eb5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/The Dear Hunter">consensus</a> at that time was "delete." Since then, it was recreated, with slightly more content, and that's why I was hesitant to speedy delete it as a recreation and wanted to resubmit it. <b>Delete</b>, <b>speedy delete</b> if there is a consensus quickly that it's still a non-notable band. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 00:01, 3 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't know if you are aware (probably not since your specialty is asian culture) but a band does not have to be played on the radio for it to be notable, and The Receiving End of Sirens are one of the fastest growing bands in the alternative rock music scene. Warp tour is not notable for any band, the music they make and the impact they have is what makes them notable. The Dear Hunter are on a Label, and are growing at an extremely quick rate, there are plenty of other bands on this site that are worth less than this band. If you are going to delete articles no what you are taking about before you do it. Just because you do not know the band does not mean they are not notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.63.0.88_511b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.63.0.88">24.63.0.88</a> (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.63.0.88.html" title="User talk:24.63.0.88">talk</a>) 06:48, 3 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>I have updated the article with more information, and there is more information readily available if you guys deem it as not sufficient.Also, the Dear Hunter now can boast two of the WP rules of eligibility.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). (Though they have not technically released the second album as of right now, it is almost finished and will be released barring any catastrophes)</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. (The Receiving End of Sirens is a very notable band, with a huge devoted fanbase and a second major indie album in the process of being recorded)</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, the Dear Hunter's EP has been reviewed favorably by absolutepunk.net (THE source for online reviews of punk/pop rock music) as well as Alternative Press Magazine (5/5) (Haven't heard of it? Go to Borders, there will guaranteed be a few kids dressed in black drinking mochas and reading it) This would qualify the Dear Hunter as well.--Striderider 01:48, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>All the second criterion indicates is that it might be notable enough to justify a <i>redirect</i>, not an article of its own. As to the first, as you admitted, it's not true yet (and I question as whether these releases are "on a major label or one of the more important indie labels"). --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 02:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, as an aside, I find it absolutely ludicrous (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98308142" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nlu&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=98308142" rel="nofollow">[73]</a>) that you think that this band is more notable than emperors of <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chen_Dynasty_2664.html" title="Chen Dynasty">Chen Dynasty</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Qi_3d7c.html" title="Northern Qi">Northern Qi</a>, and <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Zhou_3c8a.html" title="Northern Zhou">Northern Zhou</a>. Perhaps this doesn't speak well of your evaluation on the notability and importance of persons. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 02:17, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Though the second criterion might stipulate the use of a redirect in the case of a side-project, the Dear Hunter has become much more than just a side project, considering its releases, line-up, and label status. That is like saying the New Amsterdams shouldn't have a wikipedia article because it is the side project of one of the members of the Get Up Kids.
<ul>
<li>I think Triple Crown can be considered a strong indie label (Brand New, Hot Rod Circuit... etc)
<ul>
<li>I'm sorry if you misunderstood my intent. Obviously in the scope of world history the emperors of Chinese dynasties are more important than a band. However, that is a poor argument. The fact that they are more important shouldn't mean that people that are less important shouldn't be allowed wikipedia pages. If that were true, I could find you thousands of articles about people that are less important than ancient chinese emperors. I was soleley using that as an example to show relevance. If that many articles about ancient chinese men are needed, I don't understand how wikipedia can't accept one more article about a great and up and coming new band.--Striderider 02:39, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The question is: is the band notable, period, by standards established by the community? I don't think you've shown it. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 05:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nlu why do you care about a band you have never heard of so much, go back making articles about asian emperors and leave the music part of wikipedia to people that know something about independent music. If you know who bands like Circa Survive, As Tall As Lions, The Receiving End of Sirens, Brand New, Taking Back Sunday, Boys Like Girls, Kevin Devine, Dashboard Confessional, Underoath, Head Automatica, Glassjaw, Jimmy Eat World and Chiodos are, then I think you have some type of authority to talk about the subject but I highly doubt in your Asian studies you came across these bands.There is a huge music scene below the scene viewed by corporate american and mtv.--Bdonovan12 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.63.0.88 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.63.0.88.html" title="User talk:24.63.0.88">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.63.0.88_511b.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.63.0.88">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<ul>
<li>It has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable.
<ul>
<li>The fact that the Dear Hunter has met that criterion should be enough already to warrant an article.--Striderider 17:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, please establish that those published works are "non-trivial"? --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 18:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Well, since we're on wikipedia right now, and you are so adamant on removing trivial articles, it would be fair to say that if something has an article that has not been deleted, it is non-trivial, right? Among other reviews and interviews listed on the TDH page, both <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutepunk.net.html" title="Absolutepunk.net">absolutepunk.net</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternative_Press_%28music_magazine%29_c3db.html" title="Alternative Press (music magazine)">Alternative Press (music magazine)</a> have given TDH's first ep a good review. --Striderider 18:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The existence of an article does not itself establish notability -- because just because something has not been deleted pursuant to an AfD doesn't mean that it <i>should not</i> be deleted. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 12:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Still, there is no way anyone can dispute the notability of both absolutepunk.net and Alternative Press magazine. They are two of the most respected and widely read sources of critique for this kind of music.--Striderider 17:09, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
