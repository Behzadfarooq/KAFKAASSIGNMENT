<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. He's a staff member in the computer science department at the University of Reading. (He's not a professor.) Maybe somehow somewhere he's got some interesting research, but it sure doesn't seem like it merits an encyclopedia article just yet. So far he seems just to have a bunch of papers in conference proceedings (which, to clear up some confusion, are not reviewed). His list of publications (at his home page and at the University) doesn't list his dissertation; who knows what he's a doctor of.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Fifteen minutes of fame (or infamy) doesn't qualify one for an encyclopedia article, IMHO.

<li><b>Comment</b> the term <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professor.html" title="Professor">professor</a> has a different meaning in the UK from the USA, so not being a professor does not automatically make a person non-notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkb_3e6f.html" title="User:Markb">Markb</a> 18:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: He is an "academic staff" member, which seems to be what the department is calling faculty. Conference proceedings are quite common in computer science and are perfectly respectable in some areas; you can't expect to translate your knowledge of credentials from some area of mathematics to a completely different field. Also, as pointed out, making "professor" is actually quite different (and harder) than at an American university; it really is a different kind of position. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 08:27, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

So what remains as a reason for keeping this bio? The only thing I can see of is some minor Internet notoriety due to Slashdot (the BBC thing is not so convincing, as it was in a local edition). But being mentioned on Slashdot once is a dubious kind of notoriety.

<li><b>Keep but rename to James Anderson (computer scientist)</b> He is in no way shapre or form a mathematician. His training is in CS.

Alternaticely, create a "Mathematical crackpots" article which talks about the phenomenon and lists several "notable" ones; redirecting all articles to that one.

<li>WP:BIO agrees with me. It draws no line that delineates "local articles that don't count" as you are doing, and rightly so. There's a great deal of <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> that flows from such a notion. It is your "It's local, so it doesn't count." that people don't agree with. And the answer to your question is "No.", because, unlike you with those 30 seconds of interview, James Anderson has been the subject of several articles all of which comprise more than just a single paragraph. The PNC requires "non-trivial" published works, remember. "It's local." is not a valid rebuttal. The valid rebuttals would be that the published works were not from independent sources (e.g. they are re-hashes of press releases), that they were trivial (i.e. are not in-depth coverage), or that there was in fact no more than one single piece. Until yesterday, there was no more than the one single piece.

<li>Ungle G, as you may have guessed, I don't abide by your PNC. Notability has to do with importance/usefulness in my opinion, and in that way serves a constructive function. Your guideline is basically set up so that some Little League coach that gets local news coverage about rescuing a cat from a tree gets a Wikipedia bio. How does that further Wikipedia's mission? Nobody here is arguing that obscure species of beetles should not be covered, so you may want to consider why not in order to understand the nuances of the position being held here. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 13:37, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your opinion is wrong, and it is you that needs to consider and understand what notability and the PNC actually are. Importance is subjective. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. Editors' personal evaluations of importance, including yours, are not the way to decide what to include in an encyclopaedia. Doing so would result in a mess very quickly, and basing your arguments upon your subjective opinion of what is important does not help Wikipedia at all.
<p>Moreover, your argument about rescuing cats from trees is a straw man. You are ignoring the words "multiple" and "non-trivial" in the PNC. The rescue of a cat from a tree would almost certainly not be an in-depth article, and other articles would be required. Please think about notability, about why it is not the same as importance, and about why arguments about cat rescues are straw men. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but you're not the arbiter of whether my opinion is wrong and yours is right. And no, I didn't ignore the wording in your PNC. I say "your PNC", because despite your attempt to make it seem like your opinion is policy or a major guideline, it is not. If you are referring to the first bullet of a list in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then note that also part of the guideline is "People who satisfy at least one of the items below <b>may</b> merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them." (my emphasis) Not to mention that the guideline also states that this is not an exclusionary list, so it's not as if your PNC was not met, the article should be deleted. Insisting that "keep" and "delete" correspond to satisfying or not satisfying PNC is just your opinion; don't pretend otherwise.<br />
"Multiple" obviously means "more than one" and "non-trivial", interpreted by you here as "in-depth", can obviously happen in any human interest story such as the one I mention. So it's not a straw man, but a valid example. For example, please look at <a href="http://www.whnt.com/Global/story.asp?S=5787943" class="external text" title="http://www.whnt.com/Global/story.asp?S=5787943" rel="nofollow">Cat Rescued From Tree</a>] and explain why it is not "in-depth". In terms of "multiple", i.e. more than one, with Anderson, I see two independent sources, the local BBC station and the Reading Evening Post. The only aspect of your arguments so far, that I can see is valid is that here we have more coverage than in the "cat in tree" case. "more coverage" here means one more source. But I would think this is a pretty borderline case. If you're going to say "here we have two sources, whereas you have only one". Then that's a weak argument, in my opinion. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 17:10, 13 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

<dd>Well, i guess it's just unfortuinate that there are very limited online sourced to cite for you.

<dd>There's no requirement that sources be online, just that they are reliable, verifiable, independent of the company itself, and coverage is not trival. The idea is that there needs to be enough independent coverage of the company to support a proper article. If the company sponsors festivals, then that should be mentioned at the festival article(s), and can be included in this article (if kept), but it doesn't establish notability under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChondrite_3324.html" title="User:Chondrite">Chondrite</a> 21:38, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable vanity. Having been a part of Ozlabs for about a year, it seems easier to AfD than to add my name. This is one of many deparments within IBM; the company has tens of thousands of deparments, and thousands of brilliant engineers, many more notable and acheived than the folks listed here. Most Harvard professors or the depts they're in don't rank an article on WP; I don't see the point of starting to list rank-n-file corporate employees. Since I work with many of these people here, sorry, my apologies in advance, but WP is not the place for this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:47, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>: Why is wikipedia not the place for this? Wikipedia has become a general reference point. I see no reason why this article should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b> Not sure if the article is trying to be more about the original organisation founded by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linuxcare.html" title="Linuxcare">Linuxcare</a> than it is about the current organisation with the same name? Maybe "Ozlabs" isn't that rare a name among international organisations with labs (of any sort) in Australia.<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 03:11, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ozlabs is a FOSS social landmark in AU. People from Ozlabs are currently working for IBM, but the Samba team and Rusty's kernel work are just two projects which have roots in this group. lucychili <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_121.44.124.28_d410.html" title="Special:Contributions/121.44.124.28">121.44.124.28</a> (talk) 11:01, 13 December 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Appreciate the feedback on the article, clearly we need to update it to better explain the relevance of OzLabs's contributions to FOSS to a non .au audience. We'll get a cleaned up version up as soon as we're able. Hughhalf 04:29, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>This one has <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> all over it. First copied directly from the Portuguese Wikipedia as a never-ending <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> resumé and thus deleted under <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A2" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A2</a>. One week later, recreated by a sockpuppet and deleted again. Now it's back (brought by yet another sock), with most of the resumé gone and a small biography written in English. No reference to the contributions that made this <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">professor</a> "very influential".

<li><b>Keep</b> He's not up for AfD on the Portuguese WP, I think they'd know if he's non-notable. (yeah, I know, <a href="../../../i/n/n/WP%7EINN_4874.html" title="WP:INN">WP:INN</a>, but they're just as hip on deleting non-notables as here).

<li>Actually, the Portuguese Wikipedia is far less efficient than the English Wikipedia. It can be months until somebody notices the article there or even bother to do something about it. The poor English is the least of the concerns here btw.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 03:48, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> It looks like they have about 20 AfD's per day, which is about proportional to the number of articles they have (1/8 that of the English WP), but that's really neither here nor there, I can read enough Portuguese to tell you it looks like the guy's written a number of textbooks, including a 10,000 word <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenician_languages.html" title="Phoenician languages">Phoenician</a> - Portuguese dictionary and a 535 page textbook on 5000 Years Of Western Culture. Looks like he edits a magazine at the New University of Lisbon, too. (I got that off the University's web site) If this article was referenced properly in <i>English</i>, I have little doubt it'd be obvious he passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>.

<dd>If he's an important professor then obviously he has done a lot of work, publications, etc. That does not grant notability per se though, and furthermore the article lacks references as you say and it would require full rewritting to be kept.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 05:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Voce pode ler o portugues melhor que eu! It looks to me that if a US professor had that much stuff on his CV, he'd be a shoo-in per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, there's nothing in WP:PROF that says the publications have to be in English, or the citations, or that the article needs to be well written. I'm not sure I buy the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> argument either, why would you think he wrote this himself? If you think he's non-notable, why haven't you PPE'd him on the PT WP? I think that'd be a no-brainer, if he had been determined to be NN in the Portuguese WP, an AfD here would be a gimme. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:04, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sim, posso ler o português e todo ele me diz conflito de interesse. It seems obvious that either the professor himself, or someone very enthusiastic about him would write and recreate this article so avidly. Have you seen many <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> articles lately? Regarding the Portuguese Wikipedia, it's a sister project but we don't abid by each other's decisions. We have different policies and something being included in one doesn't grant inclusion in the other per se. Besides, the Portuguese Wikipedia doesn't function as effectively as the English Wikipedia. Bad stuff can be kept there for ages until someone even cares about it. In fact, that's one of the reasons why I left the project.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 15:39, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>He's published 16 books in Portuguese, a number of which have had multiple printings (unless you are saying what's on his article in the PT WP is inaccurate or a hoax?), and it looks like several are university textbooks (which would qualify him per <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>). Really, this fellow looks at least as notable as <a href="../../../r/o/d/Rodryg_Dunin_8174.html" title="Rodryg Dunin">Rodryg Dunin</a>, who survived an AfD not too long ago. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 09:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not disputing that he's published what he says he did. But the article on the English Wikipedia is just a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> pool, and if all the conflict of interest were removed, we'd be left with a stub that lacked sources and asserted no notability. Furthermore, the article on the Portuguese Wikipedia does not state what sort of books are those. It's very common for university professors in Portugal to publish or co-publish a lot of work that in the end has little impact. Only good sources documenting his work would suffice to prove any notability.

<p>A list of compilation albums containing music popular at sporting events. Most are red links.

Depending on how narrowly or widely you interpret the concept, however, just about any title deviating from the "Best of Band X" template could potentially be (and some of which already having been) included here, and that's far too many for this to be useful. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUnint_1508.html" title="User:Unint">Unint</a> 02:42, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The rationale of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Jennifer_Brunner_9269.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jennifer Brunner">the last AfD</a> was that Brunner was non-notable as she was only a candidate. She has now been elected, so that rationale no longer applies.

<li><b>Comment</b>: <a href="../../../s/k/_/WP%7ESK_0a05.html" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> says that an article can be speedy kept if: "<i>No-one other than the nominator recommends that the page be deleted, and the nominator either withdraws the nomination, or wishes the page to be moved, merged, or have something else done to it other than deletion. Also, there are some cases where the nominator specifies they are nominating for the sake of process, for someone else, or some other reason but are not stating an opinion themselves.</i>" I think that applies here.

<p>This article seems to want to list every secret message, of any nature, ever placed into any media of any kind. Already we have backwards strings of text in videogames, morse code messages in songs (would that be a coded message or a secret message?), really hard-to-hear bits in songs, and one-off jokes from individual episodes of television series.</p>
<p>But there's a lot more untapped potential here too. We could rightfully include every <a href="../../../e/a/s/Easter_egg_%28media%29.html" title="Easter egg (media)">easter egg</a> that contains a secret message (<a href="http://www.eeggs.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.eeggs.com/" rel="nofollow">eeggs.com</a> lists thousands of potential items]), every computer game that uses secret messages as clues (most adventure games), every film with a joke that plays after the credits, every hidden track on an album, the entire field of <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptology.html" title="Cryptology">cryptology</a>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ring_%282002_film%29_58f0.html" title="The Ring (2002 film)">The Ring</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Da_Vinci_Code_a033.html" title="The Da Vinci Code">The Da Vinci Code</a></i>, the list goes on.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Whompa is a prominent skateboarding group in Half Moon Bay. A record of the skate team is a neccesity for the town.

<li><b>Keep</b>, Whompa is in fact a small organization of young Coast Side locals that are in the process of gaining notoriety among high end skateboarding Companies such as E.L.F. and Es.

<li><b>Keep</b>, This is a production of up-and-coming youths who are actually making a steady rise in local notoriety. They will soon attain the fame required to be "notable", so I see no reason to delete this. Besides, this is an innocent attempt at showing pride for someone's area.

<p>Before we get this thing started, let me iterate that I am a member of both LUE and LUElinks, the central locations of the meme. Now, I clearly realize there have been previous decisions to keep this article. However, those decisions almost entirely ignored the rule and guideline violations, most of which it cannot live up to. This nomination is not of bad faith.</p>
<p>The article violates the following policies and guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I quote: "Wikipedia is not the place for original research. Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say." - now, there are no reliable sources for this article and I don't believe there are any in existence. Due to the fact its main presence is on a private board, it's very unlikely for a source to publish any information on it. The "GameFAQs archive" is barely reliable, I don't believe it is. It a list of topics submitted by users, which means anything could easily have been modified.</dd>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The only thing that can possibly be verified is its origin (the source isn't very reliable either) and its existence. This isn't fact, but it is shown with the article's great lack of references.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Quote: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." The article does not have any references showing this, and based on my research, I cannot find any.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I assure you there are a few more guidelines the article violates, but I believe this is enough to convince deletion. I have gathered a list of things that the ASCII art claims notability for, and rebuttals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed by Shigeru Miyamoto</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This was simply because a person asked him to - Miyamoto would likely sign my arm if I asked him to, that doesn't make my hand notable for an article.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Popular on the GameFAQs message boards</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, for the purposes of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, it's not, since it seems only to be popular on "Life, Universe and Everything", a private message board on GameFAQs - its popularity therefore cannot be confirmed. I invite you to give a reliable source that asserts its popularity.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Interesting/I like it/Why not?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>These are not reasons to keep an article. Observe the policies and guidelines to give a valid argument.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> and redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_b5e0.html" title="GameFAQs">GameFAQs</a>. Honestly, I'd been considering nominating this again myself for a while. Simply put, this is yet another example of unverifiable internet stuff that's been kept around due to a lot of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, meatpuppetry, and other such nonsense. The only sources here are archived GameFAQs message board posts, which are far from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Any claims to notability need to be backed up with verifiable information from reliable sources, and there really isn't any in this case.<br />
Meanwhile, note that the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_LUEshi_%285th_nomination%29_9fd2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/LUEshi (5th nomination)">second-to-last AfD</a> ended with a suggestion for a merge to <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameFAQs_message_boards_e521.html" title="GameFAQs message boards">GameFAQs message boards</a>, which never materialized. That article has since been merged into the main GameFAQs article itself, which is a sign that all of the GameFAQs-related stuff should be confined to a single article.<br />
Finally, the last AfD was speedy kept as a bad-faith nom, "citing the GNAA clause". Of course, the GNAA article itself has now been deleted due to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> concerns, so it's now safe to say that there isn't really any kind of policy exemption given to repeatedly-nominated articles. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 04:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Your claim about it being non-verifiable is false, since any GameFAQs staff member could do it, should <i>you</i> ask.

<li>According to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">the verifiability policy</a>: "<i>If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it.</i>" "Reliable sources" refers to actual published sources; "GameFAQs staff members" do not qualify.<br />
"Someone might want to look this up" is also not a valid reason for having an article here; you could insert just about anything into that hypothetical. And anyway, if one were to look up "LUEshi" in such a situation, they'd be redirected to the GameFAQs article. Then they could scroll down to the "Message boards" section, where LUEshi is mentioned under the "Life, the Universe, and Everything" heading.<br />
And I don't see any previous AfDs started by the nominator of this one.

<li>I don't have a personal feud against "LUE and its descendants", in fact I enjoy going there. None of the previous AfDs were my work - where are you getting this from!? If someone gets a forum invasion with a ton of ASCII-art renditions of my arm, does that mean we need an article on it? No, not really. It's a terrible analogy, I know, but it works. A GameFAQs staff member verifying it is called "original research" and is against the primary policies of Wikipedia. I'd advise you to read these, they're the basis for the deletion. Sure, a "million people" don't know about anything, but that's irrelevant - Wikipedia needs sources and verifiability, and articles that cannot achieve this do not belong. I have nothing against LUEshi, in fact it's pretty funny sometimes. It just doesn't belong on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. TEG, unless you can somehow prove that people are being lured here to serve as blind voters, please don't throw around the accusation. You cherry-picked <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which gives three criteria, and only one of them needs to be met. "The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster." Given that this is simply a meme, "distributed" could reasonably be interpreted to mean that an explanation, as well as the ASCII itself, are present on the site. A quick google search shows Urbandictionary, encyclopediadramatica, and YTMND all on the first page, with YTMND having 43 hits for "LUEshi" and the other two having articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, LUEshi is being used as a mascot, not just as the ASCII. The Urban Dead wiki has an article about a group called "LUEshi's Undead" (<a href="http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes" class="external free" title="http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.urbandead.com/index.php?title=Lueshi's_Undead&amp;printable=yes</a>).

LUEshi is (admittedly slowly) spreading across the internet due to the actions of LUEsers, has reached a variety of sites, has links to archived topics off GameFAQs (including his creation); what more is really needed? Just because you don't like the GameFAQs archive doesn't mean it isn't a valid source, with fictional entries removed when they are noticed, which is essentially the same system of peer review that Wikipedia itself uses.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlternator_2109.html" title="User:Alternator">Alternator</a> 22:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>You've voted a strong keep and yet you've simply ignored the policy violations. As well as that, every single site you've listed is user-created. Urbandictionary, ed, YTMND, Urban Dead, Cafe Press. They're all user-edited sites. None of them are reliable sources, and all articles need reliable sources. There simply aren't any, and you're foolish to ignore that. Really, I'm trying extremely hard to control my anger. You're throwing false accusations and ignoring points all over the place. "What more is really needed"? A RELIABLE SOURCE. "LUEshi is spreading accross the internet"? You'll need a source for that. "you don't like the GameFAQs archive"? Actually, I like it. The problem is that it is user-submitted material, meaning it is not a reliable source. You cannot ignore this. Your argument is so lacking in logic it's not funny.

Don't deny it. There must be some reason for it, I'm assuming it has something to do with LUE's fame. I realize I'm swaying into bad conduct here, but when only LUE members are keeping, it simply makes me curious as to why they want the article. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 23:11, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>First off, civility would be appreciated. Stop badgering, harassing, accusing, and/or badmouthing people who express different opinions. Further, you're ignoring the very important differences between the rules for articles (which are strict) and talk pages (which are meant to be discussions), complaining when people express their personal viewpoint. I'm not going to reply to your accusations, nor to any of your complaints save one, because quite frankly you've demonstrated a complete inability to maintain a civil discourse. I'd like to note, however, that Wikipedia is technically a "user submitted site"; WP:WEB discounts sites with no review process whatsoever, such as Newgrounds; while this would discount YTMND (which was more about Notability, which has been brought up in prior VfD), it would not remove the other Wiki sites that I included. I'm maintaining my Strong Keep, and noting that I feel this is a Bad Faith Nom.<a href="../../../a/l/t/User%7EAlternator_2109.html" title="User:Alternator">Alternator</a> 23:49, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

You have still yet to provide any argument whatsoever that disprove any of the policies I have given. May you answer my question? May you back up your vote? I think you know exactly why I'm being uncivil, it's because your arguments are false, ignore points, and have no basis. I hope you realize those sites are not reliable sources under any terms. Please, just read the rules. It is not a bad faith nom AT ALL! HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK THAT? I provided THREE CLEAR VIOLATIONS, and a rebuttal to any points brought up.

<li>Wikis are <i>far</i> from reliable sources. That includes WP itself; that's why third-party published sources for verification are insisted upon here. Suggesting that pages from other wikis with even lower standards of inclusion could be taken as sources is just silly.

<li>Alternator, look at the sixth AFD. It was ****ing flooded with anonymous users who were all voting keep. I know that the both the third and the sixth nominations at least have had a LUElinks topic on the AFD, which naturally led to the use of SPAs, anonymous users, and some dead accoutns piling on the keep votes. This article has had a history of massive sockpuppetry and meatpuppetry, so this accusation is just a precaution against this happening again. Hbdragon88 23:32, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. I don't find that the case has been made that the subject of the article is unencyclopedic, or impossible of writing in a NPOV manner. However, I do find the POV, lack of sources and essay complaints do have merit and consensus. So this decision is without prejudice in regards to recreating this or a similar article that addresses those concerns. I am leaving the talk page since it contains discussion of the problems with the deleted article.

<li>Hmm... I wouldn't mind seeing individual pro-choice and pro-life articles, <i>if</i> the original article's grown too big to hold them.

Perhaps have a pro-life article, which mentiones active pro-life groups, and lists all the reasons they put forward for their case, including the Christian angle.

<dd>I just checked the [abortion and religion] page, and that page is 33 kb long as of right now. Although it is true that encyclopedias are supposed to summarize the topics covered, a look at that page would reveal that the coverage is cursory for almost every religion. Hence, attempting to pare that article down would be a fruitless task.

<li>I know what you mean, I can see how it may be possible, but we can't even consider notability when the information is not verifiable. I am a little more sensitive to accuracy in this case because it seems the subject is writing their own biography. May be a total farce, the user could be completely unrelated, but their contribution history suggests conflict of interest. I'm erroring on delete for this one. I also put a warning template on the new user's page.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 06:51, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am Barbara Biggs, the person who has written the entry for myself. Please tell me what you suggest. I have added some links to verifiable interviews. A google search will reveal at least ten pages of interviews, articles etc about me, hopefully demonstrating that my social presence in Australia is considerable. I have added some of these links to the article. Or is it not ok to write your own? If anyone has advice on how to make it more Wikipedia friendly I would welcome it. BB.</p>
<p>I have just gone into the article to add more verifiable links and see that it has already been deleted. I went to quite a lot of trouble to write it and if it can be salvaged, would be good to have it back rather than start over.</p>

<li>First of all, Welcome to wikipedia Barb. I did some summary reading on your web page and it seems that you have an interesting past. You may in fact meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wp%7Enotability.html" title="Wp:notability">wp:notability</a> guidelines, but autobiography writing is discouraged on wikipedia. You will note that I did not remove the request you had placed for someone to write an article about you. Typically this kind of discussion should take place on your user <a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarbbiggs_5fe0.html" title="User talk:Barbbiggs">talk page</a>. When you finish making a comment, you should end it with four ~ to sign your name. I will chat with you on the talk page.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:11, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This still reads like a notated bio.

<p>Still getting the hang of this thang. Just replying to the comment above that my works are primarily autobiographical. My fourth book, Chat Room, ws written with the help and at the request of Victoria Police. They felt there was a strong need for a ficitonal story about the dangers in teen chat rooms. It is a fictional book for teenagers and has received widespread publicity for that reason. It is also endorsed by Australia's governmnet funded internet safety body, which is now referenced. My fifth and latest book is also not autobiographical and now has a reputable review in one of Australia's most respected finance liftouts of a major metro daily paper. Hopefully the other references will also help the article. As I've said, any other helpful hints about what could be deleted or, in terms of where sourcing is required, added. Thanks Barbara</p>

<p>Wikipedia isn't a guide to every tag team ever. These two have teamed/been a duo in WWE for a bit, and now in TNA. There isn't a ton of notable information about their pairings. The relevant and notable information (the little there is) can be explained in their wrestler articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> Then you don't know what a tag team is considering they haven't teamed in TNA in a match. Sure, they teamed a few times in WWE, but Tomko's role is more of a bodyguard role than that of a tag team partner. --<a href="../../../d/u/b/User%7EDubhagan_33c0.html" title="User:Dubhagan"><font color="black"><b>James</b></font></a> <a href="../../../d/u/b/User_talk%7EDubhagan_8d04.html" title="User talk:Dubhagan"><font color="green"><b>Duggan</b></font></a> 02:19, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a notable tag team that's been around for awhile, provided some good momentsm and wrestled together as a clearly allied unit in both WWE <i>and</i> TNA, and you're justifying its deletion by saying "Wikipedia is not a guide to every tag team ever". By this token, <a href="../../../r/a/t/Rated-RKO_4590.html" title="Rated-RKO">Rated-RKO</a> (which despite actually winning tag team gold and having its own name has only been around about TWO MONTHS) should also be deleted.</li>

<li>And it is probably going to be kept. Winning a title is equal to notability acording to the concensus established by countless wresting afds in the past. This case is dissimilar to Rated-RKO, as this team hasn't won any gold yet. -- <b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Hybrid_70ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Hybrid"><font color="blue">T</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Hybrid_f2fa.html" title="User:The Hybrid"><font color="red">H</font></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Hybrid_f91f.html" title="User talk:The Hybrid"><font color="green">L</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_The_Hybrid_1835.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/The Hybrid"><font color="purple">R</font></a></b> 06:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed that this is dissimilar to Rated-RKO, who have their own name and tag team gold. However, the mere fact that Christian Cage and Tyson Tomko have been unified like this for an entire year in one promotion, and then brought back together in another, provides almost (if not exactly) as much notability. Unless they break up before doing absolutely anything of noteworth, Christian and Tomko should not be deleted. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 172.149.224.143 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_172.149.224.143_9400.html" title="Special:Contributions/172.149.224.143">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: This tag team ended when Christian got drafted to SmackDown! last year. It wasn't by choice, only by circumstance. Shortly thereafter, Christian did not resign with the WWE so he could go work for TNA Wrestling as "Christian Cage". He pushed to get Tyson Tomko into TNA, and currently, hes there as "Tomko". Who knows what Tomko's role will be? We have seen TNA put tag team titles on a lot of makeshift teams, so what if TNA decides to put their Tag titles on this duo? Then this article will have been deleted for nothing. I'd say give it a couple of months, and see where things are headed with this team. If Tomko doesn't really do anything but be a bodyguard and beat people up for Cage, then delete it. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames_Maxx_a7b5.html" title="User:James Maxx">James Maxx</a> 14:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Tomko and Christian, through their time in WWE, have established some kind of depth in character as a unit beyond just "wrestler and bodyguard". And already in TNA, there seems to be some indication of this, with Tomko "knowing something about Abyss's past". The minute Tomko starts to speak or team up with Christian regularly, this keep will be completely solid. 63.215.29.185 21:15, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The first is a disambiguation page, but should better be deleted as well (disambiguating between two redlinks that probably don't deserve individual articles is quite unnecessary), the second is a highway (highways are deemed more important than other streets), and the thirdd should better be deleted as well. You can see from the talk pages of these articles (first and third one) that they have not been discussed for deletion yet, so there is no way to know if they are considered notable enough (I doubt many editors would think so). There are many, many articles on Wikipedia that don't belong here, but there aren't enough of us checking articles to get rid of them.

<dd>Two comments. First, Google indicates what we (non-local editors) can find about the subject <i>when the article makes no claims to notability and provides no sources</i>. It indicates that we have tried to find indications of notability with the means available to us. Everyone participating in this discussion is free to provide off-google sources of course, and then (but only then) the argument "but there's nothing on Google" becomes invalid. Second, a street does not become notable because someone notable lived there. A street becomes notable when there are secondary sources about the street (and not mentioning it in passing), as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. So even if you would produce a source qtating that Bert Newton lived there, it would still not help you unless the source went on to discuss the street at some length. In the absence of such sources, the street is non notable, fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is cluttered and redundant. Every character on this page except one already has a listing or entire article devoted to them. There is no rhyme or reason as to what characters are included here.</p>
<p>We have a category for Kirby characters, so there isn't a need for a bloated list like this.</p>
<p>More prominent characters have their own articles.

<p>Although I was considering myself as a strong inclusionist, I couldn't make sense of this endless list of jokes in an encyclopedia. May be we should keep it somewhere as a cultural heritage (wikibooks, wikisource) but I vote for deletion from wikipedia. What do you think?

<li><i>Articles</i> aren't notable. Subjects are notable, and there's no notability guideline for jokes.

<li><b>Keep</b> as an article on one of the oldest jokes in the book (per Saberwyn, there'd have to be some folklorist or another who's actually looked at this from a scholarly perspective). Including masses of examples of the form is probably not a good idea, since there'd be a mix of copyvio and attack-page problems. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 09:20, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I so enjoyed reading through, looking for my favourites (all there) and picking up some good new ones, but I have to say it is not really an encyclopaedia article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If we took out the list of jokes, the whole content of the article would be four or five sentences, <i>every one of which</i> would be unverifiable original research. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 13:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

Proving a negative would be impossible; but, given the fact that I've never seen any sort of writing <i>about</i> the joke in my entire life, I consider that grounds enough to say that this wasn't based on reliable sources. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:08, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That last sentence implies that you know the joke exists and you're just taking the rules way too literally. What are you trying to prove? Instead of deleting perfectly good information, why not, y'know, improve it, especially if you know it exists? The point of Verifiability is to prevent Joe Smith from making an article on something <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">he just made up</a> or keeping it from being cluttered. The difference here is that the lightbulb joke has value (as you yourself seem to know) and should be included in a repository of information. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 17:15, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"exists" is not sufficient content for an article. We need to be able to say something <i>about</i> the joke without resorting to <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Information about the joke would have value, but what information can you possibly include an article about the joke without resorting to doing your own research? As it is now, that's exactly what's happened: the article is just what its authors think, instead of facts cited to a reliable source. We can recreate the article when we have a source. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 17:22, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>A: Twenty.

<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice to a future, referenced, article. The current article is massively incomplete. It doesn't even attempt anything before World War I. Current text is unreferenced and feels more like an essay than an encyclopedia article. I'm almost certain that the topic has been studied in some of the academic literature on military science and military history (topics that are quite unfashionable in Western academia these days) so that a referenced article could be created in the future. I do know that there is plenty of popular discussion and awareness for the topic to be notable, but I don't believe the current text or even organization structure would be much of a help toward a future adequate (or better) article. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Contested prod. Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I don't think that everything that gets mentioned somewhere (even in a serious work) should get an article. This kind of info could easily be put into a table (list of colours, with their RGB codes, a sample colour box, and a reference). There is no need to have a separate article about this or most other non-standard colours (by standard colours I mean red, green, blue, ... and cyan, magenta, ...). It has been named and defined, but that's all there is to say about it. It hasn't been the subject of multiple non-trivial sources (per WP:V) (and the reference you give is apparently not such a source: it is a passing mention, a short definition, not an article, paper, historical event, ... which has the colour watermelon as its subject). (It doesn't fail <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> though, like I mistakenly thought in my ProD notice.) It can arguably be said to fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as well (as a dictionary definition), but <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is my main concern. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:10, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I asked the owner of the site from which the cover supposedly came; she said that this had not been confirmed as the next single. In fact, she noted that the title track from <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sweet_Escape_7c71.html" title="The Sweet Escape">The Sweet Escape</a></i> "has been pretty much confirmed [as] the second single".

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an extremly notable joke. It has been used in many text books and a google search will show thousands of hits. Also it is written in an encylopedic fashion. Graemec2 09:59, 8 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notable things are those that have been written <i>about</i> in reliable, independent sources. Can anyone cite a secondary source <i>about</i> the joke, or just more examples of the joke itself? I could find thousands of examples of blue cars, but unless someone writes something about blue cars as a group, we can't support having an article on it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 12:38, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, I was hard-pressed for time and I had to go to Google. I still don't have all THAT much time so I can't get any "real" evidence, but the point of having at least slight significance because it had Google hits still stands. It proves that it exists and it's not just nonsense someone added for giggles. This is OBVIOUSLY not something someone just invented in school one day.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unencylopedic. I don't dispute that "Two Cows" is a well-known, widely used rhetorical device. Nevertheless the article doesn't add any non-obvious information on its subject beyond <i>reproducing the "Two Cows" joke.</i> Encyclopedic articles are <i>about</i> their subject matter; that is, they more than merely <i>exemplify</i> their subject matter. If a reader who encountered the "Two Cows" joke elsewhere came here to find more information on it, would he leave any more knowledgeable? No. Accordingly, the article as it is now is unencyclopedic. To the extent I doubt any verifiable information could be found to make it ecyclopedic, the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../p/o/p/User%7EPop_Secret_7c4e.html" title="User:Pop Secret">Pop Secret</a> 00:28, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> b/c i've never heard of this "two cow" reference, i find this entry incredibly useful. Jiggles3000 00:50, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I Dissent. Webster defines Encyclopedia as "a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge". To the extent that "Two Cows" is either a joke, or a rhetorical device used as an explanatory device, it qualifies as "information." I disagree that there is as wide an intellectual chasm between describing subject matter and exemplifying/embodying it as Secret, J. would have have us believe. Indeed, it is unclear that encyclopedias function as merely devices to encapsulate general concepts, instead of descriptively identifying something; if that were the case, biographical articles would not exist. It seems obvious that I know what a swimming pool is and elucidation does not result from wikipedia; my knowledge is not furthered. Yet, swimming pool is a valid article - its propriety is an article precisely because certain people may not *know* what a swimming pool is. This is the same logic that defends Two Cows. Additionally, as specifically noted on Wikipedia's policy page defining what Wikipedia isn't, it is noted that "...there is no practical limit to the number of topics we can cover..." To the extent that a layperson would seek further information about "Two Cows" and the corresponding no cost of keeping the article, it should stand.

<p>The result was <b>my head hurts</b>. I've closed several difficult AfDs, some <i>much</i> larger and more contentious than this one, and I pride myself on finding the proper line of reasoning and not resorting to counting votes. However, this one is one of the more difficult I've closed because, as a <i><b>possibly</b></i> emerging field of study, the references and mentions appear to be on the cusp of satisfying the requirements for an article. The comment here that best describes my conclusion of the arguments happens to be the last comment in the discussion from <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarte_ba69.html" title="User:Barte">Barte</a>, with one important change: <b>Merge essence into <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_management.html" title="Business process management">business <i>process</i> management</a> article</b> at least until the category is actually established. The potential problem with this is that the BPM article is not particularly robust. Including any signifant portion of the HIM article will overwhelm the content of the BPM article, which would create a skewed impression of the acceptance of HIM relative to traditional BPM.</p>
<p>So my decision is to <b>merge the <i>essence</i> of the <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_interaction_management.html" title="Human interaction management">human interaction management</a> article to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_process_management.html" title="Business process management">business process management</a> and redirect the HIM article to BPM.</b> The HIM portion of the BPM article should represent no more than approximately 20% of the BPM article. <i>IF</i> the BPM article is expanded, then the section on HIM may expanded comparably. I've replaced the HIM article with the redirect—the material needed for merging can be found in the history. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 11:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I respectfully disagree with Yandman and the others calling for this article's deletion. As a long-time Business Process Management professional, and as someone who has seen in practicethat the area of "Human Interaction Management", under whatever moniker it is referred to, is going to be one of the keys to success as organizations continue to evolve towards a "process-enabled" or "process-oriented" state - one in which management and staff views and manages their end-to-end business processes as their value-delivery engines, versus their functional silos as the means of value delivery - I believe this topic has real value to Wikipedia readers. It would be a great disservice to the community to remove this article. Its presence will help to stimulate discussion and, yes, debate about what I and many others do believe will emerge as an important element of how businesses manage their end-to-end business processes in the future.

<li>I am the author of the article - and one (only one!) of the SEVERAL books that cover Human Interaction Management (HIM). HIM is nothing to do with Human Resource Management. You can find a detailed description of the HIM theory in, for example, Peter Fingar's "Extreme Competition" (Meghan-Kiffer Press, 2005). I originated this theory, but it has now become the focus of interest from various different worlds. For example, HIM is now taught on MBA and Computer Science courses at Universities and Business Schools around the world, and there are several PhD research projects currently underway. There are many dozens of organizations implementing the ideas in their management practice. Articles proliferate on IT industry Web sites (Information Age, ebizq.net, bptrends.com, bpmg.org, bpm.com, and so on). The company EDS have recently published material declaring HIM to be the next generation of enterprise management practice. I created the wikipedia page as a neutral forum to help explain the ideas and encourage contribution from others. Since there is such widespread interest in the ideas, and all the software available to support them is free, this seems to be an appropriate use of wikipedia.

<li>I thought the article was fascinating. I am actually in the process of reading one of the three books referred to in the article. To me the subject matter represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the management of complex systems involving the interaction of people and computers, i.e. of practically all significant knowledge and information management systems. What is the problem everyone has? Keith Harrison-Broninski quotes books by two authors other than his own as bibliography.

<li>I also disagree with the calls for deletion. Among the vendor community there is much use or misuse of the phrase "Human Interaction management" and we need clear definition in order to stop the vendor marketing machines hijacking another solid business principle for their own commercial gain. Human Interaction Management, bears no relationship to HR as some have suggested. It is simply suggesting that if we really want to make a difference in our organisations, then we need to better understand how people work with people and then provide the ability for the more technical among us to deliver systems that support the way we actually work.

David Holliday</li>
<li>As a long-time consultant to contemporary BPM, I would like to align myself with the retention of the article in a form or another. In my humble opinion, HIM represents a clear conceptual and philosophical departure from BPM in its traditional forms: by enabling renegotiation of the public process through a multi-tier control mechanism it provides for irregular collaborations with a mobile connection structure. Notwithstanding the fact that the term has been fervently promoted by Harrison-Broninski who coined it in the first place, the term has been established within the BPM community to the extent that it transcends the notion of a neologism. As the links to the commercial product and even to KHB's web sites have been removed, I cannot see any COI or other justification for deletion. -- Janne J. Korhonen {This is an anon user 80.222.38.109 which has made few or no other edits outside of this topic.)</li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE:</b> The understanding of process context and patterns of work during human interaction is a logical development of the more mechanical workflow, BPM and associated process thinking of the past decades. It is important to broadcast the interesting new concept to a wider audience and open more dialogue on the topic. It's worthy of a place in Wikipedia. The fact that this article is seemingly obscure and supported by a limited number people does not indicate irrelevance, but rather "newness", so all the more reason to refine a mutually agreeable version of the topic. The commercial reference to Keith's book could perhaps be shifted from the 1st line to the External Links section to appease those who suspect a mercenary motive, which, by the way I don't. -- Ian Ramsay Ian Ramsay (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rojjer_2908.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rojjer">contribs</a>) has made few or no other edits outside this AFD.</li>
<li><b>STRONG DO NOT DELETE:</b> Human Interaction Management is the next phase of Business Process Management, which you can read about at Wikipedia... which also contains reference to HIM as the future of BPM. You can also read the artilce by the founder and chairman of the Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC.org)(<a href="http://www.ebizq.net/hot_topics/bpm/features/7462.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ebizq.net/hot_topics/bpm/features/7462.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebizq.net/hot_topics/bpm/features/7462.html</a>) as just one instance where the term HIM is referernced. You can also google "human interaction management" and skim thru the 12,400 hits to see that Information-Age(UK), IEEE articles, CIO magazine and umpteen other references to the term appear in reliable, independent, non-self-published sources. Apparently those complaining about "sockpuppets" (is that a neologism to be deleted as well?)are not in the world of enterprise IT. Speaking of other self-serving neologisms, how about "Wikipedia" for J. Wales? How about that cute one, WWW in serving the interests of Tim-Berners Lee?

<p>In general, the excitement around HIM may have sprung up quickly, but it is not a neologism. Rather, HIM is a necessary label for a well-defined and widely-accepted synthesis of management principles and patterns. To indicate the importance accorded to it, a short list of material on HIM from well-respected IT and management sources is now available on the HIM page.</p>
<p>Given this sort of interest in HIM from academia, analysts, and industry, what is needed now is an <b>independent</b> source of information about it - i.e., wikipedia. I may have written the original book, and the first versions of the wikipedia article, but called from the start for others to pick up where I left off with HIM. And indeed there are now many other books, PhD projects, etc focused on HIM. The term has become common management/business/IT currency, but save for wikipedia, has no online definition in the public domain.</p>
<p>HIM practices benefit society - better collaboration cures many ills. So their definition needs a public domain home. Hence the wikipedia article, which to me seems the natural location. Isn't this kind of community knowledge-sharing what wikipedia is all about? Keith Harrison-Broninski</p>

<p>I read Keith H-B's work on H.I.M. and felt that it pulls together a string of otherwise independent elements into a single holistic viewpoint that uniquely illustrates the difficulty with current BPM and path-finds for a better way forward. The potential of H.I.M. is enormous and should be explored in order to potentially revolutionise the internet...again. I believe that the deletion of this article would be a shameful stopping of a massive potential and that it serves a very useful place on Wikipedia. I strongly feel that it should not be deleted. Bryan Sergeant</p>
<p><b>STRONG DO NOT DELETE</b> I'm a strong advocate for keeping this page for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It satisfies the <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Original_Research_5e2d.html" title="No Original Research">No Original Research</a> principle: This is an important evolution and confluence of several concepts, tools and approaches. It and its constituent parts have been published in conference proceedings, journal articles and books for some time. There is nothing in this article or the citations it contains that hasn't been published. I assume we're not talking about peer reviewed scientific journals although a good proportion of the work would have been published in such places. I can't see how it violates this principle of the wikipedia.</li>
<li>It satisfies the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verifiability.html" title="Verifiability">Verifiability</a> principle: This is related to the previous point on <a href="../../../n/o/_/No_Original_Research_5e2d.html" title="No Original Research">No Original Research</a>. Many of the constituent components of this work have been published in readily accessible and reputable publications (books, journals, etc). The emerging ideas simply represent the leading edge of current practice. I suspect the wikipedia would be devoid of content if we stripped it of anything with a leading edge and I'm sure the founders didn't have any sort of simplistic, arrogant application of this principle in mind when they proposed it.</li>
<li>It satisfies the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_Point_of_View_1bc9.html" title="Neutral Point of View">Neutral Point of View</a> principle: I fail to see how one can argue that the article doesn't represent a neutral point of view. Those wikipedians who advocate the deletion of the page have had ample opportunity to edit the page to address any deficiencies in this regard. This is not a subjective or faith-based subject. It is a set of tools, techniques and approaches that has a lot to offer and is being increasingly widely practiced in business and IT circles. If there are quibbles about its appropriateness or otherwise on the periphery, let people make the appropriate edits. An author who has <b>published</b> related material cannot be accused of bias simply because he is one of only a few people to contribute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, some general comments. I have been struggling with mechanistic approaches to and notations for business process modelling and management for some time now so I want to argue that the topic is extremely valuable. My first inkling that there was an alternative approach came when I read Martyn Ould's book, Business Process Management: A Rigorous Approach. He points out, as does Harrison-Broninski, that human driven processes are dynamic, self modifying and impossible to depict using rigid mechanistic process management tools and techniques. I followed up by reading Harrison-Broninski's book and it, combined with other reading and practice, has opened up a wealth of possibilities as far as meaningful process management approaches and an opportunity to address the old business-IT divide in very exciting ways. By the way, under no circumstances should this topic be redirected to Human Resource Management! That is <i>not</i> what it is about.</p>
<p>If you don't like neologism, that's too bad! There are innumerable ways to categorise and classify the things we do. If it distinguishes one topic from related ones in a meaningful way then it should be encouraged as a good thing, not removed because of some blinkered and simple-minded application of an individual principle. That's what the wikipedia is trying to overcome, isn't it?</p>
<p>Lastly, regarding some of the arguments in favour of deletion. Although I hesitate to dignify them with the term <i>argument</i>. Instead they contain unsubstantiated slurs and accusations and are <i>very</i> disappointing to see in this environment. I had to have a chuckle when I saw "astroturfing and neologism" in the same sentence but on the whole I've been very disenchanted with the vitriol and meaningless drivel from many of the people advocating deletion. If you want to look me up next time you're in Canberra you can, over the beverage of your choice, verify for yourself that I am no sock puppet (another neologism from the anti-neologism movement?).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I think Keith's phrase (above) eloquently expresses the problem here: "what is needed now is an independent source of information about it".

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yandman, wikipedia <b>is</b> a tertiary source for HIM. The primary source is the books and academic publications. The secondary source is the Web sites, print articles, Web articles, blogs, screencasts, podcasts, etc. And re puppetry, it's easy to see why as an outsider you would be suspicious of the response level here. However, just to give a single example of the interest in HIM, the <a href="http://human-interaction-management.info" class="external text" title="http://human-interaction-management.info" rel="nofollow">HIM Web site</a> reports thousands of <b>unique</b> visitors per <b>week</b>.

<li><b>Commment</b> : Wikipedia policy on AFDs is: <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons). Conversely, the opinions of logged in users whose accounts predate the article's AfD nomination are given more weight</i> Hence sock puppets and meat puppet comments are usually disregarded by the closing admin, making all that effort completely wasted. Another wikipedia article says: <i>One exception to the principle of assume good faith concerns the use of sockpuppets. This tactic is commonly employed by vandals and bad-faith contributors who create multiple user accounts in an attempt to bias the decision process. A close variation is to enlist "meatpuppets", people from outside Wikipedia to "run in" (for example, if my article about a web forum is up for deletion and I post a call for other forum members to "help keep our website in Wikipedia"). Signs of these tactics are that a contributor's account was created after discussion began, that a contributor has few edits or that a contributor's other edits have been vandalism. Other Wikipedians will draw attention to such facts and may even recommend deletion simply because apparent sock- or meat-puppets piled in with "do not delete" or other similar comments.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Unfortunately, (vandalism aside) such cases are notoriously hard to distinguish from good-faith contributors writing their first article or from anonymous users who finally decide to log in. If someone does point out your light contribution history, please take it in the spirit it was intended - a fact to be weighed by the closing admin, not an attack on the person.</i> <i>Because of our past problems, opinions offered by new or anonymous users are often met with suspicion and may be discounted during the closing process. This decision is made at the discretion of the closing admin after considering the contribution history and pattern of comments. In practice, civil comments and logical arguments are often given the benefit of doubt while hostile comments are presumed to be bad-faith. Please note that verifiable facts and evidence are welcome from anybody and will be considered during the closing process.</i> --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:56, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

I appreciated the reference to the theory, since I'm doing research on workflow and scientific information dynamic. Why not sipmly edit the article rather than delete it? The information is obviously valuable and so far I've seen a lot of disagreement around its presentation. How could it be modified to fit protocol? Why not edit it as such. For starters, it may be best to not start out with reference to an individual before the theory has become more developed... but keep the content. There is a definite need for the information on the internet, as I haven't found much on this outside the university library. Thanks. J. 12 Dec 2006 (5:20) Madison, WI</li>

<li><b>Merge essence into <a href="../../../b/u/s/Business_performance_management.html" title="Business performance management">business performance management</a> article</b> at least until the category is actually established. The technology and business consultant sectors cook up neologisms by the dozens. Some of them, like BPM, actually take root, while others turn out to be marketing ploys: ways to differentiate a product or service in a crowded market. I'm not informed enough about HIM to know for sure which this is--but my sense is that the verdict is still out. The article itself reads more as a book excerpt than a traditional Wikipedia entry. I have no sense that the term HIM has reached the broader industry, where it would elicit criticism as well as praise. And my sense here is that the vehement protests over the article's possible deletion are coming mostly from true believers, rather than from people who are actually seeking information. In other words, Wikipedia seems to be used here as a way to validate the term HIM, rather than as a reflection of the term already validated. Until such validation is clear, I suggest merging the essence of this article into BPM.

<p>Non-notable politician. Has never held elected office (or, as far as I know, stood for office). So what is he? Member of a party faction committee. Advisor to a notable politician, and a large part of this article is actually about this MEP, not the subject. Editor of a very small circulation internal party faction magazine, not a notable publication. Nothing to suggest notability of his own. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:52, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>It was recreated on December 3 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melrose_Bickerstaff&amp;oldid=91948684" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melrose_Bickerstaff&amp;oldid=91948684" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>.

Sorry".</p>
<p>That the contestant was popular is simply a mass invocation of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. If the previous contestants on this reality television show are any gauge, the model might be popular now, but in a year or two few people will remember her. Aside from losing on the show, she's done nothing noteworthy or substantial. Google tests are tempting but invalid, since they return lots of hits on MySpace pages, blogs and forums about fans discussing the show -- but precious few hard, third-party stories.</p>
<p>This model fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, then, and the article should be deleted leaving a redirect back to the show season's page. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 13:28, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - They just announced the winner last Wednesday. Don't reality shows usually make the constestants sign a paper saying they can't draw attention to themselves, or reveal the results until the winner is revealed on tv? So, there isn't going to be much on her at the moment. Since Melrose was a decent modle, it is likely to assume that she'll be just as notable as the other 2nd runner-ups.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I disagree, in the strongest terms possible.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Your description of Google is flawed. Google doesn't track links; it tracks text. You're searching through the text on the pages, not the links on the pages. The order of the results might be influenced by the number of links, but the number of hits is the number of time the searched text was found in the corpus Google has spidered. If the text isn't found at all, it's a strong argument that the term doesn't exist. If you have more questions, feel free to send an email or use my talk page as I don't think clarifying this is an appropriate use of the AfD process. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 03:14, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Do you work for Google? The only thing that is "flawed" is using Google as a test to determine the notability of a subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> - If a whole bunch of tv shows have articles about their minor, reacurring characters, a notable contestant on a reality show can't have an article? It just doesn't feel right to me. I mean, reality contestants usually sign a confidentiality agreement, that says they can't talk about the show until it's over. Why don't you just keep the article for another week, and if nothing more notable is realeased, re-nominate her?

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. OK, I read it all. The sources, the article, the entire discussion here. I must say, the discussion here was the most entertaining of it. Despite the persistent hammering by large caliber arguments on the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> themes, the counter arguments put up a spirited defense of the article. Even though I take it that I'm one of only a few people to grow up in the U.S. without having heard of this game, I was persuaded by the common folklore arguments. Unfortunately, common folklore doesn't provide the facts and details needed to write an article. That gets back to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> arguments. On balance, it can't stay without sources because despite what everyone else seems to "know" about this, it still needs sources. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug Bell</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 07:40, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is for those of you who say because the nature of this game is that it can't be cited, it should be deleted. Folklores and bedtime stories have been passed around by word of mouth for thousands of years, yet they cannot be sourced, does that mean they should be deleted on wikipedia as well? This game is very popular amongst children and young adults, and has been passed around by word of mouth and popular culture. Just because you haven't heard of it does not make it unpopular. From personal experience, I can say that the vast majority of young adults have heard of this game, making it more popular than some folklores. 10:00, 9 December 2006

<li><b>Keep</b> - The nature of this game is one that cannot be sourced. You're not going to find information in any newspaper articles, because it is somewhat of an underground thing, and even if it were sourced, that article would be inaccurate because the game does have so many different rules from school-to-school.

<li><b>DELETE</b> OK, time for today's Wikipedia lesson: <i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is <b>verifiability, not truth</b>. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader should be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has <b>already been published by a reliable source</b>. Editors should provide a reliable source for material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or it may be removed.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is one of Wikipedia's three content policies. The other two are <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a>. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should try to familiarize themselves with all three. The principles upon which these policies are based are negotiable only at the Foundation level.</p>
<p>And further into the rule <i>The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. Any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, which should be cited in the article. <b>If an article topic has no reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it</b>.</i> and <i>Articles should rely on reliable, third-party published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Sources should be appropriate to the claims made: exceptional claims require stronger sources</i></p>
<p>Already you have stated there are no reliable, third-party sources on this, so the article Fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">Reliable sources</a></p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p><i><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Original Research</a> is a term used in Wikipedia to refer to material that has not been published by a reliable source. It includes unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories, or any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position — or which, in the words of Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales, would amount to a "novel narrative or historical interpretation."</i></p>
<p><i>kipedia is not the place for <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Citing sources and avoiding original research are inextricably linked: the only way to demonstrate that you are not doing original research is to cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article, and to adhere to what those sources say.</i></p>
<p>Well, by looking at this, we see the article in question is in violation of this policy. So we have an article which is NOT 'improving' wikipedia, is Original Research, does not cite reliable third party sources, and is not verifiable by the common person. BTW: <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore all rules</a> is meant not as a way for someone to use it as a 'get out of jail free' card to add whatever they want.

<li><b>Delete</b> There have been a number of these types of games that have been nominated for AfD in the past month or two. All have been hoaxes and follow a similar pattern in which a number of people, likely sockpuppets/single-purpose accounts, come to the AfD and talk about how popular and widespread the game is. These same accounts post ridiculous statements on the articles talk page. While this particular article seems to be a little less extreme in this sense, it still certainly hints that its a hoax in the same way. I doubt the game actually exists and even if it does, an unverifiable playground game with varying rules <i>and</i> names certainly in unencyclopedic. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:03, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Though I understand the issue of verifiability is problematic to the article, due to the nature of the game... I for one, had seen this game come up at least once a day at my high school. I'm not suggesting that my experience lends any merit to the article, but I am aware that this isn't some inside joke people just randomly decide to make an article about. I'm positive that there must be a reference to this game somewhere, someplace (even, perhaps, in a book of adolescent school games, or whatever). This isn't really something just "made up in school one day"; it was just something you were passively made aware of in adolescent, like birthday punches and wedgies. This is all from the bottom of my heart. --<a href="../../../c/2E/l/User%7EC.Logan_5bcc.html" title="User:C.Logan">C.Logan</a> 03:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I had seen something like this going on back when I was in high school, but it's an entirely unencyclopedic topic. The article states that the only real rule is the use of the circle-hand, then lists a bunch of unsourced rule variations. Then it lists a bunch of strategies. This is all original research, and should not be allowed.<br />
It's quite similar to what often happens with that "The Game" article, where random people keep trying to add in their own rule variations, strategies, and various other nonsense. The difference here is, that article actually has a print source, and removing all of the OR doesn't leave us with a blank article. This article has no reliable sources, it isn't verifiable, so it has to go. <i><b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">Warpstar</a></b><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarpstarRider_25fe.html" title="User talk:WarpstarRider">Rider</a></i> 09:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You missed my point, which is that it most certainly is verifiable. You already knew about it before this article, didn't you? And so does everyone else voting here (except for "The Way", apparently... what hole did they crawl out of?). If three people sit in a room together and one of them brings up some childhood game, and the other two say "oh yeah I remember that," then that's verifiability. It doesn't matter if they can't find a newspaper article or a scholarly journal on it. It's verifiable because everyone here in this vote knows that it's real. That's enough verifiability for folklorists, for example, who often have only oral history to work from. We all know it, so it's verifiable.

And exact same content in the exact same format would not have been considered a blog eight years ago. But even without the journal, the scene happened on the show in season 2 episode 6.

<dd>I don't see anything in the notability requirements that requires that every source be nonfiction. If a fictional show is referencing a real-life game, there's nothing wrong with us noting this reference. In fact it would make a good subsection of the article, "The circle hand game in fiction". There is absolutely nothing wrong with such a reference, you'll see that sort of thing all over Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think that this article should be removed and not merged with the kotor 2 website. As stated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT" rel="nofollow">what wikipedia is NOT</a> site, wikipedia is not a game guide and in addition to that, the number of items found in the game are quite numerous, a total of about several hundred or a thousand at least. These items would include armours, weapons, upgrades, etc. If anyone wanted a detailed description of each and every item, for example the amount of damage or defense a particular weapon or armour gives, I think they should just search the web for a gaming site dedicated to such purposes. For example, for a complete walkthrough and guide for several games including KOTOR 1 &amp; 2, <a href="http://www.gamebanshee.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gamebanshee.com" rel="nofollow">Gamebanshee.com</a> is quite a good site in my opinion and in addition to that, it comes with the complete list of items neatly sorted out into different categories. For cheats, hints, guides, walkthroughs, FAQs (although the number of guides and walkthroughs might not be so numerous and comprehensive) and a complete list of all items, not including item specs, one can try <a href="http://www.gamesradar.com" class="external text" title="http://www.gamesradar.com" rel="nofollow">Cheatplanet.com or Gamesradar.com</a>. So therefore, I feel that this site is to be removed :) <a href="../../../s/o/n/User%7ESongjin_b996.html" title="User:Songjin">songjin</a> 23:43, 8th December 2006</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - The page is corporate marketing. VIA design and manufacture chipsets. EPIA is a marketing term for distribution of their chipsets to retail. So EPIA is not really a product, as such. I had edited this page and redirected to <a href="../../../v/i/a/VIA_chipsets_b388.html" title="VIA chipsets">VIA_chipsets</a>, putting mention of the EPIA marketing brand on the chipsets page, but user <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">User:MureninC</a> called this 'vandalism' and reverted. Unless a corporate marketing brand is notable, and EPIA is certainly <b>NOT NOTABLE</b> in terms of overall x86 market share, I really don't see why it should be allocated a separate page, when it could be slotted into an existing one, already dealing with said products. Is the WIKI here to recycle corporate press releases? <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 15:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. EPIA is a series of mainboards that is very popular in the embedded market, it has nothing to do with marketing, and certainly, it is not at all related to marketing of chipsets. Claim about EPIA being "not really a product" is unfounded and downright malicious. Claim about the article being "corporate marketing" is ungrounded, for example, I've personally added a criticism section to the article describing some problems with the platform. Claim about unpopularity is misrepresented, as many models of EPIA mainboards are available from <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newegg.com.html" title="Newegg.com">newegg.com</a> for some time already. Also, notice that several other wikipedia.org sites already feature this article under its own name, and article on en.wikipedia.org existed since 2004. All in all, <b>this nomination is ill-informed at best</b>. <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> 00:56, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b><a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> violates WIKI guidelines by failing to declare himself as the primary author / sponsor of the page.</b> What I said was in terms of overall x86 market sales volume, EPIA is insignificant - probably less than 1% of the market. The fact its listed on some internet website, does nothing to address that fact. If listing on some shopping engine is criteria for WIKI inclusion, then WIKI becomes a parts database. EPIA really is more or less irrelevant to the overall PC market - which is why its not notable. MureninC again demonstrates his total inability to differentiate between marketing and products. VIA make chipsets, the EPIA brand is reference design for marketing of the chipsets. To try and settle this, lets see what VIA has to say about this shall we?</p>

<p><b>Richard Brown (VIA's Director of International Marketing): We also have an EPIA reference design that integrates the Envy24PT.......</b></p>
<p>There you have a direct quote from VIA's Director of International Marketing, referring to EPIA not as a product, but as a 'reference design.' So even VIA's own staff say EPIA is not actually a product - its a marketing tool. Yet <a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> is convinced he knows best, and VIA's Director of International Marketing has it all wrong. Do we really have to take this debate any further? Surely VIA's Director of International Marketing can be taken as an authoritative source on whether EPIA is a marketing brand or a product?

<dd><b>Timharwoodx, please stop your ungrounded accusations.

After he noticed the tags, he started his personal attacks on the talk page of <a href="../../../v/i/a/VIA_C3_d3b3.html" title="VIA C3">VIA C3</a> article, talk page of my profile, then he removed the cleanup tags and the split tags I've created, and started calling me names in his edit summaries against my edits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=VIA_CoreFusion&amp;diff=91627703&amp;oldid=90398199" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=VIA_CoreFusion&amp;diff=91627703&amp;oldid=90398199" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> (whereas the links are present in <i>Template:VIA</i>, section <i>See also</i> refers to the immediately useful links, but Timharwoodx failed to see that, and started calling names) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=VIA_C3&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91774398" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=VIA_C3&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=91774398" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (clearly, VIA C7 is intended for embedding market, and people want to know the <i>Average TDP</i> much more than they are interested in the <i>Maximum TDP</i> (specifically because Average TDP on VIA C7 is over 1000% lower than the maximum TDP), but instead of creating a new column or renaming existing one, Timharwoodx just removes my contributions and starts calling names again). Timharwoodx, please stop using personal attacks as a way to accomplish your agenda. (As far as <b>Richard Brown</b> goes, I don't think there is a need for any comments on his statement, as it is clearly taken out of context. If Paul Otellini says that they have a reference design of motherboards or networking adapters, does it mean that Intel doesn't produce motherboards and networking adapters?

<p><a href="../../../m/u/r/User%7EMureninC_a0fe.html" title="User:MureninC">MureninC</a> You added numerous factual errors to the VIA section. For example, I had a column labeled 'max TDP', and you added 'average' TDP figures. You should have created a new column. <b>Its not for me to go around tidying up your mangled broken English edits all the time</b>. If you want to add average TDP, and I don’t disagree with that because it is useful and relevant information, add your own column, and do it yourself. But you'd need to collect it for all of the C3 processors, not just the C7, otherwise the table becomes broken as a form of comparative analysis, which is its main purpose. But you can't add average TDP to the max TDP column. Thats nonsense, as its not the same thing at all, which is why I had to delete it! Also, you were utterly confused about the C3 not understanding it was originally a WINCHIP product bought by VIA, and they swapped cores, while keeping the same marketing name. I object to someone calling my work 'one of the worst pages in the WIKI' and then riddling it with factual errors, not present in my drafts. So in fact, you started the insults, if we go over it. This is a deletion page, and it looks like EPIA will stay, I respect the community voice in any matter, but I hope you've learned not to call someone elses work 'one of the worst pages in the WIKI' - as that tends to generate a response, especially when your edits are, so often, utter nonsense, in oftentimes broken English. Anyways, you should have declared yourself as a sponsor as the EPIA page. That was a guidelines violation. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 18:08, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Actually, Intel don't produce motherboards, they produce processors and chipsets. So again, you validate my point with your analogy. You lack a technical understanding of the subject matter - its very obvious. Companies like ASUS, ABIT, MSI, etc, make the motherboards. Look at your PC boot screen sometime! Do some google searches. You might learn something. NVIDIA do not produce graphics cards. They make graphics chips, which third party companies turn into graphics cards. There are exceptions, 3DFX sought to make their own cards, and ATI have in periods, but normally the chip companies do not make the cards / moptherboards themselves. This is basic stuff indeed, that you clearly just don't have a clue about. I'm not here to act as your personal tutor, but if you don't understand a topic, please don't edit in it! EPIA is not really a product, its a brand for VIA chipsets, and thats completely true. So it should be an aside on the chipsets page i.e. 'this chipsets is branded as EPIA platform xxxx by VIA. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 18:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Timharwoodx, everyone but you lacks a technical understanding - <i>this</i> is very obvious. How could you possibly live in a world of such ignorant individuals like all of us? It must be terrible! You should seriously consider opening a new wikipedia where only the privileged like yourself would have the authority to edit the articles.

<li>I do <b>not</b> think this should be merged with the <a href="../../../l/v/m/LVMH_7070.html" title="LVMH">LVMH</a> article, as eLUXURY is one of LVMH's brands, and (almost) all of the company's different brands have their own article (<a href="../../../v/e/u/Veuve_Clicquot_88c2.html" title="Veuve Clicquot">Veuve Clicquot</a>, <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Vuitton_473d.html" title="Louis Vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>, etc.). LVMH's other main online site, <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sephora.html" title="Sephora">Sephora</a>, has its own article, so I don't see why eLUXURY shouldn't have its own article as well. The article has been updated in regards to its founding, advertising methods, design, and competition, so I think it should no longer be marked for deletion. -- <a href="../../../v/i/n/User%7EVincentanton_ac28.html" title="User:Vincentanton">Vincentanton</a> 02:53, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

Despite the apparently large number of links used, only one <a href="../../../i/n/d/Wikipedia%7EIndependent_sources_664e.html" title="Wikipedia:Independent sources">independent source</a> provides substantial coverage of the subject as the primary focus.

One link is an <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epinions.html" title="Epinions">Epinions</a> review, which doesn't qualify as a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a>.

<li><b>Keep with serious revisions</b>. I tend to agree with the notion that significant brands should have a presence on Wikipedia. However, there are aspects of this article that bother me. The <i>Design</i> section: Web-site design is an ephemera unless it represents an innovation or a unique and notable achievement; for instance, if the site were the first to use the 3D-rendering to enhance the shopping experience (which is not noted) or if it was the first 'mini-boutique' to capture the public's attention (which is not noted). The <i>Advertising</i> section: the method and extent that a site is advertised is not in itself sufficiently notable for inclusion; further, the types of advertising employed on the site are not in themselves notable, and are additionally ephemera. The <i>Competition</i> section: this section maintains a thread of comparison to LuxLook.com and does not place eLuxury in an industry context, which a well composed 'competition' section should, unless these are the only two major recognized players in the specified retail domain ... which they are not or at least which is not stated. The <i>Brands</i> section: there should be mention here of the role that the site plays (or used to play) as an outlet for the parent company, which should likely be transplanted to here from the opening paragraph. In summary: get rid of or whittle to line-items the Design and Advertising sections, enhance the competition section and place the brands section in context and it might lose the 'aroma of salesmanship' as another commenter alluded to. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 00:33, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I tagged this as spam a month ago, it's barely changed since (one word and the addition of a spam link for an unofficial yousendit forum). A month is long enough, this needs to be rewritten to demonstrate notability and remove spam or it needs to be deleted.

<p>Article is a direct copy of a list available elsewhere, and is of no general use (a link to the website the list is on would work just as well).

<li><b>KEEP.</b> In response to Lima Golf, Superpower is in fact a very notable site, and I would like to know how you can call one of the most famous websites in the nationsimulator community non-notable. In response to Jobjorn, I would agree that some of the content under Superpower on the main nationsimulator page should be removed, there are many, <i>many</i> articles worse than this one that should be removed, so why target one of the longer, better articles?--Conquistador III 17:29, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> While it may be notable to nationsim players, it is not notable overall and as thus not suited for inclusion an encyclopedia. Geo-Political web-based simulators covers SPC too, although I doubt whether that article would make it through an AfD. But why target "one of the longer, better articles"? Because I happened to find it and looked into it. If I do the same with another article, I will "target" that one too.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have, in fact, made many edits to various articles on the Wikipedia, however, seldom do I log in. I did have an account with quite a few edits on it, but as I rarely log in it seems to have been deleted. Now, if you were to go to the Superpower website under the "Essays" forum, you would find a number of articles and essays on politics of the real world, and spirited debates about the said articles, which are generally sourced from an article from a major news outlet, such as BBC, and includes the author's interpretations and beliefs on the article from the news agency, and often some facts that are not included in the news article, thus conforming to the first clause of WP:WEB.--Conquistador III 18:57, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry, I don't want to come off as rude. I'm just really motivated to have the articles removed. It's also probably not a good idea if I draft paragraphs about myself. That'd be kinda self-serving wouldn't it? The current article lacks details to be of interest to anyone, and even if it were flushed out with more content I still don't see what's so notable about myself to warrant an article.

Please be certain that this person is genuinely notable before we keep it against his wishes. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 09:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>: Some local media may be doing interviews with me about my doings (setup by my employer ...). If the community wants to keep the article about me, maybe they can use the published interview(s) for material? -- Tom

<ul>
<li>I think you've been very clear, actually, Tom; nobody here doubts your earnest desire to see your article deleted. What my "digging the grave" reference to is that you are saying that new sources proving your notability are about to emerge--the best sort of sources for showing notability, that is, genuine media that's independent of you. The nominator claims that you are non-notable, which would, according to policy, be the only real reason to delete the article. You're bringing forth new evidence of your notability, thus undercutting your expressed desire. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 19:00, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ah, gotcha. Well, to be honest I think it's the marketting folk at my job who talked the local media into it. Though they do seem intrigued about my politics and how I "used the Internet to build a Career." I'm not trying to say what I've been doing for the last five years was trivial or unimportant. I just have to question, in the face of all the other OSS projects out there, how unique and notable it is. It'd be like if you were a really good coal miner. Even if you did a good job, worked hard, etc, do you deserve a wiki article? The only real thing that stands out between myself and other OSS developers is my desire to release to the public domain instead of copyleft. -- Tom
<ul>
<li>We take these things one at a time. Plenty of people argue (these are folks arguing to <i>keep</i> their articles, you understand) that there are many articles of, say, bands just as notable as theirs. Doesn't matter, all you can evaluate is the article in front of you. Same argument applies to Tom St Denis, just in reverse. And, coal miners are not inherently notable, they have to do something truly unexpected to achieve notice. Guys who write books, on the other hand--keep your nose clean, work hard, get the reviews, you get a wiki article. Plus, Tom, you've got a catchy name for your product. Never underestimate the power of a catchy name. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkspots_7ff4.html" title="User:Darkspots">Darkspots</a> 21:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, I've added info to the talk page if you guys want to rebuild the article and keep it. At least with some details it'll be worth having the slightly elevated profile around.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at the stuff Tom has done, I'm inclined to say that he's borderline notable at present. What sways me towards deletion is his pleasing modesty.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Tom, my own view is that a really good coal miner could certainly qualify for an article here. In assessing people's work-related notability I look for two things: first, have they accomplished something by their own efforts that makes them stand out in their field ? and/or second, are they recognised by their peers, and by the broader public, for their work ? So a coal miner could certainly qualify, perhaps if he were highly productive ( for example, we have an article on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleksei_Grigorievich_Stakhanov_9796.html" title="Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov">Aleksei Grigorievich Stakhanov</a>, who was noted for his zealous workmanship ( though there are also doubts as to precisely what happened on that historic day ) ), or perhaps if he in some other way performed at the peak of his profession. The same is obviously true for any other person in any other field of human endeavour. Right now it appears, from the comments of people more expert in the field of computers than I, that you are doing a great job. Your own opinion is that you're not quite unique or notable enough, though, and ( even allowing for some gentlemanly modesty ) you're probably one of the best judges of that, so I'm prepared to go with deletion for the moment. But watch out: people know your name, and are talking about you, so you're definitely at risk of having an article at some stage ! With best wishes for the future. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 18:04, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the kind words. The way I see it, being a bit over-modest is always a good idea. It's all too tempting to drop your guard and let the ego soar. As another pointed out, usually people are fighting to <b>keep</b> their vanity pages because they lost perspective and think they're really worthy of notability. I'd rather lean towards the side of caution and due process. To be honest, my notability would be better proven when all those, whom I presumably (*) touched through my efforts come forward to offer testimony, then by simply listing a couple of books and a URL to some source code. I admit it seems odd that I argue for deletion instead of keeping it. It isn't because I'm anti-social or self-destructive. Just that I have enough respect for what Wikipedia is attempting to not let my personal ego interfere with the process. (* based on the concensus assumption I'm currently notable). -- Tom</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It's refreshing when a subject of a wikipedia article not only takes interest in wikipedia but also keeps a level head when they learn about their page and that it may be kept against their wishes. I do hope that tom sticks around and updates other wikipedia articles as well. I am sure he has vast experiance in different areas that would definately be a big help to wikipedia. On a site note: I admire the stance to publish into the PD instead of Copyleft. That alone should be a point of notability and what science/research is all about. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What's the call? I'm still in favour of deletion on non-notability grounds. I think we should close this discussion once and for all. I'm not closed to the idea in the future about an article (if the circumstances warrant it), but as I see it now this isn't the case. -- tom
<ul>
<li>Deletion debates aren't usually concluded earlier than five days after they start, which means there's some seven hours or so before this one becomes eligible to be closed. The article will almost certainly be kept, though, given that there's no consensus to delete. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 16:56, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Is there enough citable resources to fill out a competent article? I think if you really press some of the voters here for wiki-worthy material they may realize the folly of their ways. I'll bet most voted to keep out of some misguided attempt to avoid hurting my feelings or something. As it stands now, the only published material with my name on it are the two books. And aside from the prefaces of both there isn't much material that discusses Tom or his wacky LibTom Projects. Again, I encourage people to re-evaluate the situation. -- Tom
<ul>
<li>I don't think there are enough citable sources to fill out more than a few sentences. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatt_Crypto_f5b3.html" title="User:Matt Crypto">— Matt <small>Crypto</small></a> 11:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Merge</b> The LibTom Project page is about his software. This page is about him as a software writer which seems to be the only thing he is currently notable for.

<p><b>A CHALLENGE TO OTTO4711's PROPOSED DELETION FROM SAMUEL KENSINGER FRANCIS</b></p>
<p>This is <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Kensinger_Francis_01d2.html" title="Samuel Kensinger Francis">Samuel Kensinger Francis</a> writing. I will first address the questions about the veracity and verifiability of my magazine, HERO, which I published and co-founded in 1997-2001. I will include several articles on the internet which verify my role as such, and will be happy to supply Wikipedia with printed copies of the bound edition of the magazine if necessary to prove same. Finally, I question the motives of the user OTTO4711 and her reasons for proposing deletion—seems she has an <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> problem of her own.</p>
<p><b>HERO MAGAZINE AND PROOF OF ROLE, 1997-2001</b></p>
<p>For the record, I have printed mastheads from HERO Magazine in my possession which verify my co-founding and as Publisher of HERO Magazine from 1997-2001. In addition, a complete volume of the periodical is stored in perpetuity by the New York Public Library and also the Library of Congress. I can also guide you to the following articles elsewhere on the internet which verify my role as Publisher and Co-Founder:</p>
<p><a href="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/" class="external free" title="http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/" rel="nofollow">http://directmag.com/mag/marketing_straight_talk_gay/</a></p>
<p><b>EXCERPT FROM <i>DIRECT MAGAZINE</i></b></p>
<p><i>"While some analysts see a trend toward nationalization of the marketing media as a reflection of what's happening in the mainstream and as a reflection of the greater acceptance of the lesbian and gay market, there are still some small "pop and pop" operations running. One example is Sam Francis, the founder and publisher of HERO, a magazine for gay men who are more interested in a relationship than in a lifestyle.</i></p>
<p><i>The publication began as a Web site, but turned into a print product. Despite its origins, banner ads have not worked for Francis to acquire subscribers. Instead he uses a mix of rented mailing lists, inserts in gay-male specific catalogs, and such Web-based subscription services as enews.com. His own site can also accept subscriptions, which he sees as an important gateway to the market.</i></p>
<p><i>A 200,000-piece mailing gets a 2% response, with a special "Gay Wedding Guide for Men" issue providing a 60% response spike. While his current subscriber base is 14,000, Francis believes his marketing mix can bring the base up to 100,000 in 2001, which he says will make it the gay magazine with the largest circulation in the country.</i>"</p>

<b>REGARDING THE WIKIPEDIA USER 'OTTO4711' and her <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a></b></p>
<p>The user OTTO4711 has no e-mail address for direct contact. I question the user "OTTO4711's" motives in proposing my article for deletion. If you'll check their browsing history, he/she also browses Wikipedia for other notable gay celebrities (and personal friends of mine), including <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chip_Arndt_7750.html" title="Chip Arndt">Chip Arndt</a> &amp; <a href="../../../r/e/i/Reichen.html" title="Reichen">Reichen</a> Lehmkuhl (of the Amazing Race), my mother in law, actress <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conny_Van_Dyke_cba8.html" title="Conny Van Dyke">Conny Van Dyke</a>, and my partner Bronson Page, "proposing them for deletion" for superfluous reasons.

I respectfully request that this user's account be de-activated as I believe SHE has a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>.</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY OF CHALLENGE TO DELETION</b></p>
<p>My accomplishments in founding HERO Magazine, an award-winning, national publication (who's entry is also in Wikipedia) stand for itself and are unqualified. The entry is relevant and should not be deleted.</p>
<p><i>—Posted by <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Kensinger_Francis_01d2.html" title="Samuel Kensinger Francis">Samuel Kensinger Francis</a> 12/08/06</i></p>
<dl>
<dd>Wow. That was pretty impressive. Way to cast aspersions with no foundation in fact whatsoever there, Sam. If you actually check my browsing history, you'll see that I have thousands of edits to articles regarding gay people, gay movies, gay topics, etc. and try to better them. I've written several dozen articles on the topic. Plus, I'm a big queer so I have no problem with gay people in general.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I proposed your two articles for deletion because of issues of verifiability. I stumbled across your article because it was in <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_people_from_the_United_States_7299.html" title="Category:LGBT people from the United States">Category:LGBT people from the United States</a>. It struck me as odd that a home improvement show like <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Makeover_Home_Edition_5347.html" title="Extreme Makeover Home Edition">Extreme Makeover Home Edition</a> would have a personal trainer so I checked the website and found no verification of your affiliation with the program under multiple versions of your name. Similarly I checked the Sirius radio page and found no verification that you "host a fitness program." I could also find no verification of your affiliation with HERO. You have now provided verification of some of the information that is included in the article and I therefore <b>withdraw</b> my nomination for deletion. The next thing that should happen is that an editor who is not you and not related to you by blood or marriage should merge the two articles on you into one and properly source it. I will not do so because although I certainly bear neither you, your spouse, your mother in law nor any of your friends and relations the slightest malice, your suggestion of some sinister ulterior motive on my part leads me to take a total hands-off approach.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have removed the equals signs that you placed above your response because placing them there causes your response to become an entry in the day's table of contents separate from the nomination itself and it should not be. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:46, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And just to address your somments about your mother-in-law's article, I made four edits to it, two of which were minor cosmetic changes and one of which was to restore something that I had removed after further research turned up a source fo it. I never had any quibble with her article and I think that I improved it. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:59, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong delete</b> The NYPL and the Library of congress have permanent copies of almost anything, and if all there is of this is one volume, and that's the only places there are, that puts it at the very lowest level of notability for a journal.

<p>As you are a librarian, please note that HERO Magazine was named "One of the 10 Best New Magazines" by Library Journal, one of your industry's own publications. In addition, HERO was named "One of the 10 Best Magazines" by magazine expert and University of Mississippi journalism professor Samir Husni, who is also known as "Mr. Magazine" and widely considered one of the most authoritative voices on magazines in the world. HERO was subscribed to by dozens of public libraries around the United States, and the world. SamFrancis 12:43, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The 'non-notable' acting in Blue Sky was notable enough to qualify me for SCREEN ACTOR'S GUILD eligibility, and give me a significant part (especially for a young actor) in a choreographed scene with JESSICA LANGE who won an OSCAR for the role. Are we to delete every actor's first films? IMDB certainly finds sufficient reason for inclusion. The suggestion that my entry is an invalid 'favor' because my domestic partner edited it is not only ludicrous, it's insulting. Are wives, husbands, friends not allowed to contribute? This edit seems unfairly, personally motivated. Who are you, editor? - Bronson Page</p>

If in future you continue to get acting work or your rock opera gets produced and there are multiple independent third-party sources to that effect, I will very much enjoy reading the resulting article.

The <a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_Actors_Guild_0d07.html" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> is an AFL-CIO affiliated Labor Union with over 120,000 members.

Please see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; the section about actors isn't very far down, and this entry clearly fails those criteria.

<p>I wouldn't have raised an objection, except for the fact that I've gone 'round with this user before. So before you dismiss this as 'rant', know that my argument, however passionate, has grounds. 'Notable' seems a subjective term here that needs clarification. Do you have clarification for 'notable' as it is used in Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Per your own description of notability which is helpful: "Other authors, scholars, and journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it." So IMDB's research and confirmation of my information isn't enough then? Please reply. Thanks.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Firstly, Notability is one of the cornerstones of Wikipedia. Not long ago, I also argued over the percieved objective nature of Notability here, but the more I poke around the numerous guidelines, and the more I experience the day-to-day operation of Wikipedia, the more I have come to respect those guidelines. For an overview of notability guidelines as it applies to people, please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. It includes very specific criteria for actors. Second: IMDB is a webpage, not an author, scholar, or journalist. To give you a personal example of why IMDB is never used as a test for notability: Friends of mine in college produced a no-budget film, based on a video game. This film can be found on IMDB<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0774116/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0774116/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a>; furthermore, as a result of this listing, every single person in that film also has a listing as well. Now, these are my friends, so believe me when I say: They are not actors. And their inclusion at IMDB does not signify anything beyond the fact that they managed to pull together a film that has sold a couple of hundred copies at various gaming conventions. I hope this has settled some of your concerns. If you would like to discuss this further, I would be happy to do so at my <a href="../../../a/n/t/User_talk%7EAntepenultimate_58e6.html" title="User talk:Antepenultimate">talk page</a>, so as to not further clutter this AfD debate. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 02:32, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Can't find how to talk to you. Fine. I'm resolved with deletion. I'd delete it myself if your bot didn't keep recovering it. However, nice casting of aspersions on OTTO4711's part, making basis for deletion that my DP and I were 'doing favors' for each other by contributing. No, that's not subjective at all.</p>
<dl>
<dd>The reason the article should be deleted is not that your DP wrote it. The reason the article should be deleted is that the subject of the article does not meet <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> guidelines. There are specific criteria for actors that establish notability, specifically: "Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers</li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following</li>
<li>An independent biography5</li>
<li>Name recognition</li>
<li>Commercial endorsements"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>You simply do not meet the criteria for notability for an actor. As a completely separate issue, your contributing to an article about yourself is a clear <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">conflict of interest</a> and a violation of the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">autobiography</a> guidleine. Your DP contributing to an article about himself is a clear conflict of interest and autobiography problem. Either of you writing about the other is also a conflict of interest. Neither WP:COI nor WP:AUTO is in and of itself grounds for deleting an article but it is a valid concern to raise about an article, and your and Sam's outbursts, ill-feeling and spurious attribution of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">bad faith</a> to me as a result of properly tagging your articles is a perfect illustration of why individuals should not be writing articles about themselves or their loved ones. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 05:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Clearly fails the notability guidelines and the above conversation also illustrates an obvious conflict of interest.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Lists are not superseded by categories, despite the efforts of some to claim that this is some sort of Wikipedia policy. The fact that an article is a troll magnet is irrelevant to whether it's kept or not (otherwise we'd be deleting <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, for example). However, it should be restricted to those who have been convicted of an offence (as the title states), not just those charged with one (as the intro says). There are no "legal ramifications" to listing those convicted of an offence under the law of any country.

<dd>Reply to above: Wrong. Many countries have legislation that deems a conviction 'spent' after a period with no other offending, i.e. it is as if the conviction never occured and the convict ceases to be a convict. It would then be a criminal offence to claim that the person was an offender. See, for example, Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in the UK (unfortunately not covered in Wikipedia). There are similar laws in other places. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 14:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What absolute twaddle. The fact of a person's conviction is in the written record. What are you suggesting? That all newspapers have to expunge the stories about a conviction from their archives on pain of criminal charges against the editors? That librarians have to go around with a black pen and cross out the records of the trials from the law reports? A spent conviction merely means you're not legally obliged to declare it (and even then, you would have to in some circumstances, such as applying for a job with children or as a police officer). It doesn't mean you haven't been convicted or you're not a previous offender. It certainly doesn't mean people can be prosecuted for saying you were convicted of such and such a crime if that statement is true. In any case, convictions for serious offences are never spent. A conviction can only become spent if the sentence was a maximum of 2½ years in prison. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 22:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>From <a href="http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/rehabact.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.lawontheweb.co.uk/rehabact.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> "The Act makes it an offence for anyone with access to criminal records to disclose spent convictions unless authorised to do so..... <i>It might be possible for a person with spent convictions to sue for libel anyone making allegations about spent convictions, if he or she can prove that the allegation was made with malice.</i>" <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:32, 10 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Oh come one, of course it's an offence for <i>anyone</i> with privileged access to sensitive information to make it public unless authorised to do so, and criminal records are privileged information. That doesn't mean that information that's already in the public domain doesn't stay there. Convictions are always in the public domain since trials are public and reported in the press. If someone has been convicted it therefore <i>is</i> in the public domain and remains so. It isn't removed from the public domain after their conviction becomes spent. Therefore it is not libellous for Wikipedia to report it. Neither does that webpage say it is, if you actually read it properly. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 13:25, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The 'anyone' means anyone, not people with privileged access. Of course newspaper archives etc aren't blanked out, I never suggested they were. The point is that a complainant who claims that <i>disclosure</i> of a spent conviction was malicious has a case and the only defence is 'in the public interest'. This exercised the minds of journalists when the Act was passed as you can imagine.

<li><b>Comment</b> The list itself is not libellous, but by having this easily editable list, it is as though Wikipedia is "inviting" vandals to add names of targetted individuals, such as disliked teachers, celebrities or public figures. On the contrary, if the only way a name is to appear on a list is to have a correctly categorised article for the person (if it can survive the new pages review which is far better patrolled than recent changes) then it is far less likely to contain libellous statements. <a href="../../../l/i/t/User%7ELittleOldMe_333b.html" title="User:LittleOldMe">LittleOldMe</a> 11:03, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Another good example of a worthless category but a potentially valuable list. What this needs is annotation to make it a useful resource for readers. Also, those users concerned with lawsuits and the like are way off base, since for the time being the identical category exists. What prevents someone from adding Mother Theresa or Walt Disney to the category? Nothing...or I should say the same thing that prevents names from getting added to this list: user oversight.

<li><b>Keep</b> n seems established per badlydrawn &amp; stammer. oh &amp; errors, i've reverted your blanking most of the article so the books published section can be kept. have a look around, you'll find this's pretty much standard. the possibly contentious nature of field he's working in &amp; your questionable justification for blanking (list of books published is definitely encylopedic, are u serious about an <i>unsubstantiated</i> copyvio claim on a <i>bibliography</i>?) could just be misinterpreted as indicating you have a very definite 'opinion' in the matter. <span style="background-color: #000000"> <font color="white"><b>⇒</b></font> <a href="../../../b/s/n/User%7EBsnowball_6f51.html" title="User:Bsnowball"><font color="white">bsnowball</font></a> </span> 09:44, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>He might be notable alright, even though the article doesn't really establish it. But fair use can only be invoked if a small fraction of a larger text is embedded in a larger educational or critical context. If you have 90% of the original text with only a smattering of context it is clearly outside of fair use. I have no qualms with the removed material being brought back, as long as it is being put in context.

<dd>except, <i>about copyright'</i> a list of someone's books is not subject to copyright in the US. It is a mere compilation, without any intellectual labor, and so would be a list of their articles.

<p>As I looked through other game show articles: I see NO other records pages. Deal or No Deal shouldn't be the first to start this trend. As I stated in the other Deal or No Deal AFDs a while ago: make a gameshow Wiki and put this information there. It certainly shouldn't be here.

<p>2.The page has been noticed by Podminions, and they have thanked me for the page.</p>
<p>There are a lot of pages that are a few sentences long. I think you should start with deleting them, instead of a decent page. Why choose this page to be delete. Do you just randomly chose a page and decide to delete it.</p>

<li>Ben Mitchell is a notable musician under the guidelines. In 2006 he toured Europe with performances in Amsterdam, Paris, Berlin (Popkomm music festival) and London. An independant musician his debut CD is released by MGM distribution and available internationally through digitial distribution.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ozmusicwriter (<a href="../../../o/z/m/User_talk%7EOzmusicwriter_bdcb.html" title="User talk:Ozmusicwriter">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ozmusicwriter_c262.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ozmusicwriter">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable musician. Releasing a cd isn't inherently notable, nor is playing some gigs. I checked the Australian Music Prize external link and it seems that musicians can enter that themselves. I've already removed the input of an external link from the Ben Mitchell disambig page and it was replaced by this article. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 00:35, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>. MGM is a notable independent record company in my book. However, except for the Americana UK, there seems to be few independent sources for this article and I haven't been able to find any. If more sources are located, I will change my mind. Sources for his European tour or an Australian tour, reviews of the album etc would help change my mind. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 02:40, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I know this is going to be a controversial deletion so I decided to take this to AfD directly instead of prodding it. Basically, before you do anything, I want you to discard all of your biases and prior knowledge of this topic and look at it completely objectively. If you can't do that, I don't think you should make any judgment on this AfD because you probably have some kind of vested interest in the topic or something which would interfere with your neutrality. Now, looking at this monster of an article, all I see is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. There are zero references in the entire article except when it quotes primary sources (being the Bible and Qur'an itself). That in itself is okay sometimes, but throughout the article, large sections of both works are quoted and it leaves the reader to draw conclusions, sort of like saying "Here's two passages. They have similarities." and just leaving it at that. Finally, the Bible and Qur'an are similar. So what? <i>The Lion King</i> and <i>Hamlet</i> are similar too but they don't have an article that just puts two sections of them side-by-side verbatim without even explaining why they're similar (a side note, is it <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECOPYVIO_ef21.html" title="WP:COPYVIO">copyvio</a> to have such large blocks of Biblical and Qur'anic text in an article?). That is something that should be discussed in their individual articles, if it's notable enough at all (and a side note, isn't it obvious enough that the Bible and Qur'an would have similarities even without an article on it?). <a href="../../../a/x/e/User%7EAxem_Titanium_88f9.html" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> 20:55, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>no vote yet</b> Good points. The question is: Is the article verifiaBLE. And another interesting question: Would it be ok with OR in SOME cases? Or in other words, is it OR if the facts are obviously self-evident and non-controversial? Im sure everybody agrees that this is a more ... uh.... "notable"? ... uh... topic than comparing <i>The Lion King</i> with <i>Hamlet</i>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:01, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete as OR unless article can be rewritten with proper sourcing, in which case, stubify and restart</b> This is a reasonable topic for an encyclopedia, but at the moment, the article appears to be pure original research.

<li><b>delete</b>- i agree there is no copyvio, but I do not agree that this is a viable topic for an article. The question posed by Striver is a telling one - "is OR ok in some cases?" I think the answer is no, even when its self-evident stuff. OR is OR, and the fact that something is true does not make it automatically valid as a WP article.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 04:52, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>well, to clarify my comment, I mean that this is a reasonable article if there is no original research (including "self-evident" stuff) i.e. rely on authoritative secondary sources only instead.

<li><b>very strong keep</b>. This is a compilation and not OR--but it is a very useful compilation. I can not understand why scholarly sources are wanted by The Way: the sources are the paraphrased texts. The reader is supposed to judge for himself. Do we need a scholarly work to tell us what part of the Bible discusses Moses?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>There are some things to be improved: the title is not a good choice--this is a comparison of some events and people in the Koran with the OT and NT. It -- fortunately -- is not about the similarities of their ethical or religious content, or their style, or their manner of composition, or their historical influence. It -- fortunately -- does not attempt to judge which story is more likely to be historical, or to cite sources who might give their opinions on that.</dd>
<dd>The paraphrases are too long, as are the sections done by quotation. It would be better to make compact accounts, with appropriate parts as quotations in each of the sections--and to make each parallel a main section. this would be much more readable. And perhaps it is not a good idea to include the entire Gospels as one paraphrase. I'd advise doing just the OT here, and do a separate article for the Gospels. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 05:29, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Scholarly context <i>is</i> needed. Obviously these texts were not originally written in modern English.

<li><b>some comments</b> This discussion is notable for the most drastic misunderstanding of copyright yet seen in WP. Neither the Bible nor the Koran are copyright. Specific translations may be, but most of this is paraphrase, and citing a few verses from even a recent translation is just about the clearest example of fair use I can imagine. (though if a particular translation is used, it should be identified)</li>

<dd>I do not see this as biased to an Islamic view. The only reason why someone would think so is the relative unfamiliarity of the Koran when read by someone who knows the Bible thoroughly. I hope it does not mean that the editor thinks that any mention of a non Judeochristian view is necessarily bias. Even if we for some reason judge by length, the Koranic passages are usually shorter. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 05:38, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> But without sourcing and context, this is not of much use to researchers. The article does not even indicate which versions of the Koran and the Bible are used. There are substantial differences and debates over interpretation and translation of these texts. As it is, the article seems to suggest with its quotations that the English language versions of the Koran and Bible are stable and uncontroversial. But the meaning of these texts is a matter of dispute even for those fluent in the relevant strains of Arabic and Hebrew/Greek. Proper referencing and scholarly context is needed. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think this article is a kind of spam. It was created in 5 or 6 wikipedias by 2 or 3 days ago. In the pt:wp (portuguese language, where I work) it was created by using automatic translation (and what a terrible translation) and now we are voting for deletion there also. Maybe we should be careful... many people think articles are ok because of the interwikis. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcelobbr_9de4.html" title="User:Marcelobbr">Marcelobbr</a> 10:22, 9 December 2006 (UTC).</dd>

<dd>I answered Marcelo at pt:wp and I have to answer here. Maybe my Portuguese is dramatic but I didn't use automatic translator - I hoped someone would improve it. Don't feel surprised that it's exactly the same at all wikipedias - I consider it absolutely normal. And... it has finally nothing in common with advertisements. We are a non-profit group so please don't make such allegations against us. <span style="color:#348853">Tom</span></dd>

<p>Hi, I know Bemowo Pictures and in my opinion this article is not an add at all.

<li>Very interesting - the initial article and every addition to it (except AfD tags and Categorizing) were written by someone with a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a>. The originator is User:Tomkowiak, who is apparently Rafal Tomkowiak, who made a "guest appearance" in the group's first production (thus has a serious <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> problem here).

<li>I was going to vote to keep the article, on the basis of the guy having a CD, until Kinu pointed out that, according to The Google Test the album seems to be self-released. That flies in the face of any type of notability guidelines that exist on wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalEnthusiast_4e7d.html" title="User:DigitalEnthusiast">DigitalEnthusiast</a> 22:42, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Although the album was independently released, it was carried by major retailers such as Best Buy and Tower Records. Both claims can be validated by searching their websites. It is also availble through online distributor CDbaby.com and through the artists website www.stressthalryricst.com. The article was created in an attempt to spread awareness of a lesser known indie artist, but I do apologize if it's creation validated any polices, and will understand completely if a deletion is neccessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Striggity (<a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriggity_d2b9.html" title="User talk:Striggity">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Striggity_e822.html" title="Special:Contributions/Striggity">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>If this is true, the article should be kept. There are a number of "indie" or "underground" artists in all genres and all art forms on wikipedia. It seems that notability is defined as whether other people seem to agree - so having a website doesn't make one notable, but having a CD published and sold through major nationwide chains does. Also, the claim that the artist has been played on XM radio, <i>if true</i>, would lend weight to the notability of this artist, but needs to be sourced. <a href="../../../d/i/g/User%7EDigitalEnthusiast_4e7d.html" title="User:DigitalEnthusiast">DigitalEnthusiast</a> 23:30, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>Yea, the CD was also available thru iTunes...if you do an artist search on the iTunes store, the CD comes right up. So even if it is on a significantly smaller scale than mainstream artists...the CD is commercially available to the public.
<ul>
<li>Per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, the relevant criterion is <i>[h]as released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</i> If (a) the importance of the label can be asserted and agreed upon, (b) there are indeed two albums on it, and (c) this information can be sourced, that should be considered in this discussion and increase the likelihood of survival. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 01:25, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Extreme brevity; only one page links to this one; nearly-if not actually-spam. I say that it would be better as three sentences of text <i>in</i> the <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virgin_Birth_e8f9.html" title="Virgin Birth">Virgin Birth</a> article. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScoutersig_0732.html" title="User:Scoutersig">Scoutersig</a> 22:46, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Brevity and few incoming links don't constitute criteria for deletion, speedy or otherwise, for something notable enough to be newsworthy by the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a>. Further, the nominator's spam sensors need tuning if the content of this article is "nearly" spam. A claim that an insurance company insured an <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immaculate_conception.html" title="Immaculate conception">immaculate conception</a> risk will offend far more people than it will ever bring in. That's hardly an ad. I thought it was funny.
