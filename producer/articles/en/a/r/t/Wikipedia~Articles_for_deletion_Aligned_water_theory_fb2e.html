<li><b>Redirect</b> Not a hoax but pseudo-science. This is the "theory" that water molecules can be aligned resulting in all sorts of magical things like homeopathy being possible. In this case, the article's author claims that <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28TCM%29_be1c.html" title="Meridian (TCM)">Meridian_(TCM)</a> are circuits of "Aligned water" that flow in the body. Redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a>. <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 07:52, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I was about to agree, but got stuck trying to decide if it should redirect to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeopathy.html" title="Homeopathy">Homeopathy</a> or <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28TCM%29_be1c.html" title="Meridian (TCM)">Meridian_(TCM)</a>. This article is more than a directionary definition, has a fair level of detail, and mentions a source but unfortunately does not cite it. On the whole I think it should be a redirect and merge with <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28TCM%29_be1c.html" title="Meridian (TCM)">Meridian_(TCM)</a>. Oddly, a search on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aligned+water%22+meridian&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aligned+water%22+meridian&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">"aligned water" meridian</a> yields only one hit and one on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aligned+water%22+homeopathy&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=%22aligned+water%22+homeopathy&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" rel="nofollow">"aligned water" homeopathy</a> yields none, making me wonder whether this theory has some other name. <b>If</b> it is invoked in contexts outside traditional Chinese medicine, I'd be incline to say keep, if the reference to Shui-Yin Lo is properly sourced. It needs some NPOV-tweaking. I think it's already fairly clear that the theory is not accepted by mainstream Western science or medicine, but this could be clearer. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:30, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sure that there is some other more "scientific" name for the thoery the underlies homeopathy. Perhaps a small article could be writen that explains the alleged theory that liquid water molecules can be aligned to form super structures, and that this theory undlies homeopathy, and is a proposed mechanism for the existance and actions of <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28TCM%29_be1c.html" title="Meridian (TCM)">Meridian_(TCM)</a>. "aligned water medicine" scores 0.95 megagoogles. With links to such gems as <a href="../../../k/l/o/User%7EKlonimus_90cc.html" title="User:Klonimus">Klonimus</a> 19:48, 13 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Uh, read the article. It's pseudoscience, but it does not say anything about primordial vibrations. That's Klonimus making a worthwhile effort to try to put it into pseudoscientific context.</dd>
<dd>The question to my mind is whether "aligned water theory" is a term in real use. I don't think it is and accordingly I'm voting for deletion. By the way, I don't think the concept is automatically utter bosh, as water molecules are very high polar and I'm sure I learned in chemistry class decades ago that they do cluster in some way, perhaps like "magnetic domains" in magnetic material. Water is not normally considered to be a "liquid crystal" but it may exhibit some kind of crystalline-like behavior. It's a looooooonnnnnng way from there to any explanation for acupuncture, but it's much more convincing pseudoscience than "primordial vibrations" are.</dd>
<dd>By the way... there's a 1950s story by Jack Finney, called, IIRC, "Such Interesting Neighbors." The narrator talks about his neighbors who the reader quickly recognizes as time-travellers from the future. He makes a living out of amazing "inventions." One that still sends a chill down my spine is one that he demonstrates to the narrator. It looks like a flashlight, but it measures distance. He pushes a button on it and a beam of light, in Finney's words "a special <i>kind</i> of light" comes out, and it reads off the distance in feet and inches. When asked how it works, the neighbor replies "On flashlight batteries." What gives me the creeps is that at the time I read it, I said to myself "A special <i>kind</i> of light? What nonsense!" I ask you, if someone had tried to describe lasers and coherent illumination light to you in the 1950s, wouldn't you have thought it was nonsense or pseudoscience? <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:42, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>*<b>Delete.</b> The question to my mind is whether the phrase "aligned water theory" is a recognized term in the acupuncture and/or homeopathy community, and I don't think it is. I have merged the relevant material into <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_%28TCM%29_be1c.html" title="Meridian (TCM)">Meridian_(TCM)</a> and added a comment on the Talk page that preserves history for GFDL purposes, allowing this article to be deleted without violating GFDL. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:41, 14 Apr 2005 (UTC)</s> Changed vote, see below</p>
