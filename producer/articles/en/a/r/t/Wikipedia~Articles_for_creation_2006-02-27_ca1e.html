<p>The Pufferfish Gang originates in the town of Lowell, Michigan. The Gang is a notorious for their famous pyromaniacal, world-domination-wanting, sasquatch-ish, leader who goes by 'Lorenzo'. The other members, his bitches and hos, are: Andrea, Bobbi, Kate, Mary, and Meghan. Lorenzo is also famous for his 'sasquatch run' 'monkey walk' and 'gangsta walk'. He uses all of these stupendous skills to light his victims on fire whilst the rest of the gang sings the special Pufferfish chant 'I AM A PUFFERFISH, IM GOING TO PUFF ON YOU". The last person who challenged the Pufferfish Gang, the fatefull Carlito 'Indiana' Jones Jackson and his life-partner Cory 'The Monkey' Grizbee, were foudn brutally stabbed to death and then burned at the stake on the deck of the Robert E. Lee Showboat. No evidence was found but the cryptic writing "OMFG PUFFA" was carved into Carlito's chest.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Gang Members:</p>
<p>Lorenzo 'Sasquatch': Sick bastard. Tall. Blonde. Blue eyes. Wears a hideous orange shirt that makes him much resemble a creamsicle. Nail marks cover his arms and hand from when the other members were insolent. Pyromaniacal.</p>
<p>Andrea: Pretty much retarded.</p>
<p>Bobbi: 'A very intellegent person...PLEASE GET YOUR NAILS OUT OF MY ARM" -Lorenzo. "Oh look at the two kitties licking the fan...how gross." -Bobbi. <strike>I'm</strike> She's just awesome.</p>
<p>Kate: Radioactive hair that changes color about every other week. Likes vodka and long walks on the beach. Dislikes sexist pigs and most people.</p>
<p>Mary: Tall, skinny, spazzoid. Shiiiiiiiny. Andrea's best friend and partner in crime. A GIGGITY.</p>
<p>Megsy: Skinny and can really shake her groove thang. Likes yaoi, anime, Tyler, and j-rock. Pretty much loves Kate. Tyler doesnt know that. Tyler is mean. Kate is supa cool.</p>

<p>The UBM was first created on February 23, 2006, by a student from Benet Academy, Lisle Illinois. This sandwich was created for only the extremely hungry.</p>
<p>The UBM is a rather large burger, approximately 3 ft x 3 ft. Estimated production costs are $34 per sandwich. It is estimated that these delicacies will be sold for $40 - $45. The sandwich is enclosed, of course, in a sesame seed bun. The inner layers are as follows: lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, cheese, french fries, ketchup, more cheese, onions, chicken nuggets, more lettuce, slabs of ribs, a flattened dwarf cow, and a 3rd layer of cheese. A cylindrical hole will be placed in the center of the burger to hold a mint shake. It is believed that this shake will be kept from spreading throughout the sandwich by either a layer of tightly packed lard or a layer of lettuce; however, this aspect is still being debated.</p>
<p>It is estimated that mass produciton of this sandwich will begin in the summer of 2006.</p>

<hr />
<p>If you already play RuneScape, you'll have a good enough feel to understand this article. On special days, players can recieve certain items - many of which have no purpose except to look good or be "fun" - and these items cannot be obtained any other way, ever again, making them the rarest and most expensive items in the game. The most coveted item is the legendary Party Hat. These have no purpose - except that they do look good on your head - but are more like trophies for players who want to demonstrate they are masters of the game: enormously wealthy, powerful, experienced, and knowledgeable. The reason anyone wearing a Party Hat is all of these things is: the Party Hats are absurdly expensive at tens or hundreds of millions in gold coins! For most players, 50 or 100 million gold pieces is a ludicrous amount. In Draynor Village, there is an <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-player_character.html" title="Non-player character">NPC</a> - and old man who is retired from adverturing - in the house across the street from the bank. Approach him, and you will notice he wears a Blue Party Hat on his head! If you ask to buy it from him, he denies, saying he is too proud of it and worked too hard for it to sell or trade it. To obtain a Party Hat, you need to trade with a player in the game.</p>

<p><br />
The dropping of rare items on holidays such as Halloween or Christmas is a well-known tradition throughout the RuneScape land. These items would be found in random places at certain times during the special day, and anyone who found one would have a great surprise! Since these items were only dropped on that day, they are considered rare and have become quite valuable (expensive too!).</p>
<p><b>Q&amp;A</b></p>
<p>Here are some common questions about Holiday Items, along with their answers.</p>
<p><i>Q: Will there still be holiday item drops?</i> A: There aren't item 'drops' exactly. Instead, <a href="../../../n/o/n/Non-player_character.html" title="Non-player character">NPCs</a> are apparently going to visit RuneScape during the holidays and hand out a special item. These characters stay in RuneScape for a week or 2 and will freely hand out holiday items to any player that wants one.</p>
<p><i>Q: Why did Jagex stop doing those <b>original</b> drops on holidays</i>? A: Holiday drops were stopped after the "Halloween 2003 Debacle." A great deal of people complained about not getting a Halloween Scythe, and Jagex decided not to have another item drop after that. Q: How do I get a Holiday Item? A: In order to get a Holiday item, you need to trade from another player. All tradeable holiday items are quite expensive. Scythes and Bunny Ears are not tradeable, and only people who managed to find one on that specific Holiday have one.</p>
<p><i>Q: What were holiday drops like?</i> A: In past holidays, special holiday items would be dropped all over RuneScape in random places and different times during the day. Usually there would be several drops, and people would be running around trying to pick one up.</p>

<b>RuneScape Holiday Items</b></p>
<p>On Easter, Haloween and Christmas Jagex creates and distributes special items within RuneScape in celebration of the holiday. These items are availible to all players, free and members. This page documents the numerous items that have been released over the years. All of these items will never be dropped/distributed again. RuneScape Classic drops</p>
<p>These items were dropped on to the ground all over RuneScape classic in random paterns. Players then picked them up. There were no trade limitations on them. There is no limitation on the number one player can own. They are unreplaceable- if a player loses these, they are gone forever.</p>
<p><b>Pumpkin-October 31st, 2001</b></p>
<p>Pumpkins apear as large orange vegtables. They heal 14hp when eaten, although this is not advised as they are now extremly rare for this reason. They read "Happy Halloween" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Christmas Crackers-December 25th, 2001</b></p>
<p>Christmas Crackers appear as a small red and green cracker. They had to be used with another player. If you did this, the cracker disappeared. One player recived a low-level item, the other a party hat. These are now extremly rare as many have been destroyed to gain the party hats inside. They read "Use on another player to pull it" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Party hats-December 25th, 2001</b></p>
<p>Party hats came out of crackers. They resemble the paper hats commonly found in crackers. They are each a randomly generated colour. Blue, green, pink, red, white and yellow are availible. They can be worn on the head and alter player stats in no way at all. They were originaly common untill hording occured, driving up prices. They are rare today, all though still availible to those with a large amount of GP. They read "It's a party hat" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Easter Eggs-March 30th, 2002</b></p>
<p>Easter eggs resemble multi-coloured chocolate eggs. They heal 14hp when eaten. They are also extremly rare because many players ate them. They read "Happy easter" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Halloween masks-October 31st, 2002</b></p>
<p>Halloween masks look roughly like a monster with large fangs. They come in red, green and blue varities. They alter player stats in no way. They are fairly rare, but still widley availible. They read "Arggggghhh I'm a monster" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Santa hats-December 25th, 2002</b></p>
<p>Santa hats look like red hats with a fur trim, as worn by father christmas. They add 3+ magic when equiped. They are fairly rare today. They read "It's a santa hat" when examined.</p>
<p><b>RuneScape Classic-untradables</b></p>
<p>The following items were dropped in the same way, but you could only pick one up. They are untradable. They are replaceable-players must ask at varrock clothes shop to replace them.</p>
<p><b>Bunny ears-April 20th, 2003</b></p>
<p>Bunny ears resember pink rabbit ears. They can be worn on your head and affect your stats in no way at all. They read "A rabbit like adornment" when examined.</p>
<p><b>Sythes-31st October and 2nd November, 2003</b></p>
<p>Sythes resemble long, black tools tradiontianly used in agriculture and wielded by the Grim Reaper in european mythology. They add 10 weapon power and 10 aim when wielded. They were dropped twice because many players complained about missing the haloween drop. They read "It's a sythe" when examined. RuneScape 2 items</p>
<p>After a break of about a year, Jagex reintroduced holiday drops into RuneScape. However, they were now distributed via a Non-Player Character, often in exchange for a special task to complete. All of these items are untradable and only one is allowed per player.</p>
<p>This list is incomplete!</p>

<p>The Professional Superheroes are four ridiculous looking guys in superhero garb playing incredible indie cover songs. Their hometown is Eureka, CA.</p>
<p><b>A pretend interview:</b></p>
<p>Pretend Interviewer Man: What the hell is going on? Why am I taped to this chair? Professional Superheroes: Just do the damn interview or we'll make you eat chalk candy.</p>
<p>PIM: Oh no, okay, I'll do anything you want! How can you become a member of the Pro Superheroes Club? PS: It's really freakin' easy. Just add us as your friend, and unless you're evil or a fool, you're in. At that point it would be appropriate to spread the message of Professional Superheroes to all you meet. Some members do this by wearing snazzy ProHeroes Gear.</p>
<p>PIM: Where did you come from? PS: Well, the Admiral is the love child of a pirate and a "private dick who's a sex machine to all the chicks." His elementary school was built on a toxic waste dump. Most of his classmates got lukemia and died. He got x-ray vision and sick tennis skills...go figure.</p>
<p>Superfly grew up hustling on the mean streets of Eureka selling baseball cards and waterballoons on the black market. Then one day he found a pair of magic glasses that supplied him with super-strength and the ablility to correctly guess a person's shoesize within 10 guesses.</p>
<p>The Triumphant Tandum met on the Plaza when they were battling revenging mutants from outerspace and have been fighting for justice together ever since. That was 35 years ago.</p>
<p>PIM: How much wood would a wood-chuck chuck if a wood-chuck could chuck wood? PS: 87. But of course, that's absurd question because everyone knows ducks can't talk...I mean wood-chucks cannot chuck.</p>

<p>Although the band are all the wrong side of forty, they still gave a kick-ass show. To see the original line-up after many a "decade of decadence", brought a tear to my eye. For today's generation, the drummer, Tommy Lee, is instantly recognisable from the "MAYHEM" tatto across his belly - the very same tattoo which gained fame in his infamous home video made with ex-wife, and ex-baywatch star, Pamela Anderson. The crowd footage included reserved older rockers - maybe the crue's original fan base, and people not old enough to be served alcohol in the U S of A where the concert was filmed. Despite the lack of alcohol for their newer fans, the entire audience appeared to be enjoying an electric atmosphere. I am a UK resident, the show was in Michigan - I only wish I could have been there!</p>

<p>His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada appeared in this world in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922. Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent religious scholar and the founder of sixty-four Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes) in India, liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge. Srila Prabhupada became his student and, in 1933, his formally initiated disciple.</p>
<p>At their first meeting Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati requested Srila Prabhupada to broadcast Vedic knowledge in English. In the years that followed, Srila Prabhupada wrote a commentary on the Bhagavad-gita, assisted the Gaudiya Matha in its work, and, in 1944, started Back to Godhead, an English fortnightly magazine. Single-handedly, Srila Prabhupada edited it, typed the manuscripts, checked the galley proofs, and even distributed the individual copies. The magazine is now being continued by his disciples in the West.</p>
<p>In 1950 Srila Prabhupada retired from married life, adopting the vanaprasta (retired) order to devote more time to his studies and writing. He traveled to the holy city of Vrndavana, where he lived in humble circumstances in the historic temple of Radha-Damodara. There he engaged for several years in deep study and writing. He accepted the renounced order of life (sannyasa) in 1959. At Radha-Damodara, Srila Prabhupada began work on his life's masterpiece: a multivolume commentated translation of the eighteen thousand verse Srimad-Bhagavatam (Bhagavata Purana). He also wrote Easy Journey to Other Planets.</p>
<p>After publishing three volumes of the Bhagavatam, Srila Prabhupada came to the United States, in September 1965, to fulfill the mission of his spiritual master. Subsequently, His Divine Grace wrote more than fifty volumes of authoritative commentated translations and summary studies of the philosophical and religious classics of India.</p>
<p>When he first arrived by freighter in New York City, Srila Prabhupada was practically penniless. Only after almost a year of great difficulty did he establish the International Society for Krsna Consciousness, in July of 1966. Before he passed away on November 14, 1977, he had guided the Society and seen it grow to a worldwide confederation of more than one hundred asramas, schools, temples, institutes, and farm communities.</p>

<p>Website name of author and columnist Mark Driver.</p>
<p>Frequently obscene and often extremely funny, Driver's prose tends toward confrontation whenever possible. Despite the protagonist of his novel "Just another empire" being a 17th century French nobleman, he speaks in the same late 20th century male American voice as Driver uses in his columns.</p>
<p>Politics has very much come to the fore of late, as his updates become more and more infrequent. As a sporadically-employed jack of all trades, Driver would frequently update his site (<a href="http://www.blindwino.com" class="external free" title="http://www.blindwino.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.blindwino.com</a>) with another long, unusually coherent piece of aggreesive, compassionate, thought-out opinion.</p>
<p>Driver claims on his site to have joined the wage-slave majority, , and his fans are getting used to the idea of yet another counterculture hero treading the well-worn path to silent conformity.</p>

<p>Tommy Hyland is a household name in the shady world of professional blackjack players. His blackjack team has won more money than any other team in existence. The words ‘The Tommy Hyland Team’ are spoken with reverence by players and with disgust by casino executives. This episode recounts the rise of the Tommy Hyland Team, beginning with Hyland’s bold decision to turn blackjack card-counting into a business venture, and the team's first attempt at employing a multi-person card-counting system in a casino. The well-oiled plans work without a flaw, and the team begins collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars from blackjack tables around the world. However, the casinos begin to fight back.</p>

<p>Since the encumbent Prime Minister of Jamaica, P.J. Patterson announced plans to step down from the leadership of his People's National Party and Prime Minister of Jamaica, four contenders from his party threw their hats into the ring as contestants to replace him as party president and Prime Minister. The contestants were Dr. Peter Phillips - Minister of National Security; Dr. Carl Blyth former government Ministe; Dr. Omar Davies - Minister of Finance and Portia Simpson-Miller, Minister of Local Government, Community Youth and Sports.</p>
<p>It was a bitterly fought contest between the two leading contenders Simpson-Miller and Phillips, where the handlers of the latter continually disparaged the former throughout the leadership campaigne mainly along class and educational lines.</p>
<p>In the end the party Delegates returned vote counts as follows; Dr. Blyth - 204 Dr. Davies - 283 Dr. Phillips - 1538 Mrs. Portia Simpson-Miller - 1775</p>
<p>Mrs. Simpson-Miller has made history as being the first female President of the Peoples National Party or any party in Jamaica; She will be the first female Prime Minister and seventh Prime Minister of Jamaica; and second female Prime Minister in the Caribbean, the first being the late Eugenia Charles of Dominica.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-02-27_ca1e.html" title="Edit section: Giorje Kaniouras">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Giorje Kaniouras</span></h2>
<p>Mr. Giorje Kaniouras (born August 8, 1974) is a Canadian citizen and prominent Torontonian. He is a banker and a noted public speaker who has worked tirelessly to enhance the image of Toronto, Ontario, Canada on the global scene. Giorje has written on what it means to be a Canadian as a child of immigrants, how Toronto is well positioned to benefit from increased globalization, and given many speeches on the Canadian economy and the effects of the ever changing social milieu on Toronto.</p>
<p>Giorje was born in East York Hospital the evening of August 8th, 1974 at 8PM to Evangelos and Sophia (nee Eliopoulos) Kaniouras. Giorje's parents arrived independently on Canadian shores as part of the wave of mass Southern European immigration that enhanced and changed the dynamics of many Canadian urban centers from the 1960's onward. Sophia immigrated to Toronto from Kalamata, Hellas in 1968 and Evangelos immigrated to Montreal from Trikala, Hellas in 1966.</p>
<p>Giorje's early years were spent in the Annex, an ethnically diverse, central Toronto neighbourhood that shaped Giorje's outlook on multiculturalism and globalization. The family moved to Vancouver, BC when Giorje was in his early teens as his father started a large scale food services company. This move allowed Giorje to appreciate the rising political power of Western Canada that was to come decades later. Upon the family's return to Ontario they relocated to Scarborough, Ontario a blue collar borough of Toronto. This was a pivotal time in Toronto's history as the city was undergoing radical changes ethnically (new areas of immigration), economically (manufacturing vs. service economy) and politically (conservative vs. liberalism). Giorje has wrote that this was the most important time in recent Toronto history as it created new power groups and entrenched Toronto as the centre of Canada's social and economic life.</p>
<p>Giorje attended Western Ontario Universe and York University before embarking in banking career with the Royal Trust of Canada. This experience exposed Giorje to more traditional Toronto power cent res and allowed him to focus on bringing together these traditional groups with emerging ethnic power cent res. Giorje is currently employed as a Director with the National Bank Canada and focuses much of his energy on speaking to the public on foreseeable economic and social trends, which he believes Toronto should benefit from. He has sat on many Toronto committees and lobby groups and recently been approached on numerous occasions to run for a seat in local politics.</p>

<p>Kevin Ford is a musician based in Swindon, England, who produces work similar to Aphex Twin, although sometimes diversifies into more sampled-based production like Amon Tobin. He is a secretive artist, who only works under pseudonyms, and is widely heralded by the inner-sanctum of labels such as Warp as a pioneer in the IDM and Glitch fields.</p>
<p>Kevin Ford began developing his unique sound during the 1970s using analog synthesizers, under the name Legion of Aquarius. In the 1980s, he is credited with loaning Aphex Twin classic Roland drum machines and a TB303, which he taught Aphex Twin to use. This is where reality breaks down into legend, although fans of Warp Records have long sought C90 cassettes produced during the time, which Ford handed out to friends at raves and acid house parties in London.</p>
