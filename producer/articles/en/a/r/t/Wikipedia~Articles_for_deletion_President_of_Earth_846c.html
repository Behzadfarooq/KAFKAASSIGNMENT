<li><b>Keep</b> -- Stancel, if you can't be bothered to justify your nomination for deletion, you can't really expect to generate a consensus to remove the article. I'm not a big fan of this article (another useless collection of SF trivia), but it's the sort of stuff SF fans love, and you're going to need some solid arguments to get rid of it. "I think it's dumb" is not enough. If nobody has more than that, let's not bother arguing about it. ---<a href="../../../i/s/a/User%7EIsaac_Rabinovitch_f1f1.html" title="User:Isaac Rabinovitch">Isaac R</a> 18:36, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Is it almost universal? There's no president of the earth in <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>Dune</i>, <i>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i>, <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>, <i>The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>, <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> or many other SF stories. Did Star Trek even have a President of Earth? I only remember of President of the Federation. There are probably more SF stories without a President of Earth than with one. Perhaps it's prominant. But is it any more prominant than <i>starship captain</i>, <i>robot servant</i>, or <i>evil overlord</i>?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 04:56, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this is a great idea for an article. We should have article on trends as well as things. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:10, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep and rename</b> to President of Earth (fiction). I know I am in the minority here, but I am still bothered by the fact that Wikipedia makes no quick and easy way to distiguish actual persons, groups, and events from invented ones. Typically, the fictional or invented nature of the subject is noted somewhere in the body of the article in no standard way. (If it were up to me, I would give all invented subjects a separate namespace.) As far as statements like "The President of Earth is a theoretical future political office", that appears to me to fall squarely under <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a> --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 21:15, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a>, I believe that under the rules of <a href="../../../d/a/b/WP%7EDAB_f303.html" title="WP:DAB">WP:DAB</a>, an article named President of Earth (fiction) is not allowed if an article named <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a> either does not exist, or the latter just redirects to the former. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> <a href="../../../z/z/y/User_talk%7EZzyzx11_0d23.html" title="User talk:Zzyzx11">(Talk)</a> 21:39, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Anyone seeing an article titled <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a> isn't going to assume that there really is a President of the whole Earth, because every single person reading the encyclopedia will know otherwise. Besides, it's noted in the very first sentence that it's not real and is common in science fiction works. Most people do not learn about things by only reading the article titles. I do agree that the first sentence should probably be reworded in accordance with the crystal ball policy. -<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoozer_0a6f.html" title="User:Doozer">Doozer</a> (<a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoozer_95ba.html" title="User talk:Doozer">Talk</a>) 21:45, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I wasn't really expecting support; just wistfully wishing there were a way to clearly, unambiguously mark articles that are on subjects that are invented or fictional. The current <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">everything2</a>-style free-for-all mélange doesn't really work for me--but I'm just one person. Not every title will be as blatantly obvious as <a href="../../../p/r/e/President_of_Earth_3c32.html" title="President of Earth">President of Earth</a>, so when (for example) going through search results it would be nice not to have to load each article and scan it for whatever non-standard way its fictional nature is indicated in order to find out if it has something to do with the real world, or is just part of the increasing body of articles about something someone imagined one day. Also, I generally find it is risky to make too many assumptions about what "every single person" knows. People constantly surprise me. --<a href="../../../t/a/b/User%7ETabor_fe0d.html" title="User:Tabor">Tabor</a> 22:08, 19 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well we could try to come up with a {{fictional}} tag or category or something, and have that filtered out from the search. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:29, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I resemble that remark (about everything2). This seems to be a reasonable, unremarkable article, so <b>keep</b> it. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexTiefling_59d5.html" title="User:AlexTiefling">AlexTiefling</a> 15:28, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Instead of yet another tag, simply identifying it as fictional in the intro, as this article does, should be sufficient. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:15, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Hmm we'd better delete every article in <a href="../../../s/c/i/Category%7EScience_fiction_0efa.html" title="Category:Science fiction">Category:Science fiction</a> by that logic. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:49, 19 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>How so?--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 03:56, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For instance, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> is set in the future, so it would seem to be future history by your thinking. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 04:01, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On the other hand <i>Star Trek</i> is a TV series from the 1960s so it is something from the past. The article in question begins, "The President of Earth is a theoretical future political office," that's theorizing what <b>might</b> happen in the <b>future</b>, that is what I am talking about when I say <i>future history</i> and that is not something that belongs on Wikipedia (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>). We could of course delete the future history parts of the article, and we'd still have the list of science fiction stories which have a character in them whom is the president of earth. That is not future history, but it isn't really encyclopedic either in my opinion. If the president or earth was an archtype like the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Mad_scientist.html" title="Mad scientist">mad scientist</a> or the <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil_genius.html" title="Evil genius">evil genius</a> I might disagree, but I don't feel that it is so I voted to delete.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 04:37, 20 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree w/ Heathcliff .President Earth does not deserve a seperate article in a encyclopedia - 2 basic reasons&#160;: 1 ) President Earth is not a popular fictious character 2 ) Its a imaginative future-history character . It can be <i>mentioned</i> in some list of <i>sci-fi personalities</i> though .--<a href="../../../g/u/p/User%7EGuptadeepak_d73c.html" title="User:Guptadeepak">IncMan</a> 10:27, May 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
