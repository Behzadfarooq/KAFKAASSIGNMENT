<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although no such event has been confirmed, this article is well referenced and is a good indicator, sourced from various places, of potential candidates, etc. Today's news shows that although no date is confirmed for a contest - one <b>will</b> happen, and this article can be updated as such as and when. 15:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This contest was always going to take place at some point in the future. That was never an issue. The problem is, this article assumes the leadership contest will take place in 2007. Tony Blair has said the he will step down in the next 12 months. Now, he could either a) Step down tomorrow. This would mean that the leadership election would take place in 2006, or b) decide to continue on as PM. He has said he will only resign if the timing is right for the country. Therefore, he still could remain Labour party leader after 2007. And that is the problem with looking into the crystal ball. If the page could be moved to a name like, Upcoming Labour Party (UK) leadership election, a lot of problems with crystal balling would be solved. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Th</a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_Esperanza_d8f6.html" title="User:The Halo/Esperanza"><font color="green">ε</font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Halo_3472.html" title="User:The Halo">Halo</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Halo_8994.html" title="User talk:The Halo"><b>Θ</b></a></sup> 17:01, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>As <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHera1187_7eed.html" title="User:Hera1187">Hera1187</a> pointed out, there must be a contest, and if the problem is with the name of the article speculating on dates, (which is likely to be accurate speculation anyway) that doesn't constitute a case for deletion.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_Stevens_51c4.html" title="User:Greg Stevens">Greg Stevens</a> 17:21, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't think there's anything gained by moving it to another name. If the date changes, then the article can change to reflect that. The alternative is, what, a growing section within the already-long <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tony_Blair_f43c.html" title="Tony Blair">Tony Blair</a>? Also, I assume that the nomination was for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">crystall ball</a> violations rather than "complete bollocks". Crystall ball says "If preparation for the event isn't already in progress, speculation about it must be well documented", and that's certainly easily met. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 18:26, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Here we go "question" "whether" "if".... this is speculation. It is only "well documented" because it is currently a media led story - the actual contest has not been called. The actual event has not been started.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a crystal ball, and the article will contain too much crystal-ballism until we have a set date and more than one announced candidate. I also point to the entry for 26 July 2007 under 'future milestones as to why. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Labour_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_2007&amp;oldid=74377967" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Labour_Party_%28UK%29_leadership_election%2C_2007&amp;oldid=74377967" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) - "The last day of Tony Blair as Prime Minister". Currently, the article is only feasible for such displays of crystal-ballism. Delete and restart closer to the time, when we, at the very minimum, have a set date. <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERailwayman_cc4b.html" title="User:Railwayman">Railwayman</a> 19:38, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Indeed. In particular, it states "Individual scheduled or expected future events should only be included if the event is notable and almost certain to take place", and both of these criteria are clearly met. It also says "Individual items from a predetermined list or a systematic pattern of names, preassigned to future events or discoveries, are not suitable article topics", and it is not such a thing. Finally it states "Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and...inappropriate", but it does not present those things: it merely states the dates which have either been put forward or been speculated about by politicians or the media; there is no original research. OK, saying "The last day of Tony Blair as Prime Minister" doesn't conform to the conditions, but that's just an anomolous statement which needs rewording, and is unrepresentative of the rest of the artcle, so certainly isn't cause for its deletion.<a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreg_Stevens_51c4.html" title="User:Greg Stevens">Greg Stevens</a> 20:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sure, individual sentences can be excised, but that's not really an issue for AfD. Otherwise, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> goes out of it's way to say <i>Events widely anticipated and at least somewhat planned for are not violations of Crystal Ball</i>. Significant press coverage of upcoming leadership convention means a Wiki article is appropriate. We even have a <i>template</i> for this kind of article, for instance at the top of <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_Party_of_Canada_leadership_convention%2C_2006_10a1.html" title="Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006">Liberal Party of Canada leadership convention, 2006</a>, another planned leadership convention. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 21:04, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per Greg Stevens 20:58, 7 September 2006 (UTC).
