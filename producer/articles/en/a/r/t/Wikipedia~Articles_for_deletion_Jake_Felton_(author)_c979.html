<p>It's an email based service. Here is an example of one of his releases Press Release</p>
<p>First, concerning the temperatures: The frigid Arctic air that has gripped our region over the past few days is, whether you like it or not, on its way out, and replacing it will be more seasonable temperatures--highs in the mid 30s and lows near the 20-degree mark.</p>
<p>In terms of precipitation--well, there's little reason to celebrate. The jet stream trough remains positioned just a bit too far east to permit any significant winter storms; instead, all we'll get is the occasional Alberta clipper that delivers a dusting of the white stuff.</p>
<p>This weather pattern, however, may change in the not-too-distant future . . .</p>
<p>As of now, we're tracking two potential winter storms, one on the 13th and one on the 16th. Now these systems are still forming over the Pacific ocean, so whether or not they'll even impact our area is exceptionally questionable, thus any attempts to estimate their exact paths or calibers would be hugely inappropriate, to say the least.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, more details will emerge over the remainder of the week. We'll keep you updated . . .</p>
<p>Next press release on Sunday; please stay tuned.</p>
<p>skibumj12 Weather Service</p>
<p>As you can see from the above reference, the <i>Service</i> does indeed exist. Since it is not acclaimed much by those not subscribed to it, one should not expect Google results.</p>

The fact remains, you have no viable support to disprove Jake Felton and his legacy's existence. Because of this lack of evidence, deleting this article would only result in the deprivation of many Wiki readers to learn about a great, young thinker. It only seems just to allow the article to remain so the knowledge of his excellency can spread, and once such excellency does spread, concrete sources can be provided for you naysayers. magicdan25 04:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Irrelevent. The burden of proof is on the editor, not the reader. Unless you can prove Jake Feldon's legacy, the article fails Wikipedia's polices. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 05:07, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> Magicdan, this is the wrong way around. Wikipedia does not exist to advance people's careers or bring "dark horses" to the public's attention, but rather to document the already known. We can't have articles created about every up-and-coming young thinker/writer/entrepreneur, for at least a couple of reasons:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>For most of them, not enough <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information is available, so the article may fall into a state of inaccuracy. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and should not be allowed to lapse into an inaccurate state.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball.</a> That is, a person is included, or not, based on what that person has done <i>so far</i>, not on what they are poised to do in the future. For example, I may be planning to swim the English channel in record time, but until I actually get around to making the attempt (and succeeding), I am not eligible for inclusion.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How did you determine that the biographical info was not a hoax? If you are going to remove most of the article, during a deletion debate, why not blank all of it? I suggest that it be left as submitted during the deletion debate, as a gesture of good faith. Otherwise it looks like gaming the system by blanking most of it so people see only a fraction of what was created. No reason the article creator could not revert to his version. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 18:04, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Just a judgement call. I deleted stuff that was <i>obviously</i> a hoax. Bare biographical detail is not, and there has already been an assertion that the skibum thing exists. Furthermore, there is plenty of precedent for taking out the egregiously problematic parts of an article during AfDs; in many cases, that is what gets them saved. And if the creator reverts, I will revert back as vandalism.-<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 03:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It was an impolitic comment by JuJube, but I doubt that accusing anyone of trolling is really valid here. There have been any number of attempts to assume good faith on what is an increasingly obvious hoax, and as a general rule experienced contributors take a very dim view of attempted hoaxes. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:09, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There's always that, yes.

<li><i>no substantial proof that this is a hoax</i>? Really? So a 15-year-old founding a weather forecast system with "a near 99% accuracy" (a statistic which would be unlikely even if he were a professional weather forecaster) doesn't seem a little bit odd to you? Not the fact that his mentor is one Hildegard von Bingen, who died in 1179 and very probably never met a golf course architect of either gender in her life? Not the fact that he's editing an essay by an author who (according to another contributor to this discussion) doesn't seem to exist? Not the fact that his novel bears an uncanny similarity in title to a very well-known book which already exists? Not the fact that his forthcoming dissertation is on a topic which comes very close to being nonsensical? Not the fact that his "grammar" is praised to the highest heavens and nothing else? Simply put, there's no substantial (or insubstantial) proof that this is anything but an increasingly obvious and increasingly tiresome hoax. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:14, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
