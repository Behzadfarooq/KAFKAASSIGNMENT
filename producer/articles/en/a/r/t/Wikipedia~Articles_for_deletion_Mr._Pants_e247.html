<li><b>Keep</b> The character exists and stars in a recent video game. I've removed some of the more flowery language and gotten it down to a more straight-forward article, but it's just as justified as several other pages out there. Sir_Slush 20:35, Jan 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: He is a now established video game character featured in a game with its own page on this site, which might I add is not up for deletion. Also, there are many, many video game characters with pages on this site that do not have even half of the amount of writing this article currently possesses, and have made just as "trivial" appearances, and they are not being targeted for deletion.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESeanKing64_8954.html" title="User:SeanKing64">SeanKing64</a> 20:06, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There's really no reason to delete the page. He's just as much a video game character as Wart, perhaps even moreso. The page in question is well written too, so I don't know what the problem is. --Glancy 00:21, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Mr. Pants is a character of extreme character. He deserves his own page just as much as anyone else does.--Fleur64

<li>Comment: New users should be aware that votes by anonymous and very new accounts are generally very steeply discounted during these discussions. We have had significant problems in the past with abuse of the voting process and attempts to bias the outcome by users creating <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESockpuppet_c4eb.html" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet">sockpuppets</a>. Hard facts which add to the discussion are appreciated. Opinions and qualitative judgments are likely to be ignored. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 02:17, 5 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Non-notable, re-creation an abuse of process, as are the many sockpuppets voting to keep it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 18:23, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>How is it non-notable? He has <a href="../../../i/t/27/It%27s_Mr._Pants%21_3de2.html" title="It's Mr. Pants!">his own game</a>, and he's a part of <a href="../../../r/a/r/Rare_%28video_game_company%29.html" title="Rare (video game company)">Rareware</a>'s history. If <a href="../../../g/o/o/Goombario.html" title="Goombario">Goombario</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/w/Mewtwo.html" title="Mewtwo">Mewtwo</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/x/Joxer.html" title="Joxer">Joxer</a> can all have articles, I don't see why Mr. Pants shouldn't. I can also imagine that if you found the game without knowing how Mr. Pants came into existence, this would be a good way to find out. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheCube_eaff.html" title="User:TheCube">The Cube</a> 20:05, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: If obscure Pokémon can get their own pages, why can't a video game character with an international cult following?--<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiphead_8912.html" title="User:Chiphead">Chiphead</a> 20:59, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I believe that we are being unfairly targeted for no real reason. This page gives out information and he is a large, well known mascot in videogaming today, yet you guys seem to think that he doesn't deserve his own page, yet characters like Toadette who nobody cares about aren't being targetted at all. And with how many edits, who cares? That's like saying JK Rowling isn't a good author seeing she's only written 6 HP Books and RL Stien is because he's written hundreds. And you instantly claim that every person voting keep is a sock puppet as to make sure this page gets deleted, which is unfair and is abusing the voting system. If you so badly want him out, why not go ahead and delete the page than then go through a voting process which we know has been rigged to ensure that he gets the boot?</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Aww, I remember this guy. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">tlk</a> 07:07, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
