This article was listed as a PROD for lack of reliable sources and for not meeting <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> notability guidelines.

The PROD tag was later removed by an anon user because, as they wrote on Talk:Dragon_Kingdoms, "Comic Genesis is a major webcomic site" and "The Webcomic List lists many comics, including Dragon Kingdoms."

<p><b>Keep</b>. Why? Because of the guideline that states: "7. Content that is distributed by independent online sites will almost certainly satisfy the first criterion." Comic Genesis, whether anyone wants to admit it or not, is an independent online site, and if this comic should go, then there are dozens of other comics on this site that should be removed from the webcomic list section. Other reasons that support keeping the article. 1) The series has more than the suggested 70 comics in an 18-month period. 2) It ranks fairly high on a search engine. 3) It might be better to have a list within the Comic Genesis article of the more active webcomics on its site, than remove valuable material from this and other Comic Genesis sites. Again, CG may have thousands of comics, but very few of them are active. --65.32.81.3 02:56, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note #7 of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> also states "Such distributions should be nontrivial. Although Geocities and Newgrounds are exceedingly well known, hosting content on them is trivial." Being hosted on a free site such as geocities, myspace or comic genesis is a trivial matter, and not a sign of notability. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 03:49, 18 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the time Dragon Kingdoms joined Comic Genesis (which was Keenspace at the time, in April 2004), there WAS a quality requirement (that the comic happened to meet). Not just anyone could join. Part of the re-branding effort in 2005 was for Comic Genesis to be more open to the many webcomics out there, to the extent of registering domains, such as toonspace.com, among others. So, while it is <i>now</i> possible for just any comic to join, that wasn't the case. Also, Comic Genesis is hardly trivial- it isn't even stated in a COMIC guideline page that it is. Even if it is now, it wasn't then. --65.32.81.3 03:59, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Revised to Keep</b> In fact, before they officially started taking any submission that came across the street in March 2004, they were limiting submissions, so the site wouldn't crash again. My submission was in February 2004, at the time they said "We're limiting comic submissions at this time, but if you're good enough, we'll take you. Please submit the work that you want to represent your comic." The first work I sent ended up representing the April 9th update. The comic posted by Nifboy started in 2002, before the short period of submission limitations. Since I don't know much about Comic Genesis before the crash, I thought they all had to be quality works. Even so, it doesn't make sense to remove comics that were already being hosted before the crash due to lack of quality. Because, if CG was as delete-happy as Wikipedia is, there would probably be about 10 or 20 comic sites left on it. As mentioned, this community is a black eye in the webcomics community, to the point that it WOULD be best to take all articles down, and move them to Comic Genesis, Comixpedia, or any other webcomics-related community's Wiki. In fact, I think all these deletions are going against what Wikis were supposed to be in the first place. <b>It doesn't harm a directory on webcomics to tell a little about each one, as said earlier, if long listings become a problem, BOLDly split them into other categories!</b> If they are truly inactive comics, THEN consider removal. If they are poorly written (which I believe is the TRUE issue here), have them marked for clean-up. Otherwise, remove them ALL, and have the webcomics page be a links page to sites that host these comics. --Videowizard2006 01:59, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>If that's the case, couldn't the article be either on Wikimedia or the Comic Genesis wiki? Though it is strange that Comic Genesis isn't considered notable enough. Another possibility, rather than deleting every article in sight, is having the webcomic lists in genres. That way, the main page would still be readable, and people looking for comics of a certain genre can find them. Also, at the time Dragon Kingdoms joined Comic Genesis (which was Keenspace at the time, in April 2004), there WAS a quality requirement (that the comic happened to meet).

<p>Close to 500 webcomic articles have been imported to Comixpedia from this site. The decline continues. Though maybe not all of the imports are articles deleted from Wikipedia, I have a feeling a lot of them are. If "there's no way to verify most webcomics' articles" (quoted from Nifboy), why not take them all down? Just make searches for them redirects to the appropriate comic site. As I've already stated, it is pointless for Wikipedia to duplicate the existing sites' (CG and Comixpedia) Wiki directories. This also works because, like it or not, some notable webcomic authors (such as the one of Checkerboard Nightmare) already feel that Wikipedia is a useless source for webcomic information (which I unfortunately agree with them). I looked at the Secret of Mana Theater article (for example), and I fail to see what is so notable about that. Also, I don't know why 2-3 people can shut an article down. Having 10 votes is hardly a large enough sample from the community to allow an article to be deleted, especially when there is no way to check that 5 of these people are Dragonfiend's friends, a well-noted nominator of articles for deletion. This is supposed to be a site for everyone. If your article is simply a description of the characters and the comic's history, and not "LOL, go to teh forumz", or "My comic is da BOMB" what harm does it do to put the word out there? Also, Alexa is no longer supposed to be used as criteria for an article, yet that is what DF has been doing. In fact, I'm thinking about proposing a new standard for webcomics to end this fighting.</p>
<p>I feel that it is fine to have an article on your (or any) webcomic, as long as: 1) It has been around for at least 6 months. 2) It has at least 20 comics in those six months, 70 by the end of 18 months (if a weekly), or 15 comics in 18 months for a monthly. 3) It doesn't go around saying it's the greatest comic ever. It is okay, however, to mention improvements since earlier editions. 4) It at least talks about the characters, mentions the time it started and its website link, and should have some history. That's all. If it isn't well-written, mark for cleanup. If the comic becomes inactive (three months without update) for a long time (like RPG World), it should go into the Inactive list for six months, after which, it can be an AfD (Article for Deletion). Inappropriate articles can go into AfD or SD, depending on severity. Completed webcomics like Kid Radd would be exempt from the Inactive list, and would go under the Completed list. I don't know why we all have to keep fighting, keep arguing, and keep deleting, when there is a simple solution right here.</p>
<p>Finally, to verify, is it so hard to go to said website and look through the archives? I didn't notice anyone checking to see if the info was correct besides DF, which doesn't exactly instill confidence in me. --Videowizard2006 05:27, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Videowizard, I agree with you that Wikipedia's rules are too strict about what is considered to be a notable webcomic, but the truth is that is the rules of the site, and that is what we're going by here. This webcomic may or may not deserve an article here, but by the current standards it does not. I think your arguments are good, and deserve to be heard, but this is not the place to bring it up, this is only an AfD discussion. Try taking this up in the WikiProject Webcomics discussion, where it's not going to fall on deaf ears. If this article stays it would be an exception to this site's rules, so rather than try to preserve the article, see if you can get people to agree to change the rules. -- <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZaron_4a89.html" title="User:Zaron">Zaron</a> 05:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Videowizard2006, I can understand that this might be difficult for you, having not only an article that you wrote up for deletion but having the article be about your comic as well. The only thing I can think to suggest is that you might want to read over <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> and try to understand that we are building a reliable encyclopedia based upon reputable published sources.

It may also help to read over <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. For example, Wikipedia is not a place for advertising or self promotion, nor is it a web directory.

<li>So, you don't hate it then? I thought maybe part of the issue was hatred of the comic. Well, I've noticed somewhat of an increase in the comic's popularity recently, having been included in the 2005 <a href="http://www.webcomictelethon.com/d/1227.html" class="external text" title="http://www.webcomictelethon.com/d/1227.html" rel="nofollow">Blank Label Webcomic Telethon</a>, and the number of hits have steadily increased. Unfortunately, Comic Genesis doesn't make the number of hits a comic gets public, so it isn't possible to verify that the comic has done so. Maybe it's just a little early for this comic to get an article here. Would've been nice, though. --Videowizard2006 08:58, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I realized something. As far as I know, this is the first comic series based on a RPG Maker creation. I haven't seen anything about webcomics starting before November 2000 that are based on RPG Maker. How come being first isn't considered notable? After all, there's the first sprite comic, the first Flash comic, the first 3D comic, etc. --Videowizard2006 07:04, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

And not that it's directly relevant to the article, but I saw <a href="http://www.legendsmagazine.net/57/bigcath.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.legendsmagazine.net/57/bigcath.htm" rel="nofollow">Big Catholic Guilt</a> live, and they were really good.

The article on <a href="../../../g/u/i/Guilt.html#Cultural_views_of_guilt" title="Guilt">Guilt#Cultural views of guilt</a> is rather skimpy so it could be <b>merged</b> over there, provided it were improved upon. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 05:04, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Firstly, to be a poet doesn't imply any published work. Emily Dickinson had no work published while she was alive; does that mean that while alive she wasn't a poet? Take that idea and stretch it to all artists. You are saying that if they have no art for resale they are not really making art. That is a lie. The bio says Amick is an actor who is in the planning stages of his poetry book; we have no reason to doubt this.</p>
<p>As to his ancestors, these may be fantastic claims but we have no way to prove them to be lies. If they are really all that bothersome I suggest editing out the portion “…whose lineage can be traced to Charlemagne the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich and Edgar Allen Poe among others.” However, I see no reason to really doubt these as factual. Also, if everyone is related to Charlemagne then he has just as much right to say so as everyone else.</p>
<p>Amick obviously does have an acting career and a position with Monumental Pictures. I think this is proven by the external links. While he has only one movie to his credit he is in talks for more movies and does hold a position on Monumental’s Board of Directors. I think if we doubt this we should contact Monumental Pictures and ask them about the nature of “Imprudence” Amick’s role in the company and any further acting work he may be doing.</p>
<p>I don’t think that this page is a strong candidate for deletion, this person has obviously done things and is continuing to do things that are beyond the scope of the everyday individual.</p>

<dd>If Wikipedia had existed during Emily Dickinson's time, and somebody had tried to write an article on her, the article would rightly have been deleted, as she was not notable at the time. Also, it is not our job to try to prove things are lies. It is the job of the people who write the articles to prove that they are true <i><b>and</b></i> notable. So, when are you going to start editing the article of every single person of European ancestry to include that tidbit about being descended from Charlemagne? And where's the proof for Mr. Amick? Also, one credit does not an actor make. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:36, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

However, the fact that our article on the Three Laws of Robotics doesn't mention him at all causes me some concern. He is a charcter in the movie but is he in Asimov's book/s.

Latter article already includes lines such as 'In his short story "Evidence", Asimov lets his recurring character Dr. Susan Calvin expound a moral basis behind the Laws.' Unless Lanning shows considerable character development, or is more generally used to reference the Laws (like Romeo and Juliet, etc, are used as cultural refs), then a similar sentence re Lanning would suffice. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJackyR_8980.html" title="User:JackyR">JackyR</a> 00:39, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Stifle, I support continuing the regular procedure as you suggest and as it developed. That said, I see this nomination as clearly disruptive. The nominator, who is indefinitely banned from the Hebrew Wikipedia, can read in Hebrew that Jackont has an extensive article at he.wikipedia and is a notable and in fact a multiple times bestselling author and television personality.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Alexa ranking of 142,470. The claim of "arguably the biggest Coldplay fansite on the internet." is POV without any proofs.

<dd>Yes, but that means it goes over here.</dd>

<p>2. we are mearly trying to help, we are aware of the clean up campain, this is just a suppliment, 2 is always better then 1, and 3 is better th4en 2. so anyone elce starts one, that wont be a bad thing either. think of it like a milita, theres the army whitch does most of the work, we just try our best to do more then our fair shair.</p>

<p><b>delete</b> - Many similar articles on non-notable people have been deleted in the past and there is no reason why this article should be kept on Wikipedia.

This re-nomination should definitely mention that it is a re-nomination, and it would be good if <a href="../../../s/c/e/User%7ESceptre_44d8.html" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a> could explain the rationale for closing the original nomination. --<a href="../../../s/a/f/User%7ESaforrest_5781.html" title="User:Saforrest">Saforrest</a> 02:20, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The original article was only the following content: "Lee started out as a marine engineer officer before travelling the world and living in Thailand. He later became a top model, presenting live shows for Barclaycard, Sony and Vodafone. You may recognise him from 90s boyband, Northern Live and his stints on Bid TV and Sky Vegas Live." Sceptre, not unreasonably, felt that this was not quite enough to establish notability. I think the current article makes it more clear, though. Just because something was speedied once does not mean it can ever be created again; speedy deletion is a way of cleaning out the thousand obviously bad/fake/wrong articles we get per day at Wikipedia, sometimes a few things slip through the cracks. (If they are really notable subjects, then someone will soon create a new article about it. Which seems to have been the case here.) --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 04:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Go ahead and recreate it in the namespace if you're going to put it up as a glossary. The wording matters; there's just too many pages listing translations for words that have no real place in wiki, but as a glossary this could be useful.

<dd>In the future, I recommend discussing it on the approriate talk page before marking an article AfD. It's much better to argue semantics (which is all this is) on the talk page than to cause problems by marking it AfD without thinking about it or discussing it first. --<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">nihon</a> 02:32, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Your sentiment is correct but I didn't consider it a semantic issue at first. Regardless I have already apologized. I choose to take the positive POV that AfD obviously provides quick results, although at the same time, it is obvious that votes come in too quickly and without enough thought. AfD is allowed as a judge of an article's worthiness because it allows for discussion of its merits in a period of five days.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Aside from the other comments above, the term is a neologism used by relatively few people. In the history of theology and the philosophy of religion, the term "benevolence" has been used without problem; "omnibenevolence" seems to have been coined simply in imitation of "omnipotence" and "omniscience". --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 22:32, 21 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Omnibenevolence, though a strange word I admit, has stronger meaning (for lack of a better word...implications? I'm tired) than benevolence alone.

<dd>One of my main teaching and research areas is the philosophy of religion; the term "omnibenevolence" is of recent coinage (within the last decade or so), and until even more recently was mainly confined to undergraduate esays. Not one of the major writers on the ontological argument, for example, uses the term; they use "goodness", "benevolence", etc. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 23:31, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> — these are real languages. I wrote the original articles on the different Judaeo-Aramaic languages. They have much in common, but lack overall mutual intelligibility. Combining the articles would be a retrograde step. It is useful to have an article that can direct the reader to the articles on the individual languages, but could also discuss their position. Wikipedia is a work in progress, and it would be careless to kill off something that is in development. This really is not the kind of article that should be submitted to AFD. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarzo_81e4.html" title="User:Garzo">Gareth Hughes</a> 21:07, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Go to www.buzzerquiz.com, and see the shell of a Web site that is there. All it says is "new site coming soon" and that was back in March 2005. The link is circular, and there is no indication that there is any plans for this organization to conduct any contest of any sort in the near future. This is bollocks, plain and simple. ~~LynnW

<p>IMPERIALX5: I still don't see why this would have to be deleted. And the site did have 5 digits in the counter. Do people just run around looking for entries to shut down? I find that a little rude and unnessesary. Also, just because you don't know about this game and site doesn't mean others don't. I also don't have the capability to use MediaWiki and host my own.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> — Hi, John. To meet notability guidelines for music bands (including independant bands) for inclusion into Wikipedia, they must meet the guidelines as stated <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28music%29_1229.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (music)">here (WP:MUSIC)</a>. If Turd-Ad can meet the criteria for inclusion, then you will be able to argue for your side. As for the "15 year old" comment, I believe that ERcheck was simply referring to the fact that most 15 year-olds aren't the kind to produce something notable, much less WP-inclusionable. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 14:00, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Personally, I would regard the phrase "non-notable pair of buffoons" quite offensive and believe that such blatant effrontery has no place on Wikipedia. I would simply like to add that Turd-Ad has a quite significant fan-base and, as aforementioned, is working on the release of an album with contributions from a wider group of affiliates. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Dr Romano (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dr_Romano_8a07.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dr Romano">contribs</a>).</small></p>

Wikipedia is criticised on the following issues:</p>
<pre>
   * Usefulness as a reference
   * Anti-elitism as a weakness
   * Systemic bias in coverage
   * Systemic bias in perspective
   * Difficulty of fact checking
   * Use of dubious sources
   * Exposure to vandals
   * Privacy concerns
   * Quality Concerns
   * Flame wars
   * <b>Fanatics and special interests</b> [see note 1] 
   * <b>Censorship</b> [see note 2]
</pre>
<p>Note 1: I don't think dance music, Turd-Ad's main output, can be classified as specialist. Note 2: Yes, censorship. The act of disallowing someone's right to free thought and speech and freedom of information. This is what Wikipedia is once again doing, going against its very reasons for being.</p>
<p>Another point I would like to put to you regards the nature of your style of moderation. You seem to be working against us, not with us, trying to get this article deleted in an effort to flex your authorative muscles and show who's "boss". Your opinion is not better than ours. Wikipedia is a mass of human information and therefore should contain information that all humans want, whether it may be "specialist" to some it would not be to others. Surely going with the majority feeling or opinion is not in the best interest of the minority? Instead all tastes should be catered for. This page does harm to no-one but helps and pleases others. We kindly ask you not to delete this article. JohnOHara 20:06, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> — The Wikipedia community (and I believe I represent several peoples' opinions here) isn't all against you. In fact, while I may have sounded rather harsh in dealing with this, the listing on AfD and the ensuing discussion is simply following guidelines detailed in <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">Articles for Deletion</a>. Wikipedia isn't a space for free speech (as that may sometimes violate the NPOV policy), nor is it (and this is important) a free web-hosting service. Non-notable entries are entirely that: Non-notable, and therefore, should <i>not</i> be included in Wikipedia until they can be proven to be notable. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 20:21, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<p>But some of reasons for being notable are hardly clear-cut. 30 minutes on a radio broadcast? What if Turd-Ad was featured for 29? (I believe it was featured on 2FM). Surely the rule should be: "Featured for a notable amount of time on a radio broadcast" I know you don't have the power to change that rule but you can see where I am coming from.81.129.71.209 20:42, 19 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> — The reason behind the clear black-and-white distinction in the criteria for notability under WP:MUSIC is due to the fact that it is not good form to say "a notable amount of time". Being an ambiguous phrase, exceptions can be made, and if exceptions are made, then the standard is lowered, and later on, many articles that formerly would have failed the guidelines set out through WP:MUSIC would make it through. It is unfortunate to say that if you've been on 29 minutes, you've failed the test, but that's the rule. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<sup><a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser">Talk!</a></sup> 20:50, 19 February 2006 (U</dd>

<li>Crea7or is direct competitor of the Winpopup LAN Messenger.</li>
<li>This page is <b>not promotion</b>. It is <b>short</b> information only. See this page <a href="http://www.winpopup-lan-messenger.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.winpopup-lan-messenger.com/" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> if you are looking promotion.</li>
<li>"this seems to be non-notable software" - the software is contained in non-large segment of the market (<a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_Messenger_a978.html" title="LAN Messenger">LAN Messenger</a>). But it is significant in this segment. So it is well founded to have this page if the wikipedia have <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_Messenger_a978.html" title="LAN Messenger">LAN Messenger</a> page.
<ul>
<li>Can you explicate the significance in the limited segment? Approximate marketshare? Or userbase compared to other products in the market? Or do you have notable press on the product that wasn't sourced by the company who makes the software?--<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarnesky_43db.html" title="User:Karnesky">Karnesky</a> 11:19, 20 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are right, there is no public info about userbase, downloads or sales. I have no objective comparison. I have only stats for <b>two</b> softwares in this segment and my subjective vision about competitors. Have I ineterest&#160;? - Yes. Am I expert in this subject&#160;? I guess - Yes. That is why I edit common topics like <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_Messenger_a978.html" title="LAN Messenger">LAN Messenger</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winpopup.html" title="Winpopup">Winpopup</a>, etc. and I do not touch my competitors pages.

<li>Vitaly, you have commercial interest here ( As me some time ago ). One of wiki admins has told me about wiki policy and commercial interest is not acceptable here at all. Links to commercial sites I also not acceptable as Perfecto told me. Please understand me and delete your links if you want to keep this article - but it have no encyclopedic info and will be deleted by the other users I think ( and I see the conforming answers here). This is not a software archive like "1000 new programs".crea7or
<ul>
<li>Pavel (Crea7or), this article is just <b>short facts</b> about the software (not promotion). The homepage url is fact also, and the description will be partial without the homepage. I do not understand what wrong with this link&#160;?! Each commercial org promoute its products at theirs homepages. Do you offer to remove all external links&#160;? I see the difference between wikipedia and my site, thanks <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> too. Fomine 20:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Pavel (Crea7or), it is ok, when <b>independent</b> person initiate such deletion process. But you are my competitor, and you have your commercial interest that is opposite to mine. You think that this article is advertisement. All others contributors has some doubt in "significance in the limited segment" only. What do you think is the Winpopup LAN Messenger adequate item of the <a href="../../../l/a/n/LAN_Messenger_a978.html" title="LAN Messenger">LAN Messengers</a>&#160;? 20:21, 20 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I will not initiate deletion again if your page will not be deleted. But I know and you know that all these articles about <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winpopup.html" title="Winpopup">winpopup</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/t/Net_Send_6cd0.html" title="Net Send">Net Send</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winpopup_LAN_Messenger_cd53.html" title="Winpopup LAN Messenger">Winpopup LAN Messenger</a> only for keyword catching from google search results. Net send is a part of net command that relevant to your messenger, Winpopup LAN messenger is relevant words for your messenger, the real name of your messenger is Fomine Messenger. It's a game, but not the real knowledge. When I found your page in the wikipedia, I have created my own. My page has been deleted.

<p>Ok, MISSION is not a GAME it's an online cartoon and NOT an advertisement. I don't make any money off of the site and have placed this article on wikipedia to provide further information about the cartoon. I figured since other comic book type sites have THEIR own entries, I can make one for mine since thousands of people watch this cartoon. You might want to check out the entry for 'Sacred Pie' which is similar to my site, yet it has an entry too. I don't see why my entry is considered an 'advertisement' and being singled out for deletion while sacred pie is essentially the same thing. Please clarify this for me.</p>

<p>Hi, I wrote the article. The radio station has a potential audience of over 100,000 people. It is well known in the Preston area and similar radio stations have pages on Wikipedia that have not been scheduled for deletion. Please do not delete it. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebloggsy_3172.html" title="User:Joebloggsy">Joebloggsy</a> 21:19, 18 February 2006</p>
<p>The same goes for the Pluto, it has a massive audience and similar articles exist already that have not been deleted. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebloggsy_3172.html" title="User:Joebloggsy">Joebloggsy</a> 21:21, 18 February 2006</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not so much that we don't believe you, Joebloggsy, as much as is that the article doesn't show evidence of what you state here. Also, isn't "potential audience" a funny measure for a radio station's noteworthiness? Couldn't any radio station in the area make the same assertion? --<a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 21:38, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>As could any other student radio station listed on Wikipedia. It isn't possible for student radio stations to ascertain correct RAJAR figures as that centralises on commercial radio and BBC radio stations. Perhaps if you could explain what is meant by evidence and examples of what we could provide then we could reach a more amicable solution. (Unattributed)</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Radio_Association_01b8.html" title="Student Radio Association">Student Radio Association</a> page for other examples for student stations on Wikipedia. The university is the fourth largest in the UK. What would you suggest I add to the articles to make them worthy? Cheers, Joebloggsy. --<a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebloggsy_3172.html" title="User:Joebloggsy">Joebloggsy</a> 21:50, 18 February 2006</li>
<li>Plus, Pluto has three celebrity writers, which is of interest. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoebloggsy_3172.html" title="User:Joebloggsy">Joebloggsy</a> 22:41, 18 February 2006</li>
<li>Here's my case for keeping the articles...</li>
</ul>
<p>1. They are integral parts of one of the UK's largest higher education institutions.<br />
2. Frequency is one of only a handful of radio stations in <a href="../../../p/r/e/Preston.html" title="Preston">Preston</a>, a major North-West city.<br />
3. The university has one of the best journalism courses in the country, so these media have, and will continue to develop journalists who go on to be significant.<br />
4. Other student radio stations and newspapers have been on Wikipedia without being deleted. (See the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Radio_Association_01b8.html" title="Student Radio Association">Student Radio Association</a> page for examples).<br />
5. Pluto has guest writers that include <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Lawrenson_d307.html" title="Mark Lawrenson">Mark Lawrenson</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Finney_854e.html" title="Tom Finney">Tom Finney</a>, and <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Bowen_eafd.html" title="Jim Bowen">Jim Bowen</a> and has been mentioned several times in the national press because of this.<br />
6. Frequency often hosts meetings for the <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Radio_Association_01b8.html" title="Student Radio Association">Student Radio Association</a>, and is an integral member.<br />
7. The two media get as many readers/listeners as any non-student media, and would not get deleted if they weren't student-based.<br />
8. Pluto has been running since 1985 - making it one of the country's oldest student newspapers.<br />

And if nothing else, it appears that the plans themselves for this movie are notable enough for an article (i.e., the article can be about <i>present</i> plans and verifiable reports instead of about a nonexistent future movie). –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 21:53, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><small><b>Please note</b>: This AFD applies to a large number of pages. There are also various redirect pages (eg, Ruinmist) not listed; a vote to delete the lot will be interpreted as including those.</small></p>
<p>This one is a bit odd, so please bear with me. Basically, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Stanek_3b54.html" title="Robert Stanek">Robert Stanek</a> is an almost entirely non-notable author, with hordes of obscure fantasy books coming from a small press, which he may or may not control. But he has a very good PR machine, which makes him <i>seem</i> like a major author; dedicated fans fill Amazon with glowing reviews, vaguely threatening 'legal' letters mysteriously get sent to places that mention that his books are not very good, and so forth. And in December, this PR machine hit Wikipedia; see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Archive21_8ce7.html#Beware_the_Stanek" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Archive21">WP:AN</a>. Hordes of links to his material from unrelated pages; hordes of pages on his stuff. A lot of the cruftier stuff got trimmed then - I know, I did some - and we left it.</p>
<p>Last night, a couple of the authors of these pages started blanking <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Stanek_2b68.html" title="Talk:Robert Stanek">Talk:Robert Stanek</a>, demanding that comments suggesting astroturfing were removed. Fun ensued; see <a href="../../../a/d/m/Wikipedia%7EAdministrators%27_noticeboard_Incidents_947b.html#Robert_Stanek" title="Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents">WP:AN/I</a>. So I got to thinking about our pages on his works... hence, this AFD. I've been reflecting on these articles, and they're just not worth keeping.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd be uneasy with anything running to this detail on a "real" novel... and as it is, given the obscurity of Stanek's books, I really feel we're just being used for <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">astroturfing</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox; astroturfing is <b>self-promotion</b> in all but name, IME. It's certainly not motivated by improving the encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The obscurity of Stanek's work means that these pages will likely suffer the fate of vanity pages - even if they weren't created by him, they are of interest to a very small number of people, and will likely be left <b>unmaintained</b> for long periods. Many of them haven't been touched at all since the frenzy of creation, with the rest maybe getting a typo fixed or a link disambiguated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Merging and redirecting</b> without going to AFD was possible, but I know that would just result in me being yelled at (you should see <a href="../../../r/o/b/Talk%7ERobert_Stanek_2b68.html" title="Talk:Robert Stanek">Talk:Robert Stanek</a>), and trying to see if community consensus agreed with me seemed smarter. Plus, this way I get to shift the buck to "Wikipedia".&#160;:-)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The books are, IME, <b>non-notable</b>... but due to the nature of the situation that's hotly debated. It is something to bear in mind, though.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Robert Stanek is infamous throughout science fiction publishing. What tends to happen is that a completely non-notable book is put out in the Stanek name, and then hundreds, if not thousands, of positive reviews begin to flood web-based reviews websites. Oddly, these reviews are all identical. Now, I'm not saying that Stanek himself has anything to do with these reviews, any more than I'm saying that the sudden flurry of Stanek-related articles on Wikipedia are anything to do with him personally, but the long arm of coincidence stretches only so far.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I know nothing abou operations research, and I've heard of this before. On mathworld, it is called the [<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GloveProblem.html" class="external text" title="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GloveProblem.html" rel="nofollow">Glove Problem</a>]. As to notability: right now, the defacto <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_7ee9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics</a> "notability" criterion is set at a level whereby, if a paper or two has been published on the topic, its notable. For something to be in a book means that there have been dozens of papers at least, and so is clearly notable. Although, ahem, it might be more appropriate to reword this into talking about gloves not condoms. Although I admit the reason I remember hearing of it before was the "gross-out" factor. Actually, think I heard about re-using latex gloves in Soviet hospitals, and maybe 3rd-world hospitals. They certainly reused "disposable" needles. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 01:06, 22 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since I don't know what a "makespan" is, I suggest moving article to glove problem. The language doesn't concern me much. Wether te content is accurate.... actually, that I did not investigate.
