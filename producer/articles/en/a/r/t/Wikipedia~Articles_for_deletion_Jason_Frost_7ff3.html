<p>PLEASE READ FIRST:</p>
<p>Wikipaedia decision maker. Jason Frost was a Sunshine Bandmember withMajor label, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, as well as an important part of rock n roll history in Olympia-Seattle area, who continues to create music for his devoted fans like myself. You can check here, as well as the many, many, links thoughout this page on his newspaper articles, press, artist pages, and movie film database on major film, etc. He is notable. Android79 has done nothing but angered me and played games and muddied up this page.</p>
<p>A search for "jason frost kc &amp; sunshine band" turned up folowwing results: MTV listings: <a href="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/movies/person/337491/personmain.jhtml</a></p>
<p>(The star next to his name means he is notable to MTV!!!)</p>
<p>Wikipaedia requires for a band or artist personality to be listed he must have been a member of a notable band, KC &amp; Sunshine Band, had hits like "get down tonight" and others. His being a memebr of this band makes him notable, even though I find this the least notable of his accomplishments. I vote to KEEP! - Timk</p>
<p>He did not fill in, he was member of band, that was my mistake from earlier post when I said filled in. He was touring performer.</p>
<p>(again apologize for the muddled up page which follows, in between are some good links for verification)</p>
<p>GO AHEAD AND KEEP DELETING ON YOUR DELETENG SPREE ANDROID79, WIKIPAEDIA AUTHORS WILL SOON FIND THAT YOU ARE JUST DELETING ON RANDOM SPREE WITH NO BASIS - SEE ANDROIDS PROFILE, they have contributed nothing to wikipaedia except to go around voting to delete stuff, many have contributed over years in building and writing!</p>

<p>VOTE TO DISREGARD: See below, even after providing facts, Android79 will not back down or change mind, obviously personal, also read androids profile, makes a habit of actively seeking bands and artsist to delete. Sounds fishy to me. Like they are just looking and itching to delete the hard work many of have contributed over many years on an artist or band they find notable. I don't think I will be using wikipaedia anymore because of stuff like this. I actually came on here 2nite and was going to add some newer updates and stuff to one of my favorite artists pages- but I change my mind after this. Not worth the ffort when people can just delete on a whim everyones efforts and contributions. <i>(Note: This unsigned comment is by User:Tim k, who inserted it between <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">User:Megan1967</a>'s vote and her signature)</i> <small><i><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">User:Android79</a> pasted name here; trying to lay cliam that I was changing people vites, which was not true.

<li><b>Keep</b> Keep. I have been longtime fan and can verify this information, also do a web search on google or sumthin, hes listed everywhere, but AMG only listed major label artists, not indies -he has only recently signed to bigger label, and sunshine bandmember in like 2000-2002 so perhaps he will be listed soon? - Timk</li>
</ul>
<p>Also he began and started out renting warehouse space formerly rented by nirvana and was roomates and shared practice space and lived with John Wozniak of Marcy Playground in heart of the grunge scene in Washington state, also was promoter in NW Washington innovating new type shows like phunky phat 95, and has gone on to do national charity tours such as ROCK FOR CHRISTMAS rock4xmas.com which brings gifts and money to homeless and those less fortunate each year.</p>
<p>Do your research before deleting!</p>

<p>HE IS LISTED AS JASON FROST, UNDER SPONSORS LOVE JUNKIES ALBUM COVER IS LISTED -- READ THE NAME SOF PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS - NO SMALL FARE.</p>
<p>Also he began and started out practicing with John Wozniak of Marcy Playground (jamming in same warehouse space formerly as Nirvana with his band Blue Moon splitting the unit with Marcy Playground to jam---they also shared a giutarist). He was also promoter in NW innovating new type shows like phunky phat 95 bringing hip hop and alternative music together and he has gone on to do national charity tours such as rock4xmas.com working with some pretty notable celebrities like members from Anthrax, WASP, Great White, Quiet Riot, Badfinger, Blue Oyster Cult and others.

<p>I have provided more notable info and links than you could provide discredits---as I said and YOU deleted and VANDALIZED MY post. I said being on major film credits with Michael Douglas and Albert Brooks and a member of KC &amp; SUNSHINE BAND, also in film, is pretty frickin notable if you ask me...also every other thing and link abotu this artist is notable. I have followed this artist for years. I coudl go on and on... but why try...its obvious that wikipaedia is no longer aplace to find juicy tidbits and obscure info...its becoming ruined by people likeyou deleteing information that took others years to compile and post here on what they obviously found to be notable. - Tim k</p>
<ul>
<li>Please, read the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>. They're not hard and fast rules, but Frost comes nowhere near meeting any of them. I doubt whether a role as what basically amounts to an extra in a single movie really counts for much, either. Also, if I deleted all or part of your posts, it was inadvertent, as we were editing this page concurrently. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 05:16, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Your original argument has been refuted</p>
<p>Non-notable,</p>
<p>I have given links to websites, press, newspapers, charity sites with bands and concerts he has worked to promote. Also if not being a part of the initial grunge movement and playing and hanging with all those bands in the early grunge days in independantg rock scene is not notable or interesting WTF? Also I provided major film and verifiable proof that he went on to be part of KC &amp; SUNSHINE band- wikipaedia rules says if you are memebr of major band through major label even for short time than you satisfy listign requirement. I personally find this as his least notable accomplishment, but that alone suffices and satisfies wikipaedia placement.</p>
<p><br />
vanity,</p>
<p>I am sure if you check the articles on frost and his bands, and otehr stuff probably had multiple authors as I have witness the articles here on him change over the years -- he has had listign long time. Are you smoking peyote?</p>
<p>possible hoax</p>
<p>Hoax,</p>
<p>This is a musician with long verifiable history, what kind of hoax can this be? he has been around before wikipaedia even existed!!!</p>

<p>I am the user that deleted Vfd tags. I apologize, I am new here. There was some confusion about Vfd tags being deleted after 5 days. I thought anyone could delete after 5 days, although discussion still continues in here on vfd pages. It is recommended vfd deletion rule pages add specifically who is authorized to do this as it was unclear -- hence the accidental deletion. It was only done out of respect for the artists concerned. Please research and confirm updates on Artists profile. All information can be verified either through Publisher or ASCAP. <small><i>This unsigned comment is from User:66.32.171.2.</i> <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:57, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li>Well, given that the VfD notice itself says "don't delete me," and that the VfD policy page is pretty clear on <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#When_the_Lag_Time_runs_out" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">what happens after the 5 days are up</a>, I really don't understand the confusion. Feel free to leave a comment over at the policy page, though. Anyway... Google for "Statue Records" and one of the first hits is whether or not the label is a scam. Indeed, the Love Junkies appear to have released a record on this label of undetermined notability and reputation, but even so, the subject still does not meet the letter or the spirit of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Music_Notability_and_Music_Guidelines_9d02.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Music/Notability and Music Guidelines">notability guidelines for musicians</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">Android79</a> 13:51, Mar 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
