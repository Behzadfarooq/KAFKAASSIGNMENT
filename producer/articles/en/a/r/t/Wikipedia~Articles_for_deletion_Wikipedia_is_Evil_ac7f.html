<li>Please do not attempt to discredit my vote, the admin which counts the vote at the end of this proccess can determine if any invalid votes have been made. I never claimed that my <i>comment</i> was the <i>reason</i> I think this article should be deleted. It was merely a <i>comment</i>. I believe that this article should be deleted because I concur with the reasons given by the nominee. I think it would be quite unneccessary if everyone had to repeat the same reasons for every vote, or even if they had to put "I concur" after each vote because that's what voting delete without any further reasons generally means. -- <a href="../../../j/o/o/User%7EJoolz_b423.html" title="User:Joolz">Joolz</a> 14:05, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>From the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> page: "Wikipedia is not an experiment in democracy. Its primary method of finding consensus is discussion, not voting. That is, majority opinion does not necessarily rule in Wikipedia. Various votes are regularly conducted, but their numerical results are usually only one of several means of making a decision. The discussions that accompany the voting processes are crucial means of reaching consensus. For example, a very important Wikipedia process is reaching consensus on what articles are not encyclopedic and should be deleted from Wikipedia entirely. The discussion by which that consensus is reached occurs in the context of a "vote" on the Wikipedia:Votes for deletion page. That page is slightly misnamed since the discussion is more important than the actual voting."</li>

<dd>Someone here seems to be labouring under the delusion that you have to have a valid reason for your vote. More to the point that he/she is the judge of what is a valid reason. In fact there is no need for anyone to provide a reason for their vote, any more than you have to have a 'valid' reason for how you vote in an election.

<p>If anyone has a legitimate reason for deleting, keeping, or redirecting, I encourage you to list it here. However, simply stating "delete" is not a valid reason for deletion. If the veracity, format, or POV of the article is in question, it should be discussed in the Talk section.

<li><b>Delete</b>, POV/original research, however some of those criticisms are commonly made of the Wikipedia, so it may be worth digging up some sources and putting the more notable points in something like a Wikipedia:Common criticisms page or something.

<pre>
   A unique criticism, however, is that the system actually exhumes evil 
   based on its design. This view is explored in depth in this article.
</pre>
<dl>
<dd>The article establishes the parameter for the topic as, an <i>in depth</i> exploration of the <i>unique criticism</i> that, Wikipedia <i>exhumes evil</i> by design. It couldn't be made more clear to what pseudo-intellectual depths the article must go in order to investigate the issue under a pretense of neutrality. The exploration of <i>this view</i> consists chiefly of a lazy wave of the hand in the general direction of a group of people, ominously called "internet [[fundamentalists]]" - well, let's just say it (and he does) - "Christians" - well, alright (which he doesn't say), "Me". This is how far an in depth exploration of the topic will take us at first thrust. I shudder to think how much farther in that direction things might go with a little more work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is followed by a section entitled <i>Man-Based Thought in Information</i>, the relevance of which is not obvious, unless the point is to grant access to someone's (presumably not the author's) struggles with epistemological issues in a world without God. Finally, we are treated to an arm-chair analysis of what we might have learned from reading all this.</dd>

<dd>My first inclination was to try to improve the essay - because I can sympathize with its theme. Any religious person who is never frustrated by the official and coercive agnosticism, enforced through Wikipedia's editing policies, is not religious in any sense that I can identify with. But the only way to contribute to this topic would be to join with the author in carving out article space for a forum controversy, for the sake of further elucidating his point of view. I recommend to the author that he should create a blog, link to it from userspace, and direct people to it who might be interested in his explanation of why Christians will find it difficult to participate in Wikipedia, and why he thinks this is not an accident. This would free him from the pretense of agnosticism, and enable him to write much more credibly about the problem. However, the best way to improve this article is to delete it from Wikipedia. Some mention of the problem alluded to might make a good addition to <a href="../../../w/h/y/Why_Wikipedia_is_not_so_great_3112.html" title="Why Wikipedia is not so great">Why Wikipedia is not so great</a>, but there are only themes, no actual content, here. <a href="../../../m/k/m/User%7EMkmcconn_b3be.html" title="User:Mkmcconn">Mkmcconn</a> <a href="../../../m/k/m/User_talk%7EMkmcconn_6087.html" title="User talk:Mkmcconn"><small>(Talk)</small></a> 05:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>
