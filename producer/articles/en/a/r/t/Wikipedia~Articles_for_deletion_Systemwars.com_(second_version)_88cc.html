It should be noted that to overcome the "substantially identical copy" clause of G4, a recreation must address <i>those features of the original that were felt to be in contravention of WP policies and guidelines</i> in the first place. The original version of this article was validly deleted via <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Systemwars.com_aae2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Systemwars.com">VfD</a> principally because it so lacked notability (to use that much-maligned word) that it did not have independent sources that would adequately meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements of this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, the heart and soul of an encyclopedia and one of WP's great trinity, regretably also appears to be the most ignored WP policy. To quote from that repository of good sense:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments <b>that have already been published by a reputable publisher</b>...</i></dd>
<dd><i>For an encyclopedia, sources should be unimpeachable. An encyclopedia is not primary source material. Its authors do not conduct interviews or perform original research. Therefore, anything we include should have been published in the records, reportage, research, or studies of other reputable sources...</i></dd>
<dd><i>Subjects which have never been written about in published sources, or which have only been written about in sources of doubtful credibility <b>should not be included in Wikipedia</b>. One of the reasons for this policy is the difficulty of verifying the information.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Not only does this article lack any such sources, no reason is given for us to believe that such sources might be available. It is useful to ask the following questions whenever one contemplates writing a WP article. Has someone written a paper on this subject (ie. in this case, the website "Systemwars.com")? Has it been the focus of a thesis or newspaper or journal or magazine report (even an online one)? Is it the subject of a book or a book chapter? If it is, the source should be provided and the contents of the article should state (only) what is verifiable per that source. But, if there are no sources, the article <i>goes</i>. <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> a receptacle for unverified claims. It is not a collection of weblinks appended to blurbs. It is not the place for original research and claims. It is an <a href="../../../5/p/_/WP%7E5P_c2b8.html" title="WP:5P">encyclopedia</a>.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">enceph</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#666699">alon</font></a> 18:17, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><i>NB</i>. It has sometimes been suggested to me that linking a website which is <i>the subject of the article</i> will suffice for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This represents a profound misunderstanding of WP:V and WP:NOR. The reason that one is required to have independent, reputable sources for WP articles is that these sources represent the primary research and peer review that WP simply cannot do on its own. WP cannot conduct interviews. It cannot perform investigations to determine whether the claims people make on websites are true. It has no body of professional experts to peer-review and endorse its articles. It relies for all this on what is <i>already published</i> by organizations that can do all this. One cannot write the claim "<i>Systemwars.com quickly grew its board to include 1000 members</i>, and provide no source for it except a link to that very website. That would be like me claiming "<i>My pet dog is the smartest dog on earth</i>", and providing a link to my website which says "my pet dog is the smartest dog on earth." Now it may very well be true that the website has 1000 members and that my pet dog really is the smartest dog on earth, but to determine that without independent sources, WP would have to engage in <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>—which we cannot do. That is why we need independent sources, whether we're writing about <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Shakespeare_c1d2.html" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthma</a>, or <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_mechanics.html" title="Quantum mechanics">quantum mechanics</a>.

<ul>
<li>So if I, as a "respected user" and administrator create an article on My Sock Collection, you would judge its notability differently than you would an article on an anonymous user's sock collection? Someone's length of service to Wikipedia should have no bearing whatsoever on judgements of notability, verifiability and encyclopedicity. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 21:21, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have to agree with FCYTravis. The contributor's status has nothing to do with the article in question being 1) currently discussed on VfU 2) a recreation of content deleted by consensus on VfD and 3) not notable in its own right.
