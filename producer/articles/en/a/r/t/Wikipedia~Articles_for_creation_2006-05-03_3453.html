<p>David Bass is a famous firefighter in Brampton. He is known for his heroic attitude, calendar pictures, loud voice and public speaking skills but mostly for his hairstyle. David's Jerry Curled hair is a matter of pride and punishment for David. His hair looks great and has helped boost the sales of the 2006 Brampton Fire Dept. Smokin' calendars. His hair is scrutinized by upper management of the Brampton FD. They claim that due to Jerry Curls extremely flammable chemical compound, that he should abstain from using these products if he is to continue working in firefighting sitautions. Some may argue that David has nothing to worry about because either he or his co-workers would be armed with a charged hoseline and ready to extinguish his hair if it ever caught fire.</p>

<p>TEACH YOUR CHILDREN WELL by Michael Mears 2001(c)</p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday, March 20, 2001 a young American woman sat alone in a cold, dark, damp dungeon awaiting her fate. She has been imprisoned for more than five years and during that time she has suffered physical and mental torture at the hands of her jailers. At her first trial she was convicted of treason based upon allegations that she had associated with the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. Upon her conviction, she was placed in the most notorious prison in South America and was kept in total isolation twenty four hours a day. After almost four years in that hell, she was granted a new trial.Lori will be tried before a panel of three judges, but there will be no jury. She is charged with treason. She did not even know the actual charges against her until February 15, only 35 days before her trial was to begin. Even though her first conviction was set aside and she was granted a new trial, she has been denied any meaningful access to her attorney, friends and family members. During her five years of dehumanizing incarceration, the political establishment that trumped up the charges against her has fallen in disgrace. Some of the prosecutors and judges who initially condemned her to prison are now themselves facing criminal charges. The President of Peru has fled in disgrace and is now facing criminal allegations.</p>
<p>Lori Berenson is the daughter of two professors from New York and she attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her parents and teachers taught her well. Her mother and father, like many other parents from the sixties and seventies instilled in their children a set of values based upon the rights of the poor and disenfranchised. They dreamed of a better world and their daughter took up their dream. Lori Berenson represents, in many ways, the hopes and dreams of her parents= generation for a better world. It is now only the children like Lori Berenson who are left with the energy and vision to carry on the dreams of their parents . Unfortunately for Lori, there has been a terrible price to pay for following her parents= dreams. Lori was first exposed to the poverty and human degradation of rural Latin America when she visited El Salvador with a group of Quaker women in 1988. She became imbued with the dream of making a small difference in the lives of the poor in Latin American. She traveled throughout Peru learning about the culture and meeting many poor Peruvians in November 1994, just two years after Decatur, Georgia established a Sister City relationship with Trujillo. She worked with religious and human rights groups attempting to use her talents and gifts to assist the poor in Lima because she had been taught that democracy is the only protection for the poor and disenfranchised. Today, Lori Berenson, one of America=s children, sits alone with her dreams and visions in a prison in Lima, Peru. Lima is only a short trip down the South American coast from the City of Trujillo, Decatur, Georgia=s Sister City.</p>
<p>Lori Berenson arrived in Peru at about the same time the now disgraced and criminal President of Peru, Alberto Fujimori, was turning the country into a police state and abrogating most of Peru=s laws which provided protection for individual and human rights. At that time, he was applauded for his Alaw and order@ attitude and hailed for bringing@stability@ to his impoverished nation. However, subsequent revelations show that he and his cronies were far more interested in lining their own pockets than helping impoverished Peruvians. Lori Berenson traveled to Peru with all of the idealism and with all of the dreams that a young person can hold. She had been well taught to try to make this a better world. She had been taught to dream about peace, equality, and an end to hunger. She was fed on the dreams of her parents. No doubt her parents listened to the music written and sung by Crosby, Stills and Nash. Music which now seems almost prophetic. They sang about And you, of tender years Can=t know the fears that your elders grew by. And so please help them with your youth, They seek the truth before they can die. Teach your parents well . . . and feed them on your dreams.</p>
<p>She was taught by a whole generation of idealists who followed President Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Where is that generation now? Where are the voices of outrage now that one of our children is in danger of spending the rest of her life in a dungeon because she followed our dreams? Today, Lori Berenson sits and wonders whether or not she dreamed alone. Perhaps, if they are not too busy the members of the Sister City Committee of Decatur, Georgia and Trujillo, Peru should get together to answer that question.</p>

<p>Amplectobelua is a mid-cambrian organism related to Anomalocaris. It differs from its better known relative in several ways. The lateral lobes on its body are wider than Anomalocaris', and the grasping appendages each form a kind of claw, with a large curved spine erupting from the first segment. It is also one of the few Anomalocarids with a tail furcue (2 whip like protrusions at the end of the tail.)</p>

I am very proud of this fund because for people who care about money and want a money tree, i shall make one and the worth of a us dollar will go way down.Please submit any further info on money trees so i can try to make one. I have planted every kind of money in the ground and watered it regularly. Thats how i lost 6 million dollars. For all your money tree entusisists like myself i hope to hear of you and help me discover the long to be found money tree. PLEASE WRITE FURTHER INFORMATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>Viraf Patel – Mr. India 2005</p>
<p><br />
The Grasim Mr. India 2005, Viraf Phiroz Patel, was training to be a Navigational Officer in the merchant navy in which he has sailed for five years till the bright lights beckoned him and in an interesting way. The sailor, model, actor, anchor, DJ, some of the many faces of this Pune (200 kms sw of Mumbai) bred Parsi boy who says he is a mama and papa's boy.</p>
<p>Possessing the panache, the looks, the attitude, it's not a small wonder that he was born for the glam world. A Gemini by birth, Viraf easily comes across as extremely versatile and talented. He has dabbled in photography, theatre, anchoring shows, even worked as a DJ while studying in college. During his onshore visits, one of his friends suggested posing for a portfolio along with her and Viraf saw no harm in giving it a shot. There has been no looking back after that. With total support from his family, Viraf participated in the Grasim Mr India contest ,India’s most prestigious male pagaent. The title win has catapulted Viraf to a different league and his first TV promotion/ commercial was for multinational Nestle's orange juice which was, ironically, for the Pakistan market.</p>
<p>This was just the beginning. He followed it up with a series of ads like the Yamaha G5, Godrej RTF , Bare Denims, Pantaloons, Max Life Insurance with Rahul Dravid, Visa Card with Javed Jaffery and Arshad Warsi, Snickers, LG Viraf is the current face of India’s largest retail brand ‘Pantaloons’ and brand ambassador for the MMX Fashion Studios,Crossroads Mumbai. Viraf has also walked the ramp for bigwigs like Rohit Bal,Arjun Khanna,Manoviraj Khosla, Narendra Kumar, Raghavendra Rathore, Ashish Soni ,Abhishek Gupta. In his first year in the modeling circuit ,he has been nominated as best male model (commercial assignments) at the F awards,considered as the most respected fashion awards in India,conducted by Wizcraft and audited by Pricewaterhouse Coopers.</p>
<p>As for the music videos, he is dancing to the tunes of DJ Suketu "Meri Nazar Hai Tujhpar", a remix of a track from the yesteryear hit "The Burning Train". Viraf has also featured in Shaan’s latest release “tishnagi”.</p>
<p>On the personal front, Mr India is a very family person and loves listening to music, making friends and traveling. Cooking, playing chess, table tennis and cricket, learning photography are a few of his hobbies. To give a sneak preview on his culinary skills, which he picked from his mom and while at sea, Viraf is at home in the kitchen and the gym. He also believes his spiritual inclination helps him to focus and gives him the confidence to achieve great heights and keep evolving into a better human being.</p>
<p>His mantra for life "my attitude will decide my altitude" is what Viraf believes will take him to greater heights.</p>

<p>fixed and posted to wikipedia, nevermind!</p>
<p><br />
Warren K. Moorehead was known in his time as the dean of American archaeology; born in Siena, Italy to missionary parents on March 10, 1866, he died on January 5, 1939.</p>
<p>His mother died when he was quite young, and while his father remarried and became head of a Presbyterian seminary in Xenia, Ohio, travels for keeping that institution open left young Warren and his sister in the care of two aunts, who are recalled vividly in Helen Hooven Santmeyer's non-fictional "Ohio Town" and the novel "...And Ladies of the Club."</p>
<p>Their brother, Moorehead's grandfather, was Joseph Warren King, whose wealth from the King's Powder Mills became both an opportunity and a curse for the fledgeling archaeologist. Digging about in the earth was considered beneath a fine family, and for much of his life Warren King Moorehead was pressured to enter the family business, whose remains are near King's Mills, Ohio, a near ghost town except for the now more famous neighbor called after it, "King's Island," the Cincinnati area amusement park.</p>
<p>Moorehead went to Denison University, near Moorehead family interests in Muskingum County (from which is descended his collateral relation, actress Agnes Moorehead). By 1887 Moorehead had left without a degree, and his relationship with academic archaeology stayed distant and at odds throughout his life, adding to his quick dismissal after his death by most of professional archaeology.</p>
<p>Excavations and collections begun as a schoolboy continued through self-financed work taking him to a display of his own at the 1888 Cincinnati Centennial Exposition, and contact with Dr. Thomas Wilson of the Smithsonian Institution. Dr. Wilson encouraged and possibly helped Moorehead to enter the University of Pennsylvania for study under the famous Dr. Edwin Drinker Cope, but opportunities to lecture and write for publication led Warren away from class work.</p>
<p>A contract to write for a national magazine about the "Ghost Dance" phenomenon on the Pine Ridge Sioux Reservation put Moorehead on the scene for the critical weeks leading up to what is now known as the Wounded Knee Massacre of Dec. 29, 1890. Moorehead was not present, though his camera was used by journalists who were still on the scene to record the horrific aftermath; Gen. Brooke ordered Moorehead off the reservation under armed military escort, according to Moorehead's journal because he was the only reporter present who spoke some of the language and was permitted to stay overnight with the Sioux in their encampments.</p>
<p>After a frustrating period trying to influence legislators to give justice to the Sioux and publish his account of events leading up to the massacre, Moorehead returned to Ohio and found a position developing the state display for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (Chicago World's Fair), which led him to work with Fredrick Ward Putnam, the Harvard professor who began the academic field of archaeology in the United States.</p>
<p>Some of the field work Moorehead did for Putnam resulted in the Hopewell "type site" near Chillicothe, Ohio, setting the parameters for the study of American Indian moundbuilders of the Ohio River valley around 2000 years ago. Work that actually went back to his high school days at Fort Ancient, just up the Little Miami River from his grandfather's King's Mills, also went into the World's Fair display, became a published volume for Moorehead, and caught the attention of the organizers of the Ohio Historical &amp; Archaeological Society (now OHS) just begun in 1885. Efforts to have Fort Ancient purchased and cared for by the state were spurred by Moorehead's publications on that site and other Ohio cultural marvels.</p>
<p>When the 1893 WCE ended, and a hoped for faculty position with the new college on the site (soon to be the University of Chicago) did not work out quickly, Moorehead accepted the position as what would be the first curator of archaeology for the OAHS. With the support of President Orton of The Ohio State University, a museum was established in what is now Orton Hall on the OSU Oval, and Moorehead was made a professor of archaeology at OSU, the only part of his work that was paid. OAHS, with little money from the state and sites already to manage (Fort Ancient, and Serpent Mound which had been purchased by Dr. Putnam with money raised at society teas in Newport, RI, but now a local obligation to manage), encouraged Moorehead to pay for his travel and speaking and research by selling duplicate artifacts. This process would be not only discouraged but is unethical and illegal today; the 1890's found it unremarkable.</p>
<p>With the aunts refusing to release any money for "that dirty work," Moorehead launched into an ambitious plan to create an atlas of Ohio mounds and earthworks, which he saw eroding and destroyed wherever he went across the Midwest, and even in forays into the southwest, becoming one of the first surveyors of Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde. His network of collectors literally saved his life after 1898.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis was nearly always fatal in Moorhead's day, and when he was clearly diagnosed with the disease, a second trip to the desert southwest became part of what turned into a permanent leave from OAHS. (His assistant, William Mills, completed what is now known as the Mills Atlas of 1904, but Moorehead laid out the majority of the material that is in the volume.) Finding no relief in the southwest, he returned to meet with Robert Singleton Peabody in Philadelphia, a wealthy descendant of George Putnam, trader and philanthrophist, who collected pottery and baskets from Indian cultures throughout the New World.</p>
<p>Peabody, seeing how ill Moorhead had become, generously offered a season of treatment at Saranac Lake, New York, the famous tuberculosis sanitarium where just a few years earlier Robert Louis Stevenson had sought relief. The season turned into two years, and from blood loss and anemia Moorehead's wife Evelyn Ludwig (of Circleville, Ohio) and their son Daniel Ludwig were told repeatedly to prepare for Warren's death.</p>
<p>With the dawn of a new century, Warren King Moorehead began almost literally a new life in 1901. He and Evelyn had a second son, Singleton Peabody Moorehead, who would become a key architect with the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and is buried on the grounds of Bruton Parish Church there. With Peabody's influence and money, a museum and program was established at Phillips Andover Academy, with the dedication program including a fellowship from the Peabody-established Victoria Institute and the award of an honorary doctorate from Dartmouth (also a recipient of significant Peabody largesse). As head of the Peabody Institute in Andover, Massachusetts, Moorehead launched into a program of research and publication that went on to include Red Ochre cultures of the Atlantic coast, the Etowah Site in Georgia, and Cahokia Mounds in Illinois.</p>
<p>He was named by Theodore Roosevelt a member of the board of commissioners of the Bureau of Indian Affairs with the Department of Interior, and his work on behalf of Indian Land Claims, exposing fraudulent Indian agents, and seeking better health care on reservations probably made many Washington bureaucrats feel the same way Gen. Brooke did in 1890. After many attempts to remove him and silence the commission, the Depression was used as pretext to dissolve the commission in 1933, after almost 25 years of service by Moorehead.</p>
<p>With many honors and published volumes to his credit, and a thriving and vital field of research and informed speculation well established, Moorehead died in 1939 and was buried near his parents, his grandfather, and his aunts in Xenia; the family home is now the heart of the Greene County Historical Society, where portraits of father William and grandfather Joseph are on prominent display. Little is known there, however, about Warren; their papers include a reminiscence from a contemporary on Moorehead's death calling him, from their childhood together, "a born archaeologist."</p>
<p>High compliment indeed, when at his birth in 1866 the title archaeologist didn't even exist!</p>

<p>Named for the French phrase bon chic, bon genre, a Parisian slang meaning: good style, good attitude, the company is a true combination of European sophistication and American spirit. since its inception in 1989, BCBG Max Azria has been known for its signature collection of women's apparel from Fashion Designer Max Azria. gradually expanding his company, Azria has successfully developed other high-fashion collections for women. from separates, suiting, evening dresses, and denim, to footwear, eyewear, swimwear, and handbags, BCBG Max Azria has become a lifestyle collection that takes today's modern women from day to night, work to weekend. with the introduction of a new plus size line in Fall, 1999, Azria not only expanded his product offering, but also his customer base, catering to a much wider range of women. BCBG Max Azria has also addressed the men's arena offering the company's signature spin on everything from casual looks to suiting to outerwear, and for Spring 1999 will launch a new collection of men's footwear that will work back with the ready-to-wear collection.</p>
<p>One of the keys to BCBG Max Azria's success has been Azria's ability to mix his creative eye with his very keen business sense. as one of today's rare breed of designer-businessmen, Azria used his remarkable intellect to create a new platform in the industry. with the launch of BCBG Max Azria, Azria accomplished a feat that no other designer has been able to achieve: he redefined the designer category by offering a high end designer collection at contemporary price points.</p>

<p>Perpetually pushing the edge of the envelope in business acumen, in 1996 Azria diversified his product categories, and became immersed in the contemporary and junior businesses as well. in addition to the collections under the BCBG Max Azria label, Azria also owns and oversees two additional labels: to the Max, an edgy junior sportswear line; and parallel, a directional women's contemporary line. creating an even broader portfolio of diversified yet complimentary product categories, and marking yet another leap towards fulfilling his lifetime dream of running one of the largest and most versatile fashion houses in the world, Azria officially acquired the French couture design house, Herve Leger, in September, 1998. Herve Leger is a collection of beautiful yet seductive couture and deluxe ready-to-wear designs.</p>
<p>Continuously applying his retail expertise to all aspects of the business, Azria has began developing a retail presence for the parallel and Herve Leger collections. the first parallel boutique was opened in October, 1997 on Robertson boulevard in Beverly hills, while the U.S. flagship Herve Leger boutique, which is the second boutique in the world, opened in march, 1999 in the center of sunset plaza in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, BCBG Max Azria has become one of the most sought after designer collections on the market. with immediate goals to further expand the BCBG Max Azria product categories and to increase retail locations globally, Azria's long term goals involve continuously growing his fashion empire into an international lifestyle brand, and establishing his company as a worldwide powerhouse of style.</p>
<p>The company sells the BCBG women's collection in nearly 100 company-owned stores in North America, Europe, Asia, and South America, and through in-store shops in major department stores. BCBG also boasts men's and plus-size lines, as well as accessories including BCBGirl fragrances. Additional lines include To The Max, Parallel, and Herve Leger. Dresses account for 20% of sales.

<p>Badger Clark was one of the most famous cowboy poets in American History. His poems were very widely published during his lifetime and continue to be published today. His books have never been out of print. He was also published in many magazines. In 1937, he was made the first Poet Laureate of South Dakota. He was born in 1883 to a Methodist minister who had to give up his job because he nearly worked himself to death. Badger’s family moved away and took up homesteading. His father was not a good farmer so he went back to being a reverend in a church in Deadwood. After graduating high school in 1902, he spent a year at Dakota Wesleyan University. After spending a little time in the university, he moved to Cuba with a group of colonizers. Badger was only twenty at this time. The ranch the colonizers had planned out did not work as they had expected. The next thing he knew, Badger found himself in prison for stealing coconuts and carrying a gun. Badger returned to South Dakota but was soon ill with Tuberculosis, a sickness which had claimed the life of his mother and brother. A doctor advised him that he should move to Arizona to help aid in the recovery of his illness. Badger moved to a ranch near Tombstone, here he is known for writing the line “The only men I knew were cowboys”. The cowboys inspired Badger to write poems. He wrote a poem about the cowboys he knew and sent it to his step mother. It was sent to a magazine and Badger received ten dollars for the submission. Badger found himself a good job and said:</p>
<p>"If they'll pay money, good money, for stuff like that, I'm fixed. A job without a boss, without any hours and without any responsibility - it's made for me!"</p>
<p>Having become a successful poet, Badger moved back to the Black Hills and built himself a cabin. There he lived out the rest of his life as a poet, a lecturer, and a teacher of his own experiences.</p>

<p>James Hurst was born in 1922. He grew up in North Carolina, and graduated from North Carolina State College. He also served in World War II. Hurst studied Chemical Engineering, Singing, and Opera. Soon, realizing that Opera wasn't for him, he started a 34-year career in 1951 at a New York Bank. While Working at the bank, he spent his evenings writing short stories. His most famous story, "The Scarlet Ibis" was published in 1960 in the literary magazine <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>. Winning the "Atlantic First" award, the story soon became a classic and is now featured in many school textbooks. The story was also re-published as a part of a children's series in 1988. Hurst now lives in North Carolina, not far from where he grew up from. When asked about the meaning of his story, "The Scarlet Ibis", he responds: "I hesitate to respond, since authors seldom understand what they write. That is why we have critics. I venture to say, however, that it comments on the tenacity and the splendor of the human spirit."</p>

<p>Mayfield Shares is a fairly new site dedicated to old school gaming. Founded by Nexus and Dan (as they are known on their site), Mayfield Shares provides everything you could need to fill your cravings.</p>
<p>It all started off when Dan and Nexus (aKa MD &amp; Co.) decided they needed a place to store things for use at school without using the network drives because they were always being wiped clean. MD &amp; Co. decided to go with a free host that allowed anyone with the username and password to upload their files, mayfieldshares.tk was born. Soon after, things were getting really disorganised. People were not following the layout as it should have been, that idea was scrapped and better things were in mind.</p>
<p>The same host allotted some space and bandwidth for free, the new layout was created and everything started to take shape. MD &amp; Co.'s skills in html and php improved quickly and things got much more organised, better looking, and faster. Later that month, the host began to give them problems, frequently losing contact with the provider, switching servers, down time, you name it. It was time to move on once again.</p>
<p>Now, Mayfield Shares is on a proper host. The layout has been improved yet again. Alot of new content was added, their own <a href="../../../k/a/i/Kaillera.html" title="Kaillera">Kaillera</a> server was created and the forums have been getting active. Last but not least, the phrase "Best roms you can find" was born and still stands on their main page this very day.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know us, Gamer Studio'z is a Christian-based game company established in August, 2005. What do we do? Hmm, we create all kinds of genres of games examples; Christian, Racing, Rpg, Adventure, just about anything else we could do with our current software! All of our creative work originates out of the head office 'think tank' in Brighton, IA. However we do employ freelancers from around the globe to handle everything from graphics to programming to sales &amp; marketing. Company C.E.O., Byron Pringle, remarks "We like things efficient and cozy, that's why we're unlikely to expand beyond a handful of fulltime employees." Gamer Studio'z wants to create games that have more appeal than the latest technology. In regards to computer games, we feel that to stay ahead of the pack using the latest technology very rarely works as by the time you release a game the technology is already old news. That's why we plan to focus our attention on Christian games. With this particular gender of game its not necessary to have the fastest coolest 3D graphics around. This doesn't mean we won't incorporate the latest technology into our games! Computer game development aside, we also design software for other companies and for our selfs, and then we also take time to create other companies websites as well. With that said, we as a company can't lose. No matter how advanced technology gets. We'll just have to see if we have to eat our words in the next 10 years. <a href="http://www.gamerstudiozinc.tk" class="external free" title="http://www.gamerstudiozinc.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamerstudiozinc.tk</a></p>

<p><b>Jetpack UK</b> is a pop-rock band based in <a href="../../../n/a/s/Nashville%2C_Tennessee_0fa5.html" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>. The band members include Sean Williams, who preforms the vocals and guitar, Stephen Jerkins, who plays the guitar and keyboard, David Dewese, who plays the bass, and Brain Fuzzel, who plays the drums. They are with the label <a href="http://heatstrokerecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://heatstrokerecords.com/" rel="nofollow">Heartstroke Records</a>.</p>
<p>Their current EP, <i>The Art of Building a Moat</i>, was released nationwide in April, 2006. They have had three past albums— the <i><a href="../../../s/a/x/Saxophone.html" title="Saxophone">Saxophone</a></i> EP (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>), the self-titled album <i>Jetpack</i> (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>) and the <i>High School Girls</i> EP (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>).</p>
<p>The current name, "Jetpack UK", was originally just "Jetpack" for some time. A Los Angeles <a href="../../../s/u/r/Surf_rock.html" title="Surf rock">surf rocker</a>, who goes by the same name "Jetpack", predated the Tennessee band and asked them to change it. They decided on "Jetpack UK" for their new name, despite being from Nashville, not the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_5ad7.html" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Jetpack UK will be the subject of a children's book titled <i>Inside a Rock Band</i>. The book will be published this summer by Minneapolis book publisher "The Child's World". Aimed at third through fifth graders, it will be a 32-page hardback book. It will follow Jetpack through forming a band, writing lyrics, and playing shows. To promote the book (and their current EP), the band will be traveling to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Library.html" title="Library">libraries</a> around the country.</p>
<p>Jetpack UK opened for <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superdrag.html" title="Superdrag">Superdrag</a>'s final show on Sept. 5, 2003.</p>

<p>Shawna Parker</p>
<p><br />
Shawna was born in Los Angeles California, 1986. Shawna Parker is a converted Christian from being an atheist. After successfully learning the practice of levitation, her spiritual greatness was at its chuck smith point. She is "all that and a bag of fritos." She is too modest to indulge any personal characterisitics but some might say, "she is pretty much amazing." Shawna is often found looking forlorn in the coffe shop where she helps even more forlorn looking Russians. Aliens are not any less human, in her eyes. They are no different, only that they have no citizenbship in any decent country worth memorizing the national anthem over. Today shawna received a couple of roses, but she is waiting for her true prince charming, a member of 98 degrees.</p>

<p>Microsoft created the .NET Compact Framework for one single reason. To develop applications!! The .NET Compact Framework is used to develop applications for smart devices. By smart devices we mean devices that run the Pocket PC 2000, Pocket PC 2002 and Windows CE.NET operating systems. These operating systems are targeted for mobile devices (like PDA, Pocket PC) that have small display areas, small storage areas and run on batteries. Developing applications for devices has never been easier! Earlier, people had to grapple with the eMbedded Visual Tools kit from Microsoft. This toolkit essentially consists of an operating system and development tools (like embedded Visual Basic and embedded Visual C++). Application also had to deal with different programming models and understand and work with the API of the operating system. With the advent of the .NET Compact Framework, Microsoft has unified the programming models between developing applications for PC's and applications for devices. The .NET Compact Framework provides a managed execution environment for applications on devices and makes writing applications extremenly easy.</p>
<p>In this article, we will see how to write a simple .NET Compact Framework application and deploy it onto a device. This article provides a step-by-step instruction on how to write the application.</p>

<p>Getting to Know Ryan</p>
<p>by Anne Acampado</p>
<p>“Breathe, breathe, breathe,” This was what I kept telling myself while en route to the taping location. I was set to do an interview with Ryan Agoncillo who plays Miguel in the nation’s only superserye, Krystala. Miguel is that neighbor that all girls would love to hate but can’t live without. Is Ryan just like Miguel? Does he pick on girls and tease them if he secretly likes them? Is he a good mechanic? Who is Ryan Agoncillo behind the camera? What are his dreams?</p>
<p>These questions were running around in my head by the time I got there. But I was also very concerned about how I would react. You see the prospect of seeing Ryan Agoncillo in the flesh scared me. Only because I might have fainted! :laughs:</p>
<p>I first saw Ryan in a pizza ad and I thought he was cute, but what really made look again were his hosting and verbal skills. I think a person is interesting if he can hold your attention whenever he says something. Ryan was very, very interesting for me. But I was also very curious to find out how he thinks and how he would answer my questions.</p>
<p>Anyway we got there and the first thing I noticed was the waiting!!! There is a lot of waiting happening during tapings. Everyone has to wait for something. The directors have to wait for the staff to finish arranging the lights and the set, the stars had to patiently wait for their next scenes, fans had to wait while everyone did their job…</p>
<p>If there’s one lesson I won’t forget, it’s that tapings are good exercises of patience!</p>
<p>The taping was worth the wait though because I saw the attention the directors put into every scene and detail. Everyone worked without complaint. I was impressed with the discipline of the staff and even with the courteousness extended by the guards there. The cast and crew of Krystala were very gracious in accommodating me. I would like to thank them for that. Sa uulitin po ha?</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As for Ryan, he was a great subject. I remember sitting there talking with him and in the back of my mind, thinking “this is surreal!” Ryan in real life is as witty as he is on TV and I’m glad I survived the interview without looking like a crazed fan, although my heart stopped for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Read on for the excerpts of this interview. Aside from Krystala, Ryan also appears on Breakfast, YSpeak and Review Nights.</p>
<p><br />
Anne: So Ryan this is your first acting job right?</p>
<p>Ryan: My first regular acting job, I tried thrice before. One for Tara Tena. It was an episode with Camille Prats, and again with Camille in Wansapanataym. I did a cameo actually. It was a bit role, then for a month, Whattamen. This is my first time on a soap and a regular gig.</p>
<p>A: So how was it shifting from hosting to acting? You’re more known as a host and a model kasi.</p>
<p>R: I hope! I hope I am.</p>
<p>A: You are.</p>
<p>R: Thank you. Not much of a change, I mean it was a natural progression. When you do ads, you act and as a host you’re on TV. So you know, it had to meet somewhere. Acting was just another thing to do. But of course I wanted to do it when I felt that it was right already. That’s why it took this long. I really had to wait kasi it’s hard to come in as a young guy, kasi I started hosting at 19. Ayokong malito sila, “What is he a host or an actor?” So I had to wait. Now that I’m into hosting for at least five years now, they know that I’m a host who’s trying out acting this time.</p>
<p>A: What made you decide to take the role of Miguel?</p>
<p>R: The role of Miguel is an expanded version of my role in Tara Tena. I played a junkyard owner, the same din, batang kalye, brusko, unruly hair, all dirty. I mean it was something that was offered to me and I’m like why not? Diba it’s easy, it’s as easy as it can get at this level. I mean at least Hindi ako heavy drama, Hindi ako comedy na comedy, you’re pretty much tapping into something that’s really there.</p>
<p><br />
A: Something natural?</p>
<p>R: Right, ang mahirap lang sakin nun was the speech, in the beginning. Kasi iba yung Tagalog ni Miguel, and ako automatically pag nakita ko yung camera, pag nagta-Tagalog ako, it’s Tagalog na pang host. That was one thing I really had to work on. I’ve got a singsong going, diba pag host ka, when you deliver a spiel you have to say it in a way na parang nagkekwento. But my role is kanto boy, very abrupt yung speech, Hindi drawn out yung phrases. So the first few taping days I had to be guided. (He gives us a sample of his speech pattern as a host and as Miguel) It was a cold switch for me eh. Kaninang umaga lang naghohost ako sabay biglang sasalang ako. Speech pattern iba, so I had to go through a workshop for that.</p>
<p>A: Which leads me to what sort of preparation did you have to undergo before taking on the role?</p>
<p>R: Well, dapat sana, it was a whole caboodle of workshops. Kaya lang I only had time to take the speech workshop and pretty much everything filled up from there. Yung role ni Miguel mekaniko siya. And it’s odd because sa race team namin, I’m the mechanically stupidest person, as in I wouldn’t know the difference from an 8 and a 10. All my friends are mechanics so I had to ask them for help. I have to at least look like I know what I’m doing and when I hold the tools I have to know how to. Kasi samin all I do naman is sit around and wait for the race to start. But then everybody else repairs the bike. Yung mga kaibigan ko nga natawa sila na ako yung mekaniko. Kung alam lang nila.</p>
<p>A: What do you think are the similarities between you and Miguel?</p>
<p><br />
R: It’s pretty odd actually. People who really know me say “di ka naman umaarte”, the people who don’t know me say na ibang iba. It’s a role that you have to play to the hilt. The first few taping days, pinapakain nila ako sa scene, kaya lang sabi nila dapat mas maragas pa, so I tried again pero kelangan mas maragas pa raw. So talagang dinadampot ko yung ulam, brusko. I guess it’s an exaggeration of one part of me. Cause I can be very rough, especially around friends and family, so times ten lang yun and the camera picks up on it. Kasi you’re shown on tv, what a maximum of a minute and half? So I had to exaggerate.</p>
<p>A: So tell me, who is Miguel? Describe him to us.</p>

<p>The factual evidence of the origin of one of <a href="../../../c/e/y/Ceylon.html" title="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>’s minority communities, The Ceylon Moors, is very little known. It has been suggested that the expression came into being in much the same manner that the early European historians and writers applied the name, Gentoo, meaning Gentile, to all the inhabitants of Southern India without distinction.</p>
<p>In its present form, the word “Moor” is traced through the Spanish Moro and the Portuguese Mouro, either to the Mauri, the ancient inhabitants of Mauretari, now known as <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morocco.html" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>, or as Tennent, the famous historian of Ceylon suggests, to Maghrib (Morocco).</p>
<p>The Ceylon Moors do not lay any claim to, possible, African origin, just as much as they, rightfully, resent the suggestion that they are of Dravidian (Tamil) extract. It is not that they feel any discredit or insult attached to being classified as <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamils.html" title="Tamils">Tamils</a>, but being of <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab.html" title="Arab">Arab</a> descent, they take a natural pride in tracing their ancestry to a race of people who were, in their day, the pioneers of civilization in the East. More than this, it must be remembered that the Moors of Ceylon are Muslims without exception and being attached to the race to whom Islam was first revealed is certainly a status of great pride and distinction.</p>
<p>The beginnings of Arab settlement in Ceylon appear to be shrouded in oblivion. With the exception of the fragmentary relics of the distant past scattered over a period of many centuries, the story of the present day Moors, who are the descendants off these settlers, has remained unrecorded.</p>
<p>However meager the material available, there is sufficient evidence to show, to the unprejudiced mind, that the Ceylon Moors had their origin from among the Arab traders and settlers of old who traveled across the seas in search of trade and barter during the earliest times of the history of Ceylon.</p>
<p>It has been recorded that the early Arab traders, who visited Ceylon, settled in the coastal belt of Ceylon concentrating mainly in the South Western towns of Puttalam, Beruwela and the Southern ports of Galle, Matara, and even Hambantota.</p>
<p>Although Nevill gives the date of the domination of Kalah (the Southern port of Galle) by the Maharajahs of Zabedj as 100 B.C. O 700 A.D. he adds:</p>
<p>“The truth, however, is that there were Arabs in Ceylon ages before the earliest date in these conjectures.”</p>
<p>The “conjectures” occur in a foot note on page 607 of Tennent’s History of Ceylon and read as follows”</p>
<p>“Mounstuart Elphinstone, on the authority of Agatha cides (as quoted by Diodorus and Photius) says, that from all that appears in that author, we should conclude that two centuries before the Christian Era the trade between India and the ports of Sabaea was entirely in the hands of Arabs.”</p>
<p>Nevill goes on to say: “The whole north-west coast and Jaffna has from the most ancient times been peopled by the Tamils and the Moors, thus accounting for the districts being under the Maharajahs of Zabedj, who extended their empire and ruled the Malay Islands, Kalah and Travancore.”</p>
<p>This establishes beyond doubt the connections of Arabia with Ceylon over two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Sulaiman, an Arab trader and explorer, recounts his visit to Ceylon in 850 A.D. and mentions a pilgrimage to Adam’s Peak. One cannot think of an Arabian, ignorant of the language of the indigenous inhabitants of a country, unlike its people in every respect in regard to habits, customs, diet and observances, undertaking a long and perilous journey into the heart of an unknown country. This surely suggests that the Arabs had been in the country some time already, that they were known to the original inhabitants of Ceylon and wielded influence and were therefore permitted to travel far into the interior in safety and comfort.</p>
<p>Fifty years later, in the year 900 A.D. we hear of another Arab, named Abou Zaid, who supports the stories of Cosmas and Sulaiman and describes the still flourishing port of Kalah (Galle). Zaid’s narrations are based on the experiences of other travelers, one of whom was Ibn Wahab who included “Serendib” in his travels. Wahab like his predecessors made careful observations and collected much information regarding ancient Lanka for he is able to tell us that the Maya Rata or “Pepper Country”, one of the three oldest divisions of Ceylon, was situated between Kalah (Galle) on the coast and the Ruhuna Rata in the South East.</p>
<p>With no devastating wars, no politics and no intrigues, the Moors were able to concentrate their attentions on the accumulation of wealth alone. Meanwhile, the Tamils of the North made an occasional invasion into the territory of the Sinhalese Kings, only to be massacred and driven back later. This state of affairs continued, till in the Thirteenth Century, the Moors were in the zenith of their power. Trade had expanded on every hand and business flourished. Their influence increased proportionately and their Buddhist neighbours were beginning to receive them with cordiality and recognise the avowal and free performance of their religious rites.</p>
<p>The thriftless Sinhalese petty-trader and the improvident garden cultivator were disposed to overlook the Moorman’s sharp, bargain-making proclivities so long as the former realized that there was something to be gained by such forbearance on their part. For one thing, there was always the possibility of obtaining ready money from the Mussalman in an awkward and trying moment; the one against his crop of arecanuts or cinnamon the other in the form of a loan-of course at remunerative interest-when his rice-crop failed. As for the wealthier classes of Sinhalese feudal chiefs of the interior, they were satisfied to receive their supplies of salt from the coast and such luxuries articles of daily use which the Moors imported from abroad.</p>
<p>It was beneficial for both parties to live in peace, and this form of relationship was permitted to continue inndefinitely, since there was no clash of interests, the Sinhalese never having been a sea-faring race. The activities of the latter were confined to the mountain fastnesses, where they hatched their plots and schemed their intrigues. It was the northerners whom the Sinhalese had to prepare against, in the event of an inroad into their preserves in the North-Central Province, whilst the Moor made his profits and battened on the produce of the land.</p>
<p>The Moors of the Fourteenth Century, like their descendants of the present day, never missed the opportunity of driving a shrewd bargain. Where a Sinhalese country yokel still turned over a proposition in his mind, the Moorman saw at a glance, with the traditional instinct of his race, the business possibilities of an offer of any kind. The following historical incident which is related by Johnstone, besides illustrating this trait in their national character, throws some light on an obscure point in regard to the history of that community of the Sinhalese people who belong to the Salagama caste.</p>
<p>Up to the Fourteenth Century, the Sinhalese were not familiar with the art of spinning and the weaving of cloth. Of course, there were the primitive hand-loom and distaff, but the best articles produced locally were inferior in quality and coarse in texture, as insufficient to meet the wants of the whole population. Accordingly, they had to depend on India for their clothing.</p>
<p>Whilst things were in this state, a certain Sinhalese King issued proclamations offering handsome rewards to any person who would go over to India and bring some skilled artisans for the purpose of introducing the art of the manufacture of cloth in to Ceylon. About this time, a Moorman of Beruwella, in the Kalutara District-to the strong hold of the Moors and the Salagama people, respectively,-induced by the tempting offers made the voyage across Palk’s Strait and brought with him a bath of eight weavers of the Salagama caste, from a place call Saliapatanam.</p>
<p>There is a tradition that the eight persons referred to were drugged and bound and taken on board and that they only realised that were being transported to a foreign country when they had been many miles out at sea. It is stated that two of the victims rather than being the subjects of such deception, jumped overboard and were never heard of again.</p>
<p>According to others, these founders of the cloth-making industry in Ceylon were inveigled to the ship on the pretext that there was to have been an excellent opportunity of making a fortune by taking part in a particular game of chance which had been arranged, and that the vessel noiselessly slipped its moorings and sailed away whilst play was in progress.</p>
<p>However the case many have been, the weavers were accorded a cordial welcome upon their arrival in Ceylon. In due course they were presented to the King who treated them with every kindness in order to induce them to commence practising their craft locally. They were at the instance of the Court, married to women of distinction and given houses and lands. A manufactory was established for them in the vicinity of the Royal Palace and the highest honours were conferred on their chief. Amongst other things they were allowed the privilege of travelling in palanquins and were permitted to wear a gold chain on certain occasion.</p>
<p>By such methods as this, the Moors ingratiated themselves into Royal favour. This obtained for them a larger measure of indulgence which they in turn utilized in exercising their power to the fullest within their territory along the sea coast.</p>
<p>Prominent among the Moors of that period was Ibrahim, “the ship captain,” who entertained Batuta and his party at his mansion at Galle. The same historian in his reference to Colombo, which he describes as “one of the largest and finest cities of Serendib” mentions “the Vizier, prince of the sea, named Djalesty” who had about five hundred Abyssinians.”</p>
<p>According to local legend, Djalesty was a petty sultan and had a band of powerful Moors and Africans who were alike valiant tighters on land with the scimitar, as they were pirates and plunderers, familiar with every creek and jungle fastness along the coast of Colombo. It is said that he lived in state, with all the pomp of a minor ruling potentate on an elevated headland overlooking the sea. A place called Rasamunakanda, in Mattkkuliya, in the north of Colombo is pointed out as the spot where he had his little fortress concealed behind the huge trees of the neighbouring hills. From this coign of vantage, the arch-pirate could spy an approaching merchant ship and his band of brigands always would be ready to swoop down in their small craft under cover of darkness and plunder the unsuspecting stranger.</p>
<p>It would appear that Djalesty is the individual referred to by John de Marignolli who was driven to Ceylon by adverse winds in the May of 1350 A.D. Marignolli, however, gives him another name. He states that he met a certain tyrant name Koya Jaan, “a enuch who had the mastery in opposition of the greater part of the kingdom. Marignolli must have been a Roman Catholic. His bitterness against the “accused Saracen” is easily explained, for he makes no secret of it that this sultan “in the politest manner” robbed him of the valuable gifts which he was taking to Europe, to the Pope.</p>
<p>When the early merchant sailors returned home to Arabia with ship-loads of rich merchandise, they undoubtedly spread the news of the productiveness of Ceylon and its natural beauties. The accounts of its wealth and the prospect of amassing fortunes attracted other adventurous spirits and yet other merchants followed in the trail of their sea-faring predecessors. In this manner many of their countrymen came to Ceylon, until in the course of time there was a small colony of Arabs in this country. Amongst those who made Ceylon their home was Hashim and his family who are mentioned by Denham in his census of Ceylon. Hashim arrived some time in the seventh or the ninth century according to this authority. It is said that Hashim was accompanied by his family and although the case is an isolated one, it is proof of the fact that there have been Arab women too in Ceylon at one period.</p>
<p>Denham’s story of this foundation of an Arab colony in Ceylon is supported by Johnstone who states that the Moors first permanently settled in the island in the Eighth Century, that they were of the house of Hashim and that they were driven from Arabia by the tyranny of the Caliph, Abdul Melak Ben Merwen.</p>
<p>The inauguration of a colony in this manner is not without parallel in history. There is a striking similarity between this incident and that of the arrival of the Pilgrim Fathers inn America by the “Mayflower” in December. 1620. Like Hashim the heroes of the “Mayflower” left their home country for reasons of freedom and liberty; the one owing to religious persecution and the other owing to political intolerance, for we are left to infer that Hashim’s political creed was a danger to the tranquility of his country.</p>
<p>Had circumstances permitted the early Moors to continue indefinitely in the position which they held in Ceylon, it is possible that the subsequent history of this country would have been totally different. However, the appearance of Vasco da Gama in the East changed the trend of events completely. In 1498, the Portuguese navigator struck land at Calicut in South India, and this brings us to modern history. European dreams of colonial expansion had begun to materialise and when it had come to the day of navigators of the type of Columbus, Arab sea-power crumbled and disappeared.</p>
<p>The first Western nation to whom the Arabs had to yield pride of place as sailors was the Portuguese. With Arabia’s decline in naval importance, her foreign trade collapsed, and as a natural sequence the business of the local Moorish merchants suffered. Arab vessels ceased to call as frequently as before. Occasionally a fugitive pirate would show its sails on the dim horizon and disappear again in the distance. Those Arabs who had made Ceylon their home, with their children and grand children found themselves cut off from communication with Arabia, but their descendants have retained the religion and observances of their ancestors to the present day with that inward conservation which is a racial habit.</p>
<p>Under the altered circumstances, the less affluent Moors were driven to the land for a living. Many of them, nevertheless, continued to carry on a trade with South Indian ports in cinnamon and arecanuts. For this purpose they had to rely on the small coasting vessels or Champans (boats) and when opportunity offered, musk, cloth and brass were imported by them from the neighbouring continent. In the course of time, the Moors succeeded in establishing a fair trade with the Portuguese and later with the Dutch in regard to whom the Moor was the middleman. Those of them who had not the necessary capital to engage in export trade with India became pedlars and hawkers whilst a few made large profits through the exploitation of the salt pans on the Western and Southern sea-board. For many years afterwards, almost the entire inland trade in salt had been in the hands of the Moors. Just as their ancestors transported their merchandise overland by camel caravan, the local Moor in those days of difficult communication conveyed their salt from the coast to the Sinhalese Capital and other interior towns by means of the Tavalama or pack-bulls.</p>
<p>The Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Aisatic Society, Vol:II, Part II, 1853, describes the Moors of the Chilaw and Puttalam districts as follows:</p>
<p>“They carry on a very extensive trade in rice, salt, indigo, chanks, cheya, etc. and by making advances to the natives for the purpose of repairing their tanks, were the means of keeping the northern part of the island inn a very prosperous condition. They are the most industrious class; they are traders, boutique-keepers, master-fishers, etc. They also deal largely in cattle and are frequent purchasers of Government taxes…They are for the most part confined to the immediate neighborhood of the sea; there are however Moor villages scattered about the interior……”</p>
<p>In reference to the civil rights of the Moors; it would appear that as early as 1804 they had so succeeded in enlisting the sympathy of the Britisher that a resolution was passed on the 5th August, publishing a code of Mohamedan Laws which were observed by the Moors residing in the area known as the Province of Colombo. It will be noticed that whilst the Portuguese and Dutch did everything that was possible to disregard the rights of the subjects of this history and wantonly wound their susceptibilities, the diplomatic Englishman took them under his sheltering protection, with that characteristic solicitude for subject races which distinguishes British rule in the most distant out-posts of Empire. Government’s attitude towards the Moors who were only a minority community even in those days could not have failed to impress the Sinhalese themselves who in thee territory of their own kings were not infrequently made the instruments of arrogant chiefs and intriguing ministers of the Royal Court.</p>
<p>The next outstanding event relative to the Moors of those pioneering days of British colonisation in Ceylon was the incident of 1814. In the November of that year, ten Moorish cloth merchants from the Coast who had gone into the interior for purposes of trade and barter were seized and punished on the orders of the Sinhalese King. They were so horribly mutilated and dismembered, that seven of them died on the spot. The three survivors managed to escape to Colombo, where their blood-curdling tales of the torture inflicted on them provoked the anger of the authorities. The Governor at the time, General Brownigg, considered the treatment meted to the Moors who were British subjects as an acts of aggression, and Major Hook immediately took the field and advanced as far as Hanwella. It is supposed that it was the commencement of hostilities on this occasion really that terminated in the overthrow of the Sinhalese kingdom and the annexation of the Kandyan Country. However, although the brutal massacre of the Moorish merchants is regarded by some as one of the immediate causes of the last Kandyan War, it is well known that there were numerous other contributory factors, the chief of which may be regarded as the long desire of the Britishers to be absolute masters of the whole of Ceylon. The Moors, of course, regarded the injury done to their kinsmen as the primary casus belli, and it is a noteworthy fact that whilst there have been a few petty insurrections on the part of the Sinhalese, since British conquest, the Moors, to the present day have remained loyal to the Union Jack.</p>
<p>It is about this time that Ceylon Moors were for the first time appointed to native ranks. One of the earliest of these was Hadjee off “Velassy” the distinguished, though little known Moor. A more popular individual was Uduman Lebbe Marikar Sheik Abdul Cader, the grandfather of the late I.L.M.Abdul Azeez, who in his day was a prominent member of the Moorish Community. “Sekady Marikar” by which name he was better known was appointed Head Moorman of Colombo by Sir Robert Brownigg, on June 10th, 1818. Several other appointments followed soon afterwards and the Moors were not only made chiefss in different parts of the maritime Provinces, but they were also admitted into the Public Service. The names of some of these with the offices which they held are to be found in the “Ceylon Calendar” of 1824 which was an official publication, published in book form those days. These names are mentioned here as indicating the status of the Moors a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Head Moorman of Colombo, Uduman Lebbe Marikar Sheik Abdul Cader, Interpreter to the agent at Tamankaduwa, Mr. John Downing; Cader Shahib Marikar, Kariaper, or Head Moorman over the Temple at Welasse, Neina Marikar, Head Marikar of the Moormen in the jurisdiction of Tricomalie; Cader Sahib Marikar, Head Moorman under the collector of Galle; Pakir Mohadien Bawa Saya Lebbe Marikar and Samsi Lebbe Ali Assen, Head Moomen of Gindura; Slema Lebbe Samsy Lebbe, Head Moomman of Matara; Sekadi Marikar Sekadi Lebbe Marikar, Head Moorman of Weligama; Kasi Lebbe Sinne Lebbe Marikar, Head Moorman under the Collectors of Chilaw; Omer Marikar Sego Lebbe Marikar, Head Moorman of Puttalam; Neina Lebbe Bawa Marikar, Head Moorman of Kalpentyn; Sinna Tamby, Clerk and Storekeeper to the Deputy Assistant Commissary pF Hambantota; S.A.L.Munsoor Sahiboo, Storekeeper to the Assistant Commissary at Badulla.</p>
<p>In March, 1825, Sir Edward Barnes, Governor of Ceylon, appointed the first Moorish Notary Public, “Sekady Marikar,” “for the purpose of drawing and attesting deeds to be executed by females of the Mussalman religion.” The fact that there was not a single Moorish lawyer in the island in 1825 and that the community is today represented in all the learned professions and has two elected representatives in the Legislative Council, indicates the advancement of this section of the population during the intervening period of a hundred years. Again, it is worthy of note, that the Moors who had not one among their number in 1825 who was capable of holding a brief before even the Minor Courts of Justice, in the year 1904 wielded such influence as to be able to insist on the rights of their lawyers to appear in their Fez-caps before “My Lords.”</p>
<p>The regime of Sir Wlimot Horton, 1831-1837 which is notable for the establishment of the Legislative Council, the running of the “First Mail Coach in Asia,” the abolition of compulsory labour and the publication of the first news paper in Ceylon, also saw the repeal on June 1st, 1832 of the Dutch Resolution in Council of February 3rd, 1747, by which Moors and Tamils were prohibited from owning property or residing within the Fort and Pettah or Colombo.</p>
<p>Up to this time, according to the old order of things, various section of the public had separate residential areas allotted to them. For example, the Moors were, confined to Moor Street which is designated Moors Quarters in old maps of Colombo, the Colombo Chetties lived in Chetty Streett or Chekku Street, as it was also known, the brassfounders in Brassfounder Street, the barbers in Barber Street and silversmiths in Silversmith Street, whilst the “dhobies” lived in an area called Wahermen’s Quarters.”</p>
<p>The removal of these restrictions led to an influx of Moors into the business quarters of the City. Gradually they began to acquire property in the Pettah of Colombo and in the process of time nearly all the immovable property here, which originally belonged to the descendants of the Dutch passed into the hands of the Moors. It is significant that a large proportion of the shops and other buildings in Petttah today belong to this community, whilst all that remains to the descendants of the Hollanders who excluded the Moors from this area, is their ancient Kerkhof behind “Consistery Buildings.”</p>
<p>Having established themselves in business here, the Moors were now able to carry on a flourishing trade without any hindrance whatever, and strangely enough they count amongst their chief patrons, the Burghers who are the descendants of the Dutch. Although all professions and occupations were thrown open to this hitherto oppressed class of people, true to the instincts inherited from their Arab forefathers the Moors largely engaged in trade and amassed fortunes, whilst education suffered. It was in comparatively recent times that the efforts in this direction of the late Mr. A.M.Wapche Marikar, a building contractor; the Muslim Educational Society and the United Assembly were crowned with success. After more than a generation of patient endeavour, the Moors slowly began to realise the extent of the disadvantage encountered on every hand owning to a lack of modern education. The introduction of up-to-date business methods, strongly contrasted with the primitive systems of exchange and barter and it became necessary to be properly equipped in order to meet the competition from other quarters. Other communities were forgoing ahead in the march of progress and the Moors as a community were badly left behind. These considerations led to a wider interest in education, and the more progressive Moors sent their sons to the best schools at the time. Of these the most popular institution seems to have been Wesley College, due perhaps to the proximity of this institution in those days to Moor Street still the stronghold of the Moors. There had been no Muslim Schools at the time, with the exception of the small classroom attached to most mosques where the Muslim youth is instructed in the Koran and receives an elementary knowledge of the reading and writing of the Muslim Zahira College, at Maradana, although it was proclaimed with much gusto, did not for very many years rise above the level of an elementary school. It is only during the last decade that it has mushroom-like sprung into prominence under the energetic direction and untiring zeal in the cause of enlightenment by its present principal, the Hon. Mr. Jaya B.A.,London.</p>
<p>Of those Moors who engaged in trade, a large majority became shopkeepers. Their chief articles of merchandise were cloth, hardware, crockery, household goods and groceries. A few exported areca nut to South India and still continue to do so, and a fewer still became planters and made large profits in the days of “King Coffer” which preceded the tea-growing industry. Several continued to be dealers in precious stones, having gained distinction in this line since Dutch times when they were credited with an export knowledge of pearls and gems. To the present day the leading firms, which deal in jewellery and precious stones are conducted exclusively by the Moors. One of these had even found it necessary in order to provide a nearer depot for its numerous European patrons.</p>

<p><b>Metalgy</b>, is a personal web blog created by <i>Ahmad Khundaqji</i>, still this blog operating since Jan, 2006. In specific means it handles the concept of <b>Versus the world</b> which means according to the principle; the perfect isolation of ideas away from each other, and to get back each but with different balances and equivalents, each one of them represents the counter part of other, so that the main world is still under stress and work till a better balance could be found for it…</p>
<p>The name “metalgy”, is in fact an exact transformation of the Arabic word that came originally from the “Metal” that is related to Metal music… appended with “gy” to mean the person who has that property – being a person that pays to much attention to metal music … metalgy may be equivalent to a word in English “Metalist” or something like that!</p>

<dd>Removed entire text, which was over <b>110 pages</b> long, to make maintaining this project page less burdensome (it was <b>595 kilobytes</b> long before I edited it). Sorry, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a free web host. You obviously know much about Final Fantasy, and have a talent for writing, but Wikipedia is not the place to post this kind of thing. Have you tried a games-specific forum such as GameFAQs? Or you could submit this into a games-related magazine, or maybe even publish it as a book. It's certainly long enough. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:08, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Ismar Alabedi - Chess player, Grand Master since 1906, deceased, murdered by Ivan Sokolov et al, in 1987, when Ismar face raped Ivan during a chess match, shortly after he buggered him</p>
<p>During a particularly militant era in Bosnian history, a young prodigial chessplayer named Ismar Al-Abedi, born in 1888, became something of a celebrity in his home country, and his meteoric rise to chess infamy was seemingly capped by his recognition as a Grandmaster in 1906, at the age of only 18. However, in the following years, the secretive and quietly depraved young genius descended into a bitter battle with longtime rival Ivan Sokolov. As Ismar fell into insurmountable debts to various gangs, including the dangerous Al-Nuzrkoch (Fistheads), to support a rapidly increasing drug problem, he reached a new low. By enlisting the help of two other Bosnian gangs, Sokolov arranged to have Al-Abedi attacked at his home in Sarajevo. The then 32 year old was badly beaten, and his fiance raped repeatedly. Rumours abound over whether at that point, Al-Abedi himself was sexually abused by his captors, but non are substantial. Al-Abedi became further embroiled in gang dealings, and disappeared for 21 years, between 1925 and 1956, before returning at the age of 68 and becoming the legal owner of a casino in Livno named the Rio Delte. The casino enjoyed reasonable success for the next 27 years, until a major sting operation in 1983, which exposed the gang ties in the casino and the on-premises abuse of hundreds of prostitutes. The courts failed to convict Al-Abedi, although many of the other gang members running Rio Delte were imprisoned for life. Despite escaping a custodial sentence, Al-Abedi became bankrupt, and once again dependent on the Al-Nuzroch for money. At the age of 96 he made an open challenge to Sokolov to one final chess game. Despite the ancient Sokolov being eager to accept, the legal situation became so entangled, the match was delayed for 2 and a half years, until it was eventually organized for the 11th of January, 1987. The event was much publicized and both Grandmasters arrived the day before the match at a fixed location in Sarajevo. Then, 18 minutes into the match, an aide of Al-Abedi's walked over to him and whispered something to him. Sokolov was outraged at this, claiming that the game "must be fixed", and that he "never seen such a disgrace to the game of chess". Then, another attendant stepped in and struck the elderly Sokolov in the back, causing him to fall. Evidently Sokolov had assumed the Al-Abedi had not traced the attack on his home back to him, but after 67 years, Al-Abedi was to have his revenge. The chessmatch was a set-up by the gang for this next event. The ancient gangbanger proceeded to rape his victim orally and anally live in local television, although the transmission was quickly terminated. Having finished with his victim, Al-Abedi made to leave the room, but the crafty Sokolov was finally left alone long enough to access a gun strapped to his leg. He shot Al-Abedi four times before he was killed by the gang. Al-Abedi was rushed to hospital but pronounced Dead on Arrival. His only living relatives currently reside in Manchester, UK, including his nephew, born exactly one year after his uncle's death, and named after him.</p>

<p>The first version of clanweb, then known as CAT, was created sometime during 2003 by Michael Winberg. But it wasent before late in 2003 that the development became serious when he established it as an senior high school project. The task was to solve problems that clans might encounter when creating a site or expanding their current activity online. The first step doing this was to offer clans a complete admin solution that would give them a push in the right direction. Helping them to create a fully dynamic site that would be easy to manage, presenting the information required with just a few clicks. The second step in this procedure was to offer this solution free of charge.</p>
<p>The first version, 1.0.0, only contained a login script, news script, match script and member script that had been combined and released in one package.</p>
<p>The up following version contained small updates until 1.1.0 that added support for various languages. (This support has been removed in latest version).</p>
<p>The by far most downloaded version series of all version created has been the 1.3.x serie. The 1.3.x line added support for things like <a href="../../../w/y/s/WYSIWYG_fcf0.html" title="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>, using the popular editor <a href="../../../f/c/k/FCKeditor_9c5d.html" title="FCKeditor">FCKeditor</a>, uploading of images and better member management.</p>
<p>ClanWeb 1.4.x, was begun around September, 2005 code named Orion. 90% of the new version was developed from scratch. The developer had some help with the planning from John "Fiyah" Lewis that designed the frontend and backend of the new version. The first version in the 1.4.x series was released on April 23, 2006 just to be followed up nine days later with 1.4.1.</p>

<p>From its headquarters in the city of Garopaba (Santa Catarina State), Mormaii exports products to many countries and continuously expands its performance in the sports clothing and accessories market. The Mormaii brand is characterized by a successful trajectory based on the union between a modern enterprise infrastructure and creativity since Doctor Marco Aurélio Raymundo started to sew neoprene in the garage of his house, at the beginning of the 70's. Since those days, the brand has never stopped growing. More than 6,000m² of modern facilities have been built at the entrance of Garopaba City, latest generation equipment has been acquired and designed and a dynamic operational infrastructure has been developed which has enabled the company to successfully face the competition from international manufacturers. With an average growth of over 40% in the last 4 years, Mormaii has become the biggest Brazilian manufacturer of wetsuits, clothing and products related to the water sports world. In this great mix, the wetsuits stand out thanks to a pioneering work of almost 30 years. It's a Brazilian brand gaining recognition continuously, and even winning prizes to the country such as "the best wetsuit of the planet" by the English magazine Wavelength and the classification of the Mormaii eyeglasses models in the Trend Forum of Silmo, in France. With more than 150 employees at the Garopaba plant and hundreds more integrating a network of 25 franchised stores and 37 licensed manufacturers in many parts of the planet, Mormaii is today the main brand of neoprene wetsuits for surfing and water sports in Brazil . We take pride in showing this determination and representing Brazil . We have a life philosophy of peace and integration of man and nature and associated companies which share our dream. You are part of this dream.</p>

<p>David Worrell is a right sided defender that currently plays for English league 1 side Rotherham United. Worrell was part of the side that got relegated from the English championship in the 2004-2005 season and his previous club was plymouth argyle who more than likely passed out with laughter after realising someone actually wanted to buy this muppett</p>
<p>Never before had the world gazed upon a defender of such huge ineptitude as mr worrell. He is currently anything but a crowd favourite at millmoor and the entire town will not be happy unless he leaves in the summer</p>
<p>It was also rumoured that david worrell sacrifices small goat to his overload and lives in a cave</p>

The Battle of Hudson's Bay (also known as "The Battle of the Bay") was a naval battle fought during the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_of_the_Grand_Alliance_245f.html" title="War of the Grand Alliance">War of the Grand Alliance</a> (known in the North American colonies as "King William's War"). The battle took place on September 5, 1697, when a French warship commanded by Captain Pierre Le Moyne D'Iberville defeated an English squadron commanded by Captain John Fletcher. As a result of this battle, the French took York Factory, a trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company.</p>
<p>D'Iberville's flagship, the <i>Pelican</i> (44-guns), was part of a larger French squadron dispatched to contest English control of Hudson's Bay. Before the battle, the <i>Pelican</i> became separated from the rest of the French squadron in heavy fog, but D'Iberville elected to forge ahead. This set the stage for a little-known but spectacular single-ship action against heavy odds.</p>
<p>As the <i>Pelican</i> sailed south into clearer weather, she approached the trading post of York Factory, and a group of soldiers went ashore to scout out the fort. Captain D'Iberville remained on board the <i>Pelican</i>. While the shore party was scouting the fort, D'Iberville saw the sails and masts of approaching ships. Thinking the rest of his squadron had arrived, he set off to meet them. In short order, D'Iberville realized that the ships were not French, but were, instead, an English squadron comprised of the warship <i>Hampshire</i> (56 guns) and two armed merchantmen, the <i>Dering</i> (36 guns) and the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> (32 guns).</p>
<p>D'Iberville, his shore party out of reach, elected to give battle. The battle began as a running fight, but after two and a half hours, D'Iberville closed with the English and a brutal broadside-to-broadside engagement took place between the <i>Pelican</i> and the <i>Hampshire</i>. The English seemed to be gaining the upper hand with blood running from the scuppers of the <i>Pelican</i> into the water. Captain Fletcher demanded that D'Iberville surrender, but D'Iberville refused. Fletcher is reported to have raised a glass of wine to toast D'Iberville's bravery when the next broadside from the <i>Pelican</i> detonated the <i>Hampshire's</i> powder magazine. The <i>Hampshire</i> exploded and sank taking most (if not all ) of its crew with it.</p>
<p>The <i>Hudson's Bay</i> and the <i>Dering</i> seem to have played a supporting role in the final stage of the engagement, because the <i>Hudson's Bay</i> was damaged and struck its colors to <i>Pelican</i> after the <i>Hampshire</i> blew up. <i>Dering</i> broke off the engagement and fled, but the <i>Pelican</i> was too badly damaged to pursue.</p>
<p>The <i>Pelican</i> was also fatally damaged in the battle. Holed below the waterline, the <i>Pelican</i> had to be abandoned, but the arrival of the remainder of the French squadron shortly thereafter led to the surrender of York Factory on September 13, 1697, and the continuation of D'Iberville's remarkable career.</p>

<p>Pastor Shawn Boonstra, a native of British Columbia, is speaker/director for It Is Written International Television. Pastor Boonstra made the decision to commit his life to gospel ministry after attending an It Is Written evangelistic series in the city of Victoria 12 years ago. Soon after, he graduated with a degree in political science from the University of Victoria, and later attended Andrews University, where he gained theological training.</p>
<p>Before moving to the It Is Written international headquarters in 2004, where he served as associate speaker for a year, Pastor Boonstra was associate speaker for the It Is Written telecast in Canada from 1998-2001, then served as speaker from 2001-2003. In 2001, he and Pastor Henry Feyerabend held a special “NET” satellite evangelistic series in downtown Halifax called “Revelation Speaks Peace.” More than 1,200 churches downlinked each of his nightly programs.</p>
<p>Since coming to the It Is Written headquarters, Boonstra has conducted meetings in places like Peru, Denver, Phoenix, the Far East and more. In the fall of 2005, he held a 5-night event on the Second Coming called “The Appearing” (www.theappearing.com). This satellite series received national attention and at least 1,300 churches participated in the meetings.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Pastor Boonstra has held 25 major evangelistic series and written 11 books. His clear grasp of Scripture and his warm, dynamic presentation style have been an inspiration to many.</p>

<p>The story of North Carolina's Reed Gold Mine reveals the amazing accidents, drama, and ironies of history that, with variations, occurred in connection with gold rushes around the world. It is the story of an illiterate Hessian mercenary from Germany—an illegal immigrant—who deserted from the British army in Savannah and made his way to backwoods North Carolina, where he settled near Meadow Creek in Mecklenburg County, married, and raised a family. It is the saga of a twelve-year-old boy who went fishing one Sunday and found a seventeen-pound rock that served as a convenient doorstop for three years before being sold to a merchant for a mere $3.50, although it was gold worth a thousand times that modest sum. It is the account of an impoverished slave who found a twenty-eight-pound nugget of gold in a creek while doing part-time mining for his owner. It is the report of a rich mine that was closed for a decade while its owners argued over a hunk of gold in legal battles that reached the state supreme court. It is the topsy-turvy tale of a mine whose last original family owner went broke and sold the property at auction, only to see it resold ten months later for an 800 percent jump in price. It is the narrative of a mining company that, despite tens of thousands of dollars and the latest technology, equipment, and management, failed within a year. It is the legend of a woman murdered by a family member and shoved down a mine shaft. It is the tale of a mine only twenty miles from Charlotte abandoned and kept for a private hunting retreat for seventy years, only to wind up preserved as a state historic site.</p>
<p>The Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County, site in 1799 of the first authenticated discovery of gold in the United States, held out the initial golden promise to the people of the Piedmont and the nation. In beginning such a story it is imperative, of course, to introduce John Reed, the fortunate fellow who owned the mine. Unhappily, because there are no known Reed manuscripts, many questions about his life and his mine remain unanswered. The very spelling of the apparently illiterate man's name may be questioned. Since he was born in Germany, John Reed must have Anglicized his original name, which probably was Johannes Ried, Riedt, or Rieth. Many German surnames in Piedmont North Carolina received American equivalents either by transferring the sound or meaning of the word to English. As "Reed" meets both of these criteria when compared with Ried, and several of his sons signed their names in that manner, the spelling seems to have been a logical choice. Equally imprecise until recently have been the date and place of John Reed's birth. He was born in 1757, 1758, or 1759 in the province of Hessen-Cassel. These uncertainties about the place and time of Reed's birth and his German heritage remained an enigma until the 1990s, when Mark A. Schwalm, a Hessian descendant and genealogist, completed the most thorough analysis of the questions.</p>
<p>In 1799 the course of Reed's life and a portion of the history of his adopted homeland was turned about by the accidental discovery of gold on his property. The most authentic accounts of the find come from some of Reed's relatives about half a century after the occasion. One Sunday—supposedly in the spring—twelve-year-old Conrad Reed, son of John, chose to go fishing with several siblings in Little Meadow Creek on the family farm rather that attend church with his parents. While busy alongside the creek he saw "a yellow substance shining in the water." Wading in to retrieve the object, he discovered it to be some kind of metal. The wedge-shaped rock was about the size of a small smoothing iron, or flatiron. Its weight was later said to be approximately seventeen pounds.</p>
<p>Conrad subsequently showed the yellow rock to his father, but John Reed, unable to identify it, set the heavy stone aside as a useful doorstop and continued life as usual. For some time this valuable doorstop served unnoticed in its utilitarian role. On only a single recorded occasion during the next three years did Reed pay any particular attention to it. At some point he took the hunk of ore to William Atkinson, supposedly a silversmith in Concord, for identification. The latter proved to be a silversmith unable to recognize raw gold and could not identify the rock.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Reed in 1802 found a person who knew the metal at once. A jeweler in Fayetteville, whom Reed visited on an annual marketing trip to that town, told Reed that the metal was gold and asked that the nugget be left for fluxing; when Reed returned, the artisan showed him a bar of gold six to eight inches long. It may be difficult to believe that Reed had no conception of gold as a precious item, but when the craftsman offered to buy the nugget, Reed asked what he felt to be a "big price"-$3.50. The merchant, whose name is now unknown, gladly paid him and received roughly $3,600 worth of gold.</p>
<p>It was not long before Reed (perhaps with the aid of James Love or others) discovered his errors and supposedly recovered about a thousand dollars from the jeweler. Reed and his family soon began searching in Little Meadow Creek for other valuable rocks. The chief hunts occurred in the summer, when farming did not require much labor and the creek was dry. Perhaps uneasy with his sudden wealth, Reed early turned a profit and in 1803 expanded his operation by taking three friends of relative substance—his brother-in-law Frederick Kiser, Reverend Love, and wealthy landowner Martin Phifer Jr.—into partnership. After the crops were put into the ground and the stream on Reed's land had nearly dried up in late summer, each of the three other men supplied equipment and two slaves to dig for gold in the creek bed. The four associates planned an equal division of returns. They were not disappointed, as Peter, one of the slaves owned by Love, unearthed from merely six inches below the bottom of Little Meadow Creek (near a deep spot called the "lake") a twenty-eight-pound nugget worth more than sixty-six hundred dollars before the end of the season. One story was that Love offered Peter a walnut-sized knob off the nugget before it was fluxed, but Peter—fearful of a jest at his expense—refused to risk damage to his dinner fork by trying to pry off the piece.</p>
<p>The gold later enabled intelligent but uneducated Reed to become a man of significant wealth over the years, and he invested in land and slaves but otherwise apparently lived modestly. In the sixty or so years he resided in the area, he engaged in about two dozen documented land transactions (including some intended to defend or enhance his mining sites) in Cabarrus County alone. Reed bought some two thousand acres of land there and retained nearly half of it until his death. He also became part of the unfortunate southern habit of slaveholding, purchasing three African Americans—Dinah, Charity, and Sam—in 1804. Reed ultimately may have owned more than a dozen additional blacks. Thirteen unmarked stones, which may mark slave graves, have survived in the family cemetery. Each of Reed's three partners owned more than a dozen enslaved Americans in his lifetime, and each of the four men attained or approached the level of affluence of the one in fifty Piedmont slaveowners who owned twenty or more slaves in 1860. At that time only about a fourth of white families in the state owned any slaves at all.</p>

<p>The Undergraduate Mock Trial Association (UMTA) serves the University of Texas' undergraduate pre-law community. Each year, current student/participants hold 'try-outs' for new members. Around September, the two teams are formed and begin competition with the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA).</p>
<p>The first round of competitions, or the 'invitational season' begins in the fall semester. In the past few years, Texas' teams have attended tournaments at Middle Tennessee State University, the University of Iowa, and the University of Virginia.</p>
<p>In December of each year, the teams (usually two teams of six to eight competitiors) 'stack'-- that is, they change team composition to create an 'A' team, or a team most likely to win the national championship.</p>
<p>The re-formed teams then enter into the 'post-season', usually beginning with a warm-up tournament at Loras College (which the University of Texas has won the past two years in a row, in 2005 and 2006) in January. The season continues with a Regional tournament and (based on regional finish) either a trip to a National tournament (called 'silver flight' tournament) or to the National Championship tourmanet. The National Championship tournament, the final post-season tournament, determines the team's national ranking among all undergraduate mock trial teams.</p>
<p>In 2005, Texas top team, designated team 513, earned a bid straight to the National Championship tournament. The B team, designated team 512, earned a bid to the Silver Flight tournament in St. Petersburg, Florida. The top three teams from the Silver Flight tournament earn bids to the National Championship and, placing 3rd, Texas 512 earned such a bid. At the National Championship, Texas earned three all-American awards: Tom Jacob, team 513, earned an All-American Attorney designation. From team 512, John Paul Cedillo and Ruchit Shah earned All-American witness designations. Shah earned the additional honor of being top witness in the nation.</p>
<p>This year, for the 2006 season, Texas 513 was the only Texas team to earn a post-Regionals bid, again to St. Petersburg, Florida for Silver Flight. This year, however, they earned 1st place in their division, as well as first place over-all. At the National Championship tournament, this Texas team ranked 9th place.</p>

<p>201.25.36.43 23:10, 2 May 2006 (UTC)Since a long time ago, salt has been used to preserve and bake food. A lot of early roads were created to transport salt. Salt was used to pay taxes. Salt was so precious that it had the same value as gold. In ancient China, coins were made of salt. Salt cakes were used as money in early Mediterranean regions. Ancient cities such as Genoa, Pisa, and Venice became salt market centers. By the fifteenth century, salt was collected by springs, by boiling the water, and many towns and cities in Europe were located near such springs. During the eighteenth century, the speed of the boiling process was quickened by using coal instead of wood as fuel. England became the leading salt producer in the world, because of its coal supply. The U.S started collecting sea water after the revolutionary war. Salt springs were discovered in New York, near where the city of Syracuse is today. By the early nineteenth century, technology was developed to improve the collection.</p>

<p><b>B.R.E. stands for Boss Reign Entertainment and is a record label that is underground with up and coming rap artists that each have their own way of rapping but also can catch your attention when you listen to them. B.R.E. resides in Texarkana, Texas and has very few members, but then again it has just been created. The rap artists consist of Big Joe, Zac The Rippa, and BCB (Big Chinese Boy) and each of them rap about different subjects that everyone can relate to. Big Joe raps similar to Chamillionaire, Lil Keke, and Eazy E, Zac The Rippa raps similar to Eminem, 50 Cent, and The Game, and BCB well you just have to listen for yourself because he is very original with his flow. Keep in mind that B.R.E. is a record label and is just coming off the ground but there is much to be expected from this record label in the future because future members are yet to come. Big Joe, the founder of B.R.E., has also place his self in the record label. Also Big Joe is close friends with Zac Tha Rippa and they have known each other since first grade. BCB was added in early 2006 and he resides in Houston, Texas. Big Joe Plans to one day get his record label to be one of the worlds's best record labels and plans to build the B.R.E. headquarters in Texarkana,Texas. If he never completes his objective, he plans to go to go through college and become a producer and then take on his original dream again. Big Joe says, "Ever since I can remember I've always gotten what I've wanted if I really really really wanted it I would get it. So I hope that my luck doesn't run out on me now!" The three young artists in B.R.E. plan to drop a mixtape in the streets before 2007 entitled "We know yall hate us" and they plan on it to be a big hit.</b></p>

Luke Bunworth is a cool guy. He is very wealthy.

<p>together with his aboriginal friend Wylie, was the first man to cross southern Australia from east to west, travelling across the Nullarbor Plain from Adelaide to Albany. Eyre was born in England where his father was a minister. He came to Australia when he was seventeen years old. He conducted many small expeditions in New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, combining droving sheep and cattle with exploring. Eyre was hoping to discover good sheep country. He opened up much of South Australia for settlement. Eyre wanted to open up a route to the centre of Australia. In 1839, he set off to reach the centre. Lake Torrens was covered with salty mud. His way was blocked by swamps in one direction and by sand hills in another, so he followed the Flinders Ranges to Mount Hopeless, where he turned back. Meanwhile, back in Adelaide, plans were being made to form an expedition to open up a route between South Australia and Western Australia. They were hoping to find good land and to open up a route to take cattle overland from Adelaide to Western Australia. Because of his skills in the bush, Eyre was made the leader the expedition. He volunteered to lead it and pay half the costs. In 1840, he set out from Adelaide. The party was made up of 6 white men, including Baxter, his station manager, an aboriginal friend called Wylie and 2 other aborigines. They took with them 13 horses, 40 sheep and supplies to last them 3 months. They planned to be met at Spencer Gulf by a government ship with more supplies. Eyre travelled westward across what is now known as Eyre Peninsula and along the coast. The harsh conditions and lack of water forced him to send all of the members of his party back to Adelaide, except for Baxter, Wylie and 2 other aborigines. Eyre thought that a smaller party would have more chance of success. The 4 men left Fowler's Bay with 11 pack horses and 6 sheep. They would have to travel 1 300 kilometres through harsh desolate country. Because the Nullarbor Plain had no trees, there was no shade from the fierce heat of the sun. There was little water and very few ways to reach the sea because of the huge cliffs. By the time the expedition reached the top of the Great Australian Bight, they were desperately short of water and were saved by friendly aborigines who showed Eyre how to find water by digging behind the sand dunes on the shore. For five days they travelled, but were unable to find any water. They travelled along the Great Australian Bight, suffering terrible hardship. To the north of them lay the Nullarbor Plain. Eyre was the first man to cross this plain. Water was becoming very scarce when they came upon some wells dug by the aborigines at the present site of Eucla on the border of South Australia and Western Australia. They stayed here for 6 days. After resting for 6 days, they travelled on, keeping close to the beach. Water once again became scarce and the aborigines showed them how to break off the roots of gumtrees and suck them to relieve their thirst. The pack horses found it difficult travelling through the sand and so Eyre was forced to leave behind their firearms, horseshoes, spare water bags and even clothing. One by one the packhorses had to be left behind. Soon their water was finished. The party used sponges to collect early morning dew from leaves. Food was becoming scarce and so they killed a sick horse for food. It made Eyre and Baxter very ill. The aborigines tried to go on alone, but returned a couple of days later almost starving. They were now about halfway to the West Australian coast. It was winter and because they had been forced to leave their clothes behind, they suffered from the cold at night. It was around this time that 2 of the aborigines started to cause trouble, refusing to work. One night while Eyre was keeping watch he heard a gun blast and found Wylie running towards him in alarm. Two of the aborigines had murdered Baxter and had disappeared with most of the supplies and firearms. Wylie, however, refused to go with them and stayed with Eyre. They were now feeling desperate. Eyre had seen no water for three days and ahead lay almost 1000 kilometres of unknown barren country. The aborigines, now armed, had taken most of their supplies. Eyre could not even bury Baxter as the ground was solid rock, so he wrapped him in a blanket and left him. Eyre and Wylie trudged on and it was seven days before they found a native waterhole. They survived by killing and eating kangaroos. Wylie even ate a dead penguin he found on the shore. For over a month, Eyre and Wylie continued to walk to Western Australia. In June 1841, they came upon a French whaling ship anchored off the coast and were able to rest for a fortnight. The captain, an Englishman, named Rossiter provided them with food and even some wine and brandy. After resting for two weeks, they were now both fit and strong, well clothed and had plenty of food. The journey became much easier. In July, they reached Albany, after travelling through heavy rains and cold weather. Their journey had lasted four and a half months. Eyre was awarded a gold medal of the Royal Geographic Society for this incredible journey. Despite his hardship, Eyre lived to be 86. In 1846, he was made Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand. He was also made governor in various parts of the West Indies. Eyre retired to England, where he lived until his death in 1901. Wylie was rewarded with a pension, and he remained in Albany, happy to be among his own people once again.</p>

<p>The French Connection was a famous husband/wife aerobatic team that performed in countless airshows in North America. The team consisted of Daniel Heligoin, a former French Air Force fighter pilot, and Montaine Mallet, his assistant that later became his wife. Both Daniel and Montaine were French-born, they came to the U.S. in 1973 to promote and sell their aerobatic plane, the CAP-10, manufactured by Avions Mudry in France. They performed mostly in airshows the U.S. and Canada until their tragic death, in a training accident in 2000. Their favorite and signature aerobatic routine was unique: Montaine and Daniel would fly their CAP-10 (or later CAP-20) planes in an extremely tight belly-to-belly formation, literally inches apart, through various hair-raising aerobatic maneuvers. Daniel and Montaine loved to teach and they devoted much of their careers to aerobatic instuction.</p>
