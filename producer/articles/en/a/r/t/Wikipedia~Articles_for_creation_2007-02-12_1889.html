[<b>The SCP</b>] is a 12 year old boffer/live combat orientated group based out of Kent, Washington. It was founded by Justin Gilmore in 1995, the group has been dedicated to the fighting aspect of Live Action Role-play ever since. Originally fighting in parks or in small fields behind apartments with friend, Justin found more and more people wanted to fight, and decided to officially found a group. After the first season of play, the group had just over twenty members and by the end of the third the group had blown up to near seventy five. Today the founding Kingdom of <a href="http://www.smartpeoplefactory.com/scp" class="external text" title="http://www.smartpeoplefactory.com/scp" rel="nofollow">Earth Haven</a> boasts an average weekly player base of ninety to one hundred players. The SCP has expanded with two new Kingdoms found in Eugene (<a href="http://apostlenation.bravehost.com/" class="external text" title="http://apostlenation.bravehost.com/" rel="nofollow">New Avalon</a>) and Salem (<a href="http://sabregurl.googlepages.com/" class="external text" title="http://sabregurl.googlepages.com/" rel="nofollow">Strifeland</a>), Oregon. These two Kingdoms were founded by members who moved away from the Kent area, but wished to keep enjoying the fun of the game. While these two Kingdoms are still growing, they show that The SCP is beginning to come into its own.</p>
<p>The SCP's abbreviated name once stood for Shadow Clan Players at one point and at another it stood of Swordfighting Character Productions. These days the player's have decided that the name no longer stands for anything; it's just the name of the group that has given them a safe place to have fun.</p>
<p>While most groups have developed in-depth systems with races, classes and armor. The SCP has stuck to a more simple approach to keep the game easily understandable, and open to a broader age range of players (player can start participating at thirteen years old). Another rare aspect to The SCP is that they are a free to play game; there is no membership fee or dress code. The focus is to keep the game open to all those who wish to participate; having fees and dress codes simply eliminates younger players who can't afford it.</p>
<p>The SCP World has little back-story, except that which was developed by players. Much of its history will be remembered as legend and myth as was done with our real world's history. The group also allows players to choose races they have seen in books, movies or other sources; this allows players to develop more unique characters. There are a few awards or honors within The SCP, most are achieved through combat. The most notable of all is Kingdom Champion, which is awarded to the player who wins their Kingdom's Tournament. These tournaments generally take up a full day, with as many as seventy-two or more players participating. Some of the other titles that players can take on are: King, Lord, Knight, Champion and Magistrate.</p>
<p>Within The SCP there are seven notable Knighthoods. The Knights of Earth Haven, the Dark Knight Order, the Dragon Knight Order, Order of the Tear, the Fallen Knights, Daughters of Aegis and the Exalted Knights of New Avalon. Each has a unique Code of Conduct and training regime, as well as out looks on battle and each other. It is up to each Knighthood as to how a player can join their Order; most require a player to have been an active member of The SCP for at least one full season.</p>

<p>The Secrets of Penny EbaY Auctions</p>
<p>WEBMASTERS LOOKING TO GENERATE TRAFFIC- BE SURE TO READ TOWARDS THE END OF THIS E-BOOK FOR GETTING THOUSANDS AND POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF PAGE VIEWS, NOT JUST HITS BUT PAGE VIEWS! Everyone wants to buy an e-book for 1 penny with free shipping so that they can build up their feedback score and spend very little money doing it. Feedback is the way a buyer knows you are legit, the higher the better! Sellers on the other hand lose money when they list and sell an e-book for .01 with free shipping but they do gain the very important high feedback they need. EbaY seller have found a way to get around the high costs of building feedback. 1. If you are selling a buy it now item for .01, ebaY will not let you list a quantity of more than one item. You have to have a minimum of .99 cents to use buy it now with a quantity of more than one. This is a problem because every item you list costs a minimum of .30 to list. You could list 100 buy it now items at one cent each, but after they are all sold you owe ebaY $100.00 or more. Are 100 feedback points worth $100.00? Not to mention the time it takes to list 100 auctions? NO! There is a way around this.... Get an ebaY store! 2. If you list an item in an ebaY store you can have multiple quantities of a .01 Buy it now item! And you are only charged a one time listing fee (Listing fees vary depending on your options chosen. I use gallery, subtitles and other options that brought you here. It was only $0.03 total to put in the ebaY store) you are charged far less per every item that sells. In this case, looking at my fees it only costs $0.01 per sale. So if you sell 100 of these items you will have 100 feedback and you will owe ebaY $1.00. I'm sure you'll agree that $1.00 is a lot better than $100.00 especially when you start thinking about doubling or tripling that amount. PLUS think of the exposure you'll get for your other auctions!! (This is where some of the big $$ to be earned comes from) Think of this as traffic like a website gets. However- 3. If you list the item in your eBay store - the item is not shown in search results hardly anyone will see your .01 listing unless they can somehow find there way to your eBay store.... But, good news - there is a way around this also! Here is the way to list- Let's say you list this e-book in your ebaY store for $0.01 with a quantity of 1000. How is anyone going to find your e-book? Simply list it as a regular buy it now for $0.01 with free shipping and it will appear in the search results. Ebay however only allows one listing at pricing under .99. There is another way- If you list an item as a buy it now for $0.01 you can only list a quantity of one. Once someone buys it then the item disappears from the search results. But, if you list an item for $0.01 in your ebaY store (Which if you do not have one get one, while you are at it get selling manager pro too) then you can have any number of quantities. So you make an ad with a regular buy it now auction with a quantity of 1 for $0.01 then you make that listing for pre-approved buyers only. The secret- You include a link from your regular buy it now auction saying "click here to get instant approval and access to purchase this item" link that to the $0.01 item that is in your ebaY store with a multiple quantity. Your listing will stay listed for the full 7 days instead of disappearing once there is a sale.</p>
<p>If you do not know how to do this, simply go to the auction you won from us. From your browser click on view, then page source. Find where the words &lt; - - Begin Description - - &gt; are. You will see this html:</p>
<p><br />
item=180009387906 is the auction you purchased this book from in my store. You are now set to sell the penny e-book from your store!</p>
<p>How to set an auction to pre-approved bidders- First create the auction and list it on ebaY, then immediately take the auction number and enter it here while you are still signed in: <a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/manage_bidders_ov.html" class="external free" title="http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/manage_bidders_ov.html" rel="nofollow">http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/manage_bidders_ov.html</a> Go to: Pre-approve a list of bidders/buyers Then add your item This is way, Way easier if you have Firefox and use tabbed browsing. Okay now you know how to sell a ton of .01 free shipping e-books. Remember to re-list the 7 day auction every 7 days to keep your traffic coming in! And have sales from your store. Ok, So now you are asking where is all the big$$ coming from? At only $0.01 per auction I am making nothing right? Wrong&#160;! Let me ask you this- if you are driving hundreds of ebaY buyers to your penny auction they are naturally going to look at some of your other auctions right? Start selling some e-books for profit! We have a great package that is currently up and it has resell rights. Traffic, traffic and more traffic get it going to your Store; your pages; just get it going to huge profits. With all the traffic generatedby this e-book we will be generating more sales, lots more sales! With our other e-book offers. Want to purchase the best e-book package on ebaY? Want to make huge profits? <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/19-Gb-Of-E-books-templates-SOFTWARE-tutorials-GAMES_W0QQitemZ190079677561QQihZ009QQcategoryZ52559QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem" class="external free" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/19-Gb-Of-E-books-templates-SOFTWARE-tutorials-GAMES_W0QQitemZ190079677561QQihZ009QQcategoryZ52559QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/19-Gb-Of-E-books-templates-SOFTWARE-tutorials-GAMES_W0QQitemZ190079677561QQihZ009QQcategoryZ52559QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem</a> VERY IMPORTANT Now if you do not have a website to host an e-book we are granting you the rights to use our web link for your buyers to download this penny e-book!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.e-martin.net/download/Onecent.zip" class="external free" title="http://www.e-martin.net/download/Onecent.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.e-martin.net/download/Onecent.zip</a></p>
<p>Remind buyers to paste the link in your address bar if having difficulty. WEBMASTERSBy reading the above you have most likely already figured out how to generate quality PAGE VIEWS, yes page views not just hits. By following all the above you are sending all your Penny e-book buyers to your website page to download the e-book. Each time they arrive you get a view/hit. For each person that resells the book linking to your site for download you get another hit/view. Imagine how this will play/pay out. If you sell 500-1000 e-books and say just 10% of those buyers link to your site and 10% of their buyers link and 10% of those buyers link... well you get the idea. In our first week we have sold 55 e-books, with just a couple of listings. At just 10% of the buyers linking to your page- Over the course of one year that would work out to: 2800 views/hits for only the first level buyers 28,000 views/hits for the second level- Remember at %10 of the first level- 280 link to your page and each of them sell just 100 books that's 28,000 views/hits. 280,000 views/hits for the third level Remember I am only estimating %10 linking to your site. So that's 2800 linking from the second level and each of them selling just 100 e-books. 2,800,000 Forth level 28,000,000 fifth level. Now I really don't know how far this can go. I just started allowing links to my site and don't have much data yet. After the first month of doing this I will update this e-book, so don't lose the web page as I will continually update the e-book. So how would your site fare with 28 million hits? Where you decide to link is up to you. You may choose to create another page or possibly you might want to link this up to your front page. The choice is yours and the ingenuity could really move your website page rank up the ladder in no time. There is also an affiliate program already set up, you can find it in www.info-real.info</p>
<p>It have made a constant earning with this system, it works well, basically, the more sales or advertising the more money you make, you can easily sell your one cent ebook twenty times per auction, then by just having five you can send the message to one hundred persons daily.</p>

<p>Professor Castoldi has over 32 years experience in a wide range of styles including, jujitsu, judo, kung fu, professional wrestling, and bare knuckles street fighting. He holds a 7th degree in jujitsu, a 1st degree in Karate, and a 3rd degree in judo. His instructors include Albert J. Castoldi, John Hogan, Master Win Chil Wu, and Professor Wally Jay.</p>
<p>New England Regional Director - Jujitsu America World Martial Arts Hall of Fame - 1991 Jujitsu America - 1991 Outstanding Ambassador Award Jujitsu America - 1988 Black Belt Hall of Fame Jujitsu America - 1983 Instructor of the Year Founder of West Suburban YMCA Jujitsu School - 1974</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Prof. Castoldi is a real survival story. At a young age he suffered from Polio and doctors told him if he survived he may not be able to move around properly. He began his martial arts training when his sister dragged him into the YMCA and introduced him to weight lifting and a Karate class. Prof. Castoldi slowly began understanding the martial arts system and began training in karate and kung fu simultaneously. He overcame the Polio epidemic with no problems to his movement and soon enough he was training in 7 different styles of martial arts all at the same time. He would go from class to class and have each of his teachers yell at him because one of the styles he was taking would be the complete opposite of what he was learning in their class. One style said be fluid and loose while the other style said be firm and rigid. In 1978 the 6'1 <i>225 lbs Dave Castoldi was introduced to the 5'3</i> 110 lbs Prof. Wally Jay who needless to say, manhandled Dave Castoldi. It was here Castoldi began training with Prof. Jay and integrated everything he had known into what is now Castoldi's street self defense system. The Key to This system is practicality. drawing heavily upon the principles of Professor Wally Jays Small Circle Jujitsu. Dave has been a student of Professor Jay since 1978, and has blended the painful effectiveness of the Small Circle into his own rough-and-tough style of street jujitsu. Sensei Castoldi holds a 7th degree in jujitsu. Castoldi's style works for everyone from a 3'0 <i>child, to a 7'0</i> male. Woman have found great confidence in learning the style because it teaches them self protection from all situations, including Rape attacks, multiple attackers, and weapons defense. Castoldi is world renowned for his weapon defense techniques because he has introduced weapon disarmament and developed it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Jimmy Jimmyson The Third was born in New Jersey in the United States on the 4th of January Year 1940; he then moved (in 1960) to a small hamlet called Hammersfield in Oregon. He lived his whole life playing his beloved guitar, while his five children (Clive, Kareena, Michael, Franzo, and Jimmy The Fourth) sang along to him. Apart from playing his guitar, the thing he loved to do most of all was fish. Every morning he would go to the small lake (Lake Rita) at the bottom of his road, and catch a dozen fish that he cooked, and ate. He died in 1995, at 55 years of age. His body was found buried in a pile of leaves at the end of his garden. His case lasted for only one week, and no one found the killer. Evidence shows that he may have been strangled, but it was vague, and so the police stopped and eventually gave up. With your help, you along with his children can bring justice to the killer of this innocent, great man.

<p>The StudentZone forums were created in January 2007 in an attempt to bring together students from across the United Kingdom. Its creator, who is a student at university, struggled to find information on the internet written by students about university life, be it educational or social, and hence created the forum.</p>
<p>Although it is not yet a well known forum, it is growing daily, and will hopefully be a top resource for those either thinking about higher education, or those already in it.</p>
