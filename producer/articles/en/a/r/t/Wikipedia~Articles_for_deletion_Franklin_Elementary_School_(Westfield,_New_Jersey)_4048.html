<li><b>Definite Keep</b> I (being the author of the page) do not see why people may say that this school is not "notable". This school has consistently been rated in the top 100 elementary schools in the state, and I thought it would be nice to showcase it. I'm trying to build pages for all of the schools in my town. In response to Geogre's comment, this picture has not been photoshopped. I do not see why an attempt at showcasing an elementary school is seen as total misuse of Wikipedia. You may delete this page if you want, but I find that a true injustice. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeeilbacher_8c9f.html" title="User:Mikeeilbacher">Mikeeilbacher</a> 21:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - There is no school guidline, and for all of you who think that all schools are inherantly notable due to precedent, you're wrong.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> per Dpbsmith and Kicking222. Among elementary schools (and I'd also say middle schools), only the most noteworthy should be included here; the average ones shouldn't. Else, we should be including pages on every church (not just very large or otherwise well-known ones), every sports venue (not just professional ones), every restaurant, every gym, and so forth. We're not a web directory or a telephone directory. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 23:16, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Firstly, "notability" or the lack thereof is not a valid deletion criterion for schools, and attempts to make it so in previous discussions have failed. I understand that the nominator does not believe that <i>schools are inherently notable</i> and that belief is fine as a justification for a vote or even a nomination, but just because you say that schools aren't inherently notable doesn't make it so. I believe that schools <i>are</i> inherently notable as do many others and it is partly the rationale behind my vote. The failure to reach a consenus at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> does not mean that elementary schools or indeed any schools are thusly to be excised from wikipedia. Many of us who participated at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> who support the expansion and inclusion of school-related articles also rejected that proposal as too restrictive.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 23:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I did <b>not</b> say my basis for deletion was lack of notability. If that was the sole reason, I'd have kept my peace. My main basis was that it is not <b>encyclopedic</b> ("<i>this article, based on its own merits, has no encyclopedic value and must go</i>"). I agree, an article cannot be included or excluded on the basis of notability <i>alone</i>, but it would be foolish to say that notabilty cannot be a criterion which is considered in the light of all other factors. To determine whether something is encyclopedic, we have to have some sort of rational criteria to make that determination. One of those means is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. How does this article expand our knowledge and understanding of schools? How is this article not just an indiscriminate directory listing? All in all, <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_infinitum.html" title="Argumentum ad infinitum">argumentum ad infinitum</a> has prevailed to make high schools "inherently" encyclopedic (or notable). Now that proposition is being extended to elementary schools (a slippery slope the nay-sayers said wouldn't happen). It strikes me as an odd double-standard that the local elementary school is now somehow worthy of an article, but the church next door to it or the little league playing in its field is not (not that they should be). I need to provide a reason why the article is not encyclopedic (which I believe I did, you're free to disagree). It is not for me to prove lack of notability; however, if someone wants to maintain that something is encyclopedic because, in part, it is notable, they'd better offer more convincing criteria than repetition. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 00:22, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Librarianofages, shouting, like repetition, is not persuasive (and I thought shouting was not allowed in libraries). Neither is a critical review of the so-called <a href="../../../g/r/i/User%7EGRider_Schoolwatch_74ee.html" title="User:GRider/Schoolwatch">Schoolwatch</a> page. It is not a record of consensus, and it is not accurate. I should note it is not entirely wrong for Schoolwatch to be biased (and as a user page it's <i>not</i> subject to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>), as its creator is obviously of the opinion that all school articles must be kept and he is entitled to that opinion. However, what is wrong is for it to be misleading, depending on what purpose it is used for. As a record of "keep" and "delete", it's fine. However, if used by anyone for the purpose to "prove" consensus or anything beyond a track record, it is not. I've spent (wasted?) a ton of time actually checking the actual discussions of many, many of the articles. If "Schoolwatch" was really being fair, and if it was required to be of a neutral point of view (which a user page does not), then it would indicate which "keep" results were really because of a lack of consensus. I've counted at least a dozen high schools that in the past few months only survived because of a lack of consensus. It's also not an exhaustive list - there are school articles that had AfD discussions that are not on Schoolwatch (some were keep, some were delete, some were no consensus - to be fair, more were keep than delete). I also don't think it's fair to include in the count articles on what are not individual high schools or elementary schools, but are school-related subjects, like school districts or the odd university (although these do not puff up the numbers in a significant way). To say that the Schoolwatch list is "proof" of consensus (which Schoolwatch does not expressly state, but other users rely on that summary) is not at all correct. Based upon my long review, I suggest that Schoolwatch does not provide a reasonable basis on which one can conclude that there is a consensus, <i>one way or another</i>, keep or delete. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 03:33, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is true that the page being linked is anaemic and incomplete. The user in question was banned long ago and others sporadically maintain that page. Tha being said, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> is an accurate and virtually all-inclusive listing of all school article discussions since January of 2005. There may be the occasional AfD missing, but it would be very rare. A number of editors contibute regularly, who hold mulitple views on the noteworthiness of schools. Universities, colleges and other post secondary schools are included on the page, but AfDs on these sorts of schools are so rare as be inconsequential. It is a <b>fact</b> that not a single, verifiable high school article has been deleted through the wikipedia deletion processes in the past 2 years (substubs, hoaxes, copyvios, etc. notwithstanding). As to whether or not the result is recorded as "keep" or "no consensus" is really irrelevant because <b>policy</b> states that no consensus is keep. In an AfD discussion is <b>not</b> about whether or not there is a lack of consensus to keep an article, it is about whether or not there is a consensus to delete or not. There is no consensus to delete high school articles on the basis of their being "non-notable" or "unencylopedic" or "unimportant". Since no consensus exists to delete such articles, they stay. Also, since Grider's "schoolwatch" page is also called schoolwatch, you are confusing it with the page I have linked in some senses, most editors would consider <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive</a> to be "Schoolwatch", not Grider's old page. You may wish to review that page rather than try to dredge through individual AfDs on your own, it really is unnecessary to do so. It should also be noted that some admins routinely close high schools as "no censensus" irrespective of predominating discussion in an AfD itself. I remember a VfD from last year where there was a solitary delete vote and about 25 keep votes and the closing admin still closed "no consensus" on the basis that school deletions are contentious. For the record, could you please point to the "at least a dozen high schools that in the past few months only survived because of a lack of consensus."??? I would like to see the specific "dozen" you are referring to. I can only find 2 such high schools since January, which were 9-5 and 9-4 in favor of <b>keep</b> - hardly "no consensus" by the traditional intrepretation on Wikipedia. A clear majority to keep is generally considered a consensus by most closing admins.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:36, 27 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You're right, but I clearly see your point. In the beginning I was fighting this purely on the fact that I don't want anyone deleting my work. This page is not necessary to for people to learn about education, but I still believe that it should have a place in Wikipedia. I propose a solution that should not anger everyone: I suggest creating a page ( perhaps titled "Notable Schools in New Jersey"), and letting anyone write about a school that they want to schowcase. This would allow for schools to express themselves, without compromising the encyclopedic values of Wikipedia. It may sound stupid, but I truly think this could be a solution.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeeilbacher_8c9f.html" title="User:Mikeeilbacher">Mikeeilbacher</a> 22:30, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - in addition to the usual justifications for keeping schools with verifiable information, the nomination states "I'd say that this article, based on its own merits, has no encyclopedic value and must go." As much as I try to understand the deletionist mentality, I fail to see why the solution is not to <b>improve</b> the article. Given that the nominator acknowledges this possibility, what on earth is lost by letting it evolve into a more encyclopedic article. I have added information to this article in the past, while others stand idly by. Instead of adding to and improving articles, I lose far too much time each day dealing with both vandals and deletionists.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Merge as always is not a good vote since it gets counted as a keep. Until that changes, Delete is the correct vote for cases like this. Of course since it was merged already. This should be changed to a redirect and the discussion closed. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 21:42, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and allow for organic growth, this school is notable. <a href="../../../b/a/h/User%7EBahn_Mi_d240.html" title="User:Bahn Mi">Bahn Mi</a> 21:58, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> purposeful article on worthwhile topic. AFD is pointless waste of resources. I won't accept random deletions of articles, with total disregard for precedent, and thereby disregard for consistancy. Such a random approach discredits Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 23:24, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Schools are worth writing about, because they give kids something that they can identify with on Wikipedia. We should make all efforts to educate youth on how to be good Wikipedians. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">Elonka</a> 00:37, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> this article which helps expand our knowledge and understanding of education in Westfield, if we happen to be interested, and does us no harm if we are not. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 20:29, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westfield_Public_Schools_0ec1.html" title="Westfield Public Schools">Westfield Public Schools</a> or <b>Delete</b>. I'm ok with high schools, but elementry schools is pushing the limit of random collection of information. <a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Breitenstein_8775.html" title="User:Kevin Breitenstein">Kevin_b_er</a> 23:08, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
