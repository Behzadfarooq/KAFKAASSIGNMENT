AfD in the past has shown that candidates cross the threshold to notability when they win the elction they're campaigning for. Merely being nominated isn't enough because plenty of people are nominated for these things all the time in Canada and the US and luckily we don't have entries for all of those people.

<li><b>Keep</b>. She is a notable Northern Manitoban, not many of them, fewer people up there, so it's no surprise that she doesn't have many web hits, though the page does need to work.

The above anon is correct in saying that the Ashton family is highly influential in northern Manitoba. Also, someone above mentioned her unseating a three-term incumbent, which makes her notable in the history of Canadian politics; nomination unseatings are very rare in Canada. Also, on the Google search method - a poor choice indeed for a region where, despite high computer ownership in Canada, less than half of the population owns or has access to a computer. —<b><a href="../../../c/u/i/User%7ECuivienen_fddf.html" title="User:Cuivienen"><font color="olivedrab">Cuivi</font></a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="darkolivegreen">é</font></a><a href="../../../c/u/i/User_talk%7ECuivienen_9aca.html" title="User talk:Cuivienen"><font color="steelblue">nen</font></a></b>, <font size="1"><a href="../../../t/u/e/Tuesday.html" title="Tuesday">Tuesday</a>, <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_11.html" title="April 11">11 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> @ 22:12 (<a href="../../../u/t/c/UTC_9234.html" title="UTC">UTC</a>)</font></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Google hits =/ page views; we're not measuring how popular Ms. Ashton is (I rather think the electoral results did that for us). They measure how <i>notable</i> she is. What you and several other noms are doing is arguing why she <i>should</i> be notable, and your arguments are defensible, but the purpose of AfD isn't as an advocacy group. Demonstrably, Ms. Ashton was a mere drop in the outside world, and barring greater success in politics, she just hasn't demonstrated that the world's particularly noticed her. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 14:30, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think Ashton was the only person to defeat any Canadian Member of Parliament running for reelection for their own party's nomination in the 2006 election.

<li>While I realize that not everybody agrees on the notability of unelected political candidates, the precedent has already been set that <i>federal</i> candidates are entitled at <i>least</i> to inclusion in a merged list. I'm inclined to agree with Samaritan that <i>l'affaire <a href="../../../b/e/v/Bev_Desjarlais_d34d.html" title="Bev Desjarlais">Desjarlais</a></i> is, in and of itself, a sufficient criterion of notability, but per established practice, as a candidate in a <i>federal</i> election she's unequivocally entitled to at <i>least</i> a subsection in a merged candidates list.
