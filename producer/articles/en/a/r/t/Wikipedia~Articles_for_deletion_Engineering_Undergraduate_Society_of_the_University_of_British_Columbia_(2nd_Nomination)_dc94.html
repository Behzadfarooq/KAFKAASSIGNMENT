<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable student group. Ardenn is altogether correct when she intimates that, irrespective of the propriety of her nominating the article of a newbie, the group is non-notable; no decorous welcome would change that. There are cases in which the subject of an article can be identified as notable even where no assertion of notability is made; in such cases it is surely appropriate for an editor either to improve the article him/herself or to contact the creator and suggest that he/she edit the article in order that notability should be established (or at least that an assertion should be essayed); here, even asd the article presents a good deal of information about the subject, it is eminently clear that the subject is non-notable, which term we generally ascribe to student groups save those which are university-wide (see, e.g., student governments, especially at Canadaian colleges and universities) or otherwise notable (see, e.g., <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiffenpoofs_fb72.html" title="The Whiffenpoofs">The Whiffenpoofs</a>). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:06, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>The EUS is an internationally known group. In Vancouver alone we are known extremely well for 'hanging the bug', and our red jackets which can be seen all over the city. Many engineers worldwide also have these red jackets. Internationally we also have recognition from our many stunts as seen in the article. I would be more than happy to expand on some of the stunts. FYI The Queen of England, Prince Charles, Boris Yeltsin, and Scotty from Star Trek all have been given reds and have worn them (exception: the Queen did not wear hers to my knownledge). <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_clare%40hotmail.com_8a47.html" title="User:Ryan clare@hotmail.com">ryanc</a> 21:13, 19 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>internationally known group</i> That's stretching the term to near meaninglessness: you traveled down to San Francisco and performed a juvenile stunt on the Golden Gate Bridge, which netted you an item in the morning paper.

<li><b>Comment</b> The "Bug incident" perhaps merits an article more than does the group.

<li>Joe, the start of the article is just the tip of the iceberg. Note that the original bug stunt was in the late 70's on Lion's Gate bridge. A bug was also placed on top of the clocktower at UBC.

<li><b>We have been through situations like this in history before with the likes of the logical positivists.</b> While the intentions of the logical positivists were to remove false and untruthful facts, they lacked consistency in their definitions for what was 'notable.' I see here similar inconsistencies in determining what is 'notable.' Case in point, explain to me how this is more 'notable' than a well meaning and prominant engineering society <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Monkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Breakfast_Monkey" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The fact that the entry simply exists, effort was put into providing the world with a history of the society and that people are here fighting to keep it suggests that this entry is notable.

<li>Well, Mr Brand-New Editor, you might have had the ghost of shred a possibility of a point if the comparison in your cliched "If X article exists, why can't mine?" argument (I swear, I'm going to start numbering them, for convenience) was to an article that had been through the AFD -- which, <i>quelle surprise</i>, it hasn't. Of course, the article you dredged up from whatever dark corner of Wikipedia you found it has nothing -- vip, zero, nada, nil -- do with the actual article under discussion, either in terms of subject area and appropriate notability standards.
<ul>
<li>And that's not even touching on the most basic of issues: we're not discussing the deletion of that article here. We're also not talking about global warming, whether the Socreds are coming back, or the best place to spot American TV stars working in Vancouver, all subjects equally as valid as the one you're attempting to misdirect us to: <b>we're discussing the deletion of the <a href="../../../e/n/g/Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia_2778.html" title="Engineering Undergraduate Society of the University of British Columbia">Engineering Undergraduate Society of the University of British Columbia</a> article.</b> Period/full stop/EOL. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 01:21, 20 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I re-worded my entry so it was less of an 'attack.' Though the entry here before was a slight 'personal attack,' entries shouldn't be simply editted by others. A lot of valid points were missed when someone editted it. Oh...and the way it was editted... spectacular.. really I don't know how missed ommiting some of those valid points...

<li><b>Keep</b> even though as an arts grad I should oppose on principle&#160;;-) I'll agree that it's undesirable to have an entry for every little club that might form on any given campus. That said, I have no opposition to articles on student clubs that have established a significant presence, even if it's within their own campus. There are a few student societies popping up on AfD with enough frequency that I've begun to suspect it's a bit arbitrary what makes one "notable" and another not. I've seen it suggested that one can substitute a place like <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard_University_9346.html" title="Harvard University">Harvard</a> and the entry would still fail notability. Let's take a look at some of the entries on clubs at Harvard: Harvard Computer Society; <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harvard-Radcliffe_Science_Fiction_Association_6464.html" title="Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association">Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association</a>; <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_club.html" title="Final club">Final club</a>.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Clearly, the article is undergoing a substantial amount of change (compare the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">16:40 April 18 version</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia&amp;oldid=49176743" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia&amp;oldid=49176743" rel="nofollow">13:29 April 19 version</a> and you can see how much it has changed in the <i>less than 24 hours</i>. I propose that this AfD be placed on hiatus to allow for editors to improve the article (especially in regard to notability and verifiability, removing an original research.) <i>I am strongly against the categorical removal of this article simply because it is about a university society,</i> unless there is a proven discussion about this sort of categorical deletion policy that can be documented. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_cd32.html" title="User:Andrewjuren">Andrew<font color="lightblue">jur</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewjuren_Esperanza_8bed.html" title="User:Andrewjuren/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrewjuren_8d5e.html" title="User talk:Andrewjuren"><font color="lightblue">n</font>(talk)</a> 02:44, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the Golden Gate Bridge job should be considered rather notable in itself, and the lifting of the Rose Bowl adds to it. Media coverage has indicated notability in the past, and should probably be considered here as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Beetle stunt gives them notability. But people involved with the group should not be the ones editing it. And it needs sources. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 07:15, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, however there are many stunts which may be overlooked. Like stealing the speaker's chair from parliament in Victoria BC. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_clare%40hotmail.com_8a47.html" title="User:Ryan clare@hotmail.com">ryanc</a> 19:06, 20 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The UBC article is already criticized as being too long and full of random crap. I don't think the EUS can be added to it without reducing the quality of both articles. <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastyCakes_4007.html" title="User:TastyCakes">TastyCakes</a> 17:51, 22 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "<i>Stunts make them notable</i>"&#160;?? "<i>extracuricular activities make them notable.</i>"&#160;?? They are a school society. They have a organizational structure. They have a mission statement, traditions, special clothing, a song, and a totem rock. Same as a zillion other non-notable groups. Delete. Now if you are tickled by the pranks (repeated in kind by <i>quite a few</i> other student groups) then move those particulars to some other page entertaining the world with the like. <a href="../../../s/h/e/User%7EShenme_67cd.html" title="User:Shenme">Shenme</a> 19:44, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The EUS has traditionally had a prominent (and often controversial) presence on the UBC campus, and it has established a certain international notoriety over the years. The annual stunts during Engineering Week have attained [<a href="http://batman.mech.ubc.ca/~eus/stunts.html|" class="external text" title="http://batman.mech.ubc.ca/~eus/stunts.html|" rel="nofollow">local</a>], [<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/AS_IT_HAPPENS_TORONTO/2001/2/6.html|" class="external text" title="http://www.cbc.ca/insite/AS_IT_HAPPENS_TORONTO/2001/2/6.html|" rel="nofollow">national</a>], and even [<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/goldengateproject/" class="external text" title="http://www.angelfire.com/bc2/goldengateproject/" rel="nofollow">international</a>] attention. I agree that the page needs a substantial rewrite to focus on the aspects of the EUS that <b>are</b> noteworthy to readers outside of the UBC community. However, it should <b>not</b> be turfed just because it is a "student society". Successfully planning, coordinating, and executing schemes to "borrow" the Speaker's chair from the BC Legislature, hijack the Rose Bowl trophy from the University of Washington, and hang Volkswagen Beetles from (among others) the Lions Gate Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge is, I think, worthy of an article. I'll also add my voice to those asking "Why are we doing this again?" (See the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Engineering_Undergraduate_Society_of_the_University_of_British_Columbia_182c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Engineering Undergraduate Society of the University of British Columbia">first AfD</a>, from only a month ago, nominated by the same editor.) <a href="../../../c/k/a/User%7ECkatz_0c62.html" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a> 05:39, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Since Vancouver is the economic Hub of British Columbia most people in BC get their news from Vancouver. The Vancouver Sun has on various occasions covered the exploits of this engineering society. Thus anyone in BC knows that the UBC engineers attempt MIT-esque pranks. The authors of the article should simply link to the news coverage and then this would be a non-issue. This isn't made up one day. The pranks are basically repeated every year. My complaints with the article is that the authors did not take the necessary time actually go and collect links like this: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/05/MN60371.DTL" class="external text" title="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/archive/2001/02/05/MN60371.DTL" rel="nofollow">Beetle Overboard! VW hung off GG Bridge in prank</a>. The fact is these engineers even leave their own community to commit pranks. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollHistorian_f3a9.html" title="User:TrollHistorian">TrollHistorian</a></dd>
