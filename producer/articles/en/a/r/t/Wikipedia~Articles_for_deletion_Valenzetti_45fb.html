<p>The result of the debate was <b>No consensus</b>.

<p>This is either a hoax or improper manipulation of Wikipedia's reputation. There is information in this article that has not been revealed anywhere else (e.g., Enzo Valenzetti is said to have proven Fermat's last theorem but burnt his work after showing it to his colleagues) in either the shows or the related websites. The contents of this article are either invented -- &amp; thus should be considered a hoax &amp; removed -- or it is part of the <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alternate_reality_game.html" title="Alternate reality game">Alternate reality game</a> related to the television series, &amp; thus should not be part of Wikipedia. Articles about ARGs are one thing: providing articles that are part of an ARG is another -- &amp; something we must keep out of Wikipedia, because in blurring the distinction between fact &amp; fiction this can only harm our encyclopedia's credibility. (And the information in the article has already been mirrored <a href="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Valenzetti" class="external text" title="http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Valenzetti" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, so deletion does not mean it is irreparably gone.)</p>
<p>Sorry to be so brief in my argument, but I really need to be in bed. I'll be happy to answer questions later, but in any case I believe this matter needs a thorough discussion not only about this case, but over future cases. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 06:52, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If either Encyclopedia Britannica or Encarta allowed an something like this in their website to promote a television show, I would lose a great deal of respect for them; I doubt am alone in this view. The same applies to Wikipedia: people would distrust us if we let Hollywood -- or any other commercial entity -- use us as a conduit to raise a buzz over their products. And I can think of half a dozen fan websites that would be excited to accept something like this from the creators of Lost, become part of the show &amp; promote the heck out of it. Take it to one of them, &amp; create goodwill with your fanbase; your submission is <b>not</b> what Wikipedia is looking for. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 19:16, 11 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry, I just don't see how this is anymore "promotion" than an article on <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superman.html" title="Superman">Superman</a> or <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spider-Man_f858.html" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>. Seriously, if you say it's fiction, it's just like those articles. Besides, before someone pointed out it had to do with LOST, there was no mention of LOST OR ABC - so someone coming across it wouldn't suddenly want to watch LOST - it's promotion for Wikipedia if anything. Besides, now that it's up at LOSTpedia, what's keeping someone from (after this is deleted), sourcing LOSTpedia and putting up the exact same text - only with the words "fictional character" in it . . . because then, it would be by the guidelines stated here. --S 11:39 11 May 2006</li>

<dd>Those articles begin along the lines of "X is a fictional character in the works of Y", &amp; refer to specific episodes, creators &amp; other verifiable sources for their statements. In the case of this article, even if it were re-written to Wikipedia standards, &amp; Lostpedia was used as a source, we still come back to the problem that we don't know where various details in this article come from: if Javier Grillo-Marxuach created these details, &amp; they are canonical to the series then he must be quoted directly -- for him to say "it's mostly accurate" is not good enough.</dd>

<dd>He should have put it on a fansite first, for a number of reasons. First, Wikipedia does not accept submissions in the fiction category; if this is not a clearly understood, then give me 5 minutes &amp; I'll start making it a formal policy. Secondly, all information on Wikipedia needs to be verifable, which means it can be found outside of Wikipedia in a book, the mass media, or an appropriate website; we don't accept primary sources or original research, so tv writers submitting fiction about their characters is again inappropriate. Third, as I said above, there are countless fans who would be thrilled to be part of the making of Lost, &amp; they would be far more eager than we to help publish this kind of information; &amp; if this became successful enough, an article would be written in Wikipedia. Lastly, as Leflyman above points out, this is part of a promotion for a television show, not an objective submission of information; Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> advertising. If you can't understand the difference between the two, then your time on Wikipedia will only become less pleasant: I'm being civil &amp; respectful; there are other Wikipedians who won't be as nice over submissions like this. -- <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 21:01, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for being civil and respectful. I was merely trying to find a middle ground, but I <b>do</b> understand your points. I still stand by most of mine, but where my stance falters is the "all information on Wikipedia needs to be verifable." In the end - that's all it takes to make my arguments moot. That said, I just think that once it's deleted it will show up again and even though it will have been done by the book - there won't be much of a dif. Even so, as they say, rules are rules. --S 16:23 11 May 2006

<dd>Actually, Wikipedia is rife with 'submissions in the fiction category', and many along the same vein.

That's part of the fun in ARGs. The sources of the material on the page are fictional and currently, because the puppetmasters haven't posted it authoritively anywhere else, unverifiable. That's not to say that, within the <i>Lost</i> mythos, they're not true. In reality, Enzo Valenzetti is a fictional character referred to by the blast door map in the Lost TV series and the book <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_Twin_701b.html" title="Bad Twin">Bad Twin</a>. The "previous book" by the fictional author of Bad Twin, Gary Troup, was "The Valenzetti Equation" and is referred to as "out of print" rather than the more truthful "non-existant". Enzo Valenzetti may turn out to be an interesting character, plot strand or clue in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lost_Experience_f4ca.html" title="The Lost Experience">The Lost Experience</a>, or even a future series of <i>Lost</i> itself. Thus, Enzo may well be worth an article in future - it depends on how notable he becomes.
