<p><br />
I would like to point out that this entry is notable for more than simply the level of football played by the team in question. The club's FA supported tour of Malawi during the summer has generated national and international press coverage, with an additional article due to be published in the Guardian Travel section in the near future.</p>
<p>As part of a FIFA initiative, each African Football Association is twinned with a European equivalent, on which it can call for support in its development. Malawi's allocated partner is England. A major responsibility that can be taken on by the clubs and individuals who sit within the structure of the English FA, is that of raising awareness of football in Malawi, and the role it can play in assisting the country's development. In my opinion, the Wilberforce Wanderers tour of Malawi can contribute to this goal, and therefore should be maintained on the site.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at a time when international sporting relationships are visibly fraying (as is the case with the current animosity between Pakistan and the ICC) the publicity generated by the Wilberforce Wanderers' tour of Malawi can only serve to re-inforce the idea of sport as a force for uniting, rather than dividing, the world community, regardless of any cultural or economic differences.</p>
<p>I hope you will take these comments into consideration.

<li><b>Comment</b> Old Chelmsfordians recently played in the Essex Olympian League, which, while Step 7, is effectively a 10th level league because it is a direct feeder to the level 9 <a href="../../../e/s/s/Essex_Senior_League_1d3c.html" title="Essex Senior League">Essex Senior League</a>. Furthermore, it was agreed that EOL Division One clubs are inherently notable. Wareham Rangers were just relegated from the Dorset Premier League, which is Step 7/level 11, but is co-feeder to the Wessex League Division One with the Wessex League Division Two (in which all clubs are considered notable). DPL clubs seem to be considered notable as they all have pages and there is a template. Up until a few years ago, the DPL was a direct feeder the Wessex League before the WL expanded. It has sent <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamworthy_United_F.C._0091.html" title="Hamworthy United F.C.">Hamworthy United F.C.</a>, <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shaftesbury_%28Dorset%29_F.C._cabb.html" title="Shaftesbury (Dorset) F.C.">Shaftesbury (Dorset) F.C.</a>, and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherborne_Town_F.C._23b7.html" title="Sherborne Town F.C.">Sherborne Town F.C.</a> to higher levels within the last three years, so it's certainly a Step 7 league with some standing. As such, Wareham Rangers' long-term participation in the league until their relegation last season should merit notability. --<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalerion_82c4.html" title="User:Balerion">Balerion</a> 18:02, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, to illustrate it with an unlikely example, if Manchester United or Arsenal were relegated to below level 10, then obviously they should retain their articles because in the past, they had won major trophies and been extremely well known. This case can be made at a lower level as well, I feel: for example, I recently voted to keep <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Liverpool_F.C._2a8b.html" title="South Liverpool F.C.">South Liverpool F.C.</a> because I felt that a team that had won the Welsh Cup (beating a professional club in the final) was notable enough to merit its article because of that historical achievement. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 17:33, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Retain Wilberforce Wanderers</b> The Wilberforce Wanderers played in what was considered an international friendly on this tour, the game was attended by the Malawian FA president and overseen by 4 full FIFA officials.In particular the ADMARC tigers side contain a number of current full internationals (R Gonani, V Gona amongst others). I understand that playing against international opposition with the last 12 months coresponds to playing at a level well above 'level 10' of the English game and hence the club must be considered notable. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.171.142.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.171.142.219_048b.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.171.142.219">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep Wilberforce Wanderers</b> Notable as I and the Oxford English dictionary define it means <i>worthy of note or notice</i>. The reference to level 10 and above of the English game is a simple and crude proxy for this assessment, but is clearly no replica for a full understanding of a clubs presence. As I see it, the Times and shortly the Guardian will see fit to take notice of The Wilberforce Wanderers, and record their exploits which is more than can be said for the majority of those clubs operating at level 10. I would trust these mainstays of the English media as a better judge of what is worthy of note than any simple proxy.</li>
<li>I see that Robotforaday has completely missed the point with his comment. The reference to notability is not based on simply going on tour as choirs could equally do, but is based on being recognised as worthy of note from an independent body, in this case the national press. Any choirs who the national press see fit to report on are also very deserving of a place.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.171.142.219 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.171.142.219_048b.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.171.142.219">contribs</a>).</small></li>
