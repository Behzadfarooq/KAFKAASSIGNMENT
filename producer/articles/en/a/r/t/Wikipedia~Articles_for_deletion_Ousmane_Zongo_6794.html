<li><b>Speedy keep</b> as bad-faith nomination. The "stupid perp" was an apparently innocent person who was shot and killed by Officer Conroy in a high-profile case which resulted in a $3 million settlement and a prolonged trial.

<li><b>Keep and Close</b> I suggest we move forward to keep this article and close the discussion. The main reason being its nomination was not done in good faith. The nomination was the second edit by a new user which is highly indicative of sock puppetry. The article is notable as per coverage by the New york times. This includes 33 articles on the case spanning the course of three years from his death in 2003 to the court settlement in 2006.<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/ousmane_zongo/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/ousmane_zongo/index.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChifumbe_2417.html" title="User:Chifumbe">Muntuwandi</a> 10:26, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This was a local incident, so of course The New York Times would have coverage of it, as they would most of the other crimes and what not in the city - it was not a national story, just a local one, as the bulk of the reporting was in the Metro section of the paper. In this case, the New York Times test gives a false positive, as it would for most local NYC stories. Most of the media coverage on TV was basically typical <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Sharpton_c19e.html" title="Al Sharpton">Al Sharpton</a> publicity hounding. Just because it happened in the city doesn't mean it is important. If this happened in Detroit, Omaha, or some small town in the midwest would it wouldn't have been on the radar. <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amadou_Diallo_24c5.html" title="Amadou Diallo">Amadou Diallo</a> is notable but Ousmane Zongo is not, since the only thing that came of it was the poor police officer who shot accidently the guy got his life ruined and Al Sharpton got what he desires most - TV time. <a href="../../../t/b/t/User%7ETBTA_143b.html" title="User:TBTA">TBTA</a> 20:46, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> bad faith nomination. Sufficient non-trivial coverage of the case to make the content verifiable and in compliance with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I think this debate is one of the most depressing ones I have read around here. There is no excuse for calling an innocent man shot by police a "stupid perp". There's also no excuse for sockpupettry and I sure hope that admins will take action in this case. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:41, 9 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> primarily per Kappa above. Also, although not a basis for ultimate decision, the tone of some of the comments here is highly troublesome.

<li><b>Keep</b> due to NYT coverage. Worried about various editors seeking to delete anything that might display the police or individual officers in anything less than 100% positive light.
