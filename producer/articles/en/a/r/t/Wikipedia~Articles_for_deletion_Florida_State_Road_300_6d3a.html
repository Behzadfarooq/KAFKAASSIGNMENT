<dd>Certainly. But if every single one of the hundreds of thousands of schools in America is notable, I fail to see how any of the far-smaller number of state, U.S. and Interstate highways can be deemed non-notable. Deleting articles on state-designated and maintained highways which link communities together while keeping articles on elementary schools that are notable for "teaching things" makes no sense. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 02:51, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Just because there's a bunch of people who want all American roads and schools included doesn't mean they should be.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wiki policy, as you can perhaps gather, is very contentious on the issue of articles about roads that just describe their geography.

<li>No, what it means is that people who want to include individual pages for otherwise non-notable highways, as we do for schools, should try to hammer out a consensus among wikipedians before going ahead and creating thousands of articles. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 20:33, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>As much as I can appreciate this sentiment, it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. If someone spent 100 hours working on an article about his belly button lint, I would feel bad about the wasted effort, but that would not change the validity of the article. How much time and effort has been spent should have no bearing on an editor's decision WRT the encyclopedic nature of the subject. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 16:41, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They *are* encyclopedic, in the views of a goodly number of editors. This isn't like an article on some fan forum or a crufty screed on a Star Wars character who got 5 seconds of screen time. These are articles on important links in the transportation network of the United States, which are encyclopedic for being (relatively) permanent, publicly-constructed, widely used and verifiable. I would argue that these roads have far more impact on the nation at large than any Star Wars vs. Star Trek debate forum ever created, or any band which released two albums, sold five copies of each and then disappeared into the mists of time. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 16:53, 26 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not arguing about whether or not they're encyclopedic in this case; all I'm trying to get at is that if an article is unencyclopedic, the fact that a large amount of work has been put into it should not merit its inclusion. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 00:21, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You heard it here! Roads are the new schools. I remain utterly convinced by the suggestion that institutions that obtain state-level grants for their construction and maintenance can be described as "non-notable". When we remove neutral, verifiable information from Wikipedia, we degrade it in a small way. If we continue to do so, we end up degrading it in a large way. We have no noticeable namespace problems, we have no noticeable diskspace problems, so the only real reason for removing something from Wikipedia is the suggestion that the information could be damaging to the project. In what way does the information that there is a road leading out to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Island_1801.html" title="St. George Island">St. George Island</a>, designated Florida State Road 300, damage Wikipedia?

A state highway project for all 50 states is not feasible at this time... leave it be and it will be improved with a routebox and that sort of thing in the near future. There are also over 600 US road stubs alone. And not to mention the nearly 1,000 state highway/ interstate articles in the WPs mentioned alone. You can't just delete 1,000+ articles! They are informative- you can learn about the highway that you commute on to work or a highway that you will travel once on vacation. We keep county routes in CA which are less notable than these.--<a href="../../../r/s/c/User%7ERschen7754_0301.html" title="User:Rschen7754">Rschen7754</a></li>

The article should be about the bridge, and the road should be mentioned within.

<li>Weak <b>Keep</b>.
