<dd><b>Comment</b>: Hey, this is Chris Putnam, the creator of GBStv, and I just want to say I don't really mind if the article is deleted from Wikipedia although we have a decent number of active users and I do feel it's somewhat "notable" for that reason. It is true that there are no real reliable sources and, as such, I am okay with it being deleted. However, I'd really like to know where another useful encylopedia resource is online so people can learn about GBStv's history independent of its own web site. I fail to understand exactly why Wikipedia cannot afford to have more legitimate information archived on its site, especially relating to demonstrably large internet communities. As a side note it doesn't surprise me that the people pushing for this are possibly on the offensive for some drama reason that I have no grasp or part of (the user who is arguing for this the most, Quirex, is not surprisingly a proud SA goon). In fact I have been very busy with other projects for quite some time and have relied on our excellent community to run the site on their own. GBStv was never related to the Something Awful forums, it just required SA membership for the first 5 months of operation. I built it to provide a place for a community of friends to hang out and watch TV (and to showcase their content to one another), and it's still doing that over a year later with nearly 10,000 users. But alas, we have no legitimate notability according to the rules of Wikipedia, so again let me repeat I don't mind us going the way of the axe. I'm just a bit upset at what Wikipedia considers "notable" and "unnotable", and for a significant community like this to be lumped in with vanity articles for 12-year-olds is not just offensive, but it's unfair.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia has these things called policies which are the rules of Wikipedia. These rules include expected behaviour of users and necessary requirements for article inclusion. If you read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> you'll see this AFD is solely based on policy.
