<li><b>Save</b>WBXO is an FCC part 15 radio station transmitting on 630Khz and on 102.5 FM; The station further streamlines its audio signal over the Internet via <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shoutcast.html" title="Shoutcast">Shoutcast</a> streaming technology. The station slogan "WBXO AM &amp; FM" is simply that; it is not a set of call letters issued by the FCC. Much like some stations have slogans (Z-100, Power 95, 3WE, Kiss-FM) WBXO AM &amp; FM happens to be the slogan we so choosen. The primary purpose of the part 15 operation is to provide coverage to the local population abeit the listening range is short due to restrictions based on part 15, there is actual transmission over the public airwaves, thus affording anyone within tranmission range the opportunity to listen in. The Station is privately owned; that is, no outside public interest involved in the affairs of the station. It is a primarily automated station with some live day-parts interspersed during the week and weekends. Deletion of this station would <b>not</b> be in the best interests of the general public as we operate under legal parameters; maintain a regular schedule of broadcasting to the public as evidenced by our continous broadcasting since 1/1/02; The station has continually streamed audio since 6/1/04 thus affording internet listeners a regular source of music, public service announcements and other pertinent information as needed. Arguements of the station being "unnotable" are compeletely without merit and should be dismissed as such. As encyclopedia's are supposed to be a source of knowledge, it appears that the proposed deletion of this page would be counter productive to the aims and goals of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/g/a/User%7EMgarnes2_ae2e.html" title="User:Mgarnes2">mgarnes2</a> WBXO 19:33, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Note, The article lacks Reliable sources and these need to be clicked to verify their nature and if what they say is actually what has been referenced - <i>removed on verifying the sources</i> <s>I am not saying the article lacks source but the</s> article itself is denoting an adjective that is why it is used to qualify Prejudice (Anti-Hindu <b>prejudice</b>)in the very first sentence of the article.The term Anti-Hindu is therefore incapable of carrying the whole weight of the article.Do a dictionary search for <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/islamophobia" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/islamophobia" rel="nofollow">Islamophobia</a>,<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-Semitism" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-Semitism" rel="nofollow">Anti Semitism</a><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-%20Hindu" class="external text" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&amp;q=anti-%20Hindu" rel="nofollow">Anti Hindu</a>,You will find that both the former exist but not Anti-Hindu.I am equally against the terms Anti-Muslim being elevated to denote a movement or philosophy - which is the reason the term - fear of Muslims or Islamophobia is used to denote that state of mind or philosophy - similar is the case with Anti-Semitism.Anti-Jew does not denote a widespread philiosophy of hate towards Jews while Anti-Semitism does.The absence of a term denoting the fear of Hindus or hate of Hindus could be an indication that such a philosophy has not gained a wider ground even though in individual cases there would be definitely be people who are Anti-Hindus, in the similar way that there will be people who are Anti Buddhists,Christians or Muslims.The term Anti-Hindu does not exist in academic discourse the way it has been portrayed in this article and hence does not deserve to be used as a head for an article that discusses systematic prejudice against Hindus.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 03:43, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There is of course a large element of bias in this article as the concept is built upon Hindu Action Forum sources while the some examples are indeed built upon news sources but do they discuss the concept of Anti-Hindu or Anti-Hinduism or Anti-Hinduness?? Many of the articles from independent sources discuss persecution of Hindus and not biases against Hindus including the one from US State Department and Amnesty International's BANGLADESH</li>

<dd>Please articulate your argument better.It makes absolutely no sense to me right now.All the HAF links are qualified as HAF links.HAF is an advocacy group like the Anti-Defamation League, which is allowed as a reliable source to explain their viewpoint (primary source) and to cite their activities etc. HAF is a notable and recognized group. Their partisanship may be a matter of debate, but they are reliable. Similarly, IndiaCause would not lie about the topics discussed as then they'd invite libel lawsuit. Thus, the facts are reliable.</dd>

<dd>The only worthwhile sources used are&#160;:1 educational on Wendy episode - scholarly interpretation whose comments on Hinduism were in academic perspective,few articles from rediff.com - editorial in nature.US State Department links mention the presecution of minorities in South Asian countries and are already covered in the Persecution of Hindus page.In short this is an interesting presentation of factoids and individual incidences.This page needs to go.Those who say the sources are fine and article is balanced need not look at the face value of the article - check the individual links.Most if not all are dubious <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerryJ-Ho_0781.html" title="User:TerryJ-Ho">TerryJ-Ho</a> 06:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

TerryJ-HO is deliberately conflating the issue of Hindu Nationalism with the hate and bigotry against millions of Hindus who have nothing to do with any goddamn nationalist movement.Many anti-semites also conflate the issue of anti-semitism with the issue of minority Jewish Fundamentalism, does that mean antisemitism should also be put up for AfD?This is utterly disgusting!<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 01:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Which is why I have been careful to avoid potentially partisan sources unless backed by reliable sources.Also bear in mind that anti-Hindus often hide their bigotry behind claims to oppose Hindutva (like the user who filed this AfD), so any claims of "Misuse of anti-Hindu by Hindutvaadis" need to be carefully sourced lest we don't let anti-Hindu prejudices enter the anti-Hindu article itself.This is similar to many haters of other religions who mask their hatred behind opposition to radical sects in the religion (anti-semites who claim opposition to Jewish nationalism, anti-Muslims who claim opposition to terrorism, anti-Christians claim opposition to Christian Fundamentalism etc.).<a href="../../../h/k/e/User%7EHkelkar_b268.html" title="User:Hkelkar">Hkelkar</a> 03:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did look at the links, which is why I voted move. The use of the term in the media is largely limited to rightwing groups.

<dd>Please be civil. That was a remarkably incivil statement, and a violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. The names you mention are based on a superficial reading of the results. For example, the Yang, Ho, Kuver and Yang edited book is a collection of essays, in which one by Muthu Selvan uses the term in the context placing the motivation of flame wars on Hindu newsgroups. Note that you could equally well have mentioned Sumit Sarkar, who also uses "anti-Hindu", and is hardly rightwing. The point is not irrelevant that the term is used as a single adjective. Consider the following representative quote from Ashok Kapur "The British India government was acting on anti-Congress, anti-Hindu and</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>anti-majority rule premises." This hardly suggests that the term is in widespread use. Please note that I do not object to the content of the article, but the name strikes me as something of a neologism. Also, dont lose your shirt.

<li><b>Keep</b> the Subject itself is somewhat notable, with movies and TV shows about them, and there are even books on the subject.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As the proposer, I just want to make it clear that while I find the topic valid, I find the current text is so useless to what valid text on this topic should look like that deletion of the article is the first step to making it better in this case. In my mind I saw this akin to how a copyvio would act upon an article (delete everything and rebuild from anew), but maybe it would have been better just to do just that sans the AfD discussion. I don't see the current text as being any better than a blank page (and in many ways it's worse than if we had no article at all: weasel words, unsourced allegations, POV, and just plain jibberish). That is why I proposed it for deletion. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 08:20, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - Null is one of the most known scanlation groups on the internet, and very old for a scanlation group. They scanlate a lot of manga, have a fansub subgroup, are probably second to lurk in terms of their irc channel and the bots they host, and run the scanlation wiki. The article is not unreferencable - although it does lack reliable references (e.g. things like newspapers and books). But i should point out that scanlation itself is a internet phenomonen that doesn't have much of a real life presence. It's internet notability can be verified by a google test. Searching for <i>null + "one piece" + manga</i> gets over 40 thousand results. Searching for <i>null + scanslation</i> also gets about that many (although <i>null + scanlation</i> doesn't...not sure why.). Dattebayo isn't really a precedant...since the article Dattebayo wasn't actually about the group, it was about the word (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dattebayo&amp;diff=64212861&amp;oldid=63684273" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dattebayo&amp;diff=64212861&amp;oldid=63684273" rel="nofollow">here is the article before it got redirected.</a> Dattebayo group was mentioned for their explaination of what the word meant) --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 04:46, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> The discussion that took place on the Dattebayo AfD was over the group, not the word.

<li><b>Comment</b> i don't think those numbers are valid. Google test for Null using "one piece + manga" instead of "scanlation" (but still with -wikipedia) gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=null+%22one+piece%22+manga+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=null+%22one+piece%22+manga+-wikipedia&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">38,400</a> results, and just null + manga -wikipedia gets even more. The alexa ranking is not really valid since Null's primary headquaters are on their irc channel, and they distribute through their irc channel too. If there's any ways to test hit counters for irc channels, then someone should do a test for #null on irc.irchighway.net --<a href="../../../y/a/k/User_talk%7EYaksha_d46a.html" title="User talk:Yaksha"><font color="#330066"><b>`/aksha</b></font></a> 08:14, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and above. Groups like this are awesome for the work they do, and lets face it, without them at lot of us who only speak English would be at a huge loss. However, even if an individual group is notable, it's hard to even say what that group is. They change people all the time, different people in the groups will claim different levels of involvement, etc etc. Lets say we even get past that we still need to reference it. As tjstrf, said it's pretty much unreferenceable. I doubt we'd be able to get <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> for such an article. As <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says, "<i>The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth.</i>" Other than individual reader testimony, I don't even see how we'd get past the first step I mentioned, whether or not the group is notable in the fist place (and not violate <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>), let alone the other hurdles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 08:52, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Article was previously deleted in 2005 (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Dan_Sandor_9834.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Dan Sandor">first AFD</a>) and subsequently recreated after he declared his candidacy. I don't consider it a G4 since the political candidacy, while not inherently notable per WP precedent, is at the very least a <i>different</i> claim of notability from the earlier article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 05:18, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not that I agree with Sandor's political views, but he is notable for things other than his municipal candidacy. In particular his association with a group that advocates for something called "Brigadier's Law" which is an amendment to the criminal code that would make it a crime to harm an animal being used for the purposes of law enforcement. Brigadier was the name of a horse ridden by a mounted policemen that was hit by a driver (allegedly on purpose). Brigadier was so seriously injured that he had to be put down at the scene. The driver was charged with reckless driving, but there was no additional charge that could be levied against the driver for what he did to the horse. "Brigadier's Law" would be a remedy for this to allow an additional charge, be it for police horses or dogs. I think that Sandor deserves to be recognized for this. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">Atrian</a> 04:40, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>According to Dr. Michael Langone, editor of <i>Cultic Studies Journal</i>, Sahaja Yoga is a cult, it is preoccupied with money, the group has an "us v. them" mentality, and techniques are used and encouraged to suppress doubt about the group or its members. <a href="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/sahaja_yoga.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/sahaja_yoga.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a> (see the section on "Issues and Controversies). My own concern is that many of these mis-information techniques seem to be being used on Wikipedia, as members of this group appear to be creating articles here to promote the group and its activities. --<a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovaSTL_cc89.html" title="User:NovaSTL">NovaSTL</a> 23:26, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Again, how does <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_International_eedf.html" title="Sahaja Yoga International">Sahaja Yoga International</a> aim at promoting the goup? And here I was, certain that your concern was that the article didn't fit Wikipedia guidelines (which was the reason you gave when you nominated this article. Your edits show that since your account creation <i>four days ago</i> you have actively prevented sources from being added to the article, in particular any sources that could identify SYI as an organisation independant from <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a> meditation. Your edits are obviously being used to push your own POV (expressed above) and aim at the removal of the article which you placed up for deletion.

<dd>I think we've already gone over this, but to repeat: I have no bias in this matter. I am not a <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppet</a> of anyone involved in this discussion, as I have already explained <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sahaja_Yoga_International&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81488726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Sahaja_Yoga_International&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=81488726" rel="nofollow">here</a> (though considering the number of pro-SYI <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets and meatpuppets</a> that have been trotted in, I actually find that charge fairly ironic). Anyone interested in reviewing my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_NovaSTL_6da8.html" title="Special:Contributions/NovaSTL">contribution history</a> for themselves is welcome to do so, and if the closing admin has any genuine concerns, I am happy to verify my identity in private email. As for "preventing sources", that's an absurd claim, as I would actually welcome anything which would prove that SYI had independent notability. See Talk:Sahaja Yoga International for details. In short, I'm not trying to attack SYI, I am simply trying to prevent the creation of poorly-sourced vanity articles on Wikipedia. At this point, my recommendation is that any relevant information from the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_International_eedf.html" title="Sahaja Yoga International">Sahaja Yoga International</a> article be merged into the article at <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a>, and then the SYI name can be set up as a redirect. --<a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovaSTL_cc89.html" title="User:NovaSTL">NovaSTL</a> 00:18, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

All this seems to indicate bias, if not against the organisation, then at least in regards to this afd. You are altering the article to suit your interests, in this case winning this afd proposal. It shows bad faith that you would hide your Sockpuppeteer identity from the rest of us, even if your other Sockpuppet(s) were not engaged in this discussion. As for the assumed 'Meatpuppets', I'm sure many of them have contributed to articles anonymously over the years, just because they are required to create a User account to be able to have their say doesn't make their arguments (when given) less valid. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 00:52, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Sahaja Yoga practicioners are counted in their hundreds of thousands. You can go anywhere in India and people will know about it. Non-notable? It has appeared in many leading newspapers.

<li>Nope, not a biased nom. I'd never heard of this organization until yesterday when I was on newpage patrol, and ran across <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishwa_Nirmal_Prem_Ashram_8289.html" title="Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram">Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram</a>, which appeared to be spam, so I tagged it with {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-spam_4537.html" title="Template:Db-spam">db-spam</a>}}. The tag was removed with a rude comment, so I proceeded to a prod, which was also removed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vishwa_Nirmal_Prem_Ashram&amp;action=history" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vishwa_Nirmal_Prem_Ashram&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>, so the next step was AfD. Rather than submitting just that article though, I decided to proceed to the "root" article, which is this one, which also appears (in my opinion) to be spam. Now let me be clear that the <i>practice</i> of <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a> appears notable, but the organization known as "Sahaja Yoga International" does not. This article also appears to be a hub for multiple other non-notable entities, such as <a href="../../../v/i/s/Vishwa_Nirmal_Prem_Ashram_8289.html" title="Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram">Vishwa Nirmal Prem Ashram</a> and <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Sahaja_Public_School_93f6.html" title="International Sahaja Public School">International Sahaja Public School</a>, other spam articles (go read it, you'll see what I mean). These all appear to have been created in an ongoing campaign to use Wikipedia to create articles on these peripheral activities, even though they are not independently notable. The articles should therefore either be deleted, or merged into the article about Sahaja Yoga. --<a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovaSTL_cc89.html" title="User:NovaSTL">NovaSTL</a> 23:40, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> - From the comments presented here, and considering the articles already present on various other faith-based spiritual movements, I cannot detect an actual problem with having this separate Wikipedia entry, nor any separate entry pertaining to Sahaja Yoga for that matter. To enable citing sources, particulars for Wiki precedents and/or Wiki accepted definitions and criteria for ‘reputable sources of information’ and ‘credible sources’ are required as these relate to the highly personal subject of spirituality (spirituality is subjective by nature). The comment referencing ‘religioncruft’ infers unfamiliarity with the subject, and as for ‘non-notable,’ Sahaja Yoga International is well-known in many circles of society, Sahaja Yoga being unique, therefore completely differentiated from every other sort of meditation technique. Generally speaking, the society of Sahaja Yoga International is a branch of the not-for-profit grass-roots, non-hierarchical Sahaja Yoga movement carrying out many international activities such as NGOs, charitable projects, non-commercial educational and social community services, duly registered active SY societies and SY charities around the world, and significant documented medical research on the many varied and widely recognized benefits of the Sahaja Yoga technique. As such, it should not be considered for deletion. Ewarrior21 03:19, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I believe that you are unaware of the recent additions to <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> concerning what is defined as spam.

In any case, if you believe that there are references which assert this topic's notability, by all means, please add them to the article. Without such sources, I stand by my opinion that this article does not make an adequate case for the notability of its subject, but instead is written in a self-promotional manner, and is almost certainly in violation of <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> (please note that the primary editor on the <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_International_eedf.html" title="Sahaja Yoga International">Sahaja Yoga International</a> article is Sahajhist (<a href="../../../s/a/h/User_talk%7ESahajhist_40eb.html" title="User talk:Sahajhist">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sahajhist_6b86.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sahajhist">contribs</a>), who is obviously associated with the topic).</dd>
<dd>Instead of attacking me, I think that your energy would be better spent on addressing the obvious WP:AUTO problems with this article and the related self-promotional sub-articles, instead of fighting the attempts to request citations, as you have been doing in the past .

<dd>I wasn't attacking you, I was remarking on the fact that either you are a sockpuppet or a newly signed up member, and have already placed an afd. A fact you seem to be avoiding. How is removing 1 (one!) request for citation "fighting the attempts to request citations"? As I have been doing in the past? What, with my one tag removal? The tag in question wasn't required there (in my opinion) since the sentence was self-explanatory. The removal wasn't contested. But why am I justifying my old edits to you? according to the link you posted above: "Pages that exist only to promote a company, person, product, service or group." The template {{Db-spam}} can be used on pages that fit the definition". In what way do you feel an NGO project that affects hundreds of people and is well know in that part of India exists only to promote itself? Also note that it is a stub, having been created 3 days ago, so sources haven't even had the time to be included. <a href="../../../s/f/a/User%7ESfacets_25b2.html" title="User:Sfacets">Sfacets</a> 06:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, your removal of that {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tag most definitely <i>was</i> contested, with the very next edit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Sahaja_Public_School&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71483534" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Sahaja_Public_School&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=71483534" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, followed by back and forth reverts, and finally the questionable statement's eventual removal. Next: My own account's status can be clearly determined by taking a moment to read my <a href="../../../n/o/v/User%7ENovaSTL_cc89.html" title="User:NovaSTL">userpage</a>. As is stated there, the primary purpose of this account is new page patrolling, as part of which I have nominated several articles for deletion, usually without much controversy (for example, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Corki%27s_Corner_cfba.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Corki's Corner">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Corki's Corner</a>).

<li>Please do not delete this useful piece on a movement for inner spiritual growth and liberation that has many thousands of adherents from all walks of life. This is not some barmy cult that grabs money from the unsuspecting and gullible seekers. It is a path that works and gives great joy and peaceful direction to life, and if there are those who have suffered because they were asked kindly to leave the movement, because they had done something extremely unkind or not in keeping with normal decent behaviour, want this page removed it would be a great shame and a very backward step. We accept anybody who asks for their self-realisation, and so there will always be discontented people who could not 'make it'.Very few indeed have been asked to leave or have left because they were unsatisfied. Why should this deprive others of the opportunity to experience the possibilities of self realisation? I have followed this wonderful path for 27 years and my life has been miraculously blessed, and those of my wife and children too.

<li>=&gt; Donot delete this as I know Wikipedia is a open site for giving useful information to all. This page seems to be correct and useful in all regards as far as I know. I know many of my friends and they all have benefitted from this simple meditation technique. The most important point I have noticed is that they do not charge you a single pie. What I feel personally is that the persons who are asking for deleting are those who are at least aware of Sahajyoga. It is something like this that you go to Swimming Pool and by someone's mistake if one drowns then you say close all swimming pools. They might have tried to use it for their personal needs or some ego hassles with some local Sahajayoga persons. So I feel it is just some human reaction which seems to be very natural. But Sahajyoga as a whole as i have seen is quite beneficial, so no point in delting it. Yes you can verify the facts from independent agencies. I know thay have an NGO for Destitute Women in India and one Hospital also in Mumbai. So seems to be good organization. - Rajesh <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rajeshhwr (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__Rajeshhwr_6dcb.html" title="Special:Contributions/ Rajeshhwr">contribs</a>) 23:36, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a>. It seems to me that the problems that NovaSTL has with this site are being rectified. People are adding in citations but these things take time. Primarily I would like to point out that Sahaja Yoga International is a worldwide organisation that is a registered charity hence it does not fall under the definition of a company or corporation. The practice of Sahaja Yoga gives thousands of individuals a means to connect with themselves. There are numerous cases of individuals who have practiced this form of meditation and have found improvement from conditions such as ADHD, (see link to published papers). The stabalizing benefit of Sahaja Yoga meditation is the reason that it is being offered in many prisons around the world with positive outcomes. What proof do you require if not verification from links to external sites telling you about the individual organisation activities ie the music school in India and the internation school, links to newspapers articles discussing the merits of Sahaj Yoga in reference to drug abuse recovery and also regarding studies on Sahaja Yoga meditation carried out by a well know Australian hospital?

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> This article should not be deleted. The alternative name "Vishwa Nirmala Dharma" has ~15,000 hits on Google and provides ample background information and evident proof that such organization exists in multiple countries and has positive impact on everyday lives of the practitioners. There is also a significant amount of press coverage around the globe which is slowly added to provide more evidence. Also note that "Sahaja Yoga International" is an official name of the organization which denotes the international nature of it and is not frequently used. If you search for "sahaja yoga meditation" on Google you get ~28,000 hits. So the argument is of technical nature and has no basis. If you search for "International Business Machines" which is the full name for IBM, you will get 48 million hits versus 348 for IBM because the abbreviated name is used much more frequently.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Sahaja Yoga is a teaching of Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi based on the ancient knowledge of the traditional Indian yoga which is described in the Vedas and Upanishads. The new in Sahaja Yoga is the awakening of the energy Kundalini on mass level. The word yoga is a Sanskrit word and means union or connection. Yoga is the union of our individual energy Kundalini with the all-pervading energy of the Universe - Paramachaytaniya. For many thousands of years spiritual seekers were trying to raise this energy but only a few could achieve it. The unique contribution of H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is that She could help the spiritual seekers in their quest for truth and awaken some strings of their Kundalini. Now a days thousands of people from all over the world are practicing Sahaja Yoga meditation and experience on daily bases it's tremendous benefits. Sahaja Yoga is one of the most practical systems of self-knowledge and self-improvement. That's why it is funny, even pity if some people try to present it as a cult. The only way to understand where is the truth is to experience it. Please visit [ <a href="http://www.sahajayoga.org" class="external free" title="http://www.sahajayoga.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahajayoga.org</a>] and get your self-realization online.

<li>PLEASE DO NOT DELETE. Before doing Sahaja Yoga, I too was of the belief that many a cults and faiths are surrounding the humanity and none of them have anything inside. This assumption kept me away from Sahaja Yoga for a long time...until one day I said to myself, "Why Don't I try it?". And when I tried it, I felt the cool breeze in no time and effortlessly achieved the thoughtless aware state. 1. This state has been well defined in different words in different holy scriptures of ancient religions of the world. 2. This is a distinct experience and NOT a matter of faith. 3. The continued practice of Sahaja Yoga has actually, NOT Assumptiously, brought much improvement in my health and personality. 4. As I have seen, almost 80% of people can have experience of this kind in first sitting itself. 5. No money is ever charged for doing Sahaja Yoga. 6. It is voluntary. 7. There is no membership of Sahaja Yoga. 8. It has high potential benefit for the humanity as a whole. 9. No loss of any kind can be envisaged for anyone trying or doing it. 10. No real or potential harm is caused to society. I request all the dear brothers and sisters of the world not to discard Sahaja Yoga as a cult. It is a happening thing...not just faith.

<li><b>Keep</b> Apart from the controversial areas, I believe Sahaja Yoga has an organizational aspect which deals with the facilitation of needs of yogis. VND (Vishwa Nirmala Dharma) functions on national levels, but for international projects, I have seen the increasing use of Sahaja Yoga International as a term. There are many projects in joint collaboration with non-affiliated entities having presence in multiple countries which has prompted the use of this term (SYI).havanhelper

<li>Sahaja Yoga is not a cult. It is rather a method that makes people more true to their own religion, as it awakens the kundalini energy inside them, and thus, gives them Self Realisation, therefore bringing them closer to their Self, their roots, the truth inside them. Shaja Yoga, and its recent name Vishwa Nirmala Dharma is known and practised in almost 100 countries at present. For people who are reading this and have not heard about it, try to explore a little bit around, you'll find it in your city, for sure! You can check our official site: www.sahajayoga.org, and you can find there the adresses of most of the Sahaja Yoga centres around the globe. Sahaja Yoga, through its practice, offers the individual relief not only from common diseases, but also from psichosomatic diseases, field in which the alopathic medicine is not effective. The most spread disease that attacks more or less each and evry individual nowadays is STRESS! Sahaja Yoga is very effective in combatting stress. These effects have been scientifically proven through medical tests on practicants, such as brain scans, galvanic skin resistence, etc. I have personally participated to some of them. In CBD Belapur, New Bombay, India there is a Health and Research Centre in which patients are treated for any disease only through Sahaj techniques by using the beneficial effects of the Kundalini energy. In India Sahaja Yoga is attested as alternative medicine by the government. Also I am a little bit amazed by the persistence and perseverence with which some people use their wrong, truncated and out dated information to denigrate Sahaja Yoga. If one checks theis site, there is no name of the authors there. In their own words, they are only about 25 ex-members of the group. The Sahaja Yoga organisation numbers many thousand yogis only in a country like India, but it is present in almost 100 countries around the world. In this way, I am very sorry, but this ex-members group constitutes a petty minority. In Sahaja Yoga people are absolutely free to come and to go whenever they wish so. We are conducting free entrabce programs for new-comers and free means not only free of cost, but the netrance is absolutely free, irrespective of the religion, cast, colour of skin, gender, social status, etc, there is no point for any kind of discrimination. In the same way, nobody is stopped from leaving the organisation whenever and however he wants. There have been very few occasions of expellation from the organisation, and they were on serious grounds of either financial fraud, or violence, or sexual misconduct. And they were decided by Shri Mataji herself after according the culprits several occasions of improving their behaviour. As regarding marriages in Sahaja Yoga, I am myself a person married by Shri Mataji in the Sahaj custom, and I can say that not only I was never forced to do so, but I am very happy of the decission taken. I know many people in Sahaj Yoga for many years who opted for not marrying in this way and nobody ever forced them to do it or opposed to the decission they have taken. Everybody is free to choose the way he or she wants to marry. Moreover, maybe only 10% of the people who are filling the marriage forms are finally married. It is our desire to have a life partner that shares the same beliefs that prompts us to request for this kind of matching and not anybody forcing us. Also the percentage of divorces is very low in such marriages. Also I have two children and I can say from my own experience that nobody evr put pressure on me to send them to the Sahaj School in Dharamshala and I am not doing it either. There are several families like mine, of Sahaj Yogis who are not sending the children to the school without having any trouble at all because of that. Around the world there are thousands of yogis and there must be tens of thousand of school going Sahaj children, but presently there are only two Sahaj schools. So, it would be practically impossible to accomodate them all. People must have wrongly understood the initial messages of Shri Mataji, from the time when this school had just started and She was encouraging Sahaja Yogis to send their children to this institution. In fact the whole image that some people give about Shri Mataji is very weird to me. She has never been bossy or ordering anybody. Like a real mother She only advises people. And everybody, on any level of Sahaj Yoga practice, is absolutely free to follow or NOT in his own life. She exerts absolutely NO control NOR takes any decission in anybody's life!!! She has filled our lives with so mach joy and happiness, with so much fulfillment, without ever asking for anything in exchange! The money matters of Sahaja Yoga are so transparent that every cent is dully accounted for. Yes, we are contributing for the advancement of this organisation, because we want that this awareness reaches as many people as possible, so that they can also enjoy the benefits of it. We can give as uch as we want, nobody is asking for it, and we do it for financing the diverse projects that this organisation has undertaken. The money have been invested in properties in different countries, that are not used by Shri Mataji, She hardly lives in those houses(maybe one week a year when She visits the respective country), but they are donated for the use of Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yoga practicants live there throughout the year. Also there are some social projects. like helping the destitude women and children in India, that are getting nominally financed. Everybody is giving as much as he wants and feels responsible for and every cent is well accounted for, with name and date dully noted. Also nobody is forced to do so if he does not want to. He can still come and attend te programs, even if he does not pay, and there are many doing it! So I feel Shaja Yoga is verily a non-profit organisation that has transformed the lifes of milions of people, including those who are no more its members, and therefore deserves a mention in Wikipedia!

<p><b>Comment</b> This discussion is not about the notability of Sahaja Yoga, If you have been directed here by someone else, please be aware that this discussion is not a vote, and is not about the question of whether or not the practice of Sahaja Yoga is notable. There is <i>already</i> an article on Wikipedia about <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a>, and it is not in danger. The reason for this discussion is about whether there should be a separate <i>secondary</i> article about the organization known as <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_International_eedf.html" title="Sahaja Yoga International">Sahaja Yoga International</a>. In order for there to be a <i>second</i> article about this subject, it needs to be proven that the organization known as SYI has independent fame as a company. If not, it is more appropriate to merge information about SYI into the already existing article about <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaja_Yoga_8ae7.html" title="Sahaja Yoga">Sahaja Yoga</a>.

<p>As noted on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_unsolved_problems_in_Egyptology_ab4e.html" title="Talk:List of unsolved problems in Egyptology">Talk page</a>, this list is mainly a list of questions with no answers due to gaps in our knowledge of the past. They may never be answered. This list can go on and on in that regard. Furthermore, most of the questions smack of "educational" sensationalism that appeal to TV viewers but not serious research. They beg for Original Research and are POV. Also as stated on the Talk page, those questions which are legitimate can be asked and discussed on their respective articles pages.

<li><a href="../../../u/n/s/Unsolved_problems_in_physics.html" title="Unsolved problems in physics">Unsolved problems in physics</a>, and indeed the other articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_unsolved_problems_e2b8.html" title="Category:Lists of unsolved problems">Category:Lists of unsolved problems</a>, are lists of questions with (as yet) no answers, too. The important consideration is not whether the questions have answers, but whether they are verifiable and not original research — in other words whether they are properly documented as being unsolved problems and gaps in our knowledge, and more than just one person in the field of egyptology regards them to be unsolved problems. Given that the article cites <i>four books</i> as references and lists six more in its further reading section, it appears, from that alone, that the problems with the article are mainly ensuring that all content is properly verifiable from multiple sources, ensuring that the article isn't overpowered by the speculation of just one source by ensuring that each individual item has multiple sources, and ensuring that the summary at <a href="../../../a/n/c/Ancient_Egypt_c49a.html#Open_problems" title="Ancient Egypt">Ancient Egypt#Open_problems</a> matches the article.

"Mysteries of Egypt/King Tut/Ramesses II/the Great Sphinx/etc." sells better than "Problems and Priorities in Egyptology". It has nothing to do if there is, in fact, an unsolveable problem but marketing. Most of the questions posed are either answerable but not sexy ("where did the Egyptians come from?" Egypt); not knowable ("Was King Khufu (Cheops) a good ruler or a tyrant, as later tradition described him?" never going to know that without a time machine and what is a "good ruler" anyhow? Good according to whom? Us or the Egyptians?); or require a long answer that is better handled in an article ("What were the origins of the Egyptian pyramids? When and where was the concept of pyramids conceived? What were the pyramids used for? How were the pyramids built? When and why did the era of pyramid building end?" all answerable to one degree or another, but not quickly). The list is pointless. <b>Delete</b>—<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlembles_9d71.html" title="User:Flembles">Flembles</a> 10:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>("where did the Egyptians come from?" Egypt</i> That was pretty funny, but kind of misleading. Example the Egyptians of today are partly or largely Arab so they do not originate from Egypt. Hence the question asks if the ancient Egyptians originated there or were also from elsewhere. In context this is rather clear. Still many of the questions in it now are too subjective or meaningless, but there are legitimate unsolved questions in Egyptology.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The atheist community is obviously going to be a smaller subset of the population that that of christianity. The Rational Response Squad is a notable entity. They play as one of the two most popular shows on the <a href="http://www.freethoughtmedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.freethoughtmedia.com" rel="nofollow">largest free thought internet radio station</a>. If you base the minority of the population which subscribes to such a station, any atheist internet radio show would not qualify as "notable". I would say that endoresements by people like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Carrier_fd31.html" title="Richard Carrier">Richard Carrier</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Harris_%28author%29_3eaa.html" title="Sam Harris (author)">Sam Harris</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Flemming_4943.html" title="Brian Flemming">Brian Flemming</a> would be enough to consider them notable. The Rational Response Squad carried out a "War on Easter" last year, distributing copies of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Who_Wasn%27t_There_e98b.html" title="The God Who Wasn't There">The God Who Wasn't There</a>, an atheist dvd exposing reasons christ couldn't have existed, all across the nation through various members. Their genesis of this event alone qualifies them as notable, and the article is definitely encyclopedic. --Cbenard 16:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Various reasons to keep this include, and are not limited to, many hits on google and other sites, hundreds of thousands of listeners weekly, thousands upon thousands of myspace friends, and an intruiging yet thought provoking glimpse into Atheist America. To delete this, we must also delete Sean Hannity and his radio show, as well as Rush Limbaugh.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Following what Cbenard said, the "War on Easter" was talked about on Fox News XM and Sirius Radio. "RRS" has about 20,000 friends on their myspace account, and they don't use "myspace as their homepage" as another person said. Their site is RationalResponders.com which is a thriving community. Furthermore the Alexa rankings for the site are innaccurate, as Alexa often is. The site seems to not be registering traffic since they changed their site, as you can see they used to be much much higher in Alexa rankings but for some reason in a time period when they are experiencing more traffic, Alexa says their experiencing less. On their website you can note their traffic fluctuates from 200-1000 visitiors at any given time. --Infidelaholic 16:45, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The RRS is one of my most visited pages. They make an argument that is growing exponentially across this nation and world. Its points are phenominal, and logical, and worth pondering. As an Atheist, they give me a voice towards the "Christian" world that now "Believes" it controls this country.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As a Christian I feel its good to have the point of views of both sides, not matter how extreme. It makes for good discussion and debate. (why was this comment deleted and replaced with "keep?")</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>."....anyone who wants to verify our page can take a few minutes to research. Another charge is that we use myspace as a homepage, however RationalResponders.com is our website which gets 30 new members per day and represents the largest growing atheist community in the world..." I believe that right there is a good enough reason to keep. It's a rather large &amp; fast growing network and will continue to do so. They are reliable for real information &amp; radio shows, they always keep everything up to date, and they are just a great orginization overall, which makes me proud to be a member of it. Even if they do happen to get a bad rating from alexa.com or wherever else, they're relatively new, and need time to cut into a groove and learn &amp; form themselves entirely. For an orginization that's as new as they are, they're doing incredibly well &amp; better than most groups would at their stage of development. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacunaSerenity_9ba4.html" title="User:LacunaSerenity">LacunaSerenity</a>, member of the RationalResponders.com.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that the RRS needs to replace the self-promotional marketing text with a simple, factual representation of who and what they are. There're a legitimate topic for a wiki article, it just shouldn't be a mouthpiece.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems the first few delete votes were vandalized and changed by the following address: 68.232.151.145 Also Alexa doesn't work, it relies on unintelligent computer users to keep a spam toolbar on the browser.

That said, I am not too humble to admit that there seems to be a neutrality issue with the article. However, deletion of the article based on that is silly.

<li><b>Comment</b> I saw those two sources, but I do not consider the <i>Register</i> to be a reliable source, and the BBC report is prior to the collapse of the company, barely mentions Sporting Options and so does not support the contents of the article.

<p>- lack of verification takes care of the rest</p>

<li><b>Comments</b></li>

<p>I mean, i think there are lots of lists here on wikipedia which i personally find a lot more worthless than these, but then squattign is an interest of mine and i appreciate that the lists are not verified at this time, although perhaps Mladifilozof, who recently created most of these pages and perhaps is still learning the ropes of wikipedia, will provide verification. There is already the list of notable squats on the <a href="../../../s/q/u/Squatting.html" title="Squatting">squatting</a> page and i hope i have moved all the blue links to that list, which can be expanded as necessary. I find it a shame that Squats in The Netherlands is also going to get deleted, becuase it is a list which has existed for quite a while and i personally find useful. moreover, i am slowly working through the squats making entries out of them, but i guess for now they can stay on the notable squats list. Further, I think its a shame Leuko is going about the deletion in this way, as i have already pointed out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Squats_in_UK&amp;diff=80669306&amp;oldid=80575209" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Squats_in_UK&amp;diff=80669306&amp;oldid=80575209" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leuko&amp;diff=80670008&amp;oldid=80494793" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leuko&amp;diff=80670008&amp;oldid=80494793" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

Yes, the incident gained a lot of press attention, but it really doesn't need its own article, in my opinion, just like the Britney Spears driving-with-baby-on-lap incident doesn't deserve its own article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm really uncomfortable with deleting an article with all of those sources cited, even if I can't check them right away. The reason given for prodding, that it 'may not represent a worldwide view', also seems inapproriate to me. It seems to imply that we can't write about a subject that applies to only one country.

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> The article has a number of notes and references at the end, but they are not tied to the statements in the article as footnotes. Please see an article which uses footnotes and place references in the text so a reader can tell which reference is supposed to substantiate which statement in the text. Otherwise there is a huge task for the reader which should have been done by the editor. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 21:21, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Cleanup</b> The references are wonderful, and would make a strong framework to an article about perceptions of high school age cliques and stereotypes.

<li><b>Keep</b> unconditionally. I agree with <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a>, though, that the references should be tied to statements in the article itself.

<p>The information seems OK, but I don't like the name of the page, it seems a bit vague. Maybe I should put this on "requests for rename-age", but I don't know the template for that. So it's here instead. Plus, the page has gone nearly 2 years without any editting, so I've a feeling the info is somewhere else anyway. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDangherous_d22f.html" title="User:Dangherous">Dangherous</a> 17:10, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Not really analogous. In the real world, politics are central to the workings of the nation.

<dd>Perhaps, but, the point is, just getting press coverage isn't the same as establishing notability in the first place. I, too, have gotten press coverage, but good luck finding my article, which also doesn't belong here. The point being made is that, if having some press coverage is all that can be said to support keeping the article, it is unlikely to be worthy of inclusion in an encyclopaedia. I'll also note that the presence of even less worthy articles does not justify the keeping of this one. GassyGuy 06:37, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I ask the person that started this - what makes this not notable now compared to other AfDs? You must remember that Wikipedia is not just about what is present, even if it is not a static encyclopaedia. Other YouTube users are arguably less notable than Emmalina was, and yet we still keep their articles. This is a pointless vote by an unsigned troll and the request by the subject does not equal deletion. It should be kept. I would, however, support a merge to a Notable YouTube users page if that were suggested.

<dd>Basically, I'm saying that, while not having any press coverage at all may be grounds for deletion, having some isn't automatic grounds for inclusion. Do you really think everyone who has an article in the special interest sections of newspapers should be included here? This is a basic summary of what happened: She had some videos on Youtube that people watched. She got hacked. It got a bit of coverage in minor newspaper sections. The end. It's not really the sort of thing that belongs in an encyclopaedia. Press coverage might make it a borderline case, but really, there's little to push her over into celebrity status. Think of it this way - every paedophile who gets caught and convicted by <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perverted-Justice.com_ab76.html" title="Perverted-Justice.com">Perverted-Justice.com</a> will have people on the web reading their story and also get newspaper coverage of the conviction. Does that establish encyclopaedic notability? (Note: I apologize to Emmalina for using the example of criminals in comparison to her, if she is reading this. I do not mean to imply that she has done anything at all to be held in a negative light. It was just the only other case I could think of that involved extensive website coverage and minor newspaper coverage.) Anyway, I think I'm rambling, so I'll quit trying to explain myself and let the AfD carry on its normal course. GassyGuy 07:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete.</b> This happens all the time on YouTube. Videos enter top lists and get a lot of views over some time especially if it's covered by media. The problem is she just got hacked and that was more the reported news than her as an influental Internet personality. How about just covering the event as e.g a blurb for notable YouTube events in the YouTube article? I can not even agree with the article's main premise about her becoming a "virtual star". -- <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthgrove_5a5c.html" title="User:Northgrove">Northgrove</a> 22:20, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Update</b> - Good idea. I've put a shortened version of the article under Notable YouTube memes (a subpage of the main <a href="../../../y/o/u/YouTube_8dd1.html" title="YouTube">YouTube</a> page), which derives its notability from YouTube (as it is YouTube that makes the publicity out of people) rather than they being notable in themselves (let's face it, this article wouldn't be here without YouTube). Some of the articles were too long so they can have their own page, but this one is not worthy of its own page - but a small mention under that article is more appropriate.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> - the main thrust of the arguments from those arguing to keep is that she is notable enough to have an article (I know there are other arguments but I'm summarizing) and that the circumstances surrounding her death confer that notability.

Further, I find the nom's arguments to be wholly unpersuasive and irritating in tone; nom seems to view AFD as a POV battleground and routinely spams to friendlies on votes. This one, for example, was pre-discussed among a little group of early voters. That last said, and I've been wanting to comment on this longstanding abuse of the AFD process for a long time, this person has no notability beyond Scarborough.

<li>Sure, you knew what I thought, because <b>you</b> had asked me to nominate it for AFD and I refused. That's not the point, but it is indicative. I am here participating because of private communications <b>off</b> the talk page; a one-off or two is no big deal, but it's becoming systemic at least with this nom. The point is that there has recently been a tremendous amount of pre-discussion of AFD's among politically like-minded editors, crucially this is <b>off</b> the article talk pages. These voters are quickly informed of the nom's and swarm in to create a snowball before disinterested editors ever have a look. I don't like it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Notable with 862 Google hits and numerous newspaper articles. The story also had a bearing on Katherine Harris's present senate race, per the article. A healthy woman in her 20's, working in a congressman's office, was found dead from a whack on the head, and the medical examiner decided she fainted from an undiagnosed heart problem (she was a runner) and fell and hit her head on the desk? The Florida papers raised serious questions about the lack of openness in failure to release the records of the investigation, and about the medical examiner's past. Keep this along with the Chandra Levy article.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In fairness to Scarborough, especially given that Katherine Harris reportedly brought this up in her campaign, if it is shown to be a tragic but non-notable death unrelated to Scarborough, the facts that show that to be so should be laid out somewhere, and it seems too much space would be required in the Scarborough article for an adequate treatment, which it does not have at present. For comparison, the death of Marilyn Monroe (certainly notable) was officially ruled to be suicide by drug overdose, but there is another long article <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_of_Marilyn_Monroe_bfdb.html" title="Death of Marilyn Monroe">Death of Marilyn Monroe</a> about it being suspicious and possibly due to murder, far more tabloid than anything in this article. The <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vince_Foster_7429.html" title="Vince Foster">Vince Foster</a> article bandies about tabloid theories that he was murdered by the Clintons, despite official findings of suicide, so there are precedents that a coroner's ruling does not prevent conspiracy theories being discussed in a NPOV way on Wikipedia.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 07:31, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You've misinterpreted my comment, then, Jimbo. I was not literally comparing Oswald to Klausutis. Obviously, Oswald <i>has</i> been the subject of far more media attention and study than Klausutis, that goes without saying. The only reason I invoke Oswald's name is as a hyperbolic example, extending the logic of a previous poster's fallacy - which is basically that Klausutis didn't do anything notable <i>before</i> she got her share of posthumous media attention. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 13:52, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Wikipedia is not dredging anything for political gain, Wikipedia is reporting on the existence of an individual whose death has been dredged for political gain by others - and it is that which makes her sufficiently noteworthy for an article - an article which debunks the myth that any competent authority has suggested that her death was anything other than an accident. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 18:03, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with Fred Bauder that "She is only notable because her death was used by unscrupulous mud-slingers as fodder for scurrilous aspersions." I don't see that as relevant, though. The statement concedes her notability. There are lots of people who become notable for bad reasons. They're still notable. (There's apparently been no attempt to delete our article about a fairly run-of-the-mill criminal named <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willie_Horton_c2c6.html" title="Willie Horton">Willie Horton</a>, who became notable only because his story was used by others for political purposes.) As for merger, I think that would be much more <i>unfair</i> to Scarborough, because giving this much information about the incident in his bio article would be undue weight. The one paragraph it has in his article now is about right, with a link to this article for anyone who wants to see the details (details that largely support Scarborough's position). I don't agree with the nom's argument that the presence of this article is undue weight, because that concept refers to space allocation within a more general article.

<dd>Wikipedia is already the conduit for scurrilous but notable aspersions, such as George W. Bush's deliberate lies about Saddam Hussein, or the Smear Boat Vets' deliberate lies about John Kerry. My view is that we report notable aspersions, whether they're valid or scurrilous. If your view is that we suppress information about notable but scurrilous aspersions, then you'd have Wikipedia editors deciding what's scurrilous.

<dd>That is not a rationale for keeping <b>this</b> article. It is a rationale for <u>writing an article</u> about the exploitation of the poor woman's death for political gain. We have to be very clear that the article text must reflect the topic of the article. Mrs K's life was non notable except to her loved ones. Her death per se was not notable either. The <u>use</u> and abuse some people made of her death is notable, and worthy of consideration for an article. But it is absolutely wrong to put this into an article "about Mrs K", because it is not about her. So, yes, report notable and verifiable aspersions and controversies, provided such is encyclopaedic reporting not journalistic pap, and create as many relevant articles as you wish. But this article is not the article to do it with. It has genuinely no notability and should go forthwith. Write the article about the way Mrs K's untimely death was exploited by various parties, and, provided it meets the guidelines here, there will be support for that article except from politically blinded folks.

<li><b>Comment</b>: That would raise the issue of what's relevant. The second paragraph is purely biographical -- age, education, family. It seems to me that <i>everything else</i> in the article has some relevance to Scarborough. Would you clutter his article with all this detail, or would you expunge the information from Wikipedia entirely? Neither solution would serve our readers' interests. Also, as a practical matter, the wrangling between advocates of those two approaches would waste a lot of editorial time and energy. Having a separate article makes it easier to keep the incident in perspective in the Scarborough article <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 15:36, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe your logic to be flawed. If it is about Scarborough, then it is right for it to be in Scarborough's article. If you want an article about the abuse of her good name, then it should be in an article about that abuse. In neither case does it have a place in this lady;s biography, which remains wholly non notable in our terms. She fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; as such her article, her <i>biographical article</i> should go. As for expunging the information, if placed in a correct article, and if it is in itself notable and verifiable, then it stays. If not then it goes. We do not change the rules because this is thought by some to be a special case. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 16:30, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think everything about Scarborough should be in Scarborough's article, because of the clutter factor. Other than the second paragraph of this article, which is purely biographical, is there anything in this article that you think should <i>not</i> be in the Scarborough article? <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 17:03, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Clutter? That is what section headings are for. There is no clutter factor. If it is about Scarborough and meets among other things <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, put it neatly in Scarborough's article. Or put it in the accuser's article, or put it in a new article about the disgraceful incident and put a <i>See also</i> in each. But the scandal etc had nothing to do with the Mrs K ecept that her death was abused in this manner. And Mrs K is not notable within our guidelines, so this article should go. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 17:19, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Her death had nothing to do with scarborough either. It was "unscrupulous mud-slingers" trying to link the two. The mudslingers are adequately covered in Scarborough's article and elsewhere. But repeating their "scurrilous aspersions" such as details about the coroner's or Scarboroughs marital status or even mentioning Chandra Levy as comparison is beneath encyclopedic and puts Wikipeida in the role of "mud slinger". Stopping false light libel is not censoship. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 17:40, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Utterly absurd rational for nominating this for deletion, part of a long series of suspect AfD noms. Undue weight is an invalid rationale as has been pointed out, policy states: "None of this is to say that tiny-minority views cannot receive as much attention as we can give them on pages specifically devoted to them." The undue weight provision would apply were this subject treated at this length in the Joe Scarborough article, where it would overwhelm the rest of the article. This article is sourced and deals with a subject discussed in the mainstream media by many, including Scarborough himself. We delete articles that libel the subject, we don't delete articles because we fear that sourced, verified facts might cause someone, somewhere to get the wrong idea about someone. It is not an "attack" or a "smear" (and is insulting to the editors who believe that such information should stay in Wikipedia to claim that it is such) and in fact the article flat out exonerates Scarborough from any wrongdoing - as it should - as he was not even in the state at the time. When <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katherine_Harris_bc1c.html" title="Katherine Harris">Katherine Harris</a> wanted to use the death to attempt to smear Scarborough, as was widely reported in the media, it was universally regarded as a desperate, undignified act by a rudderless and failing campaign. Everyone who hears this - except <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Moore_f401.html" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> - seems to think better of Scarborough, not worse. So it's bizarre for us to treat this matter as some sort of insidious thought virus that makes everyone think Scarborough is some evildoer. And it would be bizarre for us to delete something that's been reported on plenty of times in plenty of contexts (the original incident, the Imus show, Moore's attack, Katherine Harris, etc.) and would meet no objections regarding notability were the matter not politically charged. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 17:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>What's your point? You've nominated it for deletion, not for merging, and the article has expanded to the point where a seperate article is probably warranted to avoid the "undue weight" problem. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:11, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li>The information that exonerates scarborough (as if he needed to be exonerated) is already in the scarborough article. The information is covered adequately there. There is no reason to maintain a biography on a non-notable person that died from natural causes in order to keep alive vague, unsubstantiated claims of wrongdoing. "Undue weight" in this context is that 80% of the article about this person's <i>life</i> is about what happened after her death and how it related to a person we cannot even establish that she knew in any way other than being employed in a remote office. --<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 18:23, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The "reason" to maintain it is the same reason we maintain anything, as a historical record of notable events. There is sufficient media coverage in multiple contexts to justify the article. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:32, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then Jimbo and I will have to disagree on the matter. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 18:38, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yes, Jimbo Wales is the creator of Wikipedia, and if he wants to delete it, he can. But he voted. and his vote was solely in reaction to vote above his. There should at very least be a mention of this somewhere on the 'pedia, even if it's stuck in the Scarborough article. But it seems she merits her own article. It's not like we're making an article about the band who played for the local high-school talent show; she <b>does</b> have notability. -<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatstuart_7fbf.html" title="User:Patstuart">Patstuart</a><sup><a href="../../../p/a/t/User_talk%7EPatstuart_e8fd.html" title="User talk:Patstuart">(talk)</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patstuart_a3f0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patstuart">(contribs)</a></sup> 18:43, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So, Gamaliel see this article as having merit because there is something awry with the person who nominated it? Doesn't matter who nominated it, doesn't matter if the nominator is the devil incarnate, we have a community that judges, not a nominator. It is very simple, this article is biographical. It contains stuff that is about something else entirely. That stuff has to go. Once that stuff is deleted there is nothing remotely notable in the article because it is about an ordinary lady who died in her office. Deeply unfortunate, horrible for her family, and not notable for anyone in the world except them. The scandal after her death is absolutely nothing to do with her biography, except that, should an article be written about the scandal <u>and</u> should her biographical article survive, it merits a wikilink in a one line statement along the lines of "Certain parties attempted to make political capital about the [[death of Mrs K]]. How hard can it possibly be to grasp that an article must be about the "thing in the title" and not about some other stuff? The other stuff goes in its own article. If you feel strongly enough about it, write the other article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of the delete-sayers (that is, the few who aren't simply saying "non-notable" and leaving) seem to be of the opinion that Klausutis doesn't need an article because she did nothing notable apart from dying, and garnering media attention after death. Seems to me this is sufficient, but consider some of these articles on Wikipedia: <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean_McConville_c148.html" title="Jean McConville">Jean McConville</a> was a housewife whose only notability was that the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army_cef2.html" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">IRA</a> killed her. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Tibble_26b1.html" title="Stephen Tibble">Stephen Tibble</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_McCabe_a7da.html" title="Jerry McCabe">Jerry McCabe</a> were cops whose only claim to fame is, again, being killed by the IRA. <a href="../../../g/i/l/Gillian_Clark_98cb.html" title="Gillian Clark">Gillian Clark</a> is apparently notable only for being killed in Iraq. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Levy_095b.html" title="Rachel Levy">Rachel Levy</a> was a child whose only notability comes from being a victim of a bomber in Jerusalem. <a href="../../../b/e/h/Behnaz_Mozakka_b1b4.html" title="Behnaz Mozakka">Behnaz Mozakka</a> died in the London subway bombings.

And I've tidied up a bunch of your other edits. Proving citations where I can, which you NEVER do. If I thought this article was salvageable I would try to fix it, but it ain't salvageable because it just ain't encyclopaedic.</dd>

<li>That article is there because of the amount of information available about the book, and published specualtions about what it may contain.

<dd>If they don't deserve an article, then yes, they would get deleted. But Danny Phantom is NOT a huge show, not nearly as big of a show as SpongeBob or even Fairly OddParents. If we were to compare Danny Phantom to Chris Noth's character on <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_%26_Order_27ea.html" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i>, he wouldn't even come close to being as deserving. My logic is that the only reason they're on WP is because a fan of the series wanted them to be on it, not because they thought that all of these characters were notable enough (many characters likely were put up for the first reason, but they survive because they pass the second). Danny Phantom has little exposure outside of the source material. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:17, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why not? It seems like your reasoning is based more on the fact that you don't like the show and don't personally think it noteworthy.

<dd>One, SpongeBob SquarePants gets more than 6 million Google results. SpongeBob is a huge show, which appeals to young and old alike. And while DP appeals to many including me, it's just not nearly as notable. And the Google results are skewed - the possibilities of Danny and Phantom appearing in the same page but not referring to Danny Phantom are significantly higher than someone saying Fairly and Oddparents, but not meaning to say Fairly Oddparents. SpongeBob warrants a page because of his massive popularity. Danny is not nearly as big or as notable, so why does he need to be separate from a list of the main article? Is there a pressing need for him to be separate? Hell, why do these other characters need to be? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 21:58, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One, you stated he was as notable as SpongeBob, when he clearly is not. Two, a Google search for Danny Phantom is evidence that the cartoon is notable, not that the character is. Danny Phantom does not transcend his source material. If Danny Phantom warrants an article, then why don't King of All Cosmos, various Advance Wars characters and Blue from Pokémon (significantly more notable than SpongeBob x1000)? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 22:06, 14 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, I said he wasn't as popular. Popularity comes in all shapes and sizes. Popularity does NOT equal notability. Personally, I'm not in favor of President Bush as many people aren't, which makes him unpopular, but his notablilty doesn't lower because of it. Why doesn't all the characters from Pokemon have an article? Because most Pokemon only make one-time appearances. Only popular Pokemon like Pikachu should have articles, if there is sufficant information enough to withstand it's own article. If it's going to be a short little stub, merge it. Ash and other characters that are major characters should have thier own article (I haven't checked to see if they did or not though). Minor characters from Danny Phantom should be merged onto one page. Major characters that have lenghty articles that describe different ascpets of a character does merit it's own article. And your comment that a Google search on Danny Phantom equal that the cartoon is popular, but not the character is completely ludacris.

The only reason I don't agree with the deletion is because I think main characters of a TV show are notable enough for thier own article.

<dd>But Moe, how can you argue with your own logic? You stated that my AfDing of these articles makes me an ultra-deletionist, so why aren't you an extremist keepist when you do the opposite?

<dd>Don't call me Moe. And you're the one wanting them gone. Speculation, exaggeration and lack of solid argument does not help your case. You want us to agree they should be deleted, remember? However, I think you were referred to as an ultra-deletionist because of your apparently fanatical obsession with removing these articles. Moe might be an 'extremist keepist', but he'd not defending the articles for the sake of defending them... merely, as I understand his arguments, because he doesn't agree with your reasoning or methods. --Jace Draccus 08:48, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't speaking to you, so I didn't call you Moe. And what are you talking about? When another user speculated that these articles need to stay because it's good for most Wikipedians it's fine, but when I say that most Wikipedians would probably agree with me I'm a fiend? And I like how you point out that I am apparently being fanatical in my pursuit to have these articles deleted. What should I do to not be fanatical? Vote to keep them? Another hypocricy - why is it that Moe can accuse me of being an ultra deletionist because I happen to vote to delete one group of articles, while Moe could never be an extreme keepist for voting to keep this one group of articles? - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 19:56, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Stop being lazy and address Moe in replies to Moe then. Let's keep things orderly. I never commented on another user's speculations, only that your speculations are entirely irrelevant as 'most wikipedians' are not voting on this article, so saying 'most would vote delete' means nothing, as most who have voted went for 'keep' (Ok, yes, I editted, it didn't make sense before--Jace Draccus 20:53, 18 October 2006 (UTC)). If you're referring to the 'speculation' I think you are, then look at their reasoning as to WHY they think its good. And argue it with them... as for not being fanatical? Stop quoting rules that don't exist, and find some justification more solid than 'OMG IT'S NOT AS POPULAR AS SPONGEBOB SO IT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT'... and don't flag EVERY article relating to the show for deletion. That's a napalm approach. Better to review each article on its OWN merits. Also, learn to read. I said Moe _may_ be 'an extreme keepist', but I defended his REASON for being so. Which has more to do with the Wikipedia process than a personal bias towards the show, unlike your portrayal of your reasoning. --Jace Draccus 20:22, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To Moe: But shouldn't I actually have a strong bias to have a strong bias towards somkething? How am I acting? Oh, I know what you mean - I must hate Danny Phantom because I'm not making an article about every single orgamism in the Danny Phantom series.

<dd>Moe isn't basing his arguments on anything as absurd as 'It's not as popular as Spongebob'... also, the bit about how you're not writing about every single organism in the show so you must hate it? No, that's absurd. The fact that you're so relentlessly against the articles, against even the main character having his own article, to the point that you're fervently proposing a massive delete bomb of 20-30 articles, tells us you hate it. --Jace Draccus 23:34, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So deleting the character articles means I cannot like Danny Phantom? Can you imagine why I think that both you and Moe are incompetent fools? No human being with an ounce of intelligence makes such a claim unless they're just trying to make baseless accusations. You are either an idiot or are trolling. Next time you decide to act like a moron and decide that you know what I think more than I do, smack yourself upside the head and throw your computer in the trash. Whether you're an idiot or a troll, you ruin the internet. If you are an idiot, let me explain something - I like Danny Phantom. I have stated that. But you seem to not like to bring up evidence that hurts your otherwise solid point that I hate Danny Phantom. Apparently, someone didn't consider that the fact that one likes Danny Phantom kind of shows he doesn't hate it. But then again, can't let logic and reality stop you from accusing those who dissent from your opinion of bad faith. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:18, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Oh, do you want me to bring up the comments you made about how un-notable Danny Phantom is, to the point that even the main character shouldn't have his own article, and how much less popular than Spongebob it is?

<dd>To Draccus: You make it sound like telling everyone what their opinion is - even when they have told you that it's not - is perfectly alright. And no, I would prefer you cease your incessent lies. How does "Danny Phantom isn't notable enough to have character articles" mean "Danny Phantom isn't notable?" Tell me - if I thought DP wasn't notable, why the Hell wouldn't I nominate the TV show? And, the sarcastic comments come from you spreading bullcrap. "Because he doesn't think Danny Phantom isn't notable enough, he hates Danny Phantom". And another bullshit statement! I never knew one Wikipedian could be quite as laughable as you two. I was responding to a comment that Wikipedia should be as extensive as possible. You claim I'm distorting things when you make false claims? Psh. And being an ass about it all? Timeline: Created AfD. Watched people vote Keep a bunch o' times. Watched Moe spew fuck a few times. Watched Moe, etc. make baseless claims. Asked for proof of these things. Watched Moe, etc. make baseless claims and refuse to give proof, began to assume bad faith. Then I acted like an ass. That was the point where I acted like an ass. Not your viewpoints, not getting flamed, being told that I am wrong about the facts of me and you both are right and that I must be acting in bad faith because... well, no reason provided, apparently. So my AfD is in bad faith because I have a thing about dirty liars? Then can I invalidate your vote for being a potty mouth? And how exactly am I not the victim? What does you attacking me first constitute? Are you the victim because I actually asked you to not make bullshit statements? And to Moe, it makes me look bad when you tell half truths. Of course, it doesn't make you look good when people see all truth. Such as the idea that most people would vote delete being in response to someone saying that these articles are good for most people. Can he proof it? No. Can I prove what I say? No. So basically, my proofless statement is bad and his proofless statement is good. I guess that it's not so bad when you want to believe what they're saying, eh? Grow up. You may not want to admit it, but you both are dead wrong. All you have been doing is making up false statements about me. You tell me I hate Danny Phantom (and continue insisting it after I prove you wrong by *gasp* revealing that your baseless accusation is incorrect), that I hate character articles (yeah, because I've AfDed so many character articles, like Wario and Lakitu... oh, my bad, I featured those), that I made several of the above statements towards you (when anyone who is capable of reading can tell who I was speaking to). The only reason I'd assume bad faith in either of you is because you have both been trolling towards me by telling me I am incapable of having my own opinion and must be reminded what my opinion is. But of course, I'm not assuming bad faith, because it's against policy. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 06:36, 19 October 2006 (UTC)

Show me one single statement I made about you as a person or what you actually think, rather than how you come across. Quote my supposed bullshit, my false statements. You can't. I said nothing about bad faith until the post immediately above, and I have not ever insisted you hate THE SHOW. The only thing I said CLOSE to it was that you SEEM to dislike it. I have never tried to tell you what your opinion is, only that I don't agree with it. --Jace Draccus 07:01, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As for watching Moe 'spew fuck', apart from his vote he hasn't posted anything that wasn't in response. Don't make it sound like he's just saying things without any trigger. The proofless statements... fine, it was an idiotic thing for the other guy to say. Doesn't make yours any better? Happy now? --Jace Draccus 07:11, 19 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>"Except for the fact that you haven't responded to my request for a non-idiotic statement to prove that your accusations aren't actually bullshit." That's one of two that I've found where I ask you or subtly ask you to show evidence by pointing out you have nothing to back it up. You attacked me by making false statements. I couldn't care less about personal attacks, it's when people lie about me. Additionally, the only time I made the insults was when the both of you had told me that I hated Danny Phantom (and how does "it tells me that you hate Danny Phantom" not telling me that I hate Danny Phantom? You seem convinced that I hate it with out any good reasoning). And no, not wanting characters from the show to have articles is not logic to assume I hate it. I do not come across as a Danny Phantom hater. The fact that I don't think it's notable enough to warrant character articles has nothing to do with what I think of the show itself. And yes, you have said I hated it.

You have me AfDing Danny Phantom character articles as your only logic for both (and me saying that I like Danny Phantom, but why ruin a solid point with something that destroys it?), while I have the fact that you assumed bad faith in my actions, assumed that I was doing this out of hatred of the series and hatred of character articles (more bad faith) and started cussing while responding to me. - <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> <a href="../../../a/_/l/User_talk%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_c879.html" title="User talk:A Link to the Past">(talk)</a> 00:33, 19 October 2006 (UTC)'

<li><b>Comment</b> - We might take Gettysburg, PA as a guide. There is a short entry there for the Civil War battle, but the battle core has its own entry. I would say that perhaps this belongs in a subsection of "The Southern Theater of the American Revolutionary War" or "History of South Carolina" which are both too short. The importance of the Marion's efforts and its relevance to the popular movie "The Patriot" suggests we retain the content somewhere. I think it unwise to lose it in just another town history.--Beanmf 13:48, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Seems to be a largely unsourced and unecessary <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">point of view fork</a> essay. I've been tracking this page since its creation. The original contributor said it was based off of someone else's essay, so when he was warned about that, he slapped on the "major revamp" tag. It's been almost two weeks without any of the issues being addressed. I spoke to the user on the talk page without really managing to get anywhere. Anyway, I think this breaks the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">no original research</a> policy and should be removed considering it's basically an opinion essay. <a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 21:53, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>We don't need proof that the film will be made to know that there are media reports on it, to know that other pepole have written about it, for it in fact to be, verifiable and notable information. Yes, unsubstantial rumors are one thing, but this seems a bit more, since James Cameron did do an interview with IGN on it. That said, I already said I wouldn't mind a merge and redirect, as the article could be expanded later, so I really don't see your point. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:21, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep All</b> If you delete <b>any</b> of these pages, okay, say someone was doing a project on the history of WWE, where would they go? I did that project, and I got all my information from sites like these. How would you know who won the match at <a href="../../../w/w/e/WWE_Bad_Blood_aa8d.html#2004" title="WWE Bad Blood">WWE Bad Blood 2004</a> between <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Benoit_0875.html" title="Chris Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> and <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Jacobs_42a9.html" title="Glen Jacobs">Kane</a>? Exactly, you wouldn't, because WWE doesn't post them all the time. And plus, Wikipedia posts results at least 5 minutes before WWE.com even does. And it's their PPV! So I say, like most of the posts, thats just a <b>Bad Faith Nomination</b>. <a href="../../../b/u/d/User%7EBudd16_217b.html" title="User:Budd16">Budd16</a> 18:25, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep All</b> I don't see how you can nominate any annually held performance. Of course, I am biased, but how are some PPVs worth keeping and others worth deleting?

<li><b>Keep All</b> Annual Pay-Per-Views, are an immortalizing thing for a WWE Superstar, much like the SuperBowl is for American Football players or the Cricket &amp; Soccer World Cup.

<li><b>Keep All</b> I think that the WWE is important for many people and all PPV records should be kept on Wikipedia. But maybe there is no need to include background info. Just include blah def blah 2006 or something. adeyinka 19:54, 18 October 2006 (AEST)</li>
