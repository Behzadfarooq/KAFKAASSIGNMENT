<p>This page is impossible to maintain. There are thousands of battles in human history and they would all be impossible to organize into one page. This page is only biased toward some of the most famous battles. Also, this page now includes many non-battles (sieges, etc..). Some battles listed in red font actually exist so this page is becoming misleading.

<li><b>Comment</b> It may just need cleanup. Obviously, there are thousands of battles, but only the notable ones make it onto Wikipedia, so I don't think it would be too impossible to maintain. Of course, there is the problem of deciding which name of a battle to use when placing it on this list.

<li><b>Comment</b> - some lists in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battles.html" title="List of battles">List of battles</a> are very good. The page <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battles.html" title="List of battles">List of battles</a> does need expansion however. Some lists of battles will be impossible to maintain and should be deleted. I work with Wikiproject Military History and it is our goal to add every single battle in human history to Wikipedia, no matter how big or small it is. All battle are inherently notable (as historical events). Creating a list of The Most Important Battles would violate <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a>. A list of battles with the most casualties already exists. If this list of battles is deleted, I will consider nominating other obsolete lists for deletion. Categories work well for many of the battles. Lists are only required for Battles of certain characteristics (casualties, certain event, etc.) --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:01, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please, please, please remember that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> would keep "every" battle from having an article, thus restricting the list to only the most important and historically notable ones.

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh I know.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not agree much with Geographic list either. It omits a lot of battles.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am hoping that this AfD would bring a new test which determines what battle list is necessary (and good) and which is just impossible to maintain and obsolete. Please give opinions on the matter. In my opinion, such a test would help idealize the Lists of Battles. I am acting in Good Faith and do not wish to cause any harm to Wikipedia by doing this AfD. I just want the lists of Battles to become good, and I do not think that some of the lists are good at this moment. --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:06, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Looks fine to me. List can be sorted multiple ways, and the red links let me know what articles still need to be written. Why is the excuse to delete a list always that a category exists, and the reason to delete a category is that a list exists?

<dd>dude, the "list of battles 1200-1300" is just a subheading in a "list of battles chronologiocally" page. It divides it up and allows you to jump to a particular time period. You can have them all in 1 big list with no divisions if you like, or you can dividde them by war, or into centuries, or by war, as well as by century. It just serves to make it more manageble. Some battles weren't really part of a major war, or perhaps a war only had one battle, so you'd only give the title of the war where there were an appreciable number of battles in it. Others would be group together.</dd>

<p>I'm not sure why naval battles isn't an acceptable category for you, while "battles during ramadan" is. Does ramadan change the nature of the fighting considerably?

<dd><i>after fourth edit conflict&#160;:)</i> Hmmm, I do feel that a chronological list (separated somehow into different time periods) might be useful.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I have put a link to this AfD page on the Wikiproject talk page. Hopefully some experts will come and speak. But either way, in my opinion, a list of ALL BATTLES, should not exist. --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:33, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see an alphabetical listing as a particularly useful axis for navigation, especially when there are lists/categories that organize the material much more effectively. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarom_7c23.html" title="User:Carom">Carom</a> 02:44, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The alphabetical list is, admittedly, pretty useless, as it's redundant to the categories (which already follow alphabetical sorting) in the local sense and to Wikipedia's search function in the global one. As it's additionally fairly difficult to maintain, I don't see a problem with deleting it.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>More generally, the intent of lists is to provide a form of navigation that categories and templates do not. For battles, navigation by country (via <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBattles_by_country_14a5.html" title="Category:Battles by country">Category:Battles by country</a>) and war (via <a href="../../../b/a/t/Category%7EBattles_by_war_f606.html" title="Category:Battles by war">Category:Battles by war</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/WP%7ECAMPAIGN_9407.html" title="WP:CAMPAIGN">campaignbox templates</a>) are done fairly well without lists; the lists of battles for each country and war are thus often redundant (although they may still be useful, in some circumstances). The major—and very obvious—form of navigation that categories do <i>not</i> provide, however, is the chronological; categories are sorted alphabetically, which makes it quite difficult to arrange battles in order when browsing them. Here, lists—in particular, the lists of battles split into centuries (which are really just chunks of a single timeline of battles that has been broken apart due to size constraints)—really excel; I think that this application of lists is the primary one that ought to be retained.</dd>
<dd>Which is not to say that the current form of these lists is the most useful, of course. In the long term, I think it would be best to combine these with the corresponding chronological list of wars to create a grand Timeline of military conflicts (which may need to be split into chunks) that would list, for each year, the wars and corresponding battles that took place. <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:47, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that it is a good idea in the long run. But for now, why not create categories for conflict during each time period? --<a href="../../../i/n/e/User%7EIneffable3000_f9fb.html" title="User:Ineffable3000">Ineffable3000</a> 02:50, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Um, because the articles <i>within</i> the categories would still be sorted alphabetically? The point is not to have the set of battles in the Xth century, in other words; but to have a listing of battles in precise chronological order (the century part merely being a convenient way of producing readably-sized pages, nothing more). <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 02:54, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>This nomination is only discussing <i>one</i> list; if you want to suggest that others be deleted, you'll need to make separate nominations.

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_battles_%28geographic%29.html" title="List of battles (geographic)">List of battles (geographic)</a> - delete; classifying battles by the <i>modern</i> states where their sites are located isn't very useful (and was deprecated as a category option for just that reason)</li>
<li>Lists by country or by war - some of these may be useful; others are redundant with the categories and campaignboxes</li>
<li>Lists by period (battles and wars) - combine into a single timeline, as I suggested above</li>
<li>Lists of routs/raids/etc. - delete, pretty much impossible to determine neutrally what goes into these</li>
<li>Lists by casualties - possibly combine into the timeline through the new sortable table option; alternately, rework into articles dealing with the rich historiography of these topics <a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirill_Lokshin_7618.html" title="User:Kirill Lokshin">Kirill Lokshin</a> 03:07, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Kirill Lokshin, I think that Lists of casualties should stay as an independent list or merged into an article on war casualties.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd like to pinpoint the existence of new MediaWiki feature, <code>class="sortable"</code> tables, which you can see in operation e.g. <a href="../../../g/u/r/User%7EGurch_Reports_ArbComElections_4cb8.html" title="User:Gurch/Reports/ArbComElections">here</a>. While it should be used with judgment, it makes a lot of List of X (sorted by Y) lists redundant, as the user is now offered a database-like view of long lists that can be sorted at will. Perhaps converting/merging some of those lists to this format would keep the best of both worlds—maintainability and clarity on one side, and comprehensiveness and easy navigation on the other. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 12:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> there are simply too many of them.

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELIST_3b2a.html" title="WP:LIST">WP:LIST</a> - no reason for deletion, does not duplicate categorisation. To suggest it's "crufty" is absolutely absurd. If someone thinks it's "unmaintainable" - they don't have to maintain it. Merely <i>being a list</i> is not a criterion for deletion, but it's the only one anyone seems to be advancing. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:41, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No strong opinion, but most of these battles are well covered in lists in their respective wars. I'm really indifferent as to this particular master list, but would lean towards dumping it. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScott_Mingus_78b1.html" title="User:Scott Mingus">Scott Mingus</a> 14:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> all lists of battles, and suggest that a unified discussion be made for all of these several battle lists.

<li><b>Delete</b>. An alphabetical list is really no better than a combination of categories and a search engine, unless the list is expanded to include a brief summary of the battles, which I am not recommending here. The other problem with this list is its potentially huge size. There are many hundreds of battle articles simply in the <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Civil_War_90af.html" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> space. No reader could possibly find value in this list if it were expanded to be comprehensive. <a href="../../../h/l/j/User%7EHlj_9c70.html" title="User:Hlj">Hal Jespersen</a> 17:00, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> Any kind of battle categorizations would be unfeasible or biased (e.g., should absolute number of casualties be used as a yardstick, or should the proportion as a percentage of the army be used. Or perhaps as a percentage of the country?). <a href="../../../x/i/n/User%7EXiner_4ce3.html" title="User:Xiner">Xiner</a> 22:08, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> My main concern is that this topic is so staggeringly broad as to preclude it being ever completed or maintainable. Listing battles under their individual wars makes far more sense, trying to list what could be literally thousands of entries in a single category would make it an immediate candidate for subcategorization anyway. As it stands the list seems like an indiscriminate collection because it's just 'battles' coallated without context. Also, it begs the question as to what a 'battle' is in this context: only a pitched military engagement? What about longer engagements called 'battles' such as the Ardennes? What about the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mods_and_rockers.html#Second_Battle_of_Hastings_.281964.29" title="Mods and rockers">second battle of hastings</a>? Also: I think this will invite inevitable POV battles over what events should properly be called 'battles', with POV pushers one way fighting for something to be called a battle and POV pushers the other way trying to get them reclassified as 'insurrections' or 'attacks' or 'massacres' or something simularly biased. It's unmaintainable, vauge, unworkably large, and bound to invite division and editor conflict. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 22:10, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> This category is overly broad and impossible to maintain. A better approach would be to have individual lists of "<i>notable</i> battles of the X War". This would restrict the database to notable battles of noteworthy wars, and eliminate confusion between multiple battles fought at the same site. Stand-alone battles that were not part of a broader conflict may merit their own article, if notable. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcastel_4413.html" title="User:Djcastel">Djcastel</a> 19:00, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> - highly encyclopedic, and very useful browsing tool. This is the very type of material Wikipedia was created for, and battles comprise a key component of human history.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Kirill Lokshin (5 Dec input) ... argument makes sense that 'alphabetical lists' are largely redundant with categories, albeit without the red-link potential; however, red-links appearing in a more contextually relevant list are more likely to be targeted for authoring of new articles than those appearing in a purely alphabetical listing. --User:Ceyockey (<small><i><a href="../../../c/e/y/User_talk%7ECeyockey_b802.html" title="User talk:Ceyockey">talk to me</a></i></small>) 04:07, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
