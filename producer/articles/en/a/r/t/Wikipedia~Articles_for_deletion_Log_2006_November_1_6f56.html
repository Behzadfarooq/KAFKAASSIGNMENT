<li><b>Keep</b> -- Due to the specific nature of the Manning family. His 2 brothers are 2 of the most famous quarterbacks in the NFL today, as was their father in his day. This naturally leads to the question of what happened to the 3rd son. This has come up in my circles twice in the past month, so I looked it up today. I found the answer <i>(a career-ending spinal disease)</i>, and therefore I don't think this article should be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As part of our webcomics wikiproject, we went through and labeled every non-stub webcomic article we could find as start class or higher. It was not intended as a measure of anything other than that, for example, "Substantial/major editing is needed, most material for a complete article needs to be added."

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I've-heard-of-it-outside-Wikipedia yeppers, funny-like, yes, somewhat widely known, yes, but is it <i>famous enough?</i> This is a relatively young webcomic that has not really yet seen a lot of media exposure, as far as I know. I don't think that it's really all that remarkable that the people parodied in the comic (ESR, RMS, Linus, Gerv Markham, Bruce Schneier, etc) have voiced their opinions on the comic. They probably have a lot of opinions about other things too; we wouldn't write articles on that merit alone ("Category:Stuff that Eric S. Raymond hates" would be a pretty Uncyclopedic category). I guess it's probably better to delete it now, give it a year or so, and if it can be demonstrated it has grown beyond "a webcomic that a bunch of geeks really like" (as in "some real IT media mentions"), then it's time to work on this. And I don't really mind seeing a mention of it in <a href="../../../e/r/i/Eric_S._Raymond_ac9d.html" title="Eric S. Raymond">Eric S.

<dd>OK, based on a sampling of the articles I read, I think that they all are similar to this one in terms of not providing individual notability sufficient for separate articles.

<li>My bias is that I don't like reparative therapy orgs. However, Wikipedia has no policy (contrary to popular belief) that non-notable articles should be deleted. <i>However,</i> an article should not contain information that cannot be verified in books, trusted websites, the press, or even this org's newsletter. So the question is, is there such verifiable info this org exists? I find it hard to believe there is not. Even a brief mention will show it exists. Whether the rest of the info in the article is verifiable is not an issue here. That info should be removed and the article should remain a stub, but it still has a right to exist as a stub. --<a href="../../../e/p/h/User%7EEphilei_3ebf.html" title="User:Ephilei">Ephilei</a> 03:40, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

This guideline appears to contradict your assertion regarding popular belief. Re the continued existence of this article: the <i>proposed</i> guideline <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> says, "Individual chapters of national and international organizations are usually not notable enough to warrant a separate article unless sufficient notability [n.b., not mere existence] is established through reliable and verifiable sources." --<a href="../../../f/l/e/User%7EFlex_173c.html" title="User:Flex">Flex</a> 03:56, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. The term "Alive in Christ" is so common (there are numerous 100-year-old churches named Alive in Christ, for instance) that it's difficult to tell how notable this organization is from Ghits.

<li>I'm not saying it should be deleted <i>because</i> it has a generic name, I'm saying that to try to establish notability via Google is hard because of the name.

<p>This word is a transliteration of a Russian slang term (close in meaning to <i>sissy</i> or <i>homo</i>, see also <a href="../../../../ru/%D0%BE/%D0%BF/%D1%83/%D0%9E%D0%BF%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9.html" class="extiw" title="ru:Опущенный">ru:Опущенный</a>) created by an anon about a year ago.

In Google search there was just a few hits in English. For example, <a href="http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/204/594" class="external text" title="http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/204/594" rel="nofollow">this article</a> explaines usage of names for animals (<a href="../../../k/o/z/Kozel.html" title="Kozel">kozel</a> or a goat, <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korova.html" title="Korova">korova</a> or a cow, <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisa.html" title="Lisa">lisa</a> or a fox) in Russian and English languages. If petukh deserves an entry in English Wikipedia so are transliterations of many other Russian dirty, pejorative, or otherwise offensive words. The article looks like it describes the caste system in Russian prisons, but it does not, in particular it does not cite sources. I may accept mentioning of "petukh" in articles like Russian prison slang or pejorative usage of animal names, or similar. If this article would not be deleted I could only recommend creating a category for Russian offensive words. Also if you like this article, you may also like transiliterations of all terms in this <a href="http://www.prison.org/nravy/dictionary/p.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.prison.org/nravy/dictionary/p.htm" rel="nofollow">dictionary of Russian prison slang</a></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> IMO the issue here is the anthropological relevance of the subject matter. A look at <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prison_sexuality.html" title="Prison sexuality">Prison sexuality</a> suggests that it's highly relevant. Prison slaves are not just a Russian phenomenon, but petukhi provide a vivid example. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStammer_f699.html" title="User:Stammer">Stammer</a> 06:19, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>That they are but specific examples of a larger topic is why I suggested refactoring the article, citing the aforemented book (which discusses the social strata amongst Russian criminals that are revealed by prison tattoos), as one part of an overall topic. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:27, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Petukh in Russian means rooster, period. As many other animal names it also has a <a href="../../../p/e/j/Pejorative.html" title="Pejorative">pejorative</a> usage. In particular it is used with regard to a caste of <i>untouchables</i> in Russian prison. Opuschennyi which literally means <i>lowered down</i> also has pejorative usage, same as petukh. If you want to describe the caste system in Russian prison then use proper names, that is <i>untouchables</i>(<i>неприкасаемые, neprikasaemye,</i> also <i>izgoi, otverzhennye</i>) for the lowest caste. You can then include the offensive names for the <i>untouchables</i> (петухи, гребни, пивни, шкварные, опущенные, обиженные) similar to <i>chura, bhangi, neech, kanjjar</i>, and <i>mirasi</i> in <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalit.html" title="Dalit">Dalit</a>. I do not understand why some editors try to defend a troll who created the article on petukhs. If you want to describe the caste system in Russian prisons then do it properly, that is investigate the matter before trying to protect the trolling.

For me, I have learnt about the subject more than I want to know trying to build a case for the removal.

<li><b>Keep</b> --Good day dear friends.
<p>My name is <b>Sam Aberg</b>, art historian and international art critic, servant of arts for the last 30 years. I am also author of Maîtres &amp; Epigones, a book that describes today's famous canadian painters. Book that has been distributed at 5000 copies across Canada, Europe and the USA. It is sad to see that some wikipedians may have opinions about artists with just a single Google search, while it takes professionnals months before having a final verdict.</p>
<p>I do agree that Wikipedia must have rules to make sure its content meets notability and verific criterias, it is the base of any public encyclopedia. However, I believe it is a bit early to take decision before consulting experts in the art field.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>

<p>I have read the totality of this discussion, and must thank you all for taking the time to write very good arguments. You see, I believe everyone has a purpose in this world. I was lucky to get the gift to make people happy threw my art. Now, if your purpose is to destroy the work of a few trying to build something positive, I respect that. You know, beeing on Wikipedia or not, won't change anything to me; I will still continue painting, and I will still bring hope to people.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can delete this article if you want.</p>
<p>I wish you all the best in your careers, goals or projects. Just remember that you too one day will need the help from others. That day, God will remember.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Maryse Casol --Maryse Casol 06:18, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> To all the supporters and especially Maryse, do not take this issue personally. Because WP is open to all to edit, it has a constant credibility problem and so there are rules to try to keep at least a reasonable standard. Think about it if everyone decided to add bios on wp, it would not be a serious place. Maryse is a new artist, perhaps the article is a little premature given the WP standards. Copy the code aside so that it is not wasted editing, and perhaps in the near future, the existence of the article (if it gets deleted) will be non-disputable. --<a href="../../../s/h/u/User%7EShuki_ea5a.html" title="User:Shuki">Shuki</a> 20:25, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Delete ASAP</b> To gain notability as a visual artist, there should be critical discourse in recognized journal and periodicals, an extensive exhibition history, or evidence of a signifigant contribution to the discipline. There is no evidence of any of the above. Wikipedia shouldn't be a free-for-all where anybody with the time can create an entry. I would ask you if you think your artistic contributions should entitle you to be in Brittanica. If not there, why here. And to whomever put Maryse in the main wiki article for Painting, under the history of contemporary painting, should be ashamed.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Stronger evidence of encyclopedic notability needed to take this beyond web directory content. Also, Alexa rating is not totally reliable and is also vulnerable to manipulation. As this is a porn search engine company, they would be especially adept at spam-like tactics.

<p>Author deleted an attempt at a speedy.

<p>It seems that Wikipedia states deleting an attempt at a speedy is perfectly permissable so why is that an issue? The author of this article is also writing a book about pioneers of spirit communication and chose to register and enter an article about tobias mcgriff bc he is a relevant figure to this. Especially in the southeastern United States. The websites listed are merely matters of fact not an encouragement to visit. I suppose you would say that it was an attempt to gather followers if the sites did work though wouldnt you? Additionally, I am not sure why the author did not state some of the other works of Tobias McGriff but he is a multiple published author in online articles and magazines. I say you may want to delete specific referneces to websites and book names but the subject matter is relevant and to say that someone is a non-notable personage is very subjective. Someone that comes to wikipedid to research EVP would probably ver well be familiar with Mr. McGriff.

<p>I am Tobias McGriff and I say DELETE as well. I appreciate the emails I got yesterday telling me of this debate taking place here on Wikipedia (which prompted me to create an account today)from some folks who are fans of the work SPC is doing and I do believe a local writer (original poster) and a couple of other recruited people signed up in order to post positive comments on my behalf (to confim the above users post about Jdbuyers being a new user). However, there are historical inaccuracies in the "bio" part of this article, the websites and works given are inaccurate, and the person who posted it used my last name as part of their Wikipedia sign up name which seems a little odd-although I think Wikipedia is a pretty good site I do not want an entry in it about myself or SPC regardless of the noteworthiness or remarkability.

<li><b>Response</b> It should be noted that the article specifies "Before the server crash in March of 2006, which rendered SomewhatDamaged.net inaccessible to all of North America and many other parts of the world even to this date". For further validation as to the existance of SomewhatDamaged.net, please contact the administrator of Clandemonium.net at the following email address: admin@cdmhosting.ca. They should then be able to provide you with any and all information neccassary to "notarize" the website.

<li>You make a valid point, but to which I would ask you to "hold the phone" on the reccomendation that it be deleted. This is because the website should be back up sometime fairly soon, as should the premiering of the accompanying website, NepaDollz.com. This article is not inflicting any sort of damage on anyone, nor is it violating any reasonable terms of violation set forth by Wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Renholder5x (<a href="../../../r/e/n/User_talk%7ERenholder5x_23e5.html" title="User talk:Renholder5x">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Renholder5x_c03e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Renholder5x">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> meganfetter I would rather it wasn't deleted and I left a comment in the discuss with regards to this page. I am a little mad because the person who has put this article up for deletion has been trying to delete it ever since I have started writing it. It is not finished. Is there a way I can put that on the page? If you have a way I can change the article so it fits an encyclopedia better, I would appreciate it. This is the 3rd time I have asked for suggestions and no one has commented yet.

<li>How is this article a how-to guide? It is purely descriptive, describing the various methods that different people and organizations employ for learning Kanji. It is not instructional at all. (Contrast it with the textbook at Wikibooks.) We have perfectly good articles on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language_learning_and_teaching.html" title="English language learning and teaching">English language learning and teaching</a> and <a href="../../../t/e/a/Teaching_English_as_a_Foreign_Language_d864.html" title="Teaching English as a Foreign Language">Teaching English as a Foreign Language</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Okay, I'll change my vote to <b>keep</b> (it describes methods, but doesn't tell people how to do it), but the "learning Kanji" title is a bit misleading (I think the active phrasing is what caused people to think it was a how-to manual). Can we rename the article like the Kanji learning techniques or Kanji learning? <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 16:15, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

I do not feel that Wikipedia has any sort of systemic bias against Japan (quite to the contrary, thanks in large part to our many Japanese and Japanophile contributors), and I don't think that an article called "Learning Cyrillic" or "Learning the Greek alphabet" would be terribly successful at AfD. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 23:35, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. The topic is goal-oriented and thus unencyclopedic. The fact that it fails in guiding anyone doesn't take away from the fact that it's meant to be a how-to. The main section of the article, about the "number of characters to be learned," is written in terms that make it applicable only to foreigners studying Japanese. The topic sentences of both paragraphs are "Learners may be confused about how many characters they need to learn in order to read Japanese fluently" and "It is also not clear whether one must learn the entire jōyō kanji list in order to read a Japanese text" - logically, factually, and intuitively irrelevant questions to Japanese people, and written from the standpoint that there is a goal of learning the kanji. The lead discusses different methods of memorization. As noted by <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">User:Ergot</a> above, this is very much the equivalent of making an article called "Learning math" or "Learning words." <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 12:21, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> somewhere, I think; there is very little encyclopedic information here that is not already given in other places, and this article is a spam trap (man, just <i>look</i> at that external links section!)<br />
As for bias, how about the fact that this page discusses learning methods for a major writing system but only mentions one of the languages that use that writing system? It could possibly become a useful article if it also discussed teaching methods in China and for students of Chinese. There could be some interesting comparisons to make there.<br />

<p><b>Another comment</b>. I have to say, I'm quite confused by the results of this AfD so far. I note that there is a <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading_education.html" title="Reading education">Reading education</a> article. Compare the two and you find that the reading education article is based on actual teaching methods and research, while the learning kanji article is based on commercial how-to guides and considers the "learning" at a personal level. There is no attempt in the learning kanji article to discuss the use of any teaching methods, other than to note that Japanese schoolchildren memorize kanji. The discussed books themselves are, quite honestly, not for serious language learners. And, while not necessarily a perfect indicator of anything, all of the commenters I know to be in Japan have voted to delete. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekimasu_4909.html" title="User:Dekimasu">Dekimasu</a> 12:43, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Taking the "article" paragraph-by-paragraph, the opening two paragraphs simply repeat information from other articles. The third paragraph is a brief review of commercial how-to guides. The second section consists of two paragraphs speculating about the completeness of the <a href="../../../j/o/y/Joyo_kanji.html" title="Joyo kanji">joyo kanji</a> list that veers dangerously close to being original research. The entire balance of the article consists of links, either to various how-to books or systems, most of them off-site.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I questioned this article when it was first created. A year later, nothing about the article has changed. It can never be more than a collection of links, and as such is far more suited to a personal or commercial website than an encyclopaedia (can anyone imaging Britannica having an article like this?!)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Those who have voted to keep have not really provided any compelling reason to do so. No one has really given <i>any</i> reason beyond "this is not really a how-to guide." This is not really good enough, especially giving all the excellent reasons for deleting this article. If there was really a need for an article of this type, then it would have received a lot more attention over the last year, and would have morphed into more than the long stub it is right now. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:06, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think we've had the schools discussion enough times and for long enough for almost anyone to know there's an alternative route available that should be tried first. Corporal punishment by the principal really is the only solution, since unprovoked nomination of a school is six demerits, and only four demerits is an automatic spanking.

<li>Be careful, this will go on your permanent record. The beauty of Wikipedia is that every article is a moving target. Often (and I'm not suggesting that it be used as a justification), an AfD will impel those people who want to see worthy articles retained to take the time and effort to improve the article. Often the article that the nominator refered to and that many may have already voted to delete, is not what exists if another look was taken to see if appropriate changes have been made. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 01:54, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nomination for deletion as a substitute for the moment it would take to do a contributing edit, or to tag it for positive attention is not just a paddlin' but five nights detention as well. Seriously, deletion is a moderately hostile act toward every previous editor of the article. It's the equivalent of telling them "hey, your work is not welcome here", which is not a good response to good faith efforts. Please don't excuse, or even worse, legitimize it's use as a "cleanup on demand" tag. Either the topic is worthwhile, or it's not. I think we've firmly established that there are enough interested editors to prevent the deletion of schools, other than the odd one that goes through here unnoticed or has a genuine critical flaw. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 05:21, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Deletion is not a hostile act. I've had articles I've worked on get deleted. In some cases, I've totally re-written an article during the AfD only to have it still deleted. If that's what the community has decided about the topic then that's what is relevant. It says nothing at all to the editors in question. Anyone who feels that deletion is a hostile matter has a maturity issue. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 16:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Deletion is most definitely not a hostile act. As Dhartung said, when the article was nominated, it was awful. It was unsourced and made dubious claims of notability. The problems I had with it have been adressed. I didn't AfD it to GET it fixed, although I'm pleased to see that it has been. I think you're demonizing the deletion process a little overmuch, Unfocused. I'm not insulting the previous editors, just voicing an opinion. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 07:34, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Deletion being a necessary function does not make it any less a moderately hostile act. White blood cells attacking foreign germs is a hostile act, yet quite necessary to human life. Treat deletion as the hostile act that it is and we won't have nominations of classes of articles where there is clearly a well known, large and significant good faith opposition to deleting those articles. The first reaction to an awful article (especially those in a specific class where significant support has already be demonstrated) should be "can <b>I</b> fix this?" and the second "can this article be fixed by someone more interested in this topic?" If the answer to <u>either</u> is "yes", then nomination for deletion is wrong. No one says you can't trim an article down to the barest of stubs instead. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 18:41, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. As it presently reads, the article merely asserts that the poem is the longest <i>by this poet</i>. But um...so? I don't see anything at all notable in the wikipedia sense about this work. All we really have here is a <i>slightly</i>-annotated bibliographic entry of a non-notable creative work. The poet himself, Nikhil Parekh has a wiki page that isn't exactly over-crowded that could easily accomodate info about his various works, and thus those entries wouldn't need to meet WP notability criteria themselves. No reason to spread tiny tidbits across many sparse pages. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 16:41, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree, this has to be the world's longest poem by a poet, individually written. More so, it doesnt contain any elements of stage/drama/theater or any dramatical presentations, unlike many other long poems, which are merely stories or dramas or plays written in poetic form.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>This is what I meant exactly. This poem by Nikhil Parekh is the longest ever originally written in the English Language and with tremendous authority and command over the language. It is virtually seen everywhere on the internet and appears in countless internet search results of countless search engines. It has been written with great originality and panache and demonstrates the sheer genius of the poet. It would be really pathetic to delete this and a great loss for the English Language poetry. I see no reason to delete. I havent seen a poem longer than this one, which is so originally pure in English and which doesnt contain any elements of Drama, Theater--or for that matter isnt a theaterical representation in a poetic form. This one's pure poetry from the heart of the poet, not a novel or a story written in the form of a poem with elements and dramatic characters in it. This one for me is an irrefutable keep.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Coolkeg908 (<a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolkeg908_7ce1.html" title="User talk:Coolkeg908">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Coolkeg908_1fa0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Coolkeg908">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>If you're comparing these poems by Dickinson with Parekh's longest poem, then they stand or come nowhere near. His longest poem is far far long and the only of its kind written in modern English, which is the longest in the world. I havent come across any other poem in comparison to his which is as long and written originally in modern english, pure poetry, and that too individually. His longest poem rules, as far as the English language in its most original form is considered.Coolkeg908 04:17, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I hate to be the one to ask this, but are you the same person as Parekh? Such things happen all too frequently. I must insist that this is a simple question, easily answered. <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAuto_movil_93b4.html" title="User:Auto movil">Auto movil</a> 06:19, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Now this is really funny. Mr. Parekh musnt even be knowing what's happening here. From the looks of his biography here at Wiki, he is world famous and doesnt have the time to fall into such arguments. Whether a page of his remains here at Wiki or not, how does it matter to him. There are several by his name here and all across the world at countless places. And to further clarify your raised objection, well let me have a roar first, no , am in noway Parekh. Yes, but I have read his works and researched a lot on him on the internet like I do for several others. And I for one, havent seen a poem as long as his in the world, having gone through millions of other web pages. Hope this answers your rather silly query. Also, I would implore you to stick to the subject and not raise such objectionably silly queries here in discussion. I would also like to point Wiki's attention to your absurb objection, which is quite offending to a fellow Wiki editor such as me. Coolkeg908 08:40, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>It's a quite valid question in my opinion based on the pattern of your behavior here...symptoms of being a single-purpose account (as mentioned previously) and seemingly emotional attachment and intimate relation to the subject matter (poem and poet). Nobody's saying you <i>are</i> this other guy, but, as already noted, others <i>have</i> tried to play that game here. That <i>is</i> highly offensive to all editors and the way WP works, so a quick question of someone who has some appearances of that seems reasonable. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 09:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>We've established that the poem is long. Anyone can go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It seems in your arguments, the length makes it inherently <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notable</a>. That opinion is not necessarily shared. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 14:50, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, people can go on and on and on and on, endlessly. But then it should make sense. It should be articulately synchronized. It should be in poetic verse. It should be having/possessing some qualities atleast which distinguish it to be a poem. And this one by Parekh has it all. Its not just inundating the whole page with various combinations of words from the dictionary, from the first word to the last. That way, anyone could keep writing and writing and writing, without a break, and soon surpass Parekh's long poem too. But then its not a poem. Its virtual balderdash. Whilst this one by Parekh is a true poem written with great authority in the English language. It has a moral, a message and is poetically synthesized from the first to the last line. For me it should stay as I've said earlier, as its one of the most significantly written longest poems of the modern english language with great authority by a world class poet.Coolkeg908 15:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I am far too busy to hunt up stuff, particularly since I think internet sources are not what we need. This Shopping Centre has become a focal point. Many shops have been attracted to the area close to the centre. The cinema is taking trade away from those in the traditional centres and may have forced some of those to close. The swimming pool in Footscray is not to be re-opened because one is going to be built at Highpoint. Its affect on the community of the western suburbs is large. I do not think Shopping Centres are necessarily notable. This one however is.

<li>Thanks for the correction. I still think that keeping malls that don't have coverage by independent sources would be a very bad precedent, though, so I still feel strongly that it should be deleted. The notability guidelines are as much to keep cruft out as to keep us from having articles that are hard or impossible to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>, and a lack of independent sources definitely indicates that it will be difficult to write anything of encyclopedic interest in this case. The article as written contains nothing of note that is worth saying so much that we need an article. Their official site does the job of saying what it is much better than this article does, so the only purpose the current article serves is to be a directory entry. Without indepenent coverage, this article just can't be more than a hollow profile with a traffic-driving link. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:08, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is the third largest Shopping Centre in Victoria - see <a href="http://www.maribyrnong.vic.gov.au/Page/Page.asp?Page_Id=1753" class="external text" title="http://www.maribyrnong.vic.gov.au/Page/Page.asp?Page_Id=1753" rel="nofollow">the local Council's Plan</a>.

<li>Is'nt being a Super Regional Shopping Centre and the 3rd largest in Victoria good enough for you, or do you want to delete all articles on Shopping Centres? The sources for these are independant of the Shopping centre itself. Is'nt the Sydney Morning Herald and the local Council good enough? What criteria would you use to keep an article on a Shopping Centre in your neck of the woods? Australian Wikipedians are telling you it very large and notable. We have been there. Reporting on a place is hardly original research. I have been there frequently. It is 10 times larger than another Shopping Centre in Western Melbourne which has not been deleted although a "prod" was put it on in June. It is the largest shopping centre I have been in. I live in the area that has been affected by the building of it. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 21:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While I agree this list needs cleanup, it's because of some poor presentation on the page, not because of any real problem. This list at least tries to organize things better than the alphabetical <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MMORPGs_8c14.html" title="List of MMORPGs">list of MMORPGs</a> and should possibly be a model for that list to adopt. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:18, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Then <b>change <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_MMORPGs_8c14.html" title="List of MMORPGs">List of MMORPGs</a> into a <a href="../../../t/a/b/Wikipedia%7ETables_4234.html" title="Wikipedia:Tables">table</a></b>, one which mentions the MMORPG's name, genre, developer, publisher, and whether or not the MMORPG is free. --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 14:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In that case the list should be sorted in a better way than alphabetical. Perhaps divide it into Free and Pay MMORPGs? Cost and genre are generally the two most obvious deciding factors, but I think cost is more useful than genre because of the disproportionate size of the various genres. — <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDark_Shikari_e072.html" title="User:Dark Shikari"><span style="background-color:#DDDDFF; font-weight:bold"><font color="#0000FF">Da</font><font color="#0000CC">rk</font> <font color="#000099">Sh</font><font color="#000066">ik</font><font color="#000033">ar</font><font color="#000000">i</font></span></a> <font color="#000088"><sup><a href="../../../d/a/r/User_talk%7EDark_Shikari_d292.html" title="User talk:Dark Shikari"><i>talk</i></a></sup><b>/</b><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dark_Shikari_f6a3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dark Shikari"><i>contribs</i></a></sub></font> 14:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This page does not violate any of Wikipedia's policies on advocacy or advertising since the content does not benefit any anyone specifically. Also, Mister.Manticore is right; the List of MMORPG's article should follow this article's model. Merging this article with that one would completely defeat this article's purpose for existing.

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. If it's going to be merged into List of MMORPG's, then that list also needs to be cleaned up and made easier to read, possibly into tables and alphabetical as suggested by TBC, as the point of merging articles is not to make them harder to access/read. Also, if it's going to stay here, this page also needs to be cleaned up. Either way, there's lots of work to be done, but if merging brings no benefits, why do it in the first place? <a href="../../../d/d/c/User%7EDdcc_df51.html" title="User:Ddcc"><font color="blue"><b>D</b></font></a><a href="../../../d/d/c/User_talk%7EDdcc_6032.html" title="User talk:Ddcc"><font color="green"><i>dc</i></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Ddcc_e6ce.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Ddcc"><font color="black"><b>c</b></font></a> 16:49, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - my continuing problem with this article is in its definition of "song" and the seemingly arbitrary choice of 15 minutes as a cut-off. The inherent musical snobbery against anything other than prog-rock (seemingly) make the article inherently POV and I don't see what's so special about being unable to stop playing after a period of time most would find reasonable has lapsed. I remain <b>neutral</b> on the article's fate as there is a signifiant number of contributors which suggests that it is considered useful by a large number of editors. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 17:23, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Point of fact: the article does NOT give its own definition of a <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song.html" title="Song">song</a> - it simply refers to the pre-existing wikipedia <a href="../../../s/o/n/Song.html" title="Song">song</a> article. I would also submit that your argument about "a siginificant number of 'editors' find it useful" is fallacious - rather, a significant number of 14 year old boys keep adding their favourite doom metal songs to the list, etc etc - this is not "using" the article (as a source of info), it is just cluttering it with people's personal graffitti.

<li><b>Tricky</b>. The very-long-song is an encyclopaedic subject, in that it has an impact on airplay and so on. On the other hand, but it was common in the days of prog rock and some ambient and new age acts simply roll all the CD into a single track (a.k.a. "78 minute ambient drone fests" as so eloquently put above). Even though I do admire Brian Eno. Also the list seems to exclude classical songs and includes any popular <s>guitar wank</s> instrumental with vocal interludes, which displays systemic bias; how would one characterise, say, <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Warlock_9845.html" title="Peter Warlock">Peter Warlock</a>'s <i>The Curlew</i> (22:02 in one of my recordings)? What of songs whose duration varies per performance, as almost all classical music will? Are there secondary sources or are all the timings form record sleeves (i.e. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>)? What about songs without words? Do we count Mendelssohn's <i>lieder ohne wörte</i>? I'm strongly inclined to delete unless we can find a credible way of neutralising what is, put charitably, systemic bias (i.e. teenage fandom) and preferably pruning the list below its current one thousand entries (count 'em!) while still including well-known classical songs of unusual length. As to many editors proving usefulness, I disagree. It proves to me only that many bands' fans see yet another opportunity to add a reference to their band's name. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 17:24, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd question that any "hard work" has gone into people's contributions to this list: it is not as if anyone has written any carefully thought out text for it. In fact, it's not as if they've bother to read the rules for inclusion either - rather, they've just stuck in some random long track from their fave band. If anything, I think the argument bites the other way: it is discouraging for responsible wiki-editors to continually have to try and clean up crap like this. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to delete stuff which doesn't fit the rules for inclusion, only to come along again a few weeks later and see some twit has put it back in again.--<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFeline1_dd6c.html" title="User:Feline1">feline1</a> 12:22, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I repeat what I wrote the last time around: The list's selection criteria are <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">neither excessively narrow nor excessively broad</a>. The list does not contain an inherent bias, and is not by its nature an original research magnet as some other lists are. Yes, this is slanted towards people who come to Wikipedia looking for answers to trivia quiz questions. But so are the thirty-five articles listed at <a href="../../../p/o/t/Template%7EPotuslists_bc33.html" title="Template:Potuslists">Template:Potuslists</a>. And it is conceivable that a person who knew of one song whose title includes a telephone number would want to know whether there were others. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:17, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no encyclopaedia topic <i>previous occupations of United States Presidents</i>, yet you'll have a hard time making a case that this is grounds for deletion of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_previous_occupation_1df5.html" title="List of United States Presidents by previous occupation">List of United States Presidents by previous occupation</a>. That a standalone list does not have another article for it to be paired up with is <i>not</i> a reason for not having the standalone list, and does <i>not</i> make a list arbitrary. Standalone list articles have introductory sections for a reason, after all.
<p>The reasons for not having lists are whether the list's selection criteria are <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">either excessively narrow or excessively broad</a>, whether the list is original research, whether the list is unverifiable, and whether the list is inherently non-neutral.

<li>It's self-contradictory to say that something is indiscriminate and then to give its quite precise discrimination criterion in the same breath. <b>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" is not an indiscriminate criterion for deletion.</b> It is not a handy synonym for "I want this deleted.".

<li>I respectfully disagree, cannot follow your self-contradictory point.

I don't just stick to those accurate topics, I prefer to follow the statement above them - "something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia". And that statement, I believe, applies here.--<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 19:34, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>No, no, no. Please do not attempt to manipulate my positions. Cruft is one thing, verifiability is another thing. I do not agree with your immediate association. In fact, I think that my position was quite plain and not really atypical, I do not understand why is this dispute arising.&#160;:-/ --<strong><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_60c3.html" title="User:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">Hús</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusond_Esperanza_ea94.html" title="User:Husond/Esperanza"><font color="green">ö</font></a><a href="../../../h/u/s/User_talk%7EHusond_a306.html" title="User talk:Husond"><font style="color: #082567">nd</font></a></strong> 21:27, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The only person who is manipulating your position is you. When it is pointed out that list of things that Wikipedia not in the section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> that you refer to does not cover topics such as these you change your position to being that the article falls foul of a sentence at the beginning of that section. When it is pointed out that that sentence is a simple restatement of our "verifiability, not truth" maxim, and that the article is verifiable from sources such as the aforemented and others, you are now changing your position again. Your position is repeatedly changing, by the way, because you don't have a solid hook in our policies and guidelines to hang it off. And the reason for that is because the article subject doesn't fall foul of them. As I explained above, the issues of verifiability, original research, neutrality, and whether the scope of the list was either excessively narrow or excessively broad, were all discussed last year. Nothing has changed, and the article subject doesn't fall foul of any of them. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:52, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>I reject your argumentation. It is neither sound nor plausible. I still see no reason for keeping this and I am slightly displeased by your particular method to discredit my stance.

<dd>See my question for Dark below. How is this list any different from those lists of people who are left-handed? Catholic? Eagle Scouts? Personally, I don't like these lists, but if Wikipedia allows list of famous people, why does this one pose a POV problem when others do not? Also, all but one of the people left on the list can be confirmed as a Military Brat. I left one because her biography's sound like a person who could have been a military brat, and somebody obviously added her thinking she was.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 18:37, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

It isn't meant to be so here, but if you're not familiar with the history of the word it's a fair assumption. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 19:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Agreed... but if the criticism comes from a lack of understanding of the term, then I have to ask, does TBC still feel that the list is POV? I'm asking this because this is a work in progress, and I can't address the concern if the concern is based upon an incorrect understanding of the term. Does he say that it is "undeniably POV" because he sees the "Brat" and doesn't understand the meaning? Or is there another reason that I am missing that makes this list different from other lists of famous people? It also raises questions about the need to have this AfD if the original proposer did so failing to understand the term.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 20:03, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I've never said that I thought the term had some sort of negative connotation. Anyhow, yes, I do feel the list is still POV, mainly because the list contains numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;diff=85036336&amp;oldid=85007881#Possible_Military_Brats---branch_of_service_or_status_unconfirmed" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;diff=85036336&amp;oldid=85007881#Possible_Military_Brats---branch_of_service_or_status_unconfirmed" rel="nofollow">"possible" military brats</a>, meaning that the writer is only assuming the person is a "military brat". --<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 22:22, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Ok, I don't see how POV comes up, as there is no bias in saying they are possible military brats. In fact, given the comments afterwards, I'd say "Unknown Branch of service" would be a better title. But really, I think your criticsm is off-target. That problem isn't POV at all. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:45, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I deleted the ONE person whose status was unconfirmed. AS I mentioned above, all of the others (in that section) are known to be military brats, just not the branch of service. If you hit "Edit page" on your link you would see that all but one had comments associated with them stating that their status as a military brat was confirmed.

<dd>Responding to Manticore's comment, when the heading says "status unconfirmed", it gives me an impression that the author of the page doesn't know if the person is still in the army or not, thus POV. As for Ballonman's comment, please realize that when I first commented <i>none</i> of the "possible" military brats were confirmed.--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 00:57, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, we're discussing something because you brought it up. Now I would say this is clearly a better choice for the article's talk page, but you didn't bring it up there, so it gets discussed here. And while sometimes content does merit deletion of an article, it doesn't always. Too many people jump to deletion when other choices are much better. It's quite a bother really. And in response to your question below, we don't need a list of EVERY person. However, some folks like to see examples, so providing a few people is worth doing. Since the backgrounds of many people are verifiable, and that often includes the circumstances of their childhood, it's perfectly reasonable to put that information in this article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 15:18, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do we need lists of famous Baptist? Catholics? Left-handers? Personally, I don't like these lists, but the reason why one would keep it here is because [Military Brat] isn't simply a slang term. [Military Brat]s are people who have been affected by who/what they are. Military Brat is used to indicate one who has been affect by a particular culture.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 07:53, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>"Military Brats" is, and has always been, a slang term. Whether or not a person is effected by the term does <i>not</i> make it any more formal. For example, <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slurs</a> have often effected millions of lives, yet does it mean we should list many of the notable people that they apply to?--<b><a href="../../../t/b/c/User%7ETBC_96ba.html" title="User:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">TBC</font></a><big>Φ</big><a href="../../../t/b/c/User_talk%7ETBC_07e5.html" title="User talk:TBC"><font color="#007BA7">talk?</font></a></b> 19:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Ethnic Slurs are slurs, not a description of a culture or sociological group of people. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_Brat_c539.html" title="Military Brat">Military Brat</a> is a term used to describe a unique identifiable researched culture. To call a person an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> does not describe describe the socio-economic-cultural influences that have contributed to who that person is. It says more about the person using the slur. Psychologist and sociologist do not study <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slurs.html" title="Ethnic slurs">ethnic slurs</a>, they study the population that the slurs represent. <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brat.html" title="Military brat">Military brat</a> does tell you about the person it is used to describe. To know that somebody is a military brat tells you something about that person's upbringing and what made that person who he/she is. So your comparison to an <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_slur.html" title="Ethnic slur">ethnic slur</a> is a strawman agrument. I am still waiting for somebody to give me a reasonable rationale as to why a list of famous military brats is less appropriate than famous left-handed people! Or any one of the other lists on Wikipedia. I don't care for lists, but I'm still waiting for somebody to give a rataional why this list is worse than left handers!<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 21:51, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

If a list, by default is POV, then all of these lists have to be deleted. Many of them are not well cited. When I was working on it last night I eliminated a number of people I couldn't confirm and this has been a subject of discussion on the articles talk page. But is not worthy of deleting the article on this principle. I debated adding links to the one's I found, but chose not to for consistency.

Are you interpretting the list as "Mark Hammill is a spoiled brat" as compared to "Mark Hammill's father was in the military?" If so, then your concern about the "POV list" has been addressed.

<dd>Um, School life, Frequent and Unexpect moves, impact on Military Member's careers may be unsourced, but they are hardly "extreme" original research. I wouldn't even say it's original research. If you want sources try: <a href="http://www.militarychild.org/pdfs/press/ConferenceLooksMilitaryBratsJuly05.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.militarychild.org/pdfs/press/ConferenceLooksMilitaryBratsJuly05.pdf" rel="nofollow">[35]</a> or <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2001/n08202001_200108203.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2001/n08202001_200108203.html" rel="nofollow">[36]</a>. All these positions are well-represented in terms of study and reporting on them. Even Patriotism is documented elsewhere. Yes, this article may be poorly written, but your comments are an exaggeration. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 21:00, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still think most of it is original research. Remember, we are an encyclopedia, a secondary source; we are supposed to summarize and report in a neutral manner on what is written in <i>reputable</i> primary sources. All those sections do not cite any primary sources (and I frankly doubt you can find any neutral, respectable sources), so it very much looks like original research, or at least private opinion by the original contributor (which is also unacceptable by encyclopedic standards). I very much urge everyone to stand back and reflect, for a moment, whether this information is really appropriate for a respectable general-knowledge encyclopedia, such as Wikipedia aspires to be. <a href="../../../e/k/j/User%7EEkjon_Lok_8b74.html" title="User:Ekjon Lok">Ekjon Lok</a> 02:40, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Um, to me, it's an unquestioned "Yes, of course Wikipedia should have information on this subject" as Military brats are a distinct population, in fact, the whole problem of civilian depedents is a real issue of substantive importance, and it is unique enough to warrant its own article. And I'm sorry, but there is a fair amount of scientific study on them. Here's an example: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=S7E4fqYEgMwC&amp;dq=Military+brats&amp;psp=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=S7E4fqYEgMwC&amp;dq=Military+brats&amp;psp=9" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>. That certainly seems reputable to me. The US Gov't also does reports. See page 28 of this document <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0180.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0180.pdf" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> for a description of what the services do. I'm sure the GAO has more, but they have so much, it's hard to find things sometimes. But they certainly meet the criteria of a neutral, respectable source. There's probably more from other country's militaries, and having that would be important, but I must admit ignorance of that. I find your perspective on this article difficult to comprehend. I can understand saying this article isn't great, and needs work, but your arguments for deletion just don't make sense to me. Problems perhaps, but rectifiable ones. Why is this article any different than an article on <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_body_shape.html" title="Female body shape">female body shape</a> or <a href="../../../n/u/c/Nuclear_family.html" title="Nuclear family">nuclear family</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Wow what a terrible article in its current state - so full of POV and OR. The listcruft needs to be trimmed down as well (possibly to zero). However, all excessive harshness aside, "Military brat" is a term thats definitely widely used (do a title search on Amazon.com). Recommend after the AFD, the closing admin slashes the article down to a paragraph or so (or message me, I'll do it) and building it up from there using some actual sources.

<dd>I personally don't like lists of people, but before we get rid of the list, I want somebody to explain to me how a list of military brats is less acceptable than a list of famous left-handed people? Or Eagle Scout? Or people who suffered TB? Somebody (or multiple somebodies) took a lot of time to compile the list and without sound justification, I'm reluctant to get rid of it. I am not trying to be belligerent, but rather understand what the criticism is.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Well, I've been working on this page for about 5 hours now. It's 2:30 a.m. so I'm going to bed. I ask you to look at the article as it stood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=84869444" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=84869444" rel="nofollow">two days ago</a> and compare it to what was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=85036336" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Military_brat&amp;oldid=85036336" rel="nofollow">proposed for deletion</a>. Then compare that to what <a href="../../../m/i/l/Military_brat.html" title="Military brat">now exists</a>. This is a work in progress. I posted to the Wiki Help Desk asking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Help_desk#military_brats" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Help_desk#military_brats" rel="nofollow">| help/advice</a> because I knew it needed help---but there was only so much I could do in one night. As a person who has just recently started to become active on Wikipedia, this has been a very disillusioning process. I saw an article that was in desperate need of improvement and that has personal meaning to me. Start to work on said article. I ask for help/advice and instead of spending time improving said article, I have to defend it here. Yeah, I know that most people are saying <b>keep</b>, but that doesn't alleviate the frustration. BTW, the changes made tonight will be the last one's I make for a few days---I'll be travelling the rest of this week. But to be honest, I may or may not resume this endeavor when I return. Does the article still need help? Yes. I hold no illusions that it is finalized (I didn't even proof my own text), but I don't get paid by wikipedia to fix poorly written articles or put up with this. Again, as an essential newbie, this has turned me off of wikipedia somewhat.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 10:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also, the bar for inclusion is too low - there are battles listed (thanksfully without links yet) which are contained in fiction which is barely known, rubbing shoulders with the Lord of the Rings.

<dd>Then all we need to do is define the list even more. If you wish, you can even suggest how the list should be limited more. For one thing, the battles must be significant to the main body of fiction could be a good start. --Eldarone 04:55, 5 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I thought about that before I voted. However, I couldn't think of a way to limit the list without making it too crufty. A list of fictional battles in classic literature might be manageable, but I don't think that's what the keepers of this list find interesting. Once you open up the list to all fiction, it becomes unmanageable. It's an interesting concept for a list, but I don't see a way to make it encyclopedic. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 02:18, 6 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It dosn't have to every fictional battle, just ones that have signifcance to the main body of the work. Besides, many general articles don't have list of battles for their work. --Eldarone 03:55, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Categorizing. That is what <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategories_0080.html" title="Wikipedia:Categories">categories</a> are for.

<dd>The problem is, not every series is going to have a seperate article on each battle. Most are going to have a subsection of a larger article, and categories sometimes don't list every plot or background imporatant battle --Eldarone 18:29, 6 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That really doesn't hold up as an argument at all. Why would a fan of <a href="../../../f/i/r/Firefly_%28TV_series%29_5a5c.html" title="Firefly (TV series)">Firefly</a> want to know about the fictional battles in <a href="../../../a/n/i/Animal_Farm_e7d2.html" title="Animal Farm">Animal Farm</a>?

<dd>You missed my point. I said, "Why would a fan of X what to read about fictional battles in Y?", not "Why would a fan of X <i>and</i> Y want to read about fictional battles in both?" I also don't see what "comparative purposes" this list can serve - that there are more battles in Harry Turtledove's Timeline-191 than in Animal Farm? Well, paint me blue and call me Charlie. I never would've guessed that. Further, just remember that you liking or disliking an article has very little bearing on matters. I wouldn't mind seeing an article on myself here, but that doesn't mean that one should exist. Likewise, there are lots of articles I'd prefer didn't exist, but unless there's a better reason than that, it doesn't count. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:06, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, I have to disagree. It's because of articles that I and others "like" that we come to Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:09, 7 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's why you come here, I didn't say otherwise. What I <i>did</i> say, though, is that there are rules, guidelines and policies which govern what's actually included here, and "Someone likes it" isn't one of them. Like I said above, I'd like it very much if I had an article here, and one day I might, but that doesn't mean I need one now. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 13:20, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I agree with BigHaz. This seems to be part of the problem. To be blunt, you (and others) need to understand what Wikipedia is about, not turn Wikipedia into a free-hosting site for things "you like". <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:24, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Responding to Le Grand Roi: well, fine, make a copy of the list. But the community, backed by policies, seems to be deciding that Wikipedia is not the place for this sort of thing. Please understand that Wikipedia is not meant to cover everything. A lot, yes, but not every conceivable trivial list. Again, I point you to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_rivers_by_length.html" title="List of rivers by length">List of rivers by length</a> as an example of a well-designed list. Better to have a series of inter-connected lists, than one long, indiscriminate list. By all means, keep a copy of this list offline, and redesign it into a series of navboxes between different areas of Wikipedia (such as <a href="../../../c/a/m/Template%7ECampaignbox_War_of_the_Ring_5b58.html" title="Template:Campaignbox War of the Ring">Template:Campaignbox_War_of_the_Ring</a>), but in this format, it is not suitable for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 13:17, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It actually looks like a consensus has not been reached. I have no qualms against improving this article, which I think is always a good idea, but the concept is sound and so if anything should be tagged with a please improve comment rather than just outright deleting it, especially as some took the time and effort to start with probably the right intentions in mind. --<a href="../../../l/e/_/User%7ELe_Grand_Roi_des_Citrouilles_0219.html" title="User:Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles">Le Grand Roi des Citrouilles</a> 13:28, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's a sensible fictional subject to organize into a list, and it's sensibly divided by fictional source rather than indiscriminately merged. The original research problems mentioned above are corrected by editing, annotating, and sourcing the list, and as this list expands and becomes too unwieldy, subsections can be split off into other lists with this as the organizing parent. The list (or sublists that it organizes) can also mention battles that aren't worthy of independent treatment, and redlink articles that should exist. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 04:14, 7 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Ok. After further review, it seems the band qualifies for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">notability</a> by: "Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network." After some research, it appears the station NRJ has a weekly audience of <a href="http://www.rabfinland.fi/asp/system/empty.asp?P=121&amp;VID=default&amp;SID=982558227716311&amp;S=1&amp;C=20680" class="external text" title="http://www.rabfinland.fi/asp/system/empty.asp?P=121&amp;VID=default&amp;SID=982558227716311&amp;S=1&amp;C=20680" rel="nofollow">65,000</a> (slightly greater than 1% of the population) which in my mind qualifies it as a national station. Since one of the band's songs reached the top 10 list (source already cited) I have to assume that they were featured in the rotation. I'm not sure if they meet any of the other criteria mentioned in TruthbringerToronto's below comment, but they only need the one to remain on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobertbcole_6fcf.html" title="User:Robertbcole"><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">-</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">o</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:red;font-variant:small-caps">b</em><em style="color:blue;font-variant:small-caps">y</em></a> 18:28, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the record reviews count as "multiple non-trivial published works in reliable and reputable media", which is enough to say "keep". The NRJ Top 10 <b>might</b> mean that the band also passes "Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network" (if NRJ is a network) or "has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country." (if the NRJ chart counts as a national music chart, and if Finland qualifies as medium-sized) Is NJR a radio network? Is there a national chart service other than that of individual radio stations in Finland? Have they toured internationally? --<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 17:54, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> -- I've heard the phrase "Wikipedia is not a gazeteer or directory" before, or a rephrasing of it. I come here to this discussion because it is the first I have seen of its kind since someone pointed out to me that Wikipedia is becoming a business listings site. They pointed to this category as <a href="../../../c/o/m/Category%7ECompanies_based_in_North_Carolina_178a.html" title="Category:Companies based in North Carolina">an example</a> and apparently there are many more like it (I haven't looked). I must admit, I agree with the nominator strongly in principle, but am becoming increasingly confused about what WP:ITIS and what WP:NOT. Any thoughts? <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 20:32, 1 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, for starters, that is a category, while this is an article listing companies, meaning that articles in the category actually exist. Any companies that have articles should also meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or they'll end up facing deletion, so articles in that category are (presumably) notable enough for an entry. In addition, we wouldn't have articles for, say, an individual Pizza Hut or Subway (as in this list). We would mention the national/international chain, but not the individual chapters, unless it was significant (ie largest store in the world, the first Wal-mart, etc). --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:33, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> -- I actually think, to the common user, whether it is a category or a straight article (with the same number of blue links) – it all looks the same. I would vote "delete" if I thought it would make a difference. And I stated my personal case on the nominator's talk page as <i>I thought</i> it probably isn't appropriate here. An ongoing Wiki problem, I would say. <a href="../../../b/u/b/User%7EBubba_hotep_ee80.html" title="User:Bubba hotep">Bubba</a> <a href="../../../b/u/b/User_talk%7EBubba_hotep_1f80.html" title="User talk:Bubba hotep">hot</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bubba_hotep_258d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bubba hotep">ep</a> 00:47, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> – not that this is quite the right place, but while we're on the subject raised by the above comment, I'd love to know what people think about these two shopping centres (malls) having their own articles: <a href="../../../b/o/n/Bon_Accord-St_Nicholas_Centre_65ed.html" title="Bon Accord-St Nicholas Centre">Bon Accord-St Nicholas Centre</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Mall_Trinity_31c2.html" title="The Mall Trinity">The Mall Trinity</a>. The latter isn't even very sizeable. I'm not keen to nominate them for deletion on top of this nomination in case anybody decides I have an axe to grind (I don't, I'm just trying to maintain WP quality) but if anybody else feels like doing so...&#160;;) – <a href="../../../k/i/e/User%7EKierant_38a3.html" title="User:Kierant"><font color="#006600">Kieran T</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../k/i/e/User_talk%7EKierant_b16f.html" title="User talk:Kierant"><i><font color="#006600">talk</font></i></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7Ekierant_94e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:kierant"><font color="#006600">contribs</font></a>)</sup> 00:00, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is acting as a business directory and mostly lists national chains with individual stores.

<li>Guy and Danny Lilithborne, you really should do your research before making accusations like that. Why don't you take a look at the link below and then possibly revise your previous statements. <a href="http://www.insignia.com/content/contest/index.shtml" class="external free" title="http://www.insignia.com/content/contest/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.insignia.com/content/contest/index.shtml</a>
<p>Kassis, Michael 1 November 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.157.48.97 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.157.48.97_7e40.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.157.48.97">contribs</a>) 2006-11-01 22:49:08 (UTC)</small></p>
</li>
<li>Being my first post to wikipedia, please forgive any errors regarding my comment posting format, as I am currently ignorant of of what the norm may be.
<p>My vote is: <b>Keep this article.</b></p>
<p>While the current creation of this article is rather ill timed for reasons explained below, I am getting a bit tired of having it deleted all the time. (Though yes, there were times when it deserved to be deleted, because someone tried to make it a game guide)</p>
<p>This article is neutral (it does not try to convince you to play the game), it is not a game guide, it is a simple game overview.</p>
<p>And as Kassis said, above, it really has won an award. It was for the PDA version of the game client.</p>
<p>To Danny's comment "Beta test" means many different things to many different projects. There is no standard definition as to what a beta version. What it means is based on whatever the company or group wants. In the case of wyvern, it means roughly:</p>
<ol>
<li>fully playable</li>
<li>bugs exist, and are being fixed</li>
<li>content is being actively added</li>
<li>more bugs are naturally occurring from the new content, and will eventually/are be fixed.</li>
<li>game balance is not exactly where the wizards want it to be</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>I have played this game for 4 years, and can say from experiance that it is beta as much as open source projects are all beta.
<p>The game server is down, because Steve Yegge (know as "Rhialto" in game) is in the process of upgrading\switching the operating system (supposedly ubuntu). Unfortunatly, he is having more problems than expected. He wants to make absolutley sure the server and game are secure.</p>
<p>One can see what the website looked like simply by looking at a cache. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:d3JqGxL0HGEJ:www.cabochon.com/+wyvern&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:d3JqGxL0HGEJ:www.cabochon.com/+wyvern&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1&amp;client=firefox" rel="nofollow">link</a></p>
<p>If you think having server problems means an article should be deleted, I must disagree. If the World of Warcraft servers were all taken down due to severe problems, nobody would say "well, time to delete all information from wikipedia about this game". If something happened, and the game was never playable again, then the articles would still be preserved for historical purposes, the only change would be past tense would be used. Wyvern will be up again, but as for a time frame, I cannot say.</p>
<p>One should also keep in mind, this game is not simply a text mud. You can login via telnet(i.e. for chatting), but you CANNOT play it like a typical mud. It is a fully graphical game, much like Crossfire (much of which inspired wyvern) or Daimonin</p>
<p>Crossfire wiki: <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crossfire_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Crossfire (computer game)">Crossfire (computer game)</a></p>
<p>I would like to ask wikipedians to please stop trying to disrupt this article simply because they do not see it as valuable. Other people do.</p>

<li>As the first two votes for Delete have been basically fully negated , it stands to reason that the vote is, at best, 1-2. I vote <b>Keep.</b> Why pick on just this article. Wikipedia in general isn't 100% accurate, so it can't be used as a reliable source for anything. Why not focus all your energy on attempting to remedy this instead of just sitting around and deleting articles you don't approve of. I'm not sure exactly how this voting system works, but if it isn't majority rules, then that seems a little off.
<p>Oh wait. Just checked up on it. The link Kassis posted and the External to the homepage of the website should both satisfy "Fails WP:WEB, WP:V." As Logwad said, you can view a cache of the homepage.

<li>I suggest that you check it yourself first. Being <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a> has always been a criterion for deletion. It is, in fact, one of our primary criteria. This isn't a vote, and tallies count for very little if one side cannot make any argument based upon our policies and guidelines. So stop counting heads and start citing sources. If you want to make a proper argument — so far you have not, let alone refuted the arguments made above — <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_sources_8023.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite sources">cite sources</a> to demonstrate that the article's subject satisfies the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. Sources are your best, and only, arguments against the charge that something is unverifiable. Multiple, non-trivial, published works from sources independent of the subject are your best arguments against the charge that the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria are not satisfied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:52, 2 November 2006 (</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just a note: From what I've gathered, it is almost impossible for any MMORPG to have an article in Wikipedia. For these games the main website, a player, and whatever they publish is considered a primary source, unless it is published by a reliable source. That point alone makes writing an article extremely hard. The other problem being that unless you're a HUGE game like RuneScape you're probably not going to have many reliable sources publish anything about the game at all. And if any reliable source has published anything about the game, you can't just say that they have, you must give proof, use a link to their website to show that it is true, otherwise it may be considered unverifiable. <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarth_of_NEaB_6793.html" title="User:Garth of NEaB">Garth of NEaB</a> 14:03, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I better add no source if ever reliable, nobody can ever be truely objective, so I suggest you delete the entire Wikipedia Database.</p>

<p>I find this verifiable thing confusing. As far as the statement that the game is "award winning", I can see that this has drawn much ire from wikipedians. Would it satisfy you (plural) if I removed the "award winning" from the main description, and moved it to a subtopic on the page called "Achievements"(sp), or something?</p>
<p>And then as far as it being a game, yes, it is a game. I fail to see why it needs to be verified. In fact, I do not truly understand what you find wrong with this article. Non-notable? Type "wyvern"(a fairly common fantasy term) in google, and www.cabochon.com comes up as the first page rank.</p>
<p>I'm asking for a solution, rather than a "nuke it" mentality.</p>
<p>What if I create a bio for Steve Yegge, the creator? Steve Yegge has become quite well know for his "rants" on many aspects on programming, and has worked for Amazon and now for Google. <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/</a> Would having a famous creator help convince you that information on the game Wyvern in wikipedia would be desireable?</p>

<li>The point of having the sources listed is to prove that what you wrote is verifiable. This is also the reason that non-trivial secondary sources should be used, because they are more easily verified.

<li>For things like a certain type of tree grows x inches a year and whether someone won an award or not, I understand this perfectly. But this article is almost purely an overview of what the Wyvern game is, so that people can get a quick understanding of what it is about. I often will look through wiki for a game is about before downloading, setting up an account etc. MY intention is that sort of thing be offered for Wyvern too, as it is not game that is just starting up or anything, but has been around a while. So I do not understand why people simply want to nuke this article. If there is a sentence that needs a factual source, one can simply edit the wiki for it to say "needs source", or tag the article for cleanup.</li>

<li>What we have above is directory entries (which fail the "non-trivial" test), links someone (you?) added to Wikipedia and other add-it-yourself sites, and nothing which independently verifies the text of the article.

<li>Like I said earlier, this article had horrible timing. So for clarification, could you give me an example of what you would consider a "non-trivial" source? Do you mean some sort of website that specializes in game reviews? If this is the case, does popularity determine "non-trivial". How do I determine whether it is non-trivial source? I hope I do not come across as argumentative, I have already resigned that this article will most likely be deleted as people seem to have a problem with it. I am only trying to fully understand how to resolve these issues in the future. Thank you for your patience. Logwad 21:43, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Non-trivial would be a popular source that has been reliable for past things.

Not every free, online MMOG is notable, and this one doesn't make a very strong case for inclusion.

<li>I considered the same thing, so I removed the "award winning" part from the article. Eventually, when this article can properly stand, then there will be mention of the award in another part of the article. The award WAS a big deal, years ago, because PDA's where becoming big, and there were very few games, much less one like wyvern. Things changed. Now I heard you can play 3-d rpgs on your phone.

Still, just the fact that its the only still well known bridge between the telnet MUD era and the internet's recent boon of animae MMPORPG's warrents it to be of historical interest among online gaming historians. --69.244.153.46 23:36, 5 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I can confirm most of the information in this article, from personal knowledge, as I used to play, and I think the subject is notable enough, although it would stop being notable if the game was down permanently. The article should be given some time to survive while the game creator works on bringing the server up. If the server doesn't come up any time soon, such as in the next two months or so, then the article should be deleted at that time and created again only when the server comes back up (if ever), at which time information about the game can be verified. Since the article isn't too great at this point, it could use a rewrite either way. <a href="../../../a/b/o/User%7EAborlan_3ba9.html" title="User:Aborlan">Aborlan</a> 00:17, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't need to establish the use of a phrase. Looking for usages of phrases is dictionary thinking, not encyclopaedia thinking. A problem with an article <i>title</i> is something that can be simply addressed with the <a href="../../../m/o/v/Help%7EMoving_a_page_3be0.html" title="Help:Moving a page">rename button</a> to give the subject a better title. Encyclopaedia thinking is looking at the sources (both cited and potential) and evaluating them to see whether the article is verifable and whether the concept discussed has been fact checked, peer reviewed, published, and acknowledged by others, becoming part of the corpus of human knowledge. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>PROD was removed, BUT article was not changed in any other way, and issues mentioned in the PROD were not addressed. The article is about a non-notable housing development. Neighborhoods that are historically significant in some way; inasmuch as they generate significant independant references, ARE valid encyclopedia articles. This one does not qualify.

Additionally, the article has very little assertion of notability (a single possibly notable golf tournament was held there, but it is unreferenced) and the entire article is unreferenced.

<dd>Firstly, why was the Prod removed after only 1 day? It stated 5 days. Thus what is the point of prod? As for the question at hand, from my knowledge, Pondok Indah is the wealthiest area in jakarta (or second to the older Kemang district). <a href="../../../j/a/k/Jakarta.html" title="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> is one of the largest cities in the world and capital of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesia.html" title="Indonesia">world's fourth biggest country</a>. Yes, "estate" sounds like a single development, i understand it is much more like a suburb even area in scale. I suggest the article was written by non-native English speaker and hence notability is lost in translation. I will look into it myself, and try and get some Jakartan wikipedians to comment. But don't remove this in a day either please - gives us a few days. I am leaning to "keep" but would of course like confirmation of its status.--<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerbabu_4bbf.html" title="User:Merbabu">Merbabu</a> 00:01, 2 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>reply</b> PRODs left after five days automatically delete the article in question. The idea behind a PROD is to draw attention to an article that <i>as it stands</i> does not look to be of an encyclopedic subject. Based on the way the article is written, it LOOKS to me like a newly developed rich housing development. It has an advertisement feel to it. I tried to establish notability first by doing a google search, AND by reading the articles I found there. I could find no reliable third-party references to the area in question. Since the PROD was removed without any change made to the article (which is what a PROD specifically calls for: Improvement), I moved it here to AFD, which is the next step after a PROD. I assert that <i>as it stands now</i> the article should be deleted. Comments below are made by people who think otherwise. If they can provide evidence (read: reliable sources <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) that supports the assertions made below, and can integrate them into the article in question, I will withdraw my nomination.

<dd>You have to remember, that Indonesia is not the same as the US. It is relatively poor, less-educated, less IT-savvy, less internet orientated than your USA. It is a continual problem finding reliable info on the internet on INdonesiaa in English. Whereas on the USA, and my own Australia, it is not a problem. Please consider that. You are making your judgements from a USA point of view - expecting Indonesian topics to fit the same criteria of US or Australian topics isn't going to work. It's an ongoing and some extent inevitable systematic bias in Wikipedia - it's no one's fault in particular.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This looks like a signifficant section of Jakarta, notable for its wealth - an annual salary of US$357,200 in any place, no less Indonesia, is a pretty high assertation of notability. Strangely, it's more than a "houseing estate" and it's surprising the article lists it as such. And when <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citibank.html" title="Citibank">Citibank</a> names its branch there the Pondok Indah branch <a href="http://www.citibank.com/locations/ap/id/id/jakarta/ctbnkpondokndh.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.citibank.com/locations/ap/id/id/jakarta/ctbnkpondokndh.htm" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>, you know it's a real place. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 00:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>reply</b> I could find a housing development in any city with the same or higher annual salary. It does not make it particularly notable. Some neighborhoods are poor and notable, others are rich and unnotable. The difference is whether or not the neighborhood in question is refered to in nontrivial, reliable, third party sources, not how rich its inhabitants are. That a bank named its branch after the area is also not any indication of notability; Banks can name their branches after neighborhoods, streets, whatever. It doesn't really make the thing the bank branch is named after notable. Now, if the assertion is that this is an honest-to-god suburb, and much larger than what I think of when I see "housing estate" we only need to see references that confirm such, and I would THEN withdraw my nominiation. But <i>as it stands now</i> it appears non notable, and thus deleteable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 03:25, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>As for this being an "honest-to-god suburb" , there's already speculation by a former Jakarta resident here that "housing estate" is probably a translation mistake. Besides, the Yahoo Jakarta neighborhood Travel guide refers to Pondok Indah as a "district" <a href="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2556586-jakarta_introduction-i" class="external autonumber" title="http://travel.yahoo.com/p-travelguide-2556586-jakarta_introduction-i" rel="nofollow">[51]</a> not a "housing estate". That's an actual reference that beats yours or mine speculation and unless you can find a reliable third party source that counters that, that's all we got. I'm finding that it's one of the most ritzy parts of Jakarta - and an average income of US$357,200 is a gigantic average income for any neighborhood and is very notable. Look at <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montecito%2C_California_94e3.html" title="Montecito, California">Montecito, California</a>, one of the wealthiest communities in the US and the median income there is just $110,669. And if you don't find these things notable, that's your POV. And about the banks, banks name their branches after the town they're in. If a street is mentioned in the branch name, it usually is because one town has two or more branches and they add the street name as an addition; i.e. New York City - 5th Ave.. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 04:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - as i recall from living in Jakarta almost 10years ago it was often referred to more than any other area because of its wealth.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Really, I cannot see why the article shoud be deleted. As an Indonesian, I know that it is a district and yes, one of the wealthiest district in Jakarta. Based on Merbabu and Oakshade's points we all can see the notability of the district. I also have searched pages about districts and I can find zillions of them. <span style="font-family: comic sans ms"><a href="../../../i/m/o/User%7EImoeng_a509.html" title="User:Imoeng"><font color="blue">Imo</font></a><a href="../../../i/m/o/User_talk%7EImoeng_d25f.html" title="User talk:Imoeng"><font color="green">eng</font></a></span> 08:46, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Neutral</b> I know the district, but speaking about notability, I have to say that the district is only known because of rich people living there. There's no such a qualified notability in terms of history that has contributed to Jakarta, compared with other historical districts (Kota, Glodok, Sunda Kelapa?), which some of them are still missing here. So I am afraid if richness is the only criterion for keeping it here, then there will be other rich districts pop up (Kapuk, Bintaro?). — <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndon_c50f.html" title="User:Indon">Indon</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/d/User_talk%7EIndon_22ba.html" title="User talk:Indon"><font color="green">reply</font></a>) — 09:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I honestly would say there's more of interest than just wealth there. Firstly, a district of mostly wealthy ex-pats in Jakarta sounds very notable. Secondly, with a concentration of such wealth, it shows a concentration of one of the most influencial segments of a gigantic metropolitan area. Like other Indonesians here have said, unless we're familiar with the place, it's very presumptive of us to judge what qualifies as notable. Your knowledged take on the district is highly valued and as for those other districts you mentioned that might still be missing, if they have historic or other value, I think most of us would like to see articles on them. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 15:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> anyone with a lack of knowledge of Jakarta or Indonesia should not even question notability, they should stay well away from such suggestions - just look at the thousands of USA locations with 120 residents or a couple of thousand that have articles, and they have no notability issues on them whatsoever. <a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatuSuro_2646.html" title="User talk:SatuSuro">SatuSuro</a> 10:07, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, although I am not proposing any deletions, I decided to look up the home state in the USA of the proponent of the deletion; <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Hampshire_86db.html" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>. It has a population of about 1m. Jakarta has a population of between 8 and 15m depending what one counts as Jakarta. Not many areas (or any?) in Jakarta have articles on them yet on the New Hampshire page alone i found dozens of tiny little towns. This one is a classic case of (admitedly unintended) bias on Wikipedia and was linked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire#External_links|from" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire#External_links|from" rel="nofollow">this part</a> of the New Hampshire page. By rights, if the wealthiest suburb in the fourth largest country in the world needs to be deleted, will <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">User:Jayron32</a> also be proposing this town of 0 (yes zero) population also be deleted?

<li><b>reply</b> Thank you all for assuming good faith. I really like it when people assign motives to my actions without asking. When I nominated this for AfD, I left a list of ways to make the article better. All I am asking is for someone with experience in the area to please improve the article so it can be kept. I WANT THE ARTICLE TO GET BETTER. As it stood when I nominated it, it appeared non notable as written (housing estates are rarely notable; there was NO information in the article relating to population. It read like an advertisement trying to sell homes in a new housing development. See the version I nominated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pondok_Indah&amp;oldid=84996654" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pondok_Indah&amp;oldid=84996654" rel="nofollow">here</a>) Recent changes have made this more notable. As a second note, if you want to nominate another article for deletion, do so, but THE EXISTANCE OF OTHER DELETABLE ARTICLES ON WIKIPEDIA DOES NOT ADD ANY VALUE TO THIS ARTICLE. If you want to keep this article, add value to it by providing references. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron</a><a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_Esperanza_2c14.html" title="User:Jayron32/Esperanza"><span style="color:#00FF00;">32</span></a> 19:09, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>With genuine respect, i think you are possibly misinterpreting the intent of my post, but that is partly my fault perhaps - maybe I am not clear. I said <b>I wasn't suggesting deletions</b>, on the contrary, I specifically said I thought the info (on the New Hamp) towns is good. I was only using these NH state towns to point out wider systematic problem in Wikipedia that perhaps could explain your concerns with the Pondok Indah article. When I said systematic bias i did state it was <b>unintended and a wikipedia problem</b>, not your own personal bias, much less an attempt to cast aspersions about anyone's motives. In fact, this is my own pet hate. I never you assumed anything but good faith from you - I am surprised (and concerned) that my edits suggest otherwise but will certainly go thru this page and see if i can improve somehow. Although I disagree with the specific reasons for the nomination of Pondok Indah, I understand <b>and support</b> your initial rational, and indeed your right to do so - we all know this how wikipedia is improved.</dd>
<dd>The fact is, info on countries like the US and Australia is of relatively high quality (both on wikipedia and the wider internet), compared to, for example, equally notable Indonesia (or other "less developed" countries, for want of a better term). That goes a long way to explaining the bias in choosing articles to edit - that is, an Australian largely editting Indonesian-related articles. Sure, this goes beyond the article-specific issue at hand, but i included it here cos (IMO) it goes a long way to explaining how this became an issue in the first place.</dd>
<dd>lastly, perhaps all this belongs on user talk pages, but since your concerns are now in the open, i think it is appropriate, but not ideal, that I address them here. i hope this causes no offence.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Student newspapers are often notable. In this case, the article is a stub, so it's missing a list of famous alumni or the year the paper was founded. My guess is that the paper is older than the University of Windsor (that is, it was once the student newspaper of the (Catholic) Assumption University before the (secular) University of Windsor was founded, and that several decades of publishing have generated a fair number of famous alumni. The Lance is rather more lively than the <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windsor_Star_8806.html" title="Windsor Star">Windsor Star</a>, the city's daily newspaper, but that's not saying too much--<a href="../../../t/r/u/User%7ETruthbringerToronto_2a89.html" title="User:TruthbringerToronto">TruthbringerToronto</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/u/User_talk%7ETruthbringerToronto_f8ad.html" title="User talk:TruthbringerToronto">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TruthbringerToronto_dbda.html" title="Special:Contributions/TruthbringerToronto">contribs)</a> 21:34, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What a ringing endorsement, especially the last part, Truthbringer!

<li>On a more serious note: I think it is a bad precedent to have separate articles for student organizations, including newspapers. If some additional notable info turns up on <i>The Lance</i>, it can be included in the university entry. At the moment <i>The Lance</i> is covered there in 6 words; it can take up some additional space before needing its own entry. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 22:07, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I'm puzzled. Are you saying it is a speedy keep because I have acknowledged that there is notable content? The content I that I merged in (because someone complained that the article should be merged, not deleted) basically consisted of the word "weekly" and a link to <i>The Lance</i> website. I'm not sure those were that notable either, but I was trying to keep everyone happy. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 08:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you merged it word-for-word, the GFDL requires the edit history to be retained and this should be speedily kept and whether or not to redirect should be discussed on the talk page. Even if you rewrote it, there is no reason to delete a redirect from this title. I don't care if there is a separate article about this or not, but in any event there should be either a redirect or a disambiguation. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:17, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I've noted on the talk page, for any other print publication the baseline criterion for inclusion is "has a circulation of at least 5,000 copies". I simply don't see how we can treat this differently as a student newspaper than we would if it were published off-campus by a commercial company. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:56, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, having worked on a student paper I can tell you the usual print run is a tenth of the student population. So unless we are talking about 50000+ students I doubt this publication meets that figure.<a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 17:39, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The newspaper's circulation figure is already cited directly in the article: 10,000. I can't speak for the UK, but in Canada it's quite normal for a student newspaper to have off-campus distribution points as well (especially, but not exclusively, in cities that don't also have their own commercial alt-weeklies), so that brings circulation up at least a couple of thousand over on-campus distribution alone. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:12, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wonder if that figure represents a "readership" number instead of a "circulation" number. Often publications like to talk about their "readership", i.e. the average number of people who read a particular copy (2 or more) times the printed circ. I can't find any circulation numbers on the website, so I don't know where that number came from. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 04:38, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Um, this band was just nominated on October 31. See previous <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Funckarma_b487.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Funckarma">AFD</a> Why is this being nominated again?

<dd>Scratch that, it wasn't a short period, I misread the dates. Merely a small number of votes.

<dd>The person who closed it told me to nominate it again because I felt the points made by the people voting keep weren't valid.

<dd>And when making a second nomination, you should bring up prior nominations. Especially when you do it so very quickly afterwards . Given that you made such a lenghty proposal, a single line to say "This article was previously nominated here" would not have been a problem, would it?

<li>I felt the arguements in the first nomination were not very strong ones and there were only 3 people who discussed it.

<ul>
<li>I'm saying <b>Keep</b> again. I appreciate that this is a greatly superior nomination to the first and a highly detailed one but Afd is not clean-up and renominating the next day does not give any opportunity for this to take place. I stand by my notation of the GHits for the duo - a lack is often cited as a reason for deletion so it seems inconsistant to disregard a significant quantity (NB - I am not suggesting that the nominator is guilty of this inconsistancy, this is more a remark on double standards often present in Afd). More to the point, Discogs - accepted in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> as a "good" source - lists them as members of Shadow Huntaz, who have released 2 albums on a notable label (<a href="../../../s/k/a/Skam_Records_7f17.html" title="Skam Records">Skam Records</a>) - 4 if you count the instrumental versions, which I don't. A Google search confirms that the information on Discogs is correct and that the brothers were members for both of the relevant releases, although some sources simply list them as producers. I shall add it to the article (I had hoped for a longer window in which to do this, but there you go....) as this role does not appear to be covered. If I had time, I might be more inclined to do an article for Shadow Huntaz (although, perhaps ironically, they have fewer GHits than Funckarma) and copy the relevant information. <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:38, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Very POV and unfactual This article doesn't seem to have any factual basis. Nothing links to it, it links to nothing. It seems to be just one big vanity page and its totally POV.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article is heavily POV, for sure. And there is a complete lack of sources. But googling for his name indicates that he was involved in a significant event in India, and a landmark case in the Indian Supreme Court.

<p>Non-notable radio program/podcast. 142 Google hits.

<p>I guess I'm not so much arguing for this article because I'm so fascinated with it, but because it fills a hole in Wikipedia, even if imperfectly, and I would be more in favor of deleting it if there were something else that filled the hole. The questions of notability via Google hits for WP:CORP are a bit out of place here, this not being a corporation, thereby eliminating all the stock exchange/financial type sites and restricting the notability to the actual horse world, not the business world. (Also, the number of google hits seems to vary every week.

Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, everyone is free to create an article if they want, on conditions that if they can verify the information they added to the article is true and if there is a lot of info to find about the concerning matter. I'm not suggesting to make an article for every 'reality star' there has ever been, but the article is well-referenced and meets the requirements for an article. His (user:Hotwiki) comment to keep the article may not be objective, but if the reason to delete the article is because she hasn't won the competition or being a struggling model, then for the same reason, you should also delete all the articles for most of the contestants of <i><a href="../../../a/m/e/American_Idol_ef58.html" title="American Idol">American Idol</a></i>.

<li><b>delete and merge</b> PoV Fork, they are completely the same as traditionalist Catholics, except that some trad groups claim they are not traditionalist. Merge back into article, but most of this is a dupe of TC. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 23:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Please correct me if I am wrong but this seems very different from Traditionalist Catholics (TC). Indults have been granted an "indulgence" by the Holy See to practice the Mass in Latin, a "Church-approved" Latin version. TC disputes the wisdom of the modernization reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Indults have to specifically distinquish themselves from TC to receive this indulgence. They seem very different to me and certainly sufficiently different to have a separate article. --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 19:08, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The issue is they are no less traditionalist, if all the practices of the Catholics of this stripe do not differ from other Catholics.<a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 21:37, 2 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not that familiar and am basing my opinion on my read of the articles. It seems to have to do with traditional vs. Traditional (AKA traditionalist) with Indults being traditional. I am not sure that the distinction is well delineated in the TC article so I lean toward a separate article for Indults IF there is some cohesion of them; i.e. would a specific church be Indult? or would a church have modern and Indult services at different times? I guess that IF the TC article is better developed to distinquish between tC and TC (e.g. SSPX) AND Indults do not have a separate identity apart from tC then I would support merge. Am I making sense? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 05:16, 3 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> All Indult Catholics are traditionalists, but not all Traditionalists are Indult Catholics. The indultists are more than simply traditionalists because they somehow manage to keep in full communion with Rome as well as having access to the Pre Vatican II sacraments. It is a large movement taking in the FSSP, Una Voce, the Institute of the Good Shepherd, Latin Mass Society, etc, etc. It's not far off an <a href="../../../s/o/c/Talk%7ESociety_of_St._Pius_X_Archive1_f113.html#Sedevacantism" title="Talk:Society of St. Pius X/Archive1">ill advised attempt</a> to state that SSPX were sedevacantist because they were saying rude things about the Pope. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 19:22, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you saying that the Indult movement is not far off a movement to catagorize SSPX as sedevacantist? --<a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustanother_2c26.html" title="User:Justanother">Justanother</a> 19:31, 4 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No. Few indultists would say that the SSPX is close to sedevacantism. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 14:39, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Indult" Catholics are a group of traditionalists that some radical traditionalists are trying to cut off. CLassic POV fork. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 13:32, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I started the article and I attend an NO Mass (although I sometimes go to indult Masses). I certainly did not fork the article for the reason you're insinuating. I would like to point you to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJASpencer_5837.html" title="User:JASpencer">JASpencer</a> 14:35, 8 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize if it is taken as an insult. It was not meant that way. Catholics who attend an indult are not less traditional that the other groups in the main article. <a href="../../../d/o/m/User%7EDominick_690e.html" title="User:Dominick">Dominick</a> <a href="../../../d/o/m/User_talk%7EDominick_f59a.html" title="User talk:Dominick"><sup>(TALK)</sup></a> 15:54, 8 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
