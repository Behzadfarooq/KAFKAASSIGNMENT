<p>Another random non notable webcomic which has made it to Wikipedia's infamous <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_webcomics.html" title="List of webcomics">List of webcomics</a>.

<p>Lets take an example; 10 years ago day, someone writes an article about JK Rowling, a completely unimportant writer that has never been close to having anything published.

<li><b>Userfy, userfy, userfy</b>. Obviously Jazzper attempted to enrich the wiki with his own work, unfamiliar with Wikipedia guidelines. Now of course the article cant stay (non-notable, and vanity, adding his own references to articles), but it can go to his userpage. Reading the guidelines, I'm sure that even Jazzper will agree that he is not worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia (compare, for example, that you are not included in the Brittanica either). Nonetheless, most editors start out with some addition such as this and I, for one, hope that Jazzper decides to stay and contribute to ther articles as well. And hopefully, a few literary prizes down the line, perhaps on his own bio as well&#160;;-) Cheers, <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">The Minist</font></u></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><u><font color="green">e</font></u></a><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Minister_of_War_9b5a.html" title="User:The Minister of War"><u><font color="navy">r of War</font></u></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Minister_of_War_5304.html" title="User talk:The Minister of War"><sup><font color="navy">(Peace)</font></sup></a> 11:04, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: An obvious vote, since I'm the author; no, I am not David Haley. I like to peruse the philosophy portal and happened upon the article that I spun off into <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinitism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Infinitism (philosophy)">Infinitism (philosophy)</a>, which contained a brief sentence about Infinitism also being the name of a religion; subsequent Googling turned up Haley's site. It seemed sufficiently different from the infinitist epistomological concept to warrant a separate entry, but only a stub (which I tagged it as from the beginning). The reference to Universism was an admittedly hasty response to the first {{importance}} tag, and could be reasonably removed; the article was NOT "set up as competition for the already barely-if-that notable Universism." Application of the <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> policy, since this is in reference to religion, seems odd since most people would consider any religion other than their own "things made up ... one day." I apologize if I inappropriately removed the {{importance}} tag; this is my first time creating an article (for future reference, who decides when an {{importance}} tag can be reasonably removed?).

<li>... and "not notable" means that even if the thing exists, it is not (yet) important enough to merit mention in an encyclopedia. In this case, there is very little to go on to suggest that this use of the term "infinitism" is notable, in the sense that it has meaning or significance to a large number of people. I would suggest moving <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinitism_%28philosophy%29.html" title="Infinitism (philosophy)">infinitism (philosophy)</a> back to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infinitism.html" title="Infinitism">infinitism</a> (currently a disambig page), and add a few lines in that (very short) article about this alternate usage. Can't speculate that this will overtake patheism/pandeism/panendeism/whatever anymore than we can speculate that Judaism will overtake Buddhism or the like.

<li><b>Comment</b>,Two things: (1)If it's notable enough to be mentioned at all in the epistomological article, why is it not notable enough for its own stub (since it has nothing to do with the epistomological concept)? (2)I see the point you are trying to make about speculation, but I think the analogy (<i>Infinitism:freethought::Judaism:Buddhism</i>) is flawed; a more apt analogy would be Infinitism:<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">freethought</a>::<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>:<a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Christianity_6b3f.html" title="Early Christianity">Early Christianity</a>. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESketch051_137f.html" title="User:Sketch051">Sketch051</a> 21:26, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>More like Infinitism:<a href="../../../f/r/e/Freethought.html" title="Freethought">freethought</a>::<a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholicism.html" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>:(some other religious order that someone thought of, but never went anywhere and died out before anyone else adopted it). We already know what happened between Catholicism and Early Christianity, so to say that Infinitism as a religion might enjoy any kind of success is sheer speculation. I would still include a line or two in an artice on Infinitism focused on the philosophy, but I can't exactly quantify why I think it's a good idea to do so - perhaps just as an illustration that it is possible to assign another meaning to the term. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>BD2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 21:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The article is full of lies. None of the albums in the discography exist and their names along with those of The Cortez Trio are complete nonsense. This article along with edits to others were created by <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> who is Justin Besant. He is a high school student nothing more. He has never toured through Canada and The Cortez Trio is him and two friends performing at Cafe Bleu which is a school music recital. There has been continued vandalism of other pages such as <a href="../../../a/n/n/Annie_Besant_ef44.html" title="Annie Besant">Annie Besant</a> who Chinamanjoe claims that Justin Besant is the great-nephew of. However if this were true, Justin Besant would be well over 90 years old. Also, the only record of Justin Besant is on self-editable webpages such as this and <a href="http://www.last.fm" class="external free" title="http://www.last.fm" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm</a>. If one were to look at his last.fm page: <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant" class="external free" title="http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant" rel="nofollow">http://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Besant</a> they would discover that his albums seem rediculous and all there are are a few songs he made in his spare time on his keyboard in his room. The pictures on his albums are also clearly stolen and the entire thing is obviously fake.

<li><b>Comment</b>, I don't really understand this hoax concept. Notability, I can understand, but hoax i cannot. Is every page I create going to be considered a hoax, just becuase some wacko highschool kid said so? Is the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Koven_24be.html" title="Steve Koven">Steve Koven</a> page a hoax? Is the The Maytones page a hoax? Is the Vernon Buckley page a hoax? How about all those other contriubtions I have made. Are those all hoaxes as well? I think you should reconsider everything Yofoxyman has said.

Ok I did some research. All IPs from the University of Toronto Schools are <b>142.150.33.***</b>. In this case the following two votes are <b>not</b> from "the creator of the article from different school computers". They <b>are</b> from different computers around Toronto. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 01:46, 25 April 2006 (UTC) the precedding two posts both made by the creator of the article from different school computers Yofoxyman 00:04, 25 April 2006 (UTC) Please provide a source for this statement. The preceeding two posts were made from different locations around Toronto. Not from University of Toronto Schools. Thank you.</p>

<dd>Regarding Yofoxyman's previous statement which I have removed because it was completely false and would just be misleading. -- No, they most certainly were not! I would know, since 1) I didn't vote for them (and I am the creator) and I don't know who did. 2) those IP addresses are clearly not from the same building. 3) If you are referring to the University of Toronto Schools, which I assume you think I am from, which I am not, but anyways, those are not even the correct IP addresses, so I would appreciate it if you retracted your statement since it is completely based on speculation not fact. Thank you. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:12, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>it has already been proven that you are from the university of toronto schools, also, i believe that UTS's IP addresses are actually registered to UofT and not UTS. Also, why have they all been from similar IP addresses and not from actual users. I also hope you don't plan on creating new accounts just to post here. Yofoxyman 00:16, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Prove to me that those IP addresses are from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Toronto_Schools_533f.html" title="University of Toronto Schools">University of Toronto Schools</a> then! I think you might have some trouble, becuase as far as I am aware, I have only voted once. By similar IP addresses, I think you mean they are all addresses from the GTA (<a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>), which is where Justin Besant's fan base mainly resides. Maybe Justin Besant is more popular than you thought. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:31, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>is it a coincidence that on all pages with mention to justin besant on wikipedia that <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> is the only one who speaks in his favour? it's not.<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> is justin besant, there's nothing more to the story, and hes behind everything. Yofoxyman 00:38, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I personally consider this to be a personal attack. I am certainly not Justin Besant! You have based that on absolutely nothing. Please take it back immediately. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChinamanjoe_79e2.html" title="User:Chinamanjoe">Chinamanjoe</a> 00:44, 25 April 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No chance, it has already been made pretty obvious that you are Justin Besant. This, last.fm, the fact that you saved the entire justin besant page on your user page so you would still have it to put up after it was deleted. Stop denying it, everyone here knows its true. You are your biggest and only fan. And I am not saying this as a personal attack, it is a clear fact. Yofoxyman 00:47, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't say anything about notability, per se, just that the contribution was out of commercial interest. If Bill Gates hires someone (perhaps via <a href="../../../h/i/r/WP%7EHIRE_45c0.html" title="WP:HIRE">WP:HIRE</a>?) to add content onto an article about him, that doesn't make it non-notable, it just raises an POV flag.

<dd>By that I meant, if <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Gates_65fa.html" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a> was really notable someone outside the company would create and/or add to the article long before someone at his company had to for "publicity" reasons. Obviously that was the case (presumably) with Gates but not here. Indeed most CFO's don't have much if any impact outside the their company, let alone future CFO's, and it probably would take a financial motivation to get someone to spend this much time to write an article for one who has no other notable (or notorious) characteristics. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 09:02, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>By itself, no. What does a CFO do that is significant to anyone who is not either personally involved with or has a financial interest (or disinterest) in the company? I could see if Expedia was a giant mega-corporation whose operations have a great impact on the rest of society but that's hardly the case. Even putting aside the fact that he hasn't started his job yet, redlinks Mark Gunning and Gregory Stanger who previously held his position don't seem to have ever been involved with anything so significant that someone thought to write an article about them, which is why I find it relevant that this article was only ever written because an Expedia employee was told to do it for publicity reasons. <a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a> 04:56, 25 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>KnoxBlab and its previous incarnations have been the source for many other blog reports from such notibles as Instapundit (also Knoxville based) and have been on the leading edge of behind-the-scenes information that main-stream media won't/don't report about such regional/national subjects as TVA (largest goverment owned utility in USA and based in Knoxville), public offical term-limits (currently on appeal in TN Supreme Court and may have national impact), regional enviromental issues (Great Smoky Mt. NP and several national scenis river in area)</p>

<p>"Give an article at least a little time to develop; It is understood that some RC patrollers feel they need to take action before an article disappears off the RC page, but nominating an article for VfD within minutes of its creation is often inappropriate. Use the "Watch" button - it won't kill us if a questionable stub is created and sits around for at least a couple of days until the author gets a chance to work on it."</p>
<p>"'A month' isn't exactly a long time either; many VfD's seem to be based on 'this article's been around for a month (or 2 or 3) and nobody's worked on it!!!!!'

<li><b>Comment</b> No idea about the notability of the band but 27 mins from article creation, through prodding and deprodding to AfD hardly proves failure of the prod experiment. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 02:54, 23 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b> This is far from the first piece of evidence I've seen that prod is a failure. I do some RC patrol, and whenever I use prod I find the author deletes it (without explanation of course), and I'm forced to take it here anyway. I'm probably going to stop using it fairly soon because I don't think I've had it work yet once. I realize there are some people who like, I just don't happen to be one of them. If you want to talk more about this, I'm game, but we should probably find a more apropriate venue. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 03:08, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Since the tag can be removed without comment, prod depends on the author either not being around, being too timid to object to the article's deletion, not understanding the deletion process or accepting that the article should be deleted. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:39, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>This band is acutally a really big influence today in psychobilly (which is becoming a massive genre the world over) scene. If you dont believe me...google them. I can elaborate in this article as more info becomes available to me but right now (given what little info ive given) this article and The Matadors do deserve to be in here. Futhermore, when there is information on here about Lord Elgin the 11th earl of Kincardine, you don't see people like Bachrach44 saying that Lord Elgin is being vain do you? This entry IS legitimate, people WILL use this. Davis99913:47, 23 April 2006</li>

<li>Perhaps Buffy fans had a similar motive as the U. S. military had in using body counts, hoping to prove, at least to themselves, that the valiant efforts of Buffy and her friends were, so to speak, making a difference in the age-old struggle of the forces of good against the forces of evil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The Buffy body count also helps fans, critics, and other interested parties keep track of the episodes in which, in terms of vampire or demon activity, the action was cooling down or heating up; as such, the body count allows individuals to chart the Hellmouth's least and most active periods over a seven-year time frame. For example, vampires appear to be far more numerous (or active) than demons, and demons were twice as numerous (or active) in season two than they were in season one. Likewise, vampires were almost three times more numerous (or active) in season two than they were in season one. Season four, compared to the other six seasons, is almost devoid of vampires, but the demons are more numerous (or active) than ever. In "Triangle," episode 11 of season five, Buffy bags her 100th vampire.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In addition, as Joss Whedon, who created Buffy the Vampire Slayer, has said that the vampires, demons, and other monsters in the series are metaphors of existential threats, problems, and difficulties that teens and young adults face. For example, Marcie Ross, an invisible girl, becomes invisible as a result of being ignored by teachers and her fellow students. Her invisibility represents being ignored by others, a metaphor used by Ralph Ellison in Invisible Man, a novel that recounts the effects of black men's being ignored by whites during the racially segregated period of the early twentieth century. By adapting Kenneth Burke's dramatistic pentad to the types of demons that attack Buffy and her friends, both as teens and young adults, fans, critics, and others can isolate, identify, and evaluate what category of existential crisis seemed to traumatize these characters during specific periods of their childhoods and later years. Such a tool allows scholars and fans alike the ability to analyze and assess both these threats themselves, the reactions and the responses of the characters who encounter them, and the effects of these threats upon their lives. By decoding the significance of a particular vampire or demon (or human) according to its existential, psychological, social, or spiritual nature and then weighing the number of times during a season (or throughout the series) such threats menace Buffy and her friends, critics and fans can better chart and understand the show's thematic as well as narrative arcs.</li>

I did not link it in the right place and put it in the Botanical Gardens section in Wiki. It should have been and will soon be linked on the University of Toronto Wiki pages where it should have gone in the first place. Links for the graphics were uplaoded in Wikimedia and now that I look, and I totally agree, when I made the jpeg link on Wikipedia, the photos were different and not mine. Perhaps someone can instruct me on linking from WikiMedia to Wikipedia??? If you go to my page on Media you will see the actual 93 Highland photos.

<dd>Sorry, but "has plans to..." doesn't quite cut it. I have plans to be notable someday but that doesn't quite make me notable. I encourage you to pursue your endeavour however, until your magazine reaches notability, it should not be included. This is the same with any emerging rock group or web comic. We do not write an article to publicise you (Wikipedia is not free advertising) but rather to note your achievements.

How can this be considered advertising? There isn't even any contact info. This fanzine might not be receiving the accolades of VQR or MRR but in certain circles is no less important.

<p>I personally have all issues and all versions of every issue of Trumbull Escapades. I have brought them along on many road trips, train rides, subway rides, and on airplanes to read. I know most content by heart and could quote at least half of it. In fact I often find myself referring to this magazine when asked information. Not only is the fanzine one of the few remaining american hardcore fanzines, it is also one of the best it's ever had. Its' greatness lies in the combination of a strong knowledge of hardcore, sneakers, general internet and related subjects, and the editors' unique sense of humour. Why would one deny the existance and importance of a fanzine because it has no website? First off why would this fanzine even want to have a website? If the editors have anything to say they will adress it in the fanzine, not on a website. Secondly I can't think of any "real" fanzines that ever had a website (not counting former fanzines turned magazine). I am appalled that in todays' world one simply does not EXIST if one does not have a website. So no, Trumbull Escapades does not have a website, for reasons explained above. Does that mean they are not a viable and important pillar of a strong american music culture? Does it mean they should not be represented on wikipedia? The correct answer here is no. Sincerely, Kevin Charles Alen.</p>

<li>To all interested parties: the point here is this "topic" does not comply with the high standards set for inclusion in Wikipedia, which is an encyclopedia and not a web-directory. Nobody is saying it's not a great, informative fanzine with a dedicated following, or that not having a website is grounds for not being notable. Information on Wikipedia must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> as meeting the standards, and in the opinion of all the experienced editors who have thus far placed a comment here, this topic does not meet those standards. Further "this should be kept" comments not backed up by specific references to WP policies &amp; guidelines and supported by verifiable evidence will not do your case any good. If you do a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22The+New+Yorker%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22The+New+Yorker%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">google search</a> for <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_Yorker_6fe2.html" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a>, you will notice that only one of the results is for the publication's own web site - the other 27,099,999 are from other sources which reference and verify the existence and importance of the publication. That's what editors are looking for when applying the "google test", which is just one small consideration made when considering deletion. <b><a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></a></b> 20:08, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I know we've had a lot of webcomic come up for AfD lately, but this one is an odd choice. I don't like Alexa, but here it serves as a good illustration. Most of the AfDed webcomics have had Alexa scores well over 100,000 -- often unranked or in the millions. Inverloch, on the other hand, has <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seraph-inn.com%2F&amp;url=http://www.seraph-inn.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seraph-inn.com%2F&amp;url=http://www.seraph-inn.com/" rel="nofollow">29,822</a>, which is good for a webcomic. Furthermore, a print edition is coming out in May from Seven Seas Entertainment, so it's not like it's self-published. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 07:05, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is an article about a college research project and there is no reason it should be removed. He thought I was the "Nick Ireland" in the article when it auctually reads "Nick Irelan" and talks about a computer science student (I am not a student of any kind). John dosen't even really read the articles he only skims through to find what could possibly be the slightest problem then asks that they be deleted in order to gain attention.

<li>A lot of articles about (seemingly) non-notable subjects get created by the people responsible for the subject, so it seems like an understandable mistake. "Nirelan" might well be an abbreviation of "Nick Ireland". (That's not what it is, of course.) If you had been the Nick Ireland in question, that still wouldn't be the problem with the article - the problem is with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, as others have said. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobin_Johnson_fe0a.html" title="User:Robin Johnson">Robin Johnson</a> 12:26, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As stated by another user the page has been displayed on Wikipedia for three months until it came to the attention of the user nominating for deletion. (Burmaduck). Burmaduck, if the alias serves as the same as his handle on the site, is a person renowned for spamming the Lonely Planet website which he has continued to do for the last five years due to a failed legal action for plagiarism and once banned from the Political Stew site for grotesque racist abuse of certain members now tries to spam Political Stew. If this is the same Burmaduck he personally threatened one of the site administrators of Political stew who subsequently filed a complaint with the police. The motivation behind Burmaduck's request for deletion is more likely to be out of spite and has probably little or nothing to do with any contravention of the WED.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.15.71.151 (<a href="../../../8/2/2E/User_talk%7E82.15.71.151.html" title="User talk:82.15.71.151">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.15.71.151_97c9.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.15.71.151">contribs</a>).</small></li>

If it is not, then WP:WEB is against the nature of Wikipedia, as it only offers the chance to a handful of websites to be included in the directory. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Manos_4cb7.html" title="User:Dr. Manos">dr. manos</a> 4/24/06 01:18GMT+2.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> Issue of self-promotion seems odd as author never advertised the link on the Political Stew forums - was found independently by a user - nor anywhere else.

<li><b>Keep</b>: A quick lookover of the WP:Web criteria and the site in question shows that Political Stew does indeed meet said criteria. Burmaduck's intense crusade seems hardly founded in concern for the wellbeing of Wikipedia and appears to be little more than a petty personal grudge. His comments should be treated with more than just a grain of salt. However, caution should be taken lest he spam Wikipedia with gay porn links as he has done with both the Lonely Planet Thorn Tree and the Political Stew - this fact can be verified by moderators of both sites. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 218.45.215.130 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_218.45.215.130_5205.html" title="Special:Contributions/218.45.215.130">contribs</a>) .</small>

<dd>I don't know the Franco one, but even in the U.K. the "where's the beef" advertising slogan became known through comedy shows, etc. (My point, though, was that the analogy doesn't hold because they're all complete sentences.) Have the other three been taken to AfD? What was the response, and what were the arguments?

<dd>Precisely what's written into it - I'm calling you out on a rhetorical trap you're oh-so-cleverly laying. GTB don't play. I will say this - I'm kind of racist. I think I'll be the rest of my life learning to overcome prejudices that I've internalized without noticing. (Growing up in the South can't have helped.) I'm certainly capable of contributing to systematic bias, through action and through omission, if I'm not attentive. What do you want to bet I'm not the only one? Monicasdude is calling this AfD an example of systematic bias - is he right? I have no idea. I can't see into Mel Etitis's soul or that of anyone voting "delete", and neither can Monicasdude. His post is <i>rude</i>, but I don't know that it's wrong. Each of us can ask ourselves if the shoe fits, and there you go. -<a href="../../../g/t/b/User%7EGTBacchus_0191.html" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a><sup>(<a href="../../../g/t/b/User_talk%7EGTBacchus_1f6a.html" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)</sup> 02:57, 29 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>On that note, the Boogie Down Productions album is actually called <i>By All Means Necessary</i>, which certainly refereces the Malcolm X quote, but isn't the same.

<li><b>Comment</b> Yeah, I can buy into making <a href="../../../b/y/_/By_any_means_necessary.html" title="By any means necessary">By any means necessary</a> a disambiguation page and moving the Malcolm content to By any means necessary (Malcolm X) (preferably) or By any means necessary (quote) .

<p>A non remarkable shade of blue, that seems popular as it is (or close to) Pantone Matching System No. 288 and seems popular in logos/colour schemes and similar with yellow or white.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus</b>. The keep argument is that the diner surpasses the notability guidelines at <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which (I've checked) is absolutely correct.

<dd>Comment. There's no such thing as wrongly deprodding an article. The rationale was that is appeared to be notable as it states the diner was featured on FoodTV and in a food magazine. You may disagree that it makes it notable enough to keep, or have concerns about verifying the claim, but that doesn't make removing the prod tag "wrong." <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 00:11, 24 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Response. Why I call it wrong is that the contesting user decided to demand consensus on an article that doesn't even toe the line of notability. If you look at the discussion here you can see that the consensus points to a resounding "delete", and my issue is that the extra work of the editors that listed the article here and then voted could have been better spent improving Wikipedia in other ways; that's why I call it wrongly removed. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 19:36, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article is based on a biased view of the Algerian war of independance. It is a confusion between the Setif massacre that took place in 1945 where between 15,000 to 45,000 (figures vary between sources)people were killed and the event of Algerian war of independance. In addition, France has formally accepted its responsabilities in the Setif massacre and presented its apologies to Algeria via its ambassador. The author distorts the words of president Abdelaziz Bouteflika who said that French colonisation was a genocide of Algerian identity, language and traditions, but never said that France perpetrated a genocide as in exterminating people. He was implying that the effect of colonisation was the destruction of the cultural identity of algerians. This also has to be replaced in the context, as president Bouteflika was replying in anger to a law that was voted in French parliement recognising the beneficial effect of colonisation. This law has been repelled since. The author also distorts his references as the Scotsman article referred to DO NOT claims that France killed 1.5 million Algerians so it is a false reference. I suggest this article should be deleted, as there are already some articles on the massacres perpetrated by the French rulers in Algeria, the article is just the point of view of the author and is full of inacuracies. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 14:41, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete it because the genocide committed by a Western white nation and against a non-Western nation.</b> Anybody may genocide Arabs or Africans and get no punishment. Even you cannot name tha massacres as genocide. The Algerian President and his people say it was a genocide. And the article clearly reflects the French opposition. I started the entry and I had put the info to Algeria and France pages. However the user Blastwizard deleted all of my contributions. I think this is another type of vandalism. He says that there is no court verdict about the Algerian genocide. Is there any verdict on Armenian 'genocide'. But there is an entry called 'Arzmenian Genocide' on Wiki pages. And we cannot change this article because it is under protection. Please and please delete it. Show once more how the world is as usual we know here.David Falcon 20:11, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Algerian president said it was a genocide of Algerian culture not people, obviously you don't get the subtlety of his language or more exactly you don't want to understand as it does not fit with your opinion. The exact words of president Bouteflika were <i>Colonisation brought the genocide of our identity, of our history, of our language, of our traditions</i> so it is your misinterpretation of this sentence that brought this article to existence, in addition the number of victims you wrote is unsubstantiated by any sources you gave. Would president Bouteflika go to receive medical treatment in a military hospital of a country that has comitted genocide on his people? Your contributions are in breach of neutrality of point of view. You are accusing me of editing the page of Algeria which is not the case. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a forum for personal opinion, I had nothing to do with the article on armenian genocide I just pointed its existence which obviously upsets you. If you read carefully my post on the subject you will see that I pointed at that there was no indictment of the ottoman empire because it collapsed before international courts of justices ever existed (I suppose Nuremberg trial makes a precedence), but several parliements in the world have voted a law to consider it as a genocide. You may have an issue with the atrocities the French did in Algeria, and I said I didn't condone it, what I say is it does not qualify as a genocide they took place at a time when France could have been condemned it is not the case, and you are distorting the official opinion of Algerian authorities. It is not because western people killed masses of non-western people and in the case you are pointing that it qualifies as a genocide and I'm rather upset because your light approach to the use of the word genocide belittles some real genocides. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 22:29, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>First of all a genocide is not only committed against the people but also their culture, identity, language etc. Just look at the conventions and treaties. Secondly the Algerians do not only say that the French committed genocide only against their identity. More than 1,5 million people were massacred according to the Algerian official records. OK. This is Algerian perspective. So add the French perspective but maintain the 'Algerian Genocide' title. Third I am not a full-Turkish.</li>

<dd>First of all please add your comments at the end, not to hide the reasons why I nominated this article for deletion. You seem unable to read the articles you cite. You say the figure of 1.5 million victims is the official Algerian records, cite your references where did you find this&#160;? Strangely enough when you use references to support this affirmation the references do not contain this information. Your affirmations seem to be very distorted by the prism of your opinion. As I said before I don't care whether you are Turkish, Chinese, English, Papu or whatever, what I care about is well referenced articles in Wikipedia not peoples' personal opinions. Now if you can provide a well documented research work by historians and scholars instead of reporting words from politicians I will reconsider my stance. And no genocide is a crime against people not against culture, president Bouteflika hijacked the word in the purposes of his political agenda. If you take the etymology of the word, <i>geno</i> is the greek root for race and <i>cide</i> comes from latin cidere killing it does not mean killing people's culture. And for your records I am not denying that colonisation has altered the identity of colonised country, but your articles are really far fetched in that matter <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlastwizard_4fdf.html" title="User:Blastwizard">Blastwizard</a> 11:19, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- They should be kept - This band have started a musical scene where they are from, they are an important part of the new music industry. A national tour means playing around the country, which they have done in many areas (Liverpool, Sheffield, London and soon to be Birmingham). They are being looked at by record labels and although they may release records by themself that is what music is about. Self creation and releasing. There are many unsigned bands on here which meet far less meet the 'criteria' set. Information about the band has been provided by fans of the band from all around the country. They are supporting signed bands and this has been mentioned in Newspapers and NME as tours.

<li><b>Merge</b> into somewhere related to LP mudlibs. It seems noteworthy enough for me to have created the article (there are a few ways that it's unique, and has some advantages over other mudlibs in some areas), and I made the stub in hopes that someone who uses it might improve the article. But, I am not interested enough and also don't have the time to expand it in any significant way myself. Nobody's seems to have expanded it in the several months of its existance, so I think that's enough lack of interest that I'm fine with it being deleted. Also I forgot why I created this article and not one about Merentha itself... I think it was so that <a href="../../../l/p/m/Category%7ELPMud_mudlibs_c4d3.html" title="Category:LPMud mudlibs">Category:LPMud_mudlibs</a> would be more complete.

<dd>I should have said "inappropriately" instead of wrongly, my mistake. Contesting the deletion of an article that is covered more extensively in another place, and which clearly does not merit its own article, I consider to be inappropriate and perhaps even lazy on the part of the editor, who could have spent a little more time to look into the subject instead of wantonly removing prod tags- which, if you check his recent hundred or so edits, all but a handful are exactly that. <a href="../../../k/u/z/User%7EKuzaar_7f49.html" title="User:Kuzaar">Kuzaar</a> 12:24, 24 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I know it sounds like listcruft, but it would essentially be the same thing, but it would kill two birds with one stone.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy keep</b> as an assumed good-faith nomination but with no good deletion reason given. This is a long-existing page linked to by many other pages, and as others have pointed out, certainly no less minor than many other characters from the Simpsons.

<p>Since Wikipedia Watch was not considered important enough to have its own article, I think that the same applies of this article, and also <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Information_Research_b1d1.html" title="Public Information Research">Public Information Research</a>. Thus, I believe that the contents of this article should be <b>merged</b> into the <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a> article. Also, I see a way in which this entire mess with Brandt can be sorted out (Copied and pasted from the Wikipedia Watch Deletion Voting):</p>
<p><b>Create</b> a brand spanking new article entitled <b>"A List of Websites which Daniel Brandt is Affiliated With"</b>, and then merge the contents of both <b>Wikipedia Watch</b> and of <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Watch_419f.html" title="Google Watch">Google Watch</a>, plus that of information on <b>Yahoo! Watch</b>, <b>NameBase</b>, <b>Wikipedia Review</b> and <b>Public Information Research</b>, into the new article. Then, <b>delete</b> all personal information about Brandt (Age/Gender/Location is one thing, but I seriously doubt people were going in 1947: "Good Lord! A Child has been born to missionary parents in China! Let us visit him!" Equally, I seriously doubt there is anything else within his <b>"Background"</b> section that he is notable for. As far as I see it, he is notable only for his contributions to those 6 websites) and then <b>merge</b> what non-personal information there exists left from the Brandt article (including the Seigenthaler stuff) into the new article. This way, several birds are killed with one stone: We cannot complain that Brandt is over represented in his articles in Wikipedia because he will only really feature in one as this proposal details; it will end the controversy in the <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a> article over the inclusion or not of Wikipedia Review because now we will have information about it; Brandt will most likely cease to complain because what he feels to be "private matters" will no longer be on Wikipedia for everyone to see; and it can stop this bitter war that exists between Brandt and Wikipedia: Brandt can be left to his own devices and Wikipedia can finally have a Brandt article free of controversy and one which they can be truly proud of.</p>
<p>Obviously this process can only be achieved through AfDs, so I beg your co-operation in this matter. Jonathan 666 17:09, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Google Watch is extensive and notable, and it has been profiled in major publications. It led to <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scroogle.html" title="Scroogle">Scroogle</a> and other work by the same activist(s). This is a rambling <s>bad-faith</s> nomination. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 17:51, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No it isn't. Nowhere do I deny the notability of Google Watch, but what I am saying is that Brandt should have less space on Wikipedia, and that this whole conflict between Wikipedia and Brandt should be put to rest. Because what is it now? Six, seven months? It's getting tiresome. We need a singular article on Brandt which covers his work with the 7 websites (as you've just reminded me of Scroogle), and is devoid of his personal information (such as the China and missionary parents issue) and is thus able to solve many problems as a result. Jonathan 666 18:50, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is standard to include someone's birthplace, birthdate, information about parents, etc. Brandt himself supplied this information to Chasnoff for publication in the San Antonio newspaper. And if Google Watch is notable, shouldn't it have its own entry? Wikipedia Watch is a three-page rant site comprised mostly of an enemies list-- not too notable. Google Watch and Scroogle have been written up on lots of major publications. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 19:17, 18 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps, but who honestly goes to the Brandt article wanting to know that he was born in X and raised by Y, when in reality it is likely that the majority of people who go onto Wikipedia to look at his article are probably just interested in what he did with the 7 websites mentioned above.</li>

<dd>Wikipedia Watch not notable? Searching for it on Google generates 27,300,000 hits, and that was not considered important enough for its own article. Please see however the point about the amount of birds killed with a single stone if this proposal was to go through. We honestly do not need to give Brandt all this space on Wikipedia, due simply to the fact that people more notable than him get less space on Wikipedia, and really in the great scheme of things Brandt is really not that important to have so many articles on Wikipedia.

I suspect that there are other Wikipedia users who would resonate with this.

<p><b>Comment</b> This AfD process is meant to last for 7 days, at least according to my knowledge of the AfD process. This AfD began on the 18th April.

<li><b>Keep</b> WPI is a well known institution. As a result, there are many visitors to our real campus and WPI hosts a pdf of the the campus called "WPI Campus Map" and this is what is being brought up in the google search when you search for their article name. They are a group of students working hard to start something new. Although they may have their own website, if you follow the links on the site, they link to other sites, both about halo as well as WPI's own site. I attend WPI and know for a fact that the information on their site was also on WPI's "well known and independent" site. As a member of the GDC, I know that we will be updating our site (which is a subdomain of WPI's own site) to reflect and validate the information on their site.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 130.215.33.117 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_130.215.33.117_7b65.html" title="Special:Contributions/130.215.33.117">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Anything but advertisement, we are linked to by another <a href="http://halogt.com" class="external text" title="http://halogt.com" rel="nofollow">website</a> which gets thousands of unique visitors per day. We do not need Wikipedia to advertise for us as we are getting plenty of hits without it. Wikipedia is more than an encyclopedia; it has become more of an online repository for information and hence has become a place which people turn to for answers. People who are hear about a Halo Map of WPI are not just going to think of going to WPIMap.com for information, but rather are going to look it up on the "internet knowledgebase", Wikipedia. "This article is also written as self-promotion." to answer that, I quote Wikipedia "Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject" Also, at WPI, most of the IP addresses are similar due to the fact that we all recieve static outside IP addresses. The above "shameless" accusation against "the four developers" each only voted once. The other votes are from students around us and therefore they will have similar addresses. As for some of the votes appearing the same, I talked to the person (Matt Beaty) about what he wrote and he said that he didn't feel like writing something different, but still supported the article. I am not selfish and do not appreciate being called dishonest.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Pb59 (<a href="../../../p/b/5/User_talk%7EPb59_1bf4.html" title="User talk:Pb59">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pb59_7fc5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pb59">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> 1) books published by vanity presses are generally not notable; 2) no hits in Lexis/Nexis or google news, so not a very important story outside the fanfic community; 3) <i>Lucasfilm has yet to make a public statement...but many expect</i> Wikipedia is not a crystal ball; 4) the book is being withdrawn from sale, so the author has given up rather than forcing a fight.

<p>hi Coren,</p>
<p>yes I appreciate that it seems that this article does not come close to satisfying some of the criteria in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. However, as this band will never be able to officially release a single, ( the 'moral' censor boards in the Indian subcontinent are quite particular about banning songs which contain explicit lyrics, which is a particular motif of zeest songs) the band is already precluded from quite a few of the criteria mentoined in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a></p>
<p>However, this article does meet one criterion; it has been featured in the 'Mid day' a very popular newspaper in mumbai [<a href="http://web.mid-day.com/smd/play/2006/january/128575.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.mid-day.com/smd/play/2006/january/128575.htm" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>]</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Nn "Hollywood player," only credits are segment producer for Entertainment Tonight and the upcoming (next year) movie Horrorween.

<dd><b>Comment</b> All of your edits have been towards this person and this movie... a movie that isn't even filmed yet. Yes, adding content about a film (which had yet to materialize) to various articles is, in fact, linkspam. Also, regardless of removing the POV problems, this person just plain isn't notable. His IMDB credits are a grand total of two. As for the editing, you seem to insist on making all external links in bold and so those need to be edited. <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 04:46, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Go on the www.DeadBodyGuy.com site and the www.Horrorween.com site and look at the press, then also search in Lexis/Nexis, Newsblaze.com, Yahoo, Google, etc., etc. You will see all the articles and blogs, and if you are a real Editor, which I doubt, you can see the notariety of this movie and it's cast &amp; crew! STOP FLAMING AND GET A LIFE!!!Whoizzy</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have looked at those sites. Horroween.com only has two lines quoted, both of which give no verifiable source. I googled. Only two hits for the Horroween film, the rest were for other things (videogames, etc) with the same title. There is no palpable sense of anxiousness for this film. There is no sign at all of notability. If you believe there is then provide it. Otherwise let it go.<a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIrishguy_9732.html" title="User:Irishguy">IrishGuy</a> 22:13, 26 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>AN EVEN STRONGER DON'T DELETE</b></s> Look again, you missed alot. You are lying also, because on the Horrorween.com site, there is a link to an article written by the 2006 Pulitzer Prize winning newswire service!!! Have you or Wikipedia ever won a Pulitzer Prize??? I invite you to call Katie Couric and Matt Lauer at the Today Show, and asked them how they announced Horrorween to millions of people. Oh, I guess Katie Couric is not a credible news person. Tell that to CBS!!! IrishGuy, you're just flaming!!!Whoizzy</li>
</ul>
<p>Look at www.DeadBodyGuy.com also, and check out all the news articles about Horrorween on that site also!!! 5 million people visiting www.DeadBodyGuy.com can't be wrong!!! Stop flaming!!!Whoizzy</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> You don't get to vote numerous times. Stop doing that. The one line quotes weren't from a profile of the film. They were from a profile of dead-body-guy. He mentioned that he would be in a film that no one had heard of. Don't be disingenuous. The article link is from signonsandiego.com and it, too, is about dead-body-guy with the merest mention of horroween. This article isn't about dead-body-guy. DBG is emminently notable.

<p>I'm putting this up for deletion because it is a horrible unsourced essay which I think is completely unverifiable as it is solely the author's work. It is mentioned and used and link-to-from nowhere else, an apt demonstration of its irrelevance and neologisticness. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 22:37, 23 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>No sweat. I did not have time as I'd planned to follow up on the unmet needs. I'd hoped that a wikipedian would put the boot in and add content and references but none appeared.</p>
<p>I agree that the article didn't disambiguate comp sci and software engineering. However, critical technology questions the boundaries between subdisciplines because those boundaries are mental and social construction. It puzzled me, as it puzzled Dijkstra, how there can be a pure computer science if as Dijkstra wrote, programming is applied mathematics. Of course, computer science is more than programming, as computer scientists who can't program like to say, in the same register that software engineering is programming for people who can't program. Software engineering turns out to be nearly null because computer science is applied mathematics and hence impure, and leaves nothing for software engineering except thrashing the help (Taylorist scientific management, applied to people who can code).</p>
<p>I will retry in future when I have time to resubmit an article that meets Wikipedia guidelines. Sorry for any wasted time, but it was my unfulfilled intention to improve and make-wiki the existing article.</p>

<p>The result was <b>no consensus on some and delete the rest.</b><br />
This discussion amounted to over 150K. Much of it (too much) was spent debating the merits of an AfD nominating so many related yet distinct articles in a single nomination. The prospect of <s>85</s> 59 separate AfDs containing the same arguments from the same set of editors is even more frightening than the debacle that this AfD nearly became. I find no merit in the arguments against the form of this AfD other than the observation that historically these types of nominations become a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Warcraft_character_articles_84a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Warcraft character articles">train wreck</a> with no consensus emerging after day upon day of discussion.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some progress has come from this AfD. Reading through this (yes, every word of it) consensus was clear (yes, clear) on several issues:</p>

<li>The level of detail, in-universe style and sources of all of the articles fails to meet <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</li>
<li>The information is single sourced with possible copyvio issues from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>.</li>
<li>All of the information has already been transwikied to <a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a></li>
<li>While the <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a> series itself clearly meets the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, the majority of the articles listed in this AfD do not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if this were a vote, then the result would be "no consensus". However, consensus here does not mean consensus that <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>, but consensus that the material here meets established guidelines and policies that have been developed through consensus. In this regard there were strong arguments in favor of deleting everything, however, I find that there is <b>no consensus</b> whether the following articles meet the notability requirements of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, and are thus kept by default:</p>

<p>Note that among those arguing to keep the articles, there was consensus to merge the above articles in some form.

<p>I am not only nominating this article, I am nominating <s>every page</s> all 84 pages in <a href="../../../c/o/s/Template%7ECosmic_Era_mobile_weapons_eb3f.html" title="Template:Cosmic Era mobile weapons">Template:Cosmic Era mobile weapons</a>. They are all listed and lightly mentioned on <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmic_Era_Mobile_Units_e1af.html" title="Cosmic Era Mobile Units">Cosmic Era Mobile Units</a>, therefore a merge is not required. All of the information has already been transwikied (<a href="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external autonumber" title="http://gundam.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>). The information appears to be stolen from <a href="http://www.mahq.net" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net" rel="nofollow">MaHQ.net</a>. Deletion is the only option. Before you defend the existence of these articles, please observe how these articles defy <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, an official policy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought
<dl>
<dd>There are no sources on most of the articles. Therefore the articles break this rule. Until you can come up with a reliable source not <i>dedicated</i> to Gundam, it will violate this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information
<dl>
<dd>The policy states "works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis". None of the articles have this.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There we have two policies that the article clearly violates. If that's not enough, here's a violation of the <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be merged with short descriptions into a "List of characters." The main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character.
<dl>
<dd>Seeing as most of the articles contain mostly trivial information, they are minor, and therefore violate the guideline.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, on various articles for deletions, these points have been raised to keep:</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be nice to keep these articles
<dl>
<dd>That's not a reason for keeping them.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>there are several more obscure series that should have been targeted first.
<dl>
<dd>That's irrelevant. This one has to go, it doesn't matter what order it's done in.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>they're not harming anything or against Wikipedia policies that I'm aware of.
<dl>
<dd>Yes they are, I mentioned the policies they're violating.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>If these articles are deleted you would have to delete about every single anime character plus Star Wars and Star Trek articles
<dl>
<dd>That seems like a very good idea. Just because that hasn't been done yet doesn't mean this can't be done first. Furthermore, a main character in Star Wars is a lot more important than every single quartenary robot.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>'Cruft' or no, Wikipedia is to inform. Just because it's not important to you does not automatically make it useless.
<dl>
<dd>There are various rules and policies that state the articles are useless.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Most of the information is actually translated directly from various sources, including direct references in the show, books, magazines, and model boxes and instructions.
<dl>
<dd>Those are primary sources. Articles require secondary sources. If there aren't any, the articles should not exist (in most cases)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b><span style="color:red">COMMENT:</span></b> Many people in this discussion are stating that they think some of these articles should go but some should not, or complaining that individual AfDs should be created for each separate article. What they are neglecting to state is which articles they think should go and which should stay and stating their reasons. It is perfectly within process to nominate a group of related articles in a single nomination, and the above referenced template lists the included articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> and refer to a relevant WikiProject for how to best merge, transwiki, or otherwise organize this information. Yes, we have a situation where numerous articles of questionable value exist - but trying to deal with that situation with one gigantic AfD almost guarantees throwing some babies out with the bathwater. Major elements of notable fiction do generally receive articles on Wikipedia, and that is in no way incompatible with Wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 01:21, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: It has already been merged and transwikied. There are no babies in the bathwater. Using that comment is simply an excuse to keep the articles, and until you actually find a "baby", your claim is incorrect. Look through every article in the template and I guarantee none of them are of importance. These are not major elements of notable fiction, as I have stated, and it does violate policy. Please read my nomination next time. Your keep vote is simply invalid. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 01:32, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm not going to take your word for it that a group of 85 articles contain no information that are important to a clearly notable anime. There is probably no group of almost 100 articles I'd vote a blanket "delete" on, <i>especially</i> when a dozen or more of them have already undergone the AfD process - and survived. It seems disrespectful to all those discussions to try to supercede them by having the entire category deleted. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 01:55, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Any robot in Gundam is non-notable. In a very popular series, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_f5dd.html" title="Metal Gear">Metal Gear</a>, the Metal Gears are the star of the show. They are the most important, and each one serves a very important aspect of it. However, they are all in <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metal_Gear_%28weapon%29_c96f.html" title="Metal Gear (weapon)">Metal Gear (weapon)</a>. This is good example to compare to, because Metal Gear articles are actually representative of a good set of editors, not a group of fans. I realize it seems disrespectful to previous discussions, but I have already argued against all of the points mentioned in those discussions. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Prove had been shown. You just ignore them to the convinience of your own argument. If someone have published a book to show others how to 3D model these units, if someone have published magazines on how to model real world models on these units, it is enough of a real world impact. It does not impact you, but the real world of the modeling industry and publishers and 3D modelers. No one went to improve the articles yet because you have listed too many and coined all of them to be the same.

<li><b>Question</b> <i>Until you can come up with a reliable source not dedicated to Gundam</i>. What do you actually mean? different series should be separated sources, or everything gundam related is a no? Does something like the sales of a gunpla count towards a source not dedicated to gundam, or someone writing a book stating the impact of specific gundam series to <i>name anything here</i> counted as dedicated to gundam? And what about Super Robot series? Just asking, because this is not clear enough. I limit the sentence to <i>Gundam Seed and Seed-Destiny anime and official guide books</i> for the moment.
<p>P.S. The WP:OR quoted here have been taken to a liberty of extending it to an out-of-reach limitation.

<li>These articles are all pretty much the same. All the complaints in the nomination/comments apply to all of them, in particular that there's no reputable secondary sources that provide the level of detail that would justify so very many articles instead of one or a few covering the whole topic. Are each of these lines of robots even central to the actual series? There's no hint of this in the articles, I don't even see episode/series/movie titles listed.

<li>Then wishfully there will be someone with enough knowledge and time to modify them to better articles, one by one. I never have both and I have no interest in working extensively on CE related stuff and thus I only care about this deletion process and how much it really follows WP. From what I see now, the WP is explaint in a pretty twisted way to justify the deletion of all the articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Move to alternative Wiki</b> per SeizureDog. However, this nomination is in bad form, and as much as I don't like the "tone" thing much, TheEmulatorGuy is actually being a dick, which is bad for someone so keen about policies. Oh, and if we are looking into the backgrounds, all the deleters have created their accounts about a month ago top, and all around the same dates. From what I see here, this is a "Keepers vs Deletionists" thing. I personally hate to throw good material to the garbage, and I feel like there should be a procedure of creating alternative wikis for cases like this. Additionally, it seems like a good part of this articles coul be made encyclopedic easily by adding a few lines of "the introduction of these suits had this and that impact on the series, as ----- commented in an interview." I never watched Gundam, and I'm no fan of the genre, but I know a <i>major</i> anime series when I see one, and coverage should abund if someone takes the pain to look into it.--<a href="../../../%24/y/d/User%7E%24yD%21_1c61.html" title="User:$yD!">SidiLemine</a> 16:35, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - There is but one catch to this deletion process: People voting here do not know what they are voting for. There is no direct link to <b>all</b> the pages that are nominated. Yes, there is a function called <i>What links here</i> however, it is almost certained that most people would not know its exsistence and still vote on the subject. And thus making the nomination not reputable just because there is no way to tell if people even know what there are voting about other than <i>a bunch of supposedly OR pages</i>. If users who voted above saw this comment, please edit your vote to reflect you have at least looked through all the pages and <b>know what they are about</b>, to show that the vote is reputable. The list contain <b>2</b> pages.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Secondly - The <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> does not extend to fictional characters that appears in an anime(Seed and probably Seed-Destiny), in manga(Seed Astray, Astray-X, Destiny Astray), in settings(Seed MSV, Seed-D MSV), Official guide books(Seed data file characters 1~4, Mechanical file 1~4), and a Gundam Mobile Suit guide book for most Gundam series instead of Seed and Seed-D dedicated(MS encyclopedia 2003 and 2006). Some even appeared in the Super Robot Series(Super Robot Wars) that is not dedicated to Gundam but almost every single major mecha anime. Yes, it is very likely that these pages will recieve a lot of fancruff and OR in it if left unattented, however, this is not a reason of deleting any article just because they <b>may</b> contain OR.</dd>
<dd>More reasoning could counter arguments made by the nominator:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought.</i> - No, this is not publishing an original thought, the page is <b>not</b> created by the author of said <i>characters</i>(mecha), and there are more than one source backing them up (I know not all the pages include their sources, and I have no will in doing). No, they do not have to be <i>not dedicated to Gundam</i>, They just have to be not dedicated to the series, i.e. not a comic retelling of the anime, not a novel written by the same author, etc. If someone published a book talking about these <i>characters</i>, in a different way than the story plot itself, it is justified to be a secondary source. Which actually means that the articles not just justified the WP:NOT test, but can also be written to justify the style of an <i>out-of-universe</i> view.</li>
<li><i>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</i> - Yes, but per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, <i>Major characters (and places, concepts, etc.) in a work of fiction should be covered within the article on that work of fiction. If an encyclopedic treatment of such a character causes the article on the work itself to become long, then that character can be given a separate article.</i> <b>and</b> <i>The difference between 'major' and 'minor' characters is intentionally vague; the main criterion is how much non-trivial information is available on the character. Some books could plausibly have several dozen major characters.</i> Here, in the list of AfD, I see quite a lot of important mecha that major characters used. Therefore, at least some of the articles here should not be deleted under this rule. In fact, a <i>citation needed</i> is what you need in these articles.
<dl>
<dd>And yes, I agreed with the fact that <i>There is no reason for keeping them</i>, most of them, at least. However, some of them should be kept, but the nominator indiscriminately list everything here, and thus it is too generic to vote for a yes.</dd>
<dd>And another yes, it does not matter which one goes first, but it should always be done in the correct way, with correctly informed voters, with correctly listed reasons.</dd>
<dd>Also, per <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Minor_characters_9616.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Minor characters</a>, <b>Fictional characters which are cultural icons transcending their appearance in a particular work of fiction, or who cannot be neatly tied to a particular work of fiction or fictional universe deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</b> This is not an official policy, but a consensus. If they appeared in Super Robot Wars and SD Gundam G Generation, than it cannot be tied to a particular work (It is not Mobile Suit Gundam Seed's Cosmic Era anymore) and thus <i>deserve articles of their own, regardless of other circumstances.</i> The fun thing is, there are a few listed mechas actually showed up in series that are not related to gundam at all, like freedom in <i>Magical Nurse Komugi</i> and <i>Comic Party</i> and various units appeared more than once in the magazines <i>Hobby Japan</i> and <i>Dengeki Hobby</i> as iconic model kits. If the nominator is going to do anything similar (I mean this kind of mass deletion) to the UC timeline of Gundam, be informed here that most units in that timeline is also showed in <i>Keroro Kunsou</i>, <i>Genshiken</i>, <i>Plamo tsuguru</i>(TV show teaching how to build plastic models).</dd>
<dd>I am all into deleting most of the pages listed, however, due to above reasons, this nomination did not completely followed the rules and is just too generic and took too much liberty in explaining the wiki policy, I am going to vote a:</dd>
<dd><b>Keep</b> per above reasons.

<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: The initiative previously failed because of a lack of information. I have provided everything required, making the decision much more clearer. I am trying to argue against this "potentially valuable" information argument. You're only assuming the information might be valuable because of ignorance, but I have looked through all of the articles, and none of it is valuable. For you to decide whether it is valuable or not, you will have to look at the articles. Otherwise, voting "keep" is just as foolish. You can't base a vote on ignorance - whether it's "keep" or "delete".
<ul>
<li><b>Follow-up</b>: To do as you are asking is to delete dozens of articles which probably have not been read individually by us editors. I will read each one on a case-by-case basis, but I don't have the hours required to sift through each article in a blanket VfD. Are we to simply take your word that each and every article has no potentially valuable information AND is in violation of WikiPolicy? To vote based on such would be irresponsible &amp; the height of ignorance.

<li>I just want to <b>comment</b> on how irritating I find it that so many of the people who have chimed in to this debate did not bother reading previous postings or even the original nomination. Yes it is long, but how can you expect to participate in a discussion if you are only aware of the previous three things that have been uttered? Not to select any particular editors for chiding, but I am especially surprised at how many people demanded the articles be transwikied even as TheEmulatorGuy was responding to each such comment individually saying "please read the nomination."--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5">Dmz5</a> 06:27, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That there exists a project is not a reason to keep them. Do they follow policies, especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>?

<dd>Fram is right on this one. The fact that there is a project devoted to a subject does not mean we should start writing articles on everything that falls under that subject. We have a Wikiproject on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Librarians_c634.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Librarians">libraries and librarians</a>. Does it follow that we should then write and keep an article on every library and librarian in the known universe?

<li><b>Keep</b>. the Delete admin stated the following (roughly): The only ones who wants to know said gundam is X meters high is a gundam fan! THIS is an ultimatly wrong statement, and if this was to be the rule, than wikipedia all encylopedias worldwide would be EXTREMELY narrow. To say that unless proven to be useful to everyone, it should not be part of an encyclopedia. Encylopedias, and wikipedia for that matter, does not contain info that is useful to everyone, however, shouldn`t the fact that it is useful to SOMEONE be a decisive factor?</li>

<dl>
<dd>No, the nominator (not a "delete admin", just a regular editor: anyone can nominate articles for deletion) gave numerous reasons for deletion, one of them being that these articles violate one of our core policies, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Since these articles seem to be not only not verified but actually unverifiable (from secondary sources), they are a violation of what Wikipedia is supposed to be, and should be deleted. It doesn't matter if anyone likes or dislikes the subjects (we have many articles on subjects I utterly dislike), we should only look if these articles are conform to the policies of Wikipedia. They are not, and thus should be deleted. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:55, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete all.</b> No matter your qualms with the <i>procedural</i> value of this nomination, there have been no arguments made that successfully defend against the charges leveled by the nominator. The current poll of votes shows 16-19 "keep" votes, but digging beyond the numbers game reveals a clearer picture of what's going on here. Eight keep votes reflect reservations about the way the articles were nominated, and say nothing about the content of the articles. Four "keep" votes are simple <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a> statements. Another "keep" vote is a regurgitation of the "worse articles exist, therefore this should be kept" fallacy. That means that 68.42 percent of the keep voters are ignoring the actual policy arguments, and chasing their tails in some rhetorical netherworld instead. It is my sincerest hope that the closing administrator realizes this. How on Earth is information like the following a worthy inclusion to the encyclopedia?</li>

<p>Please, by all means, explain to me how that information is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? Our guiding policy here should be <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, which gives us this gem of useful information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These articles are written entirely in an "in-universe" style of prose, thus invalidating our first premise. They are unsourced, invalidating our second premise. They make no reference to their cultural value outside of the series, thus invalidating our third premise. In the end, they are a summary of Gundam-specific <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treknobabble.html" title="Treknobabble">treknobabble</a>, regurgitating plot specifics. What have we learned, then? Not only do they fail to meet any of the <i>positive</i> criteria set forth, they specifically violate the <b>only negative</b> criteria. Seriously. What's going on in here?</p>
<p>It has already been argued that the Gundam Wing series is a cultural staple and thus important to the encyclopedia as an article reflecting the significance of anime culture. Fine. That's why we've got an article called <a href="../../../m/o/b/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_7037.html" title="Mobile Suit Gundam">Mobile Suit Gundam</a>. It covers the psychological and historical value of the franchise without vomiting up huge amounts of made-up statistics and histories for its myriad of plot-specific devices and characters. So stop saying we need an article about a futuristic backhoe to explain how the world is a better place because of the Gundam anime.</p>
<p>This debate needs to focus less on how much of a dick the nominator is (whether he is or not), and get to the crux of the issue: do these articles meet current Wikipedia policy for inclusion?

<dd>This depends on who know their exsistence and who voted. There are unfortunately too many Cosmic Era fans who just walk by and do random edits. There is no method in stopping these. I can foresee these pages be recreated again and again after every deletion if there are no redirects that led them to a list(At least that's what happen to a lot of similar page in the Chinese and Japanese wiki). Actually, this is already a sign of what level of impact those things are influencing our real world. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:12, 2 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If they are recreated after deletion, the proper response is to delete them again, and salt the earth from whence they rose. The fact that a lot of people edit an article is not an indicator of real-world impact, but rather an indicator of fan base. This was one of the major criticisms raised against Wikipedia in its humble beginnings: it was biased towards popular culture and current events articles because no one was interested in writing an article on hard science or math theory. The standards in <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> go beyond "real world impact," also, a fact which continues to be ignored in this debate. Despite the "hundreds of editors" who've worked on these articles, not a one of them has bothered to put any non-fictional context into the article. You tell me how big its fake guns are, how fast its fake engines can go, and how long its fake legs are, but there is <i>absolutely nothing</i> about the artist who designed these units, or how they play into general themes of the anime, or how they've influenced the realm of anime-robot-drawing. The reason for this is simple in some cases -- the subject of the article '<i>just hasn't done any of those things</i>. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:11, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This is you POV, not wiki's. People <i>say this</i> people <i>say that</i>. Your argument based on a lot of elements that could be called original research, without a source, and violate the NPOV rule. Where on earth does wiki policy states that wiki should be only hard science, math theory? (though I really like those, too) I agree they should have some level of real-world context, they should have information on who designed them and by the influence of what (of course, sourced information). Again, I must tell you that these articles just did not have anyone with the knowledge and sources to edit them, you cannot just coin that to <i>they can never be improved</i>. And face it, popular culture <b>is</b> a real world impact, and I have already included sources that show how some of these articles can be improved to show real world impact. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:28, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The fact that you have introduced this new term to me is ironically true that it can be used on yourself. You have strayed the discussion on saying how people critized wiki, without source, and expect me to say nothing about it? Back to the discussion. Face it, what I have listed are enough to write a good article on how some of these fictional characters made a real world impact, they have at least impacted someone to write a book on how to 3D model them, they have impacted people on writing published articles on teaching how to model using them as a reference. Even published POV critics can be included in wiki's article, therefore, a third party company publishing magazines and books referencing these fictional units, not talking about the plot, but just using them as a good tutoring material that a lot of people are familiar with, is a good source of indicating real world impact. If only I can scan a fan poll listed in magazine on which of these are more popular, there will be even more real world context, I do not have the magaizne, and I have no interest in finding one, therefore I never said anything about using it as a source. However, for a show having that kind of popularity in Japan, compared to any other anime, they always put up polls just to do a marketing research on which unit they can make a model kit and gain profit on.
<dl>
<dd>No. A straw man fallacy is when you take someone's argument, and reconstruct it in a weaker, more-easily disposed form. I said, historically, there has been a bias towards popular culture instead of hard-science, and that caused criticism. The bias existed because people wrote about their interests, and not necessarily on what people deem academically "important" for an encyclopedia. That there are a lot of people interested in a topic does not make it important. Somehow, you transformed that into me saying, "we should only have articles on hard science and math," which is not only disingenuous, but flat out <b>wrong.</b> Stop it. Even if you're only misusing the term straw man and instead arguing that I'm shifting the debate, it's still a non-responsive argument. I'm probing deeper into why these articles violate <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>, and you're regurgitating the same word-vomit that you have been all thread: "it's notable and important because people make models of them." What you have yet to address is the fact that, despite the hundreds of edits and dozens of eyes that have passed over these articles, no one has taken the time to meet the criteria for writing on fiction. No matter what <i>might be</i>, we're here to deal with <i>what is</i>. And unless you can prove to me that each of these cartoon fabrications has single-handedly reshaped the way people think about drawing 3D stuff, you can't slap a blanket on them and say, "They all belong."</dd>
<dd>Hell, the fact that they wrote a guide on how to model a Gundam isn't a very strong argument in the first place, because <i>not a single friggin' article talks about how these robots significantly affected the world of 3D modeling.</i> "So what?" you say, "People wrote about it in a third-party publication, so it's automatically noteable enough to merit an article." That's bunk. If we grant your premise that the Gundamspooge has rocked the world of 3D modeling -- which I <i>assure you</i>, it hasn't -- that's information that needs to go in the article on 3D modeling. Stop dodging the question and answer me: <b>which of the eleven characteristics of out-of-universe writing do these articles demonstrate?</b> <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 05:31, 4 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Question</b> where on earth do you see a policy saying it has to shake the whole world of 3D modeling before it can be said that it got some impact? Given, if a third party published a book of using it to teach 3D modeling, it means that it got enough credits and popularity that someone actually paid the copyright in order to use the designs for their books. No, it can never be so shocking that it moves the whole 3D modeling community, and thus it is not suitable to be mentioned in the 3D modeling article. However, a book written is a verifiable source of <i>its popularity among the general public</i> and <i>the influence of the work on later creators and their projects</i>. A third party publishing a book about these units is a very good demostration on how these units influenced the work of later creators and their projects. These articles currently contains none of these is a sign of they needed to be improved, if any of the fans cared to do so. Not a sign of deleting them. I have provided the sources, and the argument, and already said that if no one is changing them, I will merge them into a list. I never said anything about they should be kept as they are, and this is why I said the term you have introduced to me is ironically suitable for yourself, while I never said it is not suitable on what I said earlier about your unsourced argument on how people think wiki is biased towards popular culture. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 05:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Like I have said, having books published satisfy the idea of <i>It is the source writers, not the target readership population, that is relevant to the primary notability criterion.</i>, while you keep ignoring. Yes, they are not of a mainstream press, in America, but do I have to tell you that wiki is an international page, and the publishers are at least mainstream in Japan, if not Asia. The Magazines I have quoted are <b>not</b> Gundam or Anime based. Half of Hobby Japan talks about real world machine models, like cars, aeroplanes, ships and such. And your hatred in Anime does not take away the credibility of a magazine focusing on Anime is not a mainstream publisher and is biased on Gundam. Dengeki Hobby is more figure related than Gundam related. Yes, in your view anything that you have no interest in is not mainstream, because you simply do not need to pay any attention on it, and thus I have the idea of no matter how many sources I can include, you are just going to be able to say they are not notable, not mainstream. From the original Arguement of the nominator of having sources <i>not dedicated</i> to Gundam, you have moved the level higher onto an argument of needing to have sources <i>not dedicated to Anime</i>, and probably you will yet try to raise the bar to any sources dedicated to any sort of fan base, including models, anime, comics, novels, games, and any other thing you cannot name of but have a certain group of fans, and maybe just in case some star war fans are interested in Gundam, too, should not carry enough notablity as they are not mainstream, because you simply hate the fact that they are a source countering your argument. Oh, and I can add it up for you, a newspaper becoming immediately not mainstream if they have said anything about any of these Gundam mechas, why? because they are fan based, they are anime based, and center on the Gundam universe. Face it: <a href="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" class="external text" title="http://www.mediaworks.co.jp/d_original/hobby/index.php" rel="nofollow">Dengeki Hobby Magazine</a> is a mainstream modeling and figure magazine that is even translated to 2 chinese version(Hong Kong and <a href="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" class="external text" title="http://www.ching-win.com.tw/hobby/hobby.php" rel="nofollow">Taiwan</a>), <a href="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" class="external text" title="http://www.hobbyjapan.co.jp/hobbyjapan/" rel="nofollow">Hobby Japan</a> only have Gundam as one of its nine sections, with at least 3 sections not related to Anime. And if you wanted to say that the section itself is not maintream publishers, anyone could have the same argument on anything, because you can even ignore any sources from CNN or BBC if you say that particular news is written by who is biased towards that topic. And No, wiki never states its sources have to be mainstream, if it got published, by a third party company, it is good enough as a source. It doen't matter if it is anime oriented or not, it is available on the market, people can read it and learn about what is written in it, it is good enough to be listed as a source stating how anything impacted anyone on writing that article of that particular thing. As a matter of facts, the Tokien Companion is a perfect source for books of J.R.R. Tokien. And thus a third party publisher writing anything on a topic should be a perfectly valid source.<a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 16:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Apparently, we're continuing our parade of bad arguments, and the next stop on your tour is a <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">ignoratio elenchi</a>. I'll play along and grant that these articles demonstrate a significant interest in the Gundamgoo that we're talking about. I'll do you one better, and say that it shows a notable real-world impact, and is thus meritous of inclusion. I don't agree with either of those statements, but we're pretending here, mmkay? Now, tell me what that has to do with the fact that the articles don't meet any of the burdens presented by <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICTION_01cd.html" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>?

<dd>The thrust of my argument has, since the beginning, been that the articles you defend do not meet the criterion established by Wikipedia consensus in reference to writing about fictional topics. Along the way, I've had to defend against the notion that model kits inherently equal notability, but you'll notice I end each response with a return to the original question. Tell me, dear sir, how these articles meet the expectations placed upon them by the guidelines of our encyclopedia? <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 21:19, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I have answered it many times. I never said anything about keeping all of them, and I never said all of them are important, I am just saying the ones that recieve out of universe treatment, like having a model made and appearing in another anime not made by the authors and company of the original anime, and appearing in a published magazine, serveral times, satisfy having <b>influenced the work of later creators and their projects</b>. Since these are not real human acting, the people who design them(including original design and finishing and redesigns) should be listed and replace the point of <i>the actor who portrayed the role</i>. The real world factors that have influenced the work can be found in an interview(listed in the Official website) of the director and two other interviews of the mechanical designer(listed in Data files) who said the designs are influenced by some of the previous Gundam productions not designed by him. Reception by critics can be sourced from the model magazines which over and over stated these designs reference too much from the previous Gundam series and some even referenced non-Gundam series. More could be found in Game Express Magazine published in Hong Kong that Critically analyze by Jeto(similar pronounciation) the series of main mechas(in separate issues) about how the main characters use auto lock on instead of real piloting skills in massive genocide and how the other mechas are being just paper boards without even moving and aiming.(The last one I never state because even though I totally agree with him, I know that that critic does not recieve much credit for his articles of constantly bashing on new series and is being criticised for that) How some of these articles can meet the expectation of our encyclopedia is simple. It cannot cover every single point, but at least some of the articles can have enough coverage on how much it was influenced by previous productions and how much influence they have on the real world modeling, 3D modeling, and anime production of later creators. And sources are posted over and over again. And no, I keep saying the articles at their current state does not meet any of the guidelines and must be improved, and I am assuming good faith on people who are interested in them with the sources I have provided will do a good enough job. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 02:55, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If any of that information appeared in the articles in question, I'm sure things would've gone a lot differently than they have so far. But until those statements, sourced and correctly applied, appear in the articles, then they stand to be deleted. Which articles specifically will benefit from those additions?

<dd>I am constructing a list of what to do down there, I think if it is passed, we we have some sort of consensus dispite this trainwreck. However, I will use the word <i>merge</i>(and redirect) instead of <i>delete</i>. If they are redirected, it is highly likely that people that can find their information will not create a new page by copyvio from mahq or something like that. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 03:27, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, having real world context is essential, but an article not having them maybe just needed to improve, especially sources indicate they can be. You can always assume bad faith, but the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Such_a_minor_branch_of_a_subject_that_it_doesn.27t_deserve_an_article" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion guide</a> suggested a merge for these kind of articles instead of a delete. I know 1.3 states WP:NOT as a <i>may be needed for deletion</i>, however, again, I must say that this is only a straw man's explanation on the WP:NOT policy. The <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> have nothing stating about these kind of articles and obviously a lot of list articles here falls into <i>Such a minor branch of a subject that it doesn't deserve an article</i> This is why the nomiation is doomed to fail. It should not have started anyway. The nominator should just be bold and started merging them in the beginning(and no, a transwiki is just different from having a list on wiki unless we can redirect people to there without using an external link). Now it is listed, no one can do so because it is like blanking the pages. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 01:52, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If no one can show real-world impact for the articles on an AfD, then that is an extremely clear indicator is has no real-world impact. He's not coining the term "never be improved", he's showing it through evidence - evidence being that no one has shown any importance of any of the articles whatsoever. The sources you have given are NOT proof of a real-world impact. I have already explained it, please read it. You're giving me clear proof IQ is not an indicator of common sense, comprehension or intelligence itself - and no, that is not a personal vendetta or attack. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 05:37, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, keep ignoring the sources, everything that indicate they have an impact is <i>dedicted to Gundam</i> and should not be used, should not be listed and should not carry any notability since they are against <b>your</b> argument. Face it, the series is made by Sunrise, the models are made by Bandai, which are two different companies, that is enough prove of every single model made is an impact on the real world. The magazines are published by different companies, the books are published by different companies, anime made by other companies with no relationship to Sunrise that may infringe copyright problems are also shown as a proof and your common sense is ignoring anything that is against your argument, you have shown clear prove of ignorancy and yet you try to use personal attacks, POV and bad faith just to try to hook to your own nomination without even trying to link all of these together.

<dd>Excuse me? Ignoring this sources? I clearly explained why the sources do not give leniancy to separate articles. This is because the "model kits" for each robot are part of a SERIES of model kits - it's not just this one little robot, it's all of the robots - they're not uniquely important - that is why a keep vote is complete nonsense in reference to those sources. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 21:48, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep All</b>But condense the information... However, I think the whole premise of this motion is outrageous! Many of the points that the main person opposed to these articles (EmulatorGuy) has raised are vague, personal opinions which seem to have been raised on the basis of a personal vendetta. I like the way this material is called "useless" - useless to whom? It seems only to be useless to the people nominating the article and there are evidently plenty of people who find it quite useFUL. If we apply his model to the whole of Wikipedia: there will be no articles remaining for anyone to discuss or do anything with. It is obvious that many people want these articles to remain. This is supposed to be an open, public contributed resource of information, regardless of what spurious guidelines you care to spout out, (which seem more inane to me than most inclusions in these articles). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 195.18.135.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.18.135.215_ed6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.18.135.215">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 195.18.135.215 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_195.18.135.215_ed6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/195.18.135.215">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

Ben's redirect should be considered a delete (since you have to delete to redirect) and SidiLemine and Kerochan no Miko only said keep unless it was transwiki-ed. So that's at least 18 to <s>16</s> 17. wtfunkymonkey's vote probably shouldn't be considered, as it's both a delete and keep statement, so I say the voting stands at 18 to <s>15</s> 16, delete being the majority. --<a href="../../../s/e/i/User%7ESeizureDog_9ca5.html" title="User:SeizureDog">SeizureDog</a> 01:25, 1 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm sick of defending every argument here. It just isn't worth it, no one wants to accept it and keeps ignoring logic. From here on I'll just stop and let the nomination get a "no consensus", which was clearly going to happen from the start. It's beyond me why anyone thinks these articles are notable, have reliable sources etc. etc. etc. I shouldn't bother, regardless of any of my arguments, Wikipedia administrators will base it on amount of votes (like they always do) and not the integrity of votes. I give up, you can have your articles if the administrator says so. If the nomination results in delete, that's fine, but it's just not worth pointlessly arguing with ignorance. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheEmulatorGuy_9ad3.html" title="User:TheEmulatorGuy">TheEmulatorGuy</a> 02:20, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You're misinterpreting the guts of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. The fact that some of these things appeared in another anime about big robots does not mean that they significantly impacted said anime. These big robots haven't significantly affected <b>anything.</b> The television show, perhaps, has made a dent in the Great Big Timeline of Stuff, but I'm willing to bet, when it all comes down to the line, no one is going to say, "Thank God for the <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-600_GuAIZ_af9c.html" title="ZGMF-600 GuAIZ">ZGMF-600 GuAIZ</a>.

WP:FICT makes the argument for real-world reference and analysis because Wikipedia <b>is not</b> a Gundam fan site, and the sum cultural value of the Gundam series is not going to be that Pilot X stole it from Evil Nemesis Q, who was going to use it against Innocent Population T, but instead managed to defeat Otherworldly Monster N, and is the reason for the ring of space debris floating around Planet U.

<dd>I hadn't read the X-Wing article until now. Having done so, I'd say it's pretty crappy, and a poor example of writing on a fictional topic.

That article needs cleaned up, purged of irrelevant and trivial knowledge, and polished, but I digress. Since I'm not familiar with the intimate details of Gundam stuff, I'll trust you that some of the units mentioned are of value to the series. Could you give some examples of the ones you think should be kept, and provide a rationale for them?

<p><b>Comment:</b> I've never seen any Gundam, but I have a strong feeling that most, if not all, of these articles are about things that only appeared briefly in an episode or two. Any character/etc. that does not have at least ~30 minutes worth of focused airtime is too minor to have an article about. Can it be established that <i>any</i> of these weapons have had enough focus within the series that they need to be kept? It just gets worse outside of the nominated articles.

<dd><b>Reply</b> I agree that some of these articles deserve AfD-ing, but the majority of them do not. This was a bad nom period. If TheEmulatorGuy wants to have them deleted he should have done so on an individual basis. It is terribly unfair to judge the primary mech which are included in the template on the same level as your mentioned Missile truck. <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 11:37, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b> Its better, but I wouldn't suggest making mass deletion noms out of principle. For example, the Skygrasper in this new Nom is one of the more featured air/spacecraft of the show and some of the main characters involved in the story fly them. A lot of those articles I agree should go, or at the very least be merged together. I wonder if there was originally a large article that was split.... <a href="../../../k/y/a/User%7EKyaa_the_Catlord_f18d.html" title="User:Kyaa the Catlord">Kyaa the Catlord</a> 12:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>From what I see in the series, its worst. The mass-production models appear in the series as paper boards and have probably less than 5 actions each. They fly out and get destroyed by the main characters without even having the need of dodging or aiming(aiming is done by an automatic fire control system, much less powerful than the F-22 onboard FCS). The same sequence keep on and on just to show how <i>powerful</i> the main characters are(failure attempt to most people with normal level of judgement, i.e. that are not blind). That is why I am really into merging those into one big list. As per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. No voting is needed according the WP:FICT for minor characters to be merged into a list, if there isn't already a AfD tag on the page, I would have done so when I knew pages like this exsisted. I only followed a vandal's path of vandalism and figured these mecha have their own page and someone tagged AfD on it so that nothing can be done to blank them, yet. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:42, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>While I'm in favor of merging for most of the "grunt" suits, may I suggest merging them by national affiliation?

<dd>I think there ought to be a WikiPolicy to explicitly ban mass deletions, myself. Each article submitted for deletion deserves a complete, thorough and <i>individual</i> investigation, and mass deletions strike me more and more with each one as a deliberate abuse of the rules. If the deletionists think that's a pain in the ass, that's too damned bad, you can't just say something is useless and needs to be deleted just because <i>you</i> don't like it.

<li><b>Comment</b> And the bullying of fictional articles continues.

<li>The problem I have is, coming in as someone who hasn't seen the show but has read the article <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam.html" title="Gundam">Gundam</a>, I have no idea why the information on these pages is important. It strikes me as being as unencylopedic as reporting the exact dimensions of every prop used in star trek, or a data dump of the internal numbers used in a video game ("headcrab has 37 hitpoints, and does 20 hitpoints of damage. 9mm bullet does 40 hitpoints of damage, except on hard difficulty, where it does 20..."). It's not like we're considering deleting all or even most of the articles dedicated to a single franchise; as far as I can tell these don't even touch on the plot, characters, fanbase, criticism, impact on the real world, etc., just the props. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 18:23, 1 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Some of the articles should be merged. That's not the point. The Gundams used by the major characters <i>are</i> important enough to warrant individual articles, because like the <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wing</a>, they are <i>really important</i>, unique props which are used by <b>main characters</b> of the show through a significant part of the story arc, and are practically characters in their own right.

<dd><b>Arguable items</b></dd>
<dd>The GS and GSD both have a team of three piloting three different Gundam units that the main protongist fight against, these units mainly appeared only in the series and games by Bandai, they are not even a main element in the plot(none of them stayed in the series for more than half of the series). They recieve a little more treatment by having models in the GS and GSD series but not much in the Bandai regular series like the MG models. (Almost all important ones have MG models). I do not view them as having any appearance in the model because it is only one of the GS and GSD series models which are named as dedicated to those two series. Even if they exsist outside the main lists, they should be merged to the three in the team instead of having their own page.</dd>

<dd>Emulator, all you have done in this whole discussion is continued reassertion of your initial premise. It's already been firmly established that you believe there is no viable content to be had from these articles, which is debated by other posters (including posters who are not fans of the Gundam Seed universe), so further reiteration of this argument is pretty well pointless. If by this point, where viable post-AfD plans have been mentioned and posted, which satisfy the requirements of policy, you are still sticking to your original premise and demanding that the entire article complex be thrown away, in spite of all apparent evidence that contradicts your original argument (which was based on a pretty twisted interpretation of policy to begin with), you simply have nothing meaningful to contribute to this conversation from this point on (really, you have contributed nothing meaningful since the initial nomination). The consensus appears to be <b>keep some, merge most,</b> and that is probably what the discussion should be closed on. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIceberg3k_a804.html" title="User:Iceberg3k">Iceberg3k</a> 23:05, 3 December 2006 (UTC)

I'll let you ignore the fact ANY separate article for a weapon in Gundam is against policy, because obviously we need fucking "individual merit".

<li><b>Comment</b> It may be that this needs to be broken into smaller chunks. However, the other side of this issue is that having the same people make the same arguments in 84 different discussions is also not useful. It would be helpful if the people arguing for a finer-grained deletion discussion could delineate some middle ground between 1 and 84 AfDs so that we can move forward instead of stagnating. Without wanting to prejudice the discussion, I will say that it seems to me that at minimum there is a consensus here that some of the articles should go, so maybe some consensus can at least be reached on which ones those are. For at least that reason, I think it is premature at this time to close this discussion. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 00:02, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply comment</b> I guess it is because it happened that all the 84 randomly selected articles are not of good quality? lol I must admit the work going into these articles are towards a not very good direction. Most of them are just going for 1) plot summary of what happened to that unit(or the series of them) and 2) the settings spec of them. While little can be found on what they have impacted, even with the handful of sources I can just pull up that should be included into the articles long ago. (I have not read any of these articles before, even if I made like a little edit on them, it is most likely that I am tracing a vandal's path of vandalization and only revert those without actually looking at the articles.) Most of them could be improved, at least the lot of Seed mecha can be said to have impacted the Seed-Destiny mechas and have appearance in Super Robot wars. However, little was included in these, and I have no interest and time in improving these because I have an even longer list of Universal Century Mechas to work on, before some deletionist list the few hundred mechas AfD, I have to do what I can to either merge them or improve them to a point where it is good enough to meet any policy creep keeping criteria. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 14:03, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Not so. The only reason why this has generated so much heat is because of the sheer size - this would set a massive precedent if all of the articles were deleted. So <b>all</b> of the editors are jumping into this melee, inclusionists and deletionists alike, to put their two cents in. "Intense discussion =/= worth of inclusion." GNAA had to go through <b>18 nominations</b> and dozens of talk page archives, but it was eventually deleted because it did not adhere to the standards of WP:V and WP:RS.

<dd><b>Reply</b> In this case, the original poster should not have used the afd process in this manner.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd just like to say that this AfD is a complete catastrophe, and that each article should , really, be AfD'd seperately. If this goes through it will end up in DRV because of the Inclusionists here. As a Deletionist, I'm not really ... happy ... with the way this is laid out, since it's a bit of work to look through all the articles and Gundam makes me see red anyway. That being said, some of these articles are possible copyvios. Some are just summaries. Some could, theoretically, be expanded. Mass AfD's rarely succeed since most people will not axe huge clumps of information without being sure every single one deserves the axe. This one will go down as no consensus, so a good and careful look at most of the articles in this series is needed by those voting to keep on how to expand them, or in a few days I'll go through AfDing the crap ones and voting they get salted. --<font face="Verdana"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="SteelBlue">Elar</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a_7dff.html" title="User:Elaragirl/a"><font color="orange"><b>a</b></font></a><font color="SteelBlue">girl</font><small><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a>|Count</sup></small></font> 15:44, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the sake of all that is non-flamewar-causing, let us do some editing and merging before any new AfDs go out. This AfD is a train wreck because the initial poster was so goddamned determined to get the whole mass AfD deleted without any sort of compromise that he was willing to ignore policy to try to get it done (recall that he threatened to immediately re-nominate the whole thing if the result came up "no consensus" and to "teach the administrators a lesson" if the result came up "keep"); emotions need time to settle before further delete action should be taken, IMO.

Nominating 84 articles at once is not going to solve any problems these articles may have; merging, redirecting and such will, and will prevent the articles from being recreated with policy-violating content again. If nothing is done to correct the obvious problems that these articles have, then the nominator will certainly have the opportunity to kill them with fire in the future, and I think he'd be more successful with this discussion backing him. <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatbag_b817.html" title="User:Catbag">Catbag</a> 22:45, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>More and more people pop in and say <b>keep</b>, I hate to say this, but if we can say we have the least consensus here, it is <b>merge</b>, not keep, most of the articles. If you only want spec data for something, go to [www.mahq.net MAHQ.net], or the trans wiki link posted somewhere in the middle of this trainwreck. Or if we merged the pages, the spec will still be there. Here is what I propose, and is probably closest to people who actively participated in this discussion want. (I do not count the people who just come out and drop down a sentence without actually wanting to contribute and wished a blind keep).</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - Influenced at least 2, if not 3 later design in the sequel of the series, the only Perfect grade model of the series, used as the front page of a 3D modeling teaching book about all Gundam, not Seed only. Said to be one of the more realistic military based design of the mechanical designer <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kunio_Okawara_1bbe.html" title="Kunio Okawara">Kunio Okawara</a> by Dengeki Hobby. Been a featured topic of a model convention in Japan by Hobby Japan.</dd>
<dd>Reasons for merge of others - they are of a subdivision of Strike, either mass-production or special unit. They have not recieve any special treatment from the company Bandai, and thus are generic enough to be merged, if not deleted.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X10A_Freedom_Gundam_1926.html" title="ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam">ZGMF-X10A Freedom Gundam</a>, and have <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X20A_Strike_Freedom_8f84.html" title="ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom">ZGMF-X20A Strike Freedom</a> merged to it. If possible, merge the Justice page and the <i>ZGMF-X1??</i> series under this page. more details will be stated in the section <i>Suggested merges</i> below. For now, I treat those as they could be separated.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - Influenced said merge mecha in the sequel, recieved treatment of having a Master Grade model of its own and the same series only have Strike Gundam having the same treatment. Featured in the Game <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Robot_Wars_af61.html" title="Super Robot Wars">Super Robot Wars</a> along with a lot of well known mecha in Japan, and have a cameo appearance in the anime <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse_Witch_Komugi_c7e4.html" title="Nurse Witch Komugi">Nurse Witch Komugi</a>, produced by Tatsunoko productions, which have no relationship with Bandai and is actually sort of a rivaling company.</dd>
<dd>Reasons for merge of others - Strike Freedom is more of an upgrade of Freedom, although it is going to have its own Master Grade model soon(December, 2006), more have to be shown in a keep since it does not influence anything, yet. I see no reason for keeping it for now, if it can recieve more attention by publishers and the company, it could be split back out at any time.
<dl>
<dd>For Strike Freedom and Infinite Justice: Not quite usual upgrade. Not even a variant. That why we place F-15 and F-15E, F18 and F18E/F, separately. They are quite distinct, they have quite a story (Though original Freedom has more). Though they take much previous design, it is quite different, except some source say so. I never see any source which say they are upgrades. This may be only speculation, however, Freedom, Justice, Strike Freedom, Infinite Justice, receive different code (X10A,X9A,X20A,X19A respectively). I may agree if asked to merge Infinite Justice, but not the Strike Freedom based on notability. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraconins_da4e.html" title="User:Draconins">Draconins</a> 12:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Reasons - First appeared in MSV, influenced the author of the manga to include them into the manga(which is not a retell of the anime), no out of the series model kits have been made for it, but it is featured in Gundam Evolve, a series not dedicated to Gundam Seed or related series, the only other appearance of a Seed series mecha is Strike. I would like to say merging them but having only 2 in a list without any relationship in the design plot is kinda wierd. Hoping for a better suggestion here.</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Reasons - They are pretty much the same thing, but the model recieved a bit more attention for the Gold frame is an event limited item in a Japanese model convention not dedicated to Gundam. Also for the new technology in modeling in hiding the cut between the useful pieces and the backbone of the injection moulding piece. It is not the first to have such treatment, but the second of the Bandai modeling series, after Hyakushiki. And since the other astray articles should tag along, I'd say merging them to a page for the Astray series is not a bad idea.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>ZGMF-X23S Saviour, ZGMF-X24S Chaos, ZGMF-X31S Abyss, etc. that starts with ZGMF-X??? that is not 1X are called <i>Second series</i> on the official Japanese page, they generally recieve the same treatment altogether, and should be merged to a page other than the mass-production ZAFT mecha. This includes <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X56S_Impulse_Gundam_32f8.html" title="ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam">ZGMF-X56S Impulse Gundam</a> and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X42S_Destiny_Gundam_5c98.html" title="ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam">ZGMF-X42S Destiny Gundam</a> due to their not so important figure out of the series. At least until something special about them is released, I'd say this is good enough.</li>
<li>ZGMF-X09A Justice and <a href="../../../z/g/m/ZGMF-X19A_Infinite_Justice_2bee.html" title="ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice">ZGMF-X19A Infinite Justice</a> are not even satisfied as a main plot device to some certain extend. They might be a little more important to the series, but is definitely not having any special impact to the real world. The latter actually is less popular than a Zaku unit in the series(per the series models having it out so late that it is 11 months later than the last Zaku unit.) (for the 1/144, it is even 1 month later than the Dom units) For a unit appearing pretty much the same time as the Freedom, its attention is way lower and my view on this is that its popularity is not high enough for the modeling company to release it early. Therefore, I'd say merge it to Freedom, its partner and let them tag along to increase that article's notability instead of being evaluated to be deleted soon after this.</li>

<p>I would like to say the others should be deleted, but redirects to big lists would greatly reduce the chances of them being recreated by randomly dropped by fans. Since merging everything left into one page is definitely going to exceed 32kb, I propose 2 methods of merging:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merge by fictional nations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easy links from the fictional nation page (though I kinda think they should be merged to one page, too) Easier explanation on which is the predecessor of which.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: too easy to get the articles into another mess of in-universe article, and is hard to organize the whole thing to let people without any knowledge to comprehand which one is from which story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Merge by series</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: Easier to let people know what appeared in which series (All the manga Astray series viewed as a whole) which from my point of view, it is better served as an out-of-universe view of things. (Most people walking by is not going to understand what is ZAFT and Orb and etc.)</li>
<li>Disadvantage: Units appearing in more than one series is going to make a big mess.</li>

<p>I will not work on the above articles until I have finished a major part of the Universal Century mechas having similar pages like this one. I have provide sources and what I have listed in this page should be enough to improve the articles I have listed as keeps to a point where they meet wiki's policies. If nothing has improved for some while (like more AfD pops up), I will not back up those pages any more. Because it is obvious enough that nobody cared to improve those pages. However, I see that there are people who seems to be willing to do so in the above discussion and I am assuming good faith on this. <a href="../../../m/y/t/User%7EMythsearcher_0dbf.html" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="../../../m/y/t/User_talk%7EMythsearcher_0994.html" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup> 07:05, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>So.... if we are having consensus which either keep or merge, let's propose ini the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gundam_cc10.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam</a>.

<li><b>Merge or Keep</b>: A lot of stuff is noteable and I would suggest that since a lot of debate is being brought out about all the mobile suits in one of the Gundam Universes then shouldn't this affect the mobile suits from the other Gundam Universes as well. Anyway after taking a look at some articles I can say that some ideas I have to towards trimming an article down is not to go into so much detail over Mobile suit capablities since that had resulted in mutiple paragraphs also the triva section should be trimmed down to remove any speculative, and unneccessary material. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:05, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>One other comment to post: It would help if for the Gundam articles not to go into extra detail on the Technology used in that Gundam such as Phase Shift Armor, N-Jammer Canceller, and DRAGOON System since there are already sperate articles for them and it wouldn't be ripping off the Gundam website MAHQ.net of their style of explaining this technology in their Mobile suit summary. An example I have is of the Gaia Gundam <a href="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mahq.net/mecha/gundam/seed-destiny/zgmf-x88s.htm" rel="nofollow">ZGMF-X88S (RGX-03) Gaia Gundam</a>. -<a href="../../../a/d/v/User%7EAdv193_78a0.html" title="User:Adv193">Adv193</a> 06:22, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Article merges, trims, redirects, and maybe some individual AfDs seem to be our next step. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Gundam_cc10.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gundam</a> would be a good place to organize this. I think we can all agree that things shouldn't stay, as they are now, for these articles. What to cut and what to keep is the question now. Personally, I think the whole thing could be cut, especially if it's been transwikied, but that's just me. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 07:23, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I've still yet to see an example of <i>content</i> in this category that should exist, although I imagine it would be possible to write different, out-of-universe article(s) on the <i>topic</i>. My first choice position would still be to delete these and start over; but I have no particular objection to a merge so long as it 1) drastically reduces the number of articles (sections can always be split into new articles later) and 2) Gets pushed towards <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>'s goal of articles about fiction in the real world, instead of an encylcopedia of fiction as if it were real. <a href="../../../b/c/o/User%7EBCoates_04d2.html" title="User:BCoates">BCoates</a> 08:45, 6 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
