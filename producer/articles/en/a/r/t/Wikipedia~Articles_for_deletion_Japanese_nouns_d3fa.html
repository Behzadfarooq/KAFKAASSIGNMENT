<p>This <s>is</s> appears to be a joke page, it uses complicated (but accurate) phrases to translate simple words which have English equivalents. For example: "傘 — this is a noun signifying a sort of device usually used to keep dry during a rainstorm". The normal translation for <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:傘">傘</a> (kasa) is "umbrella". (<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%98" rel="nofollow">wiktionary</a>).

<p>Response: It is most definitely not a joke page. The "complicated phrases" are intended as descriptive definitions so that there can be no confusion regarding meanings. "kasa" for example can also translate to any number of English words which are more specific types of umbrella. (note for example that Wiktionary includes "parasol" and "parachute" although I would disagree with the latter) "Umbrella" in English is also used in many cases where it makes no sense in Japanese. (on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/umbrella" class="extiw" title="wikt:umbrella">wikt:umbrella</a>, the second through fourth definitions are not accurately translated as "kasa")</p>
<p><strike>Also, I challenge you to find a single one of these that is incorrect. Some here who don't seem to speak Japanese have said the page is wrong, or that there is some factual error, with some sort of authoritative air about them, yet all I can think of is that they are making a conjecture based on the lies Uncle G has been spreading and the implication of your original nomination that the "complicated phrases" are nonsensical or incorrect.</strike> (fixed by Kappa)</p>
<p>So while it may seem like a joke, this page is entirely serious. To those who think I'm trying to make this page into a dictionary, the list is intended only to be illustrative and never to be an exhaustive list of Japanese nouns - whether that even belongs at Wiktionary is questionable (as a category maybe) - because that would really suck and stuff. As you can see, nobody has added or removed any nouns to or from the list since I created the article. I know plenty of other Japanese nouns (曇, for example, is a noun referring to a sort of formation of condensation which, when seen in the sky, appears fluffy. but did I put that on there?), yet I have not put them there. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 05:31, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I disagree. This page serves a serious function. Linguistically, it is true that there is no exact semantic equivalent for any Japanese noun to any English noun or vice-versa. There isn't anything on the page that is non-factual, and it isn't unencyclopaedic. <b>keep</b>--<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 09:21, 14 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>This comment betrays a profound lack of knowledge about Wiktionary. I recommend a visit to Wiktionary. A vast number of Japanese/Chinese articles were added to the English Wiktionary early on in its life. Its coverage of those languages is extensive. For your edification, I've interwiki linked some of the words in this list to the Wiktionary articles. I strongly suggest following them, and comparing the (deliberately) pathetic tripe that is in this article with the proper definitions that already exist at Wiktionary. This article is plainly a parody, created to make a point. Wiktionary has no need of it. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:08, 2005 May 15 (UTC)

<li>Isn't there something about being nice to users? As for profound lack of knowledge (not nice), many many many articles on Wiktionary are not very good. There's no set standard for a Wiktionary article, so there's no consistent look to find a definition. Furthermore, doesn't the article under discussion provide nuances on the meanings of words? If you've looked in the OED, you'd notice some definitions akin to these. 132.205.15.43 00:04, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it /were/ a dictionary, there would be an article for each individual noun listed there. It isn't called "list of Japanese nouns", the list is merely a supplement to the article to illustrate the unique function of Japanese nouns which cannot be found in those of any other language - no other language's nouns sound quite as Japanese, and no language has all 1-to-1 correspondences with all of these unique function words. --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 05:23, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Should this page exist? Should we have Japanese nouns about and with a list of Japanese nouns, or Bengali counting words? There is nothing different between the function of modal particles in German and in other languages. A list of German modal particles definitely does not belong here, any more than does a list of Navajo noun classifiers.</dd>
<dd>And as noted above, a list does not belong here, even if this article does.</dd>
<dd>Also as was said before, duplication of information at other, more generalised articles is frowned upon.</dd>
<dd>And I will show you two policies, one that says Wikipedia is not a dictionary (that's what Wiktionary is for), and another that says we aren't trying to teach people slang or how to speak a foreign language, when combined they mean that a list in this article, at least at the length you have (two or three examples would be OK), belongs on Wiktionary or Wikibooks, and not on Wikipedia.</dd>

<li>But I didn't ask that - Physchim62 said "blatant nonsense", not "should not exist". I disagree with both, but the former argument is practical whereas the latter is more philosophical --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 01:29, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I agree with all of the above statements, which is why I would say "merge" to <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_grammar.html#Nouns_and_other_deictics" title="Japanese grammar">Japanese grammar#Nouns and other deictics</a> if there were anything useful in the first part of the article ("Japanese nouns sound more Japanese than English nouns" is hardly informative or useful) and "transwiki" the list to Wiktionary if the definitions on the list were useful (a definition for <i>naifu</i> that could also be used for the English words "saw" or "axe", which are not meant by <i>naifu</i>, is not useful). -- <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> 02:22, 16 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Clearly intended to be a parody. Or should I be more "accurate"? "Your collection of text which is supposed to be factual information appears to be instead a humorous reproduction of a previously developed collection of text and while it perhaps may be useful for you to attempt to make your argument from a previous page more clear it is not within the guidelines and other rules for this online encyclopedia project." --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 03:00, 16 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is indeed more accurate. "intended to be a parody" does not include the information: "which is supposed to be factual information appears to be instead" (parodies aren't nessecarily "supposed to be factual", although they can be), "humorous reproduction of a previously developed collection of text" (this indicates that it is a text-based parody, and that it uses layout and sentence structure from the original, rather than having all-new text), "and while it may be useful for you to attempt to make your argument from a previous page more clear" (these alleged circumstances are not conveyed by "parody"), and "not within the guidelines and other rules for this online encyclopedia project" ("parody" does not imply that the content is nessecarily against the rules). That gave me a good laugh - what was intended to be sarcastic actually went the opposite direction than intended. Anyhow. It was not intended as a parody. If it were, I would've pointed out explicitly on Talk:German modal particles that "To show you just how rediculous this is, I have created blah blah blah blah blah blah blah", which I most certainly didn't. I simply changed my opinion regarding articles on parts of speech by language, and decided that Japanese nouns, a nonexistant page, should really exist in the interest of completeness, and so populated it with content. After all, if there are so many Japanese nouns and they are used by the millions on an hourly basis, doesn't that make them notable?? --<a href="../../../n/o/d/User%7ENode_ue_1881.html" title="User:Node ue">Node</a> 01:29, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The page is a description of roles and connotations that many Japanese nouns carry, and is meant simply to illustrate that no word has a definite one-to-one correspondence with its English "counterpart" like so many people seem to take for granted.

<li><b>Delete</b> — mind you Japanese nouns <i>could</i> be a valuable article, but the way it is now, it is rubbish. Besides, it looks suspiciously like <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> to me. Apart from ridiculous sentences like "<i>Although English nouns include words which refer to a specific object, Japanese nouns sound more Japanese than do English nouns, at least most of the time</i>", and "<i>Japanese nouns need to be learned in daily usage as there is practically no literal translation for any of the nouns other than that they help form the phrase which on the whole conveys the way the speaker intends to sound</i>", it is written from a limited point of view, contains many pointless comparisons to the English language, and is generally unencyclopedic. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 07:26, 24 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
