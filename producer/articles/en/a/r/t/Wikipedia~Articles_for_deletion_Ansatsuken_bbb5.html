<p>Ansatsuken is simply a Japanese word for "Assassin Fist"; it is not a style. This whole article is based off someone's mistranslation.</p>
<p>Perhaps renaming this "Martial Arts of Street Fighter" or something could salvage this page. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan1975_6e49.html" title="User:Evan1975">Evan1975</a> 03:22, 7 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I apologize if responses like these are breaking the format, but I'd like to point out that Shotokan Karate is not Ryu/Ken's style. It's a mistranslation. - Nickoten
<ul>
<li>Actually, in SF1, they originally listed Ryu as practicing a real world martial art called "Kyokushinkai". It's a mix of Goju-Ryu, Shotokan, and Judo(History of Kyokushinkai in the uk). In SF2, they changed it to the generic Ansatsuken. (Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot Guide)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b>, Ryu and Ken practiced SHOTOKAN...</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> , but you'll probably want to cite the Secret Files, All About Capcom books, etc as sources. Since this is the name given to their style I think it's legitimate. If someone wants to start an article for what ansatsuken really is, there could be a disamiguation page with this one being referenced as a fictional form of martial arts from Street Fighter. As also stated in Tiamat's plot guide, Hadou, Tatsumaki, and Shoryu are the key elements of the style, which would suggest that it was meant to be an original style rather than a generic name for what the characters practice. Their in-game normal/command attacks seem to incorporate different styles, but the specials always bank around the same set of techniques. So yes, I feel it is unique enough to keep this name. Again, though, we need the books cited. Also, perhaps we could name the page "Street Fighter Ansatsuken"? Or even maybe "Ansatsuken (Street Fighter schools)"? It should still turn up easily in a search for "Ansatsuken," right? I don't know what we'd do about links from other articles though. EDIT: I looked at the page for <a href="../../../r/y/u/Ryu.html" title="Ryu">Ryu</a>, and I noticed that both the Street Fighter videogames and Tiamat's plot guide (As well as the books he cites, indirectly) are listed as sources. I can only assume the creator of this article may do the same.- Nickoten 15:51, 9 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I wrote the article. I am aware of the problem. The information comes strictly from Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot guide. However, very few Japanese fluent speakers bother to add information or verify. Unfortunately, I need a reference name for this martial art, which Capcom doesn't provide, so I just called it the generic "Ansatsuken". I know it is the equivalent of calling this "hand to hand combat" and saying it's a martial arts. The only option I had was Ansatsuken, which I admit wasn't a proper martial arts name, but I noted that at the beginning of the article. I did this mainly to archive the info from Tiamat's plot guide, which is the most info I've ever received about this game. -BB Mofo 10:16, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can rewrite with the sources if necessary. If it requires a merge, fine, but merge with what? Tiamat suggested Ryu, but there are several other martial artists who study from Goutetsu's school. And I tried that before with cites, and someone took it out without reason (hence this article being created). They did the same with my Goutetsu and Gouken articles. Perhaps put this information into Goutetsu's article? Maybe change the article name to "Hado No Chikara", since Goutetsu definitely invented, or atleast found that? Really, "Ansatsuken" is what Capcom Japan call it in the instruction manuals and on their website. For lack of a better name, since Capcom of Japan doesn't want to give it a name, it's the only one I can think of. Also, I agree on taking out the technique lists (except for the original 6 techniques, and 3 elements) -BB Mofo 16:12, 9 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have separate articles for Goutetsu and Gouken? We have a separate article for <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shun_Goku_Satsu_66e7.html" title="Shun Goku Satsu">Shun Goku Satsu</a>? Yikes.

<li><b>KEEP</b>—Ryu, Ken, and Akuma are all practitioners of this martial art, though Akuma practices a more forbidden variation of it. Ryu nor Ken practices Shotokan Karate. — <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">Dark Insanity</a> 03:20, 10 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is valid material. Ryu and Ken clearly praticed the style outlined in this article and the game's clearly support this. When I learned of the reasoning for the porposed deletion of this article, I was horrfied. An discussion on the talkpage should have been made proceeding this action, and the user in favor of deletion should have done his homework. This is not an canidate for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of this, the user is extremely new to the way Wikipedia works. looking at this edit count, he has only ammased 272 edits, of which an mere 9 have been directed at talk. User has also not demonstrated an knowledgeable background in the series or wikipedia policy, as he has not contributed to any character pages or any discussion pertaining to them. Poor reasoning for deletion does not dictate what gets kept and what gets deleted. Wikipedia does. To attempt to pass off this article as an threat to the encyclopedia is a travesty. As for sources, please read <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/game/583625.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/coinop/arcade/game/583625.html" rel="nofollow">Tiamat's Street Fighter Plot Guide</a> for information.</p>
<p>Additionally, I'm pleased to confirm that Evan is incorrect. Mistranslations absolutely does not determine what is kept and what is not kept on Wikipedia. It's merely an fictional fighting style created by an company for an video game. Where there is disagreement (and there is clearly disagreement here) then it isn't much of a guide. Which is why we need discussion on talkpages before making hasty actions usch as this. The article is valid, and does not meet the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:deletion policy</a>.

<li><b>MOVE</b> <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. The <i>first line</i> claims that "Ansatsuken" is a "fictional martial art... in the Street Fighter series". Which it isn't. Why don't I make an article that says "Boxing" is a fictional martial art practiced by Mike Bison, then? Furthermore, you have Gen listed in here when he practices a different style. (Two, actually.) Some fan on the net (Tiamat) is not a credible source. Please, show me where it says anything about "Ansatsuken" in the Japanese-language entry <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9A%86_%28%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9A%86_%28%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%29" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It doesn't. If mistranslations are OK, as you say, then the people claiming their style is <b>"Shotokan"</b> are more valid than Ansatsuken; "Shotokan" has been used in many more English publications. (Yes, it's wrong, too.) No, it is you who are incorrect, Megaman Zero. No specific style name has <i>ever</i> been given to Ryu, Ken, Gouki, etc. For the best <i>official</i> English-language source, try reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972503706/hokutorenkito-20" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0972503706/hokutorenkito-20" rel="nofollow">Street Fighter: Eternal Challenge</a>. Nope, no "Ansatsuken" there either. If you rename it to something like "Gōtetsu-Ryū Ansatsuken" and take out the stuff about Gen I'll heartily endorse it. <a href="../../../e/v/a/User%7EEvan1975_6e49.html" title="User:Evan1975">Evan1975</a> 20:14, 11 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
