You may want to read <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wikipedia%7EWelcome%2C_newcomers_06aa.html" title="Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers">Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers</a>. You can't expect someone to write all articles, so instead people can create links for stuff they think should be created in order to promote the creation of an article. You can easily see if a link exists by checking its color, red links don't exist yet. Wikipedia is a work in progress. Making the links before writing the articles ensures articles are carefully interlinked and that if someone writes an article they don't have to spend ages putting links to it on other pages. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)&lt;/su&gt;</sup></a> 10:37, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

A Minyan Shivyoni Hilchati (shivyoni means 'equitable' and hilchati means "in accordance with Jewish law") is a Jewish prayer service in which women have a significantly expanded liturgical opportunities within the context of Orthodox practice, including a separation between men and women during prayer. Such a service represents an attempt to readdress the role of women within the framework of Orthodox halakhah, Jewish law as represented by traditional Jewish sources including the Talmud, the Shulhan Arukh, and responsa of Orthodox rabbis.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-13_8778.html" title="Edit section: Theoretical Grounding">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Theoretical Grounding</span></h3>
<p>The theoretical underpinning of such a service is a series of articles in the journal of EDAH, a Modern Orthodox organization, beginning in 2001. These articles argued that under certain conditions it is acceptable under Orthodox jewish law for women to read from the Torah, one of the most central acts of traditional Jewish public prayer, during Shabbat (sabbath) prayer services. The seminal articles were Rabbi Mendel Shapiro’s article “Qeri’at ha-Torah by Women: A Halakhic Analysis” (EDAH Journal 1:2 2001.) and Rabbi Daniel Sperber’s article, “Congregational Dignity and Human Dignity: Women and Public Torah Reading.” (EDAH Journal 3:2, 2002)</p>

<p>The articles permitting these practices were by Orthodox rabbis, and the journal they appeared in, EDAH Journal, is the journal of an established Modern Orthodox organization. The leadership of minyanim shivyoni hilchati take great care to keep within the boundaries of Orthodox Jewish law so interpreted. Nonetheless, the interpretation was and is a controversial one. EDAH Journal published the Shapiro article only for discussion purposes, and published it along with a counterargument by Rabbi Yehudah Henkin, " Qeri'at Ha-Torah by Women: Where We Stand Today" (EDAH Journal 1:2 2001) summarizing the arguments against such an interpretation. A minyan shivyoni hilchati currently represents an experimental innovation in Orthodoxy that has not gained the offical approval of any major Orthodox organization or rabbinical association, and hence cannot be said to have full general acceptance within mainstream Orthodox practice.</p>
<a name="Innovations" id="Innovations"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-13_8778.html" title="Edit section: Innovations">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Innovations</span></h3>
<p>Key innovations of a minyan shivyoni hilchati include:</p>
<p>1. While retaining the Orthodox requirement that public parts of the service can be conducted only with ten men present, a minyan shivyoni hilchati voluntarily undertakes not to conduct public prayer unless ten women are also present, thus creating a de facto egalitarianism.</p>
<p>2. While retaining the Orthodox requirement of separate seating for men and women and a mechitza (partition) between the men's and women's sections, in a minyan shivyoni hilchati the mechitzah runs down the middle of the room, so that the men’s and women’s sections are side by side. The bimah (dias) is located in the center between the men’s and women’s sections and a shtender (reader's lectern) is located on each side. When the Torah is led in procession around the congregation, it passes through both the men's and women's sections. It is carried through the women's section by a woman, passed over the mechitza, and carried through the men's section by a man.</p>
<p>3. Women can lead certain parts of the prayer service: kabbalat Shabbat, Pesukei de-Zimra, and the removal and replacing of the Torah in the Ark. Certain parts (Maariv, Shacharit and Mussaf) remain reserved for men. The result is that women and men each alternate leading parts of the service, each leading approximately a half, creating a service with an egalitarian feel.</p>
<p>4. Women are called to and read from the Torah.</p>
<p>5. Women can give D'Vrei Torah (sermons or lessons), a practice that is also accepted in a larger range of Orthodox congregations.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-13_8778.html" title="Edit section: Continuity With Halacha">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Continuity With Halacha</span></h3>
<p>The services nonetheless have, and take great care to retain, a distinctly Orthodox flavor which is different in character from Conservative, Reconstructionist, and Reform services, which have been egalitarian for decades. Key differences between a minyan shivyoni hilchati and a Conservative service include:</p>
<p>1. The service is not fully egalitarian. While it creates an atmosphere of men and women alternating leadership roles in a more-or-less even fashion, there are some parts of the service only men can do even within the liberal interpretation of Orthodoxy a minyan shivyoni hilchati follows. These parts (e.g. Shacharit and Mussaf) are always done by men. The Orthodox idea that men and women have roles which are complementary, not interchangable, is retained.</p>
<p>2. The Orthodox requirement of separation between men and women during prayer is fully and carefully retained. In addition to the mechitzah separating the men's and women's sections, men and women are never present on the bima at the same time during prayer. Men lead from the shtender on the men's side and women from the schtender on the women's side. The Torah procession is carefully orchestrated so that men and women stay in their respective sections.</p>
<p>3. The complete Orthodox prayer service is done, including parts eliminated by the Conservative movement, such as prayers recalling temple sacrifices and petitioning for their resumption.</p>
<p>4. The permission for women to read from the Torah is based on a passage in the Talmud that concerns Shabbat (the Jewish sabbath). Accordingly, these special services are often conducted only on Shabbat, and services with women reading from the Torah are not available on weekdays.</p>
<p>5. Because the original Shapiro article suggested that there may be greater halachic support for women reading from the Torah in a minyan in a private home rather than a synagogue, some organizations conducting such services take care to call themselves a "minyan" or "kehilla" rather than a "synagogue," to meet in settings, such as private homes or rented halls, which are not reserved full-time for prayer, and to remain informal rather than formally incorporated organizations.</p>

In Social Work practice and psychotherapy, universalization is a supportive intervention utilized by the therapist to reassure and encourage his/her client. Universalization places the client’s experience in the context of other individuals who are experiencing the same, or similar challenges, and seeks to help the client grasp that his/her feelings and experiences are not uncommon given the circumstances. The therapist or social worker utilizing this supportive intervention intends to “normalize” the client’s experience of his/her emotions and reactions to the presenting challenge. By normalizing the client’s experience the therapist is attempting to help avert the client’s natural feelings of “being alone”, or that “no one understands me”.</p>
<p>For example, a therapist working with a 21 year old client who is experiencing rejection from her family and friends after admitting that she is a lesbian will use universalization. The therapist will explain that many other young adults who have revealed their sexual orientation undergo the same rejection and scrutiny from peers and parents. The therapist will follow this up by telling her that her emotional response to the rejection is likewise normal and not at all uncommon given the circumstances.</p>

GDJ is a popular saying abbreviating "God dammit Jaymie". It does not matter if you make "Goddammit" one word or two, for it will still have the same effect. It is mostly uttered as one gains frustration doing any type of activity, and means to blame Jaymie for everything.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>ex: <i>Jim, a wonderful golf player, hits his ball onto the Fairway instead of the intended Green. Jim mutters angrily under his breath, "Goddammit Jaymie."</i></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It was first started in Mililani Hawaii by NicX, known on the Aaron in Japan forums. These forums are dedicated to the game of DDR and the also affiliated Stepmania. Soon, it was spread to the AIJ forums, and now many people who do not even know Jaymie personally still use the famous quote.</p>
<p><br />
Jaymie is mostly known for his retardedness, and how he attempts to be funny but fails terribly. Some people would dismiss him as an average idiot, but those at the AIJ forums enjoy ridiculing him beyond belief. Some people are also irritated by his ego, even though it amounts to nothing, seeing as he is not accepted anywhere he goes. For example, he feels he's respected in AIJ, but that has been proven not to be true, by the thread "GDJ" in the Anything Else board on the forums. It soon turned into a quarrel about hot swedish chicks wearing edible panties, but the Moderaters did nothing to stop the people, seeing as the topic wasn't going anywhere to begin with.</p>

Mystery Method is a methodology to teach seduction to males. It was created by Erik von Markovik, more often known as "Mystery," a pseudonym he adopted on online forums, most notably on the website alt.seduction.fast. The Mystery Method was developed through a series of posts on alt.seduction.fast, and by now is developed enough to be organized and marketed effectively, independently of alt.seduction.fast. Mystery himself is considered "the World's Greatest Pickup Artist," and has single-handedly created many terms now used in the world of seduction, such as AFC (average frustrated chump), HB (hot babe), neg hits, etc. Mystery Method is now marketed through Markovik's website, www.mystery-method.com, via books, DVD sets, and most notably, live seminars and teaching with various instructors, including Markovik himself. He is one of the newer entrants into the world of online seduction teachings, established beforehand by Ross Jeffries, and including teachers such as David DeAngelo. Though not clearly founded, rumors hint that Markovik was the basis for the title character from the movie "Hitch," about a highly effective "date doctor." Mystery Method itself revolves around the central principle of distinguishing oneself from the crowd. Though Mystery Method is a unique style among "picking up" women, many practiced seducers agree that at a certain level, such distinctions between styles of online seduction indicates immaturity.</p>

The FrickCam, or Frick Cam, was one of the first web cams. Launched in 1997, it was the product of many long work days for one Jennifer Frickell. She would post several photos a month, usually of herself, with an often hilarious caption about the day so far. In short time, she became well-known on the internet and even appeared on Internet Tonight in 1999.</p>
<p>The Frick Cam - "old" and "new" versions - is still available at frickell.com but is updated very rarely, with only four postings in 2005.</p>

<p>Born Lancashire, England, 1592, Died Tyburn (London) 1654. John Southworth studied at the English College in Douai, north France, and was ordained priest before he returned to England. Imprisoned and sentenced to death for professing the Catholic faith, he was later deported to France. Once more he returned to England and lived in Clerkenwell, north London, during a plague epidemic. He assisted and converted the sick in Westminster and was arrested again. Finally arrested and brought to the Old Bailey, he was condemned for exercising the priesthood and executed at Tyburn Gallows (hung, drawn and quartered). His remains are now kept at Westminster Cathedral in London.</p>

<p>Habanos S.A is the state tobacco company of Cuba. Habanos owns most of the world's most revered premium cigar brands as well as the factories in Cuba where they are produced. Habanos also exercises considerable control over the cultivation and curing of tobacco in supplier farms accross Cuba. Habanos is a joint venture between the government of the Republic of Cuba anCd a private Spanish company, Altadis SA. Several Altadis subsidiaries are responsible for distribution of Habanos products in certain markets in Europe and the Caribbean. Habanos was formed to provide a more effective means of marketing and distributing Cuban cigars in major world markets, and is one of Cuba's most successful joint ventures with foreign corporations. Habanos produces 32 brands of cigars and other tobacco products. Most were established prior to the Communist revolution of 1959 and siezed by the state in the early 1960's, while a few, most notably Cohiba, were created after nationalization. Many of Habanos' brands are produced overseas, especially in the Dominican Republic, by competing companies who use Habanos' trademarks without permission in order to tap into the US market; where Cuban cigars are illegal. Habanos' most popular brand is Montecristo, which accounts for a large percentage of sales.</p>
<p>The brands of Habanos are: H. Upmann Montecristo Hoyo de Monterrey Cohiba Partagas Romeo y Julieta Jose L. Piedra Vegas Robaina Bolivar Punch Quintero Fonseca Cuaba San Cristobal de la Habana Trinidad Quay D'Orsay Rafael Gonzalez Gispert Los Statos de Luxe Saint Luis Rey Diplomaticos La Gloria Cubana Vegueros Rey del Mundo Troya Juan Lopez Ramon Allones Cabanas Belinda Por Larranaga La Flor de Cano Sancho Panza</p>

<p>When talking of "Little Baby', most people will think of infants or new born babies. However, in Hong Kong, "Little Baby" can refer to a toy manufactured in around 1990 (exact date of manufactur is unknown). Little Baby is a toy, or doll, made with a cloth with cotton inside. It is yellow in colour, with two fingers on each side and two eyes, and has a brown cap with a special small "ball" at its front. It was quite popular but virtually none can be found in Hong Kong now. Little Baby has a brother called Fat Baby, which is very similar to Little Baby except being a bit bigger and having an eye only (rumours are that Fat Baby lost an eye during design and was adopted as being an one-eye Baby only).</p>

<p><br />
The Quebec Gatineau Railway (QGRY) came to existence when Canadian Pacific Railway got rid of most of its eastern Canada operations in the early nineties. QGRY consists of that portion of former CP trackage included between Hull and Montreal, QC on the north shore of the Ottawa River, and between Laval and Quebec City on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River.</p>
<p>Although originally built to the highest exploitation standards in the early 20th century by CP, most actual QGRY trackage nowadays stands as a good example of Class B railroading. Average freight speed on the QGRY network dropped from 43 miles per hour in 1959 to a meager 25 mph in 2004. In the face of rising competition from trucking in the 1960s and 1970s, CP Rail was content with letting its eastern Canada network fall to pieces and simply gave up on competitioning against road transport. Today, QGRY is trying to pick up on its predecessor by focusing on efficient operation and low freight tarrifs, while at the same time maintaining its infra- and superstructures in minimally good condition.</p>
<p>QGRY has a valuable, decisive structural advantage over its south-shore CN competitor for the future of railroading between Montreal and Quebec City. The QGRY right of way is straighter than CN's Saint-Hyacinthe and Drummondville subdivisions; it features far less curves. Building a Montreal-to-Quebec High Speed Train over the QGRY would involve less curve-redesigning than with the CN line on the St. Lawrence South shore. However, QGRY is handicapped on only one aspect: right of way gradients between Three Rivers and Quebec City are substantially steeper than any portion of CN's Montreal-to-Quebec line.</p>
<p>As for the Hull to Montreal QGRY line, although it is mounted on modern 120-lbs-per-yard rail, it is of little interest in regard of modern railroading, as curves and gradients are frequently prohibitive, especially on the portion between Gatineau and Grenville, QC. This part of QGRY operations bears very little promise for the future, as it relies mostly on forest and paper products as its chief transportation staple. In Quebec, this sector of industrial activity has revealed patently unstable in the last few years. Increasing pressure from ecology pressure groups and an equally increasing approbative greater public's reaction to these pressures don't help either.</p>
<p>Lately, QGRY was able to capitalize on the renaissance of commuter train traffic in the Greater Montreal area. QGRY is successfully exploiting a commuter train line between Montreal and St. Therese, a third crown suburban area. Other similar projects currently involve QGRY trackage: extending the St. Therese service over to St. Jerome, and establishing a new line from Montreal to Mascouche, also in Montreal's third crown suburban area.</p>

<p>SRA - the only nice terrorist group in the world!</p>
<p>The SRA (short for Småländska Republikanska Armén = The Republican Army of the Small Lands) is a small but steadily growing terrorist group (at present there are roughly 50 members), which aims to liberate the Swedish province of Småland (=the Small Lands) from Swedish rule.</p>
<p>History: In the middle ages, Småland consisted of roughly 30 autonomous nations on the border between Sweden and Denmark. Gradually, these came under the influence of Sweden, but it was not until the 15th century that the 30 lands were more or less united under the King of Sweden. The last rising was that of Nils Dacke, the great rebel leader and defendant of the True Catholic Faith. The rising was very successful, culminating at what has become known as the Battle of Växsjö in 1542. The King of Sweden, Gustav I, was ready to surrender his throne, but he managed to trick Dacke into accepting a truce, which gave the king the opportunity to hire more troops and defeat Dacke at Målilla in 1543. Dacke was eventually executed. Since then, Småland has been occupied by Sweden. However, in 2002, an underground movement called the SRA started to develop in the city of Tranås in the north part of the province. In March, 2005 the SRA declared its determination to free Småland once and for all, and at the same time clearified its status as a democratic organization. Subcommander Lowe Aspviken was elected the organizations’ first Chief of Staff. As early as in 2002, the SRA threatened to declare war against the USA, thereby hoping to stop the planned attack against Iraq. The US invaded Iraq anyway, but so far the SRA are not planning any attacks on the US, according to sources within the organization. Since no peace treaty was signed after the rising in 1543, the SRA considers itself at war with the Swedish crown, a war which can only end with the complete liberation of Småland.</p>
<p>Methods and Plans: The SRA is not an armed terrorist group. Instead, it uses humour to reach its goals, and it aims to commit silly terrorist deeds such as hijacking elevators and hoisting the green-white-red cross flag of Småland at improper times and places.</p>
<p>Organization: The SRA is a democratic organization, which holds a General Congress each year, on which occasion it elects its Chief of Staff and makes (un-)important decisions. All members have a military rank, but these do not matter. All members have one vote each in the General Congress. The SRA is divided into four parts: the Army, the Navy, the Cavalry and the Others. The Army is the largest of these parts, but the Navy is steadily growing. The pedal boat Sm/s Smålandia (commanding officer captain Fuji Hoffmann), which sometimes traffics lake Sommen, is presently the only craft belonging to the organization.</p>

<p>The United States Corps Of Chaplains is a non-denominational Christian organization ministering to all with special emphasis on aid to active duty military members, veterans, and their family members. The USCOC is also active in disaster response activities, providing a needed ministerial presence for victims and responders.

ACF2 operates on mainframes under the MVS operating system. It provides the functionality for access control to computer systems and data residing on disks and tapes in this environment. Organisations use ACF2 to control access to its IBM mainframe systems and business applications, often in conjunction with other software products, such as ESP, and internal application controls.</p>
<p>ACF2 is set up in such a way that all data is protected by default. Access to data is controlled according to ownership and rules. By default each user has access to their ‘home’ area. This is defined in the prefix field of his logon ID information. Users get access to other data only if there is a rule that allows it. ACF2 distinguishes four types of access to data, namely, READ, EXECUTE, WRITE and ALLOCATE. Through rules a user may be allowed none, all, or any combination of these types of access.</p>

<p>During the 2004 United States Presidential campaign pundits started talking about the "Security Mom", a successor to 2000's "Soccer Mom" and in theory a powerful voting bloc. Security moms were supposed to be concerned primarily with issues such as the war in Iraq, domestic terrorism and the security of their children.</p>
<p>As with all media constructs there is some question whether there ever was such a group, self- or externally-identified, and whether they were influenced by the messages directed at them. But it can't be denied that both major parties did try to curry favor with the group and this influenced the direction the campaigns took.</p>

<p>In 2003 sharkbaitsurfwax inc was formed with the seemingly crazy mission of marketing a surfboard wax called sharkbait. The bar of wax had a unique shape and on the label was an eye- catching logo.</p>
<p>Sharkbaitsurfwax is the brainchild of a couple of friends from Southern California; Bruce Condon from Culver City, and Dan Argabright of San Clemente. The idea for Sharkbaitsurfwax got is start when Dan, while out surfing would imagine giant sharks swimming beneath him. It dawned on him that when you paddle out to go surfing, whether you liked it or not, you were sharkbait</p>
<p>The notion of sharkbait and surfing stayed in the back of Dan’s mind. He wondered how could he connect the two in a way that symbolized the courage of the average surfer who say’s “Yeah, I know there’re sharks out there, I’m going out anyway.” Then one day, Bruce said “How about sharkbait surf wax”. Only later did they realize the perfection of the concept. It didn’t take long to visualize the perfect logo for sharkbaitsurfwax; the trademark silhouette of a surfer holding his board, out of which is a huge shark-bite, A surfer whose body language says “ Get me another board, I’m going back out!”</p>
<p>With the help of their surfer friends Bruce and Dan have developed a hi-quality surfboard wax, one that lives up to the name; sharkbaitsurfwax.</p>

CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC NATIONAL CHURCH in The United Kingdom has been since 1993, it is headed by the appointed Primate of the United Kingdom, Cardinal James Atkinson-Wake and Archbishop de Ruijter Metropolitan, It is Joined and in Communion with the brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church and commanded by His Beatitude, Patriarch Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez. patriarch of Brazil and all Catholic Apostolic National Churches within 17 Countries with members of some 16 Million. Bishop Carlos Duarte-Costa was ordained a Roman Catholic Priest on April 1, 1911. <i>He was consecrated to be the Roman Catholic Diocesan Bishop of Botucatu, Brazil, on December 8, 1924,</i> and served in that office until certain views he expressed about treatment of Brazil’s poor, by both the civil government and the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil, caused his removal from the Diocese of Botucatu. Bishop Duarte-Costa was subsequently named Titular Bishop of Maura by the late Bishop of Rome, Pius PP XII.</p>
<p>Bishop Duarte-Costa’s criticisms of the fascist regime and oligarchy of Brazil in the 1930’s and 40’s earned him repeated troubles and prison. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the dictator and remained there until pressure from President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill and others caused his release. Of interest is the apparent lack of active protest against this unjust imprisonment by either the Vatican or the other bishops of Brazil.</p>
<p>Bishop Duarte-Costa’s criticisms of the Vatican, particularly about Vatican foreign policy during and following World War II toward Nazi Germany, were not well received at the Vatican, and he was eventually separated from the Roman Church by Pius PP XII. This action was taken only after his public denunciations that the Vatican Secretariat of State was issuing Vatican Passports to some high ranking former Nazi officials, who were then fleeing to South America, from the Allies.</p>
<p>Bishop Duarte-Costa was a strong advocate in the 1930’s for reform of the Roman Church; espousing many of the key positions that the Second Vatican Council would, thirty-five years later, enact. His positions included a more pastoral approach to divorce, challenged mandatory celibacy for the clergy, and rejected abuses of papal power, including the concept of Papal Infallibility, which the Bishop considered a misguided and false dogma.</p>
<p>Bishop Duarte-Costa was involuntarily separated from the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church on July 6, 1945. This schism was, it should be noted, an act by the Roman Pontiff and was not initiated by Bishop Duarte-Costa. It is an example of yet another in a historically long series of such schisms initiated by the Roman See to silence critics rather than act on what have frequently been shown over the years to have been valid objections to Roman policies.</p>
<p>Duarte-Costa immediately established the independent Igreja Catolica Apostolica Brasileira (ICAB) on that same date which he led until his death in 1961.he was succeeded by Dom Luis Fernando Castillo Mendez who was consecrated to succeed him, since then the church has grown. The Patriarch of Brazil, Patriarch Luis Fernando Castilo Mendez is also the Patriarch of the Catholic Apostolic Natuional Church in Great Britain, Ireland and Scotland.website address www.church4us.co.uk,www.doctrineandfaith.com or www.Cacigbi.org or even www.Cacigbi-Sisters.com &lt;--Make sure you capitalize everything appropriately and use correct spelling, grammar, etc. --&gt;</p>

I would like to see an article on Microsoft Evangelists. I have heard about the term recently, and I would like to be able to find an information on this on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I don't have any specific resources, but searct on Google gives about 290.000 hits. So it's a start I guess. I hope that someone working at Microsoft can write an article.</p>

The Fedoras are a small underground psychadelic garage rock band with an ever growing cult following. It has been stated by some that "they have revived pure rock and roll", this may be a quick summary of the band for those un-aware of their music. The once thought lost days of garage rock when any band could record has been revived in the minds of these four young men. the band includes Matt Stackhouse: lead guitar, Andrew Mazerolle: vocals, rhythm guitar, Trevor Livingston: drums/percussion and Christian Bonnevie: bass guitar and pan flute.</p>

<p>Sazemane Mojahedine Khalghe Iran or MKO organisation was basically founded as an armed resistant group with a mixed Marxist-Islamist ideology, to overthrow Iran's Shah monarchy. The group suffered many casualties and its members imprisoned or executed before the 1979 revolution of Iran and they became a popular party after the revolution. As the Iran-Iraq war started and differences of the revolutionary leaders and groups seeking power turned into the struggles and skirmishes, the MKO armed again and resisted against the cleric's manner to rule the country. This, in turn resulted into jail, exile and execution of the group leaders and many of its fans. After being named as a terrorist group by the US and some eouropean governments, the group's activities has been more limited and critisised by many international organisations.</p>

<p>"Stand up, clap your hands and stamp your feet!"</p>
<p>What would you get if you crossed influences like The Beatles, The Stone Roses and Paul Weller with a little solo twist? The answer comrades, is 23 year old Rob Smith.</p>
<p>Rob Smith who was born in the heart of Dublin City, Ireland in 1982 grew up with one thing in mind. He wanted to be a rock 'n' roll musician. Totally mesmerised by the likes of John Lennon and co. he knew his first love in life was always going to be music.</p>
<p>Rob was once a drummer in mid-nineties Beatles influenced quintet The Gears but after the band called it a day in 2000, Rob decided it was the right time to go it alone and do it himself for himself. After spending time travelling and writing the songs over the next two years that would become the songs on his demo "The Soul Shaker L.P.", Rob hit the gigging circuit in Dublin. He also appeared as a guest to his Scottish comrades The Stone Roses Experience in places such as Olympia Theatre, Witnness Festival, Glasgow Garage etc. playing onstage with the lads for a song or two. He also appeared as support for the band many times blowing the audience away with his Roses influced guitar based pop.</p>
<p>Rob's CD also attracted the attention of the likes of Aidan Lonergan (The Soup on DCAL FM), Brendan Hickey (On The Verge.ie), Mark Coyle (producer of Oasis), Peter Lacey (Liquid Sunshine), Peter "Digsy" Deary (from Liverpool band Smaller and he of Oasis "Digsy's Dinner" fame) and Aslan. Aslan of course gave Rob support slots all over Ireland and have being doing so for well over a year. From small clubs to prestigious venues such as Vicar Street. Rob is a regular and a favourite with the Aslan crowds.</p>
<p><br />
His music stands out. You either like it or you don't. Rob does it for himself. If you like guitar based music with catchy melodies, check out Rob Smith sometime. He'd like it if you did.&#160;;)</p>
<p>In June 2006, Rob will play his first UK solo gig at Liverpool's prestigious Cavern Club.</p>

<p>Basicly, I want to create a Diablo II guide, the current one isn't as informative to newer players, simply supplying them with the basics and letting them run loose isn't the best method. They don't know the games "lingo". I would like to create a guide that feeds them more infortmation on the classic, non-expansion side of the game, items, builds, "lingo", characters, stratagys and the like.</p>

<p>'Prision Sex' is a track featured on the album Undertow, by American hard-rock band, Tool. Alongside the albums most popular track, Sober, Prision Sex has been reffered to as 'Sobers little brother', in that it it soon became a fan favourite of the groups, and is regarded as a 'staple' Tool song.</p>
<p>The song deals with issue of child abuse and molestation, and has been the focal point of controversy upon the albums release. The vocals of the album seem to come from the 'abused childs' perspective, with Maynards vocals detailing the victimisation of the child, 'my lamp and matyr/this will be over soon'. The most telling and disturbing vocal point of the song, is in the closing of the song, in Maynard's vocals, 'I have found some kind of temporary solace/in this blood, shit and cum on my hands'.</p>
<p>The song was released along with a music video, making use of the stop motion effects which categorizes most of Tools music-videos. The footage in the video favours symbolism and metaphorical imagery rather than portraying events told in the song literally.</p>

<p>A <b>letterform</b>, <b>letter-form</b> or <b>letter form</b>, is a term used especially in typography, paleography, calligraphy and epigraphy to mean a letter's shape.</p>
<p>In one sense letterform applies strictly to the design of individual letters. In typography, "letterforms" is often used to describe the study and design <i>of</i> indiviudual letters while typography applies to the design and use <i>with</i> letterforms. As such, "letterform" applies not only to letters but to any graphic elements of a script, typeface or font (including numbers, symbols and punctuation).</p>
<p>In another sense letterform applies to the individual shapes of letters that gives a text an aesthetic. In this way, medieval scholars, for instance, may discuss the particular features of a script that give it distinction and definition among other scripts. <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/medievalbook/letterforms.htm|" class="external autonumber" title="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/medievalbook/letterforms.htm|" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>Depending on context, similar terms are sometimes used interchangeably - especially character but also <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sign.html" title="Sign">sign</a>, <a href="../../../g/l/y/Glyph.html" title="Glyph">glyph</a> and <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grapheme.html" title="Grapheme">grapheme</a>.</p>
<p>The history of letterforms is discussed in fields of study relating to materials used in writing. <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epigraphy.html" title="Epigraphy">Epigraphy</a> includes the study of letterforms carved in stone or other permanent materials. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleography.html" title="Paleography">Paleography</a> is the study of writing in ancient and medieval manuscripts. <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calligraphy.html" title="Calligraphy">Calligraphy</a> treats the letterforms of decorative writing, usually in ink. <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typography.html" title="Typography">Typography</a> includes the arrangement of letterforms designed for metal print or computer. More broadly letterforms may be discussed wherever letters appear stylistically - in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Graffiti.html" title="Graffiti">graffiti</a> for example.</p>

Blue Murder is a British folk 'supergroup', formed in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a> for a local school's charity concert. It originally comprised <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Carthy_2a08.html" title="Martin Carthy">Martin Carthy</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/Norma_Waterson_dbe2.html" title="Norma Waterson">Norma Waterson</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/l/Lal_Waterson_2e57.html" title="Lal Waterson">Lal Waterson</a>, Rachel Waterson, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Waterson_8ac8.html" title="Mike Waterson">Mike Waterson</a>, Heather Brady, Dave Brady and Jim Boyes (or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Watersons_b964.html" title="The Watersons">The Watersons</a> and Swan Arcade). They made a number of concert appearances over the next year and a half, but never recorded in a studio. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>, the group were asked to record a track for a <a href="../../../h/o/k/Hokey_Pokey_7718.html" title="Hokey Pokey">Hokey Pokey</a> album, and by this time Barry Coope and Lester Simpson of Coope Boyes &amp; Simpson replaced the two Swans and changes in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Watersons_b964.html" title="The Watersons">The Watersons</a> saw <a href="../../../e/l/i/Eliza_Carthy_945d.html" title="Eliza Carthy">Eliza Carthy</a> taking over from Rachel Waterson. No other performances were planned, but a request for a performance in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> saw the band back together again, and a performance at the world-famous Sidmouth festival followed in <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, and later a studio album.</p>
