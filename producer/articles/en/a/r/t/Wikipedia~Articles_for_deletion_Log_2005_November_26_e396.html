<p><b>Keep</b>: Fellow wikipedians, to delete an entry that explains what has been currently making headline in SW Ontario on the basis that it's a "tempest in a teapot" simply shows your dismissal of things of interest to Ontarians as trivial. Michael Chessman is definitely NOT a fictitious individual. Being one of East Indian heritage growing up in several British Commonwealth countries, his identifying with Anglo-centric racial and cultural prejudice could be a reaction to, or internalization/reproduction of the discrimination he has received. This coalition could also well be Chessman's ingenious parody of the all too common conservative cultural norm of SW Ontario. However, the Coalition is officially included within a list of several minor federal political parties. For no reason is it justified to delete a Wikipedia entry on even a minor mock Canadian political party like the <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhinoceros_Party_3c2f.html" title="Rhinoceros Party">Rhinoceros Party</a>, likewise this one. Those who vote to delete this article are simply too Americanocentric to care about Canada, or are too patriotically Canadian to admit to anything that contradicts the official image of Canada as cosmopolitan, multicultural, liberal and progressive. First of all, lose your biases, and then judge your fellow wikipedians. Again, wikipedia is no place for people who destroy articles without well informed deliberation. <a href="../../../b/e/s/User%7EBestlyriccollection_3f86.html" title="User:Bestlyriccollection">Bestlyriccollection</a></p>

<p>The result of the debate was Merge. I am so not into Pokémon I'm having a hard time understanding all of this, but it seems clear that the consensus is to merge all of the glitch articles ('M, Missingno. and 3trainerpoké, plus any others that I may not be aware of) into a single new article called something like Glitch Pokémon. All the individual article names should remain as redirects to that new article. I'll leave it to <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">User:A Man In Black</a> to do the actual merging, and just monitor the situation to make sure it happens, since I don't understand the subject well enough to perform the merge myself. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 01:24, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>It is highly unencyclopedic to have an article solely devoted to a single specific bug in a videogame. It screams of gamecruft. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmxbass_704d.html" title="User:Mmxbass">||bass</a> 03:33, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>
<ol>
<li>If this "mere glitch" doesn't warrant its own article, then how come <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missingno..html" title="Missingno.">Missingno.</a> and <a href="../../../3/t/r/3trainerpok%C3%A9.html" title="3trainerpoké">3trainerpoké</a> aren't nominated for deletion?</li>

<ul>
<li>A good question indeed. Consider them nominated for merger as well. Giving a distinct article to a single glitch in a single game is gamecruft at its worst. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmxbass_704d.html" title="User:Mmxbass">||bass</a> 05:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: A small press publication and local readings are all I see. The fact that she writes about gamez seems to be why she's getting an article. There are hundreds of poets who have no article on Wikipedia, and I don't see her as being among the ranks of notable poets yet. (I.e. a person can't just be a member of a class, but must be outstanding among that class, so the average professor is not notable, and the average poet isn't notable, and the average nuclear engineer isn't notable, etc.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:24, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Weak <b>keep</b>. It's not true that "a person can't just be a member of a class, but must be outstanding among that class"; many classes of people admit all their members into Wikipedia. Presidents, for example. While published poets is not a class where all members of are automatically eligible, it's much more common than, say, the category of bums. "Published authors, editors, and photographers who have written books with an audience of 5,000 or more or in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more" is the standard at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and I think she's probably passed that line.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 09:17, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Users should be aware that the phrase "Wikipedia is not a crystal ball" is misleading.

<ul>
<li>Quite correct. It's acceptable to have articles about future events when there's a good amount of verifiable information available. For example, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Bowl_XL_0ec6.html" title="Super Bowl XL">Super Bowl XL</a> or <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_World_Cup_2006_3000.html" title="Football World Cup 2006">Football World Cup 2006</a>. However, when there's very little <i>verifiable</i> information available, it's often better to hold off on writing an article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonite_19ae.html" title="User:Carbonite">Carbonite</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarbonite_fc0a.html" title="User talk:Carbonite">Talk</a> 10:32, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Also, remember that some of us take a <i>harder line</i> than the "Crystal ball" statement. All that is verifiable about World Cup 2006 is that there are plans, and the plans are present tense. The future is unwritten, and articles about the future should be the same. An article about List of expected games in 2007 might have this title or another, but that article would be about the present, about the expectations now present, and not about anything in 2007. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 14:28, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). As vote count goes, we have something like 34 delete/23 keep. The argument has been over two different terms used in the title, "modern" and "dictator". Now, if "modern" is a concern, the page can be easily given an objective standard (dictators who ruled after 1900 for example). So it is the use of the term "dictator" that has caused trouble.</p>
<p>The argument for deletion here is that the title is inherently POV. Unlike <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_dictators_dbfa.html" title="List of Roman dictators">list of Roman dictators</a>, where "dictator" was a real official office, the term "modern day dictator" is not. It is a subjective term, and some people have called people such as <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> and <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Putin_50b8.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a> dictators. Some have said that <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was not a dictator because he was reelected in referendums where he got 90-100% of the vote. Who goes into such a list, who does not? Presidents like <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mugabe_10bb.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> (elected and reelected in disputed elections) are certainly controversial.</p>
<p>The argument for "keep" is that the term is well defined. There is some merit to this, the term dictator certainly has a definition in all dictionaries. (Then again one might argue that "evil" has a clear definition, and that list of evil people will be difficult to work.) Things are not quite as severe with the term dictator since there are some standards which can be applied. Was the president elected in an election? Is there a peaceful mechanism for removing the president? Is there an opposition to the president which can operate without fear of persecution?</p>
<p>Personally, I am more convinced by the concerns of the "delete" voters here, but the "keep" side has enough merit to their arguments to not ignore the usual guideline of a two-thirds majority requirement for deletion. On this AFD discussion there is no consensus and, consequently, the article will not be deleted.</p>
<p>The article is in need of major work however, some of the presidents linked up on this page are not described as "dictators" in their articles, most likely because of POV concerns. Most importantly, some sort of definition for what will make a president a dictator which should be added to this list is needed.

<dd>VfD threads do not <i>have</i> to be closed on a rigid deadline. Many stay up for much longer. I don't see why we can wait more time to allow a clearer consensus to be established, so that we don't have to deal with the prospect of a minority of users getting away with voting NPOV and other concepts away based on a technicality. As of now the deletes are at 60% instead of the needed 67% percent at the end of five days-- an arbitary little difference that does not offer much of a compelling reason to keep the article. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 14:03, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not ready to declare a consensus yet, but I did go through and attempt to weed out people's stated opinions from all the yelling and screaming. Basicly, I ignored everything except for things that looked like variations on <b>Keep</b> and <b>Delete</b>, and teased them out into a list. Everything was put into one of those two bins (i.e. if you added <b>Weak</b> or <b>Strong</b> or anything like that, it got lost to make it easier to process). I ended up with the list below (sorted in alphabetical order). If you expressed an opinion, please double-check the list below to make sure I haven't lost anybody, or accidentally counted somebody in the wrong group. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 03:48, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

A while ago, when he used to be an administrator, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Silverback/Evidence#172.27s_lack_of_qualms_about_committing_abuses_is_analogous_to_his_apologia_for_abusers_.28dictators_and_other_authoritarian_regimes.29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Silverback/Evidence#172.27s_lack_of_qualms_about_committing_abuses_is_analogous_to_his_apologia_for_abusers_.28dictators_and_other_authoritarian_regimes.29" rel="nofollow">he was also doing this with others</a>. At various times he has given four reasons for blanking the page (which I summarised for him and he did not dispute):
<ul>
<li>a) wikipedia cannot define "dictator".</li>
<li>b) even if it could, the topic would be lead to lots of conflict.</li>
<li>c) adding someone to a list of dictators constitutes "original research".</li>
<li>d) there are no sources for the list as a whole, since no-one has made such a list before.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I provided the following rejoinders:
<ul>
<li>a) it can; it is a dictionary definition + the finer points (eg: absolute monarchs don't count) can be hashed out as usual on wiki</li>
<li>b) we must work for consensus on wiki - wiki does not shirk from controversial subjects</li>
<li>c) this is a misunderstanding of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> explains what <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Origin_of_this_policy:_the_opinion_of_Wikipedia.27s_founder" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#Origin_of_this_policy:_the_opinion_of_Wikipedia.27s_founder" rel="nofollow">here</a> and the exhaustive list of categories of things that can be excluded on the grounds of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> are listed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#What_is_excluded_from_articles.3F" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research#What_is_excluded_from_articles.3F" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Incidentally <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a> has made similar misuse of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/172_2/Evidence" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/172_2/Evidence" rel="nofollow">in the past (final comment on page)</a> which contributed to the arbitration committees decision to remove his sysop status.</li>
<li>d) it is absurd to suggest that a <i>list as a whole</i> on wikipedia must be sourced elsewhere. What does need sourcing are the <i>elements</i> of a list, that is certainly no difficulty here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In no way can a list of dictators be compared to a list of totalitarian dictators; there is no parallel - the first is a phrase that is ill-defined and disputed while the latter isn't significantly controversial and is universally used.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> looking over the discussion on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dictators_ef57.html" title="List of Dictators">List of Dictators</a> page, which has now been split into two, for clarity, I noted that the REDIRECT was entirely inappropriate. Furthermore, this list was useful. I could see no POV, and even if there is (there may be) that is not a reason to delete an article - <i>it is a reason to improve it.</i> I noted that the other arguments against the list were equally without foundation, based on inexplicable misinterpretation of wikipedia policies, and refusal to even discus the possibility of there being a definition of the word "dictator" on the part of <i>two</i> users.
<ul>
<li><i>Dictator</i> is a word with a clear definition, it is widely and uncontroversially used by historians, the media, the public, dictators themselves on occasion, and as can be seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_modern_day_dictators#Dictators" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:List_of_modern_day_dictators#Dictators" rel="nofollow">here</a> has similar definitions in eight different dictionaries.</li>
<li>A large number of individuals are universally accepted to be dictators. There is no doubt that there can be a valid, NPOV, list of dictators - therefore there is no justification to delete it - only to improve it until it is perfect like all articles on wiki.</li>
<li>The word "dictator" (-Roman) is used <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-43%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org+dictator+-roman+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GGLG%2CGGLG%3A2005-43%2CGGLG%3Aen&amp;q=site%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org+dictator+-roman+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">27,700 times in english wikipedia alone</a> and results in over 10m Google results. It is used to describe many people in wikipedia. The use of a word so often (and 8 similar dictionary definitions) implies some definition.

<li>"Dictator" is POV not because of the obvious cases like Hitler, but because of murkier cases. Is Mugabe a dictator? Is Putin?

<li>"Dictator" is a descriptive and cannot be POV. What I assume you mean is that adding names incorrectly to the list is POV, you seem to accept that there are some people who can be so described (unlike Zoe). So let's be clear: when you say you want to delete the article because of POV, what you mean is you want to delete it beause POV can be added?

<li><b>POV in an article is no ground for deletion.</b> This is made explicit in a policy statement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Lack_of_neutrality_as_an_excuse_to_delete" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPOV#Lack_of_neutrality_as_an_excuse_to_delete" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
<li>"Dictator" as discussed above is an <i>objective</i> not a <i>subjective</i> term, unlike evil/stupid and is applied universally to many people with only an extreme fan-base rejecting it in most cases. It is clearly defined in every dictionary, and encyclopedia (including here) and is used to describe people 27,700 times in wikipedia, and is used often in uncategorical terms in Britannica and elsewhere. Since (unless you with to take Zoe's position) there are certainly <i>some</i> dictators, there can be listed together. <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">jucifer</a> 07:49, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> inherently POV. An article on 'modern day dictators' can discuss a variety of definitions and interpretations, but a list will have to choose one definition and judge who meets it - that is POV.

<li>No, the word is well undestood, its meaning is not disputed by any mainstream writer. This is refleced in it's extensive use throughout Wiki, britanicca, and everywhere esle. I have yet to see any eveidence of major dispute about <i>the meaning of the word</i>. You argue that <i>Consensus is about agreeing on how to express verifiable facts, not about agreing which POV should triumph</i> - if you notice, <i>agreeing on how to express verifiable facts</i> and <i>agreing which POV should triumph</i> are the same thing here since there is <i>no mainstream dissent</i> about the meaning of this word. Indeed it has such a clear meaning that many supporters of dictators concede that their leaders are dictators - added the qualification "benevolent". <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">jucifer</a> 14:11, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>(You will excuse me removing your bolding, which I find sore on the eyes.) Right OK, so we can decide, in an NPOV way, whether Mugabe is to be included? P.W. Botha? Gorbachov? Putin? No, I didn't think so. And actually, definitions of dictator are not identical, see the ones on the talk page. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 14:28, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>There is no need to use straw-man arguements or be agressive or alter others posts. I do not excuse you for editing my post, please change it back.</i> The definitions all have the same intent, and use similar language - the meaning of the word is as clear as any other and is not disputed by any source.</li>
<li>To find out what is the NPOV way, these need to be discussed in terms of a definition - then a consensus can be reached as allways. These are not especially difficult cases in the light of the various dictionary definition. The only thing that is in question here can be "the facts on the ground". Sometimes the answer will be "wait and see" (i.e. Putin/Mugabe) and "if in doubt leave it out". Gorbachov wasn't one, he didn't have absolute power (rule by committee) and Botha was appauling man but was restrained by the "rule of law" and did not wield wield absolute power. You see, if you have a definition it can be discussed, debated and a NPOV consensus reached.
<ul>
<li>If "absolute power" is a requirement then Mussolini is not a dictator; he answered to the king and the king finally dismissed him. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You assert (mistakenly IMHO) that there is no clear definition, argue that therefore no consensus could be reached on a number of borderline cases, then you imply that because of these cases no consensus could be reached so there can be no clear definition. That it a full circle by my reckoning.</li>
<li>Do you accept that there are some people who are objectivly dictators? If so why don't you campaign for this list to be kept, but pared down consentually? <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">jucifer</a> 15:10, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Even if you could have an objective definition (and I'm not sure you can), it would still be subjective as to who met the definition. To take my staw-man List of non-existent deities: we could agree an objective criteria ('supposed gods that don't actually exist'), and we might mostly agree on certain examples that could be included (Zeus, Bacchus, and the Flying Spaghetti Monster), so should we have such a list? Your arguement would seem to say 'yes', and let's discuss <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allah.html" title="Allah">Allah</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah.html" title="Jehovah">Jehovah</a> on the talk page.

<dd>OK, your comparison is not valid because while it is true that both "dictators" and "list of Gods that don't exist" have objective definitions, one is defined in every dictionary, encyclopedia, is used here 27,700 times, is used by historians without controversy many many times. The other one (geuss which) was made up today by a Doc and is in any case unpopulatable since you can never prove non-existence. I'm sure you think of a better fatuous comparison than this one. You see what you are looking for is not only a objective definition, but also a term widely accepted and discussed even though it may seem pejorative - maybe a list like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy#Modern_examples" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy#Modern_examples" rel="nofollow">this one</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fascists" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fascists" rel="nofollow">this one</a>?</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Notable, encyclopedic. Many people would want to research the topic, and this list would make the research much easier. It is not inherently POV, as a defintion can allow editors to determine who should or should not be on the list. If some items are deemed POV, that is no reason to delete the list. I think people are mistakenly thinking that "dictator" is a subjective and perjorative term. It is commonly used that way, but it also has a pretty standard defintion as jucifer has demonstrated. For example, Hitler is not labeled a dictator because most of us <i>dislike</i> him but because he held <i>unilateral control</i> of his country. The list is not original research either; it is based on historical fact. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 15:47, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The definition of dictator is too ambiguous. Does it refer to method of taking power, their usage of power, media perception, abuse of power? Is it measured by western political standards? Standards within their continent? Standards within their country? For example, by western standards the last Shah of Iran was dictatorial. But by his country's standards how different was he? If a country has a long list of seizures of power, is method of coming to power relevant to definition of a dictator? If a country has a long history of 'strong' leadership and abuse of power, and someone else does the same, are they a dictator or just part of a pattern in that country? Leaders always base their leadership roles on what is the cultural traditions in their state and regions. 'Dictator' is a POV term. Some would say Mugabe is, others that he isn't. Ditto with the Shah and numerous others. Very few, like Hitler and Mussolini, are univerally defined as dictators. For that reason I think this list is too potentially POV to stay. There is no adequate definitions and context to avoid it containing POV opinions, even though in many cases my POV would also define most of the persons on the list as 'dictators'. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl">FearÉIREANN</a> 19:02, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b> The word dictator isn't inherently POV, but who is deemed a dictator *may* be. Hence, I think we should keep the list, but limit it to people who are nearly unanimously deemed a dictator (Hitler, for example). Also, determining who is a dictator is definitely not original research. More importantly, I think some of you are being a little harsh to <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">jucifer</a>.

<li>No matter how well defined one can render the term, the problem is not so much the concept itself but applying it. Professional historians who spend their entire lives studying any of the regimes listed on this page disagree among themselves on important questions of state power and authority. The work of one historian may suggest that the historical record confirms the placement of a particular leader in such a list; the work of another historian may present a very different picture. The process of writing this list is one of arbitrating between professional historians who themselves disagree on the questions salient in making this classification, and is thus an exercise of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> of the clearest kind. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 21:36, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Wrong. Not OR. Otherwise, you are implying that nothing can be defined at Wikipedia. And spare me <i>The process of writing this list</i>. You haven't started the process. Start by defining some standards for inclusion. Put some quotes to justify why people are listed. If needed, add bags of quotes. Use footnotes- lots of them. Show opposing viewpoints. In fact, insist on opposing viewpoints. Why do you believe this has to be a neat little compendium, like a shopping list to be handed to a grocery clerk (1.<i>Evil Dictator</i> 2.<i>Son of Evil Dictator</i> 3. <i>Mean bastard</i>).

<ul>
<li>I second that. What you argue here <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">User:172</a> is an excellent justification for improving the list, weeding out those borderline cases which may not fit the definition. Similarly I agree, that where there is evidence of a significant minority of historians disputing the characterization dictator it would be consistent with a NPOV not to list them as such. We are as one on this matter. There is no justification - from the indisputable fact that the article may contain POV, like every article on wiki - to delete it; the idea must be to improve it. Since you accept the existence of people who are objectively dictators, I do not understand how you can then argue that said dictators cannot be collated in a list. If there are dictators they can be listed - you are entitled to argue about which ones count, but there can be no justification for deleting the article on this ground. <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuicifer_867e.html" title="User:Juicifer">jucifer</a> 22:17, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, I am not implying that nothing can be defined on Wikipedia. Earlier, on <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_dictators_4506.html" title="Talk:List of dictators">Talk:List of dictators</a>, Jucifer attempted to make my argument into a reductio ad absurdum, stating that if dictators cannot be identified on Wikipedia on the grounds of NOR, on the same grounds we cannot identify a father on Wikipedia. However, just because some forms of categorization are not original research, that does not mean that no forms of categorization are original research. Regarding Jucifer's earlier father example, unless there is a paternity dispute, there is one and only one correct answer when it comes to the question about whether or not someone can be described as a father. However, for dictators, with the exception of the most readily obvious leaders who fit any reasonable definition of the term applied in any reasonable way (Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, etc.), reasonable editors, even when they are all agreeing on a single standard definition, can be left with legitimate room for disagreement on whether or not a particular leader gets included in the list as they are applying the definition, or in other words as they are doing what social scientists call "operationalizing" the definition. In that sense, making the classification boils entirely down to what we observe in the past and on a broader level the perspective from which we understand and interpret the past. Historians often disagree on the nature and scope of the power of individual leaders, especially in authoritarian regimes where leadership is opaque, under-institutionalized, and not accountable. Sometimes historians do not even agree on the question of who even ruled; for example, a timeless theme in political historiography has been the phenomenon of the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_behind_the_throne.html" title="Power behind the throne">power behind the throne</a>, arguing that certain leaders widely regarded as dictators were much more constrained than had been realized. Similarly, the lines are blurred when you have the disagreement between those who regard all nondemocratic or constitutional monarchial leaders as dictators, and those who reject the term when there is an element of collective leadership in either military regimes or single-party regimes. Earlier on this VfD, FearÉIREANN brought up examples of such ambiguous cases, just making a very brief statement of how and why this list is so problematic. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:22, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that the process of making the judgment call is the original research. When the classifications are obvious, such as the cases that I mentioned, the problems of original research are not clear. But for an even far greater number of examples, the judgment concerning whether or not to include a particular leader winds with Wikipedia editors themselves arbitrating between professional historians. Depending on how they understand the definition of the term "dictator" itself, historians will disagree based on their own disagreements among themselves on the political development of power in a regime; in that sense, there is no clear method for determing with bias and original research whether or not figures like <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Brezhnev_ff56.html" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Andropov_e579.html" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, Konstatin Chernenko, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Gorbachev_c563.html" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, and <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> are dictators. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 23:05, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm sorry, but that seems like a pathetic cop out to me. I have already offered a perfectly viable method for dealing with POV and the subtleties of history. Historians disagree on most things. If they always agreed, there would not be much need for historians at all, because the story would have already been told. You talk as if they were Homeric gods, arguing amongst themselves, while we, the mere mortal editors of Wikipedia, are hopelessly unqualified to understand their actions, or, god forgive, arbitrate. Luckily, of course, we have certain elite members, such as yourself, who can determine that <i>Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, etc.</i> can be reasonably labelled <i>dictators</i>. I wonder what method you used to allow this <i>judgement call</i>? I wonder why <a href="../../../m/a/o/Mao.html" title="Mao">Mao</a> is on one side of the equation, but these other Chinese <s>dictators</s>, <s>party apparatchiks</s>, <s>reformers</s>, political figures are not. I will never know, though, because you do not believe this info should be shared with the rest of the world as it would inevitably demonstrate some type of bias and meets <i>your</i> definition of OR. This attitude, taken to its logical extreme, essentially precludes any discussion of any historical topic within the Wikipedia domain. Wikipedia would have to stamp a warning on every page- <i>Do not discuss history. Articles on <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britney_Spears_3573.html" title="Britney Spears">Britney Spears</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">the Simpsons</a>, and <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_Statistics_ac01.html" title="Baseball Statistics">Baseball Statistics</a> preferred.</i> This shows considerable contempt for the Wikipedia project. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:38, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I explained earlier, while some forms of classification are not original research, that does not mean that some forms are not. I am not calling the process of classification itself inherent original research; so my comments cannot be taken to the extreme, as you suggest. However, efforts at making classifications are inherent original research when they are based on inductive inferences premised on unstated and unsourced assumptions about the political regime on which historians themselves disagree. In contrast, lists classifying other subjects are just reporting on society and culture. For example, the list of supermodels and the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_skyscrapers.html" title="List of skyscrapers">list of skyscrapers</a> are fine. (The authors of the lists are not consciously constructing, operationalizing, their own classification. Instead, particularly in the case of supermodels, they are dealing with self-defining subjects recognized as such by their peers and the businesses in the fashion industry.)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I’m glad you appreciated my complement. I also feel enormous relief for the editors of List of supermodels and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Skyscrapers_d08c.html" title="List of Skyscrapers">List of Skyscrapers</a> that their process of classification meets your approval. They can now join Britney, Bart and Baseball on the Wikipedia list of acceptable list topics. Of course, if a <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supermodel.html" title="Supermodel">supermodel</a> became a <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>, that might cause real problems, particularly if said dictator was featured on the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simpsons.html" title="Simpsons">Simpsons</a> or owned a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">baseball</a> team, as is so often the case. Yup, the world might crumble at that point, what with the colliding of society, culture and history and all...as if society and culture have any meaning without history. Or what if whole schools of supermodel dictators appeared, all recognized as such by their industry peers, craftily catwalking their way to world domination? Our readers would certainly be lost, given their lack of frame of reference due to the endless arguments of pesky historians, such as yourself, although wikipedians may have absorbed some knowledge owing to the inexplicable historical propensity of dictators to live in skyscrapers. I assume, at that point, you would approve the construction and operationalization of Wikipedia classifications for those of the dictator persuasion, although I may be poorly deconstructing the thrust of your argument, I admit, because I sometimes get lost in the endless swirls of circular logic I learned in grad school and I apologize to anyone who has had difficulty following said logic. Please note that my expertise and credentials permit me to speak on these matters and Wikipedia policy in general, as I have specialized in a small number of Supermodels, my research conducted late at night in darkened rooms, perhaps not unlike many professional historians, few of whom are also Supermodels. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:26, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hum, leaving it at that, on your last note it sounds as if you've made out better after grad school that most anyone I know... Anyway, thank you for the reply. To further clarify the distinction that I was making on the basis of the example comparing the list of supermodels and list of dictatos, supermodels are listed on the basis of their affiliation with the huge industry that has manufactured the very notion of "supermodel"; that is clearly reporting, not original research. When listing dictators, however, we constructing consciously our own categorical scheme predicating relevant questions on which historians often disagree (e.g., the extent of the power of a general secretary in a Communist regime with a collective leadership), and at that an understanding of what is a dictator that is almost certainly culturally and historically specific to our own society. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 06:01, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Since you recognize the validity of List of supermodels, based on their <i>affiliation with the huge industry that has manufactured the very notion of "supermodel"</i>- a definition, I would note, that ignores their <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> and degrades their very real achievements- and deny that List of supermodels is <i>culturally and historically specific to our own society</i>, I have applied your thinking and engaged the classification process from the standpoint of <i>reporting, not original research</i>.</dd>

<dd>If you attempt to challenge these sources, I would submit that your historian school has failed in its duties to inform you that dictators, like supermodels, have long been concerned about where they fit in the scheme of things, and frequently consult these types of lists as proof that they are correctly recognized for their achievements. I also needn't remind you that these are all perfectly valid sources for Wikipedia <s>editors</s> reporters. Since dictators already have lists and a store, shouldn't we out of a concept of fairness, give them a list, like we have done for Supermodels and Skyscrapers? Or does not our List of supermodels actually represent a flagrant application of our <i>historical and cultural specificities</i>, as you have so strongly denied?. If you find the time, I would very much appreciate your professional historian point of view on these issues. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:18, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, there's <i>Parade Magazine</i>, but I'm a bit uncomfortable with the blurring between history and entertainment. I recommend Eric Foner's collection of essays in his <i>Who Owns History?</i>, which offers a critical look at histories offered to the mass public for entertainment. Historians get a lot of negative feedback from the public from so many different directions; Foner's defense, though, is pretty effective. At any rate, I admit, if an arbitratary line is going to be drawn, drawing one rendering the work of professional historians (here in the U.S. esp. members of the American Historical Association) hegemonic in the production of content on history in encyclopedias is one I feel comfortable drawing. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:46, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Regardless of whether or not there is such a "universally accepted objective definition," assuming there even is one, there is no 'universally accepted' way of interpreting and applying the definitions that you are finding in dictionaries. In the end, the problem of <i>applying</i> the definition has the most bearing on the status of lists along these lines in an encyclopedia that eschews <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. For example, core figures of the collective leadership of a single-party state (e.g., <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Brezhnev_ff56.html" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Andropov_e579.html" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Gorbachev_c563.html" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a>, etc.) do or do not meet the definition of "dictator" depending not on the basis of which definition is being employed, but rather on the basis of the implications of the competing interpretive schemes employed by historians and political scientists in order to understand the internal dynamics of the regime itself (e.g., the contention between Russian and Soviet scholars following the model of bureaucratic pluralism on one hand, and totalitarianism on the other). In this sense, a couple of political scientists who spent their entire lives studying the PRC can accept the same definition of the term "dictator" but at the same time disagree on whether or not <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a> was one. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 22:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In responce to Gazpacho, I say the definition is universally accepted as objective because I'm not aware of any mainstream dispute of its use <i>at least to describe some people</i>. It is in every dictionairy with very similar definitions, it is used in every encylopedia, by every historian. No, authority has been cited that disputes this (at the very least I can say that an overwhelming body of evidence backs this up) - the meaning of the word according to the dictioanries is "absolute power" with no "rule of law" or words to that extent. 8 definitions are listed on the talk page. They are all fine.</li>
<li>172, this again I quite agree with, but this is relevent when discussing Jiang Zemin's place on the list, (FYI I dont think he should be) you would like to delete the entire list and this arguement provides no justification. You also argue above that threre are some leaders who ruled as part of a colective where it is difficult to determine. That may be and again as always in life and wiki, "if in doubt leave it out". All these points do is question whether people should be on the list - they in no way justify the deletion of the list. This debate is becoming more and more obscure.</li>

<dd>Of course there have been dicators. However, that point is moot. Original research is not necessarily wrong. It is not necessarily POV. Original research is original research because of the process by which classifications are made and information is determined, not because of the outcomes. For the purposes of Wikipedia editors, on what basis can the claim that Jiang Zemin was not a dictator be stated in Wikipedia? It cannot be on the basis of anything that you or I can state on Wikipedia, no matter how valid the kinds of inductive <a href="../../../i/n/f/Inference.html" title="Inference">inferences</a> that we make are on their own merits. In order not to be original research, the answer would have to be 'another reference source has generated the same kind of list, and it doesn't have Jiang on it.' If another sourcebook or encyclopedia that does not have a policy against original research (as it is professionally written by recognized experts in their respective fields) carried out the kind of research project that you are now attempted and published its own 'list of dictators,' only then would we be able to reproduce their research and avoid the problem of NOR inherent in generating this list, with the source being duly noted in the references section of the article. In other words, Wikipeidia editors can report the findings of research projects conducted by professionals and published outside Wikipedia; but they can not engage in their own research projects on Wikipedia, even if they can manage to reach some painfully obvious correct conclusions (e.g., Stalin was a dictator). <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:36, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Regarding the former, the reference to the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> is totally worthless, as that article gives only a vague factual definition itself.

The "totalitarian dictators" cat was mostly flawed because of the first word. But an individual invested essentially autonomous legislative authority is a decidable legal/historical question; it does require some careful treading, but it is not <i>inherently</i> original research or POV. A list (versus a category) has an advantage in that it can be annotated and structured. So some particular individual might have an annotation "Was declared a dictator by UN resolution NNN" or "According to Amnesty International..."

The term is just used loosely by those who intend for it to be pejorative, or who do not mind the pejorative implications of the usage.

<dd>I'm not sure about the redirecting thing. Someone else's "professionally published" list has no reason to be any better, nor any more or less POV, than one WP creates collectively. We editors are just as good as whoever Encyclopedia Brittianica might hire, or that Amnesty International might create (at least in the long run). I tend to take whatever exists as a starting point (assuming you can ineed imagine a <i>possible</i> good article under the title): the first thing is to start annotating names with information on the sense in which they are "dictators", and who says this of them. It's not even necessarily a pejorative to include names: "benign dictators" are discussed in the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> article... you or I might not endorse the "benign" part, but some supporters of a given political leader might. Obviously, sources who make claims should be a bit reputable: I'm not inclined to list someone because the John Birch Society called them a dictator. But if a reputable political scientist described a political figure as being a dictator (or something else close to the definition), that's citable, and enough to include the name, with such annotation. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 07:49, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It is standard procedure for topics which seem subjective to be thoroughly explained rather than ignored. Why is this case different? Just make sections for the various definitions of "dictator", and list those who fit that definition. If <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_dictators_dbfa.html" title="List of Roman dictators">List of Roman dictators</a> is allowed, then obviously this should be also. — <small><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian0918_0727.html" title="User:Brian0918"><b><font color="black">BRIAN</font></b></a><a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrian0918_ba6b.html" title="User talk:Brian0918"><font color="gray">0918</font></a> • 2005-11-27 00:29</small>
<ul>
<li>There is a clear difference. The Roman dictators held an office called "dictator" in the same sense that someone like George W. Bush holds the legal title of president. They were dictators in the sense that they themselves used the term to refer to the posts, not in the sense that we today are calling them "dictators" based on our own conscious construction of what the term "dictator" means to us. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 00:43, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The claim that the term is clearly defined in the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> article is also not true. It is defined loosely in the dictator article, because it is not a term with a precise meaning. Is the head of a military junta a dictator? Is the communist general secretary in a situation where leadership is essentially collective? Is a leader who maintains himself in power by moderately corrupt, but quite possibly genuinely won, elections?

<li><b>Delete</b> So why exactly was Mao classified as dicatator and Deng and Jiang wasn't? Was it because Deng was more favored in the west? During the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_Revolution_5b68.html" title="Cultural Revolution">Cultural Revolution</a>, absolute power rested with the hands of the Gang of Four, as well as Lin Biao. Mao really couldn't do much in terms of policy without these peoples' support. Between 1966-1968, however, Mao held absolute power, and in my opinion, only in those three years could Mao fit the "definition" of a dictator. Through one country's example, one could see the case for "Keep" is flawed. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColipon_e37b.html" title="User:Colipon">Colipon</a>+(<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColipon_76fe.html" title="User talk:Colipon">T</a>) 01:22, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You have it mixed up. Scholars do not affirm methods of conducting research based on whether it works in the easiest cases, but instead on the basis of the harder cases. Also, the cases that I called obvious (based on my own original research) are problematic because the process of reaching the conclusion was the original research; and the findings of original research are kept out of Wikipedia not because they are necessarily wrong or POV but rahter because the process of original research is not allowed under Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 01:59, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The problem with an article of this type is that there is no way to produce a non-POV comprehensive list. Even if we created the requirement that every dictator listed had to be sourced, there's the problem of whether or not the sources cited are authoritative (as opposed to polemical or rhetorical in their usage of 'dictator'). If the list included only those that were universally agreed to (or who self-defined as a dictator) it would be so short as to be virtually useless. If the list was "comprehensive," it would include nearly every modern leader, and thus be useless to our readers.—thames 02:10, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> There are problems with the list. So what? There are problems with most articles on Wikipedia, as you can note on any Talk Page. Having problems does not warrant a vote of "delete." It warrants careful editing and sincere attempts by the editors to solve the problems. I would also like to ask 172 to actually give an answer to the question, "If you admit that there are dictators, then why can't they be listed?" If he refuses to answer that question, then I think he is not acting in good faith. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 02:16, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Cut me some slack here. If I'm not answering a question, I just haven't noticed it yet or haven't gotten around to replying. The volume of discussion here is now so large that even if I were to devote an entire day to working on Wikipedia (I'm having to work on multiple things not related to Wikipedia at once while I'm online!), I may not be able to respond to everything to which I want to respond right away. At any rate, in response to the above, while <i>I believe</i> that there are some leaders for whom there are no reasonable objections to describing as dictators (e.g., Stalin), on what basis does such a list include or exclude the borderline cases pointed out by John Kenney, Jtdirl, Colipon, some other editors, and me? Either way, the list will always be POV if leaders like Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin or excluded or included. In the end, all the problems of POV and ambiguous cases boil down to <i>who</i> is making the description. If the list is a reproduction of one drafted by a professionally written sourcebook or encyclopedia, <i>who</i> is making the description can be duly cited (in such a case Wikipedia <i>itself</i> is only asserting that x said y, which can never be POV-- with readers capable of making up their own mind on the POV of x). If not, if the descriptions are the judgments of Wikipedia editors such as myself, the list is original research because the <i>listing</i> was original research. Since I am not aware of a professionally written list of "modern day dictators" drafted systematically with some rigor that we can find, reproduce, and cite for use in the page here, the subject of dictatorships cannot be configured into a list on Wikipeidia. Nevertheless, we can and already do address the subject in the <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a> and <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictatorship.html" title="Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> articles, which already deals with the subjects of Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and other historical figures as dictators in their proper contexts. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 02:52, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I glad you have answered my question. I asked you that since You yourself accept that there are some dictators - why can they not be collated in a list? You replied that <i>because the process of reaching the conclusion was the original research; and the findings of original research are kept out of Wikipedia not because they are necessarily wrong or POV but rahter because the process of original research is not allowed under Wikipedia policy.</i> The important thing you have said has thrown your simply ludicrous intepretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> into sharp relief. I'm glad you aresuddendly being straightforward. You are arguing that we cannot have a list of dictators because <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> precludes us from describing anyone as a dictator.

<li>That is simply the most breathtaking, most fatuous arguement I have seen on wikipedia - and I say this in exasperation since I have repeatetly asked you to clarify how you read your novella into the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> policy, and you have you yet to even make an attempt.

<li>No, I am not stating that no one can be described as dictators on Wikipedia.

Admittedly, the problems with POV are not so obvious in the cases of leaders whom everyone on Wikipedia finds very repellant (Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, and a handful of others). Nevertheless, the critical test that your list has to pass is whether or not it can deal with the far greater number of leaders who meet your definition of the term not because it is so "obvious" but depending on which historian or social scientist you read. The title of the article, after all, is list of modern day dictators, not list of people who were obviously dictators. Your list fails way too many tests; John Kenney, Jtdirl, Colipon, and I have pointed out only a small sampling. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:10, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b>. The term "modern dictator" has two inherent problems: what is "modern" and what is "dictator". Someone above says something along the lines that the article "dictator" gives a precise defintion. Well, it doesn't.

<ul>
<li>172, you still seem to be operating under the assumption that the term "dictator" is subjective, like the word "evil". That's why their could never be a list of "evil politicians". In this case it is simple--apply the definition. That's not OR; it's historical fact. For example, Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana dismissed his administration and ruled by dictating. That makes him a dictator. If somebody meets one or more of the criteria in the definition, then he is a dictator. It's not different from saying that somebody is a vegetarian because he will not eat meat or that somebody is a philanthropist because he gives large sums of money away. Just apply the definition. If somebody disputes an item on the list then the editors can hash it out: Did the person suspend the legislature? Did he or she continue in office by prohibiting opposition parties? Did he or she write laws unilaterally? (And so on. . .) It's simple. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 08:49, 27 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You seem to miss the main point: the definition itself is vague. While some rulers fit, others are disputable. USA President has an ultimate power during military emergency, but we are not going to list Roosevelt among dictators. Lukashenko did not suspend legislature, did not prohibit opposition parties, does not write laws unilaterally. Still he is considered dictator. Examples abound. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 08:55, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I have not been making the argument that the term cannot be applied because it is too value-laden. My concerns relate to the problems Mikka clearly noted above. Whether or not some leaders fit a particular defition is often quite ambigious, even if the term can be used in a non-loaded, value-neutral sense. A good recent example is the debate among China specialists following the 16th CPC Party Congress in 2002, when no one was really even sure <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a> was actually in charge; some thought that <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a> would continue to rule the country from behind the scenes from "retirement," as <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a> did before him. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:22, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> While I agree that the term <i>dictator</i> is somewhat POV, the fact, as mentioned by another editor, that this is the English language wiki and that the vast majority of those whose native tongue is English would agree that most of the persons on the list do indeed fall into the definition of a dictator, makes the list accurate. The words "modern day" don't really apply to <a href="../../../h/i/t/Hitler.html" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> since he has been dead for 60 years...so that may need some work.--<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMONGO_8e88.html" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 10:01, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Dictator has too many interpretations, borderline cases too difficult, would be better as category if it has to exist (ensuring that each case is fully discussed at the appropriate place, i.e. the article on the person in question). If we must have lists of this kind (and with every example I come across, I dislike them a little more, doubt their usefulness a little more), they must be based on clear and unambiguous and well-defined criteria, and not mix up things that are too dissimilar. So if necessary - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Roman_dictators_dbfa.html" title="List of Roman dictators">List of Roman dictators</a> (or better, <a href="../../../r/o/m/Category%7ERoman_dictators_3bfe.html" title="Category:Roman dictators">Category:Roman dictators</a>), List of political leaders who took or sustained power by military means (1900-2000), List of Communist Party heads of government, etc. (These would have their own definitional issues, but at least the range would be narrowed.) "Dictator" aside, "modern-day" also has definitional issues, and its insertion seems designed primarily to sidestep the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> debate (for which Gazpacho's recent solution seems reasonable, though in that form it might better be a subsection of <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">Dictator</a>). <a href="../../../r/d/2/User%7ERd232_65bc.html" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/d/2/User_talk%7ERd232_56da.html" title="User talk:Rd232">talk</a></sup> 10:50, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Dictator is such a loaded term that applying it to anyone is POV. I'm not saying dictators don't exist, just that the term has no place in a Wikipedia title (aside from the article <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dictator.html" title="Dictator">dictator</a>). If someone is described as a dictator, that needs to be footnoted and phrased to say "So-and-so considers Person X to be a dictator" or somesuch. You might salvage this from deletion if you moved it to List of modern-day individuals who have been called dictators or something (note the hyphen).

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I can imagine an NPOV, well-cited article on this topic, but this isn't it. Both "modern day" and "dictator" are subject to contention as to their meaning. I would suggest a cut-off date of 1900 and a list of objectively verifiable criteria for calling someone a dictator. For example, we could come up with a list of sources (or of classes of sources) that we consider relevant, and that for each person on the list we would indicate which of these sources so describe them. Also, we could probably say that certain criteria absolutely remove someone from consideration for the list: a freely functioning parliament (even one on a narrow franchise) that occasionally overrides vetoes, an independent judiciary that often rules against the government, possibly even a free press and freedom of movement. I also think that, because gray areas are inevitable, this list should be annotated. In particular, someone may not be a dictator when he takes office, but may become one. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 20:31, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I say this regretfully, but his behaviour has been - "eccentric" - let us say. He has deleted a large number of comments on the talk page of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> without justification and providing a misleading edit summary. He has accused me of bad faith, and refused to withdraw. He has spammed around 25 users with no prior interest in this page - often complimenting them and then asking for them to vote; portraying me as some kind of "barbarian" trying to defy a "consensus" about his risible adaption of WP:NOR. But not only did he spam profusely, he also vainly tried to hide the fact that he was doing this by instead of going to the "add comment" tab and adding a comment <i>(see how that works?)</i>, he went out of his way to scroll to the bottom of every users talk page - open up the last comment and add a new header. You see, when you do that you don't have a long list of "user contributions" saying "Please vote", since the header you edited was on some random subject. He has deleted someone else's comment on a the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_dictators.html" title="List of dictators">List of dictators</a> talk page and mislabeled the edit, and failed to replace it despite requests. When <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> politely questioned him on his general take on NOR on his own talk page recently - not only did he delete the comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A172&amp;diff=29406951&amp;oldid=29406256" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A172&amp;diff=29406951&amp;oldid=29406256" rel="nofollow">(see here)</a> but he falsified the "edit summary". When <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> questioned about this he again deleted the comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A172&amp;diff=29409009&amp;oldid=29408074" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A172&amp;diff=29409009&amp;oldid=29408074" rel="nofollow">(see here)</a>.

Users regularly inform me of debates if it is in a topic they think is in my area of expertise <i>because</i> I will offer <i>my</i> analysis, not theirs.

<dd><i>"Hello, there. I was reading through the AFD on List of Dictators, and I noticed your definition of Original Research seems a bit flawed. You claim the process of determining who is a dictator is original research. That seems like quite a stretch. You have to keep in mind the *historical* origins of NOR. It was originally developed because people were posting crackpot physics theories on wikipedia. NOR has since been expanded beyond physics theories, but in general, simple classification is NOT original research. In the case of classifying dictators, you would be using pre-existing material in your decision making process (relevant quotes, polls, media coverage, etc), hence it is not original research. Also, you REALLY need to archive your talk page.<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe1physicist_cf45.html" title="User:The1physicist">the1physicist</a> 20:06, 27 November 2005 (UTC)"</i></dd>

<p>My page reflects <i>my views</i>. Articles don't represent my views but NPOV (which why though I think Bush is a bozo I still revert attacks on him!). As to presidential gaffes (obviously you are sore that you didn't get your way there) either a person said something and it was regarded as a gaffe in public reaction, or they didn't. It boils down to facts. Whether someone is a dictator or not cannot be measured by something they said, but involves using subjective criteria on what you <i>think</i> of them.

He's the type that has to win. I don't have time for this, and I don't like it when my discretion is questioned. I know that sounds like a little thing to get angry over: but <i>it is not</i>. The amiount of discussion on the page only fortifys my lone <i>keep.</i> Surely, reasons why it should be kept have been exhausted by now. There is no reason for me to add any argument so I can get bombarded by Zoe's. Hell, he is going to argue with me when I haven't even created a debate!

<li>Oh lets please. After all he <i>lost</i> the 2000 election and only got power because Daddy's friends on the Supreme Court gave it to him.

And of course critics called the late <a href="../../../p/o/p/Pope_John_Paul_II_390d.html" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> "dictatorial" so I guess that makes him a dictator too. And FDR was re-elected four times even though the convention said that you should only be elected twice. They had to write it into the constitution to stop anyone else doing it. And Australia's <a href="../../../g/o/u/Gough_Whitlam_3876.html" title="Gough Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> tried to stay in government when he lost supply, so that makes him a dictator.

<li><b>Keep</b> Dictator is an established word that has a very definite meaning. Well sourced examples of what are ordinarily considered dictators would make an excellent encyclopedia entry. As an electronic, infinitely changeable reference work, the Wikipedia has the potential to be so much more then any other encyclopedia that has preceded it. We have lists of good movies, bad movies, people generally considered to be terrorists, etc. etc. etc. The process of vetting these entries to make sure that names do not arbitrarily get added is what makes the Wikipedia so great. If your favorite benevolent, head of a one-party state, gets included, cite your sources why he or she shouldn’t be on the list and let the process work. It might not work as fast as you like, but it’s a process. And if that really cheeses you off, then there are plenty of other websites that could use your attention just as well. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEaster_Monkey_13f5.html" title="User:Easter Monkey">Easter Monkey</a> 08:11, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have some serious problems with the article, and I can think more clearly if I try to articulate them rather than jump into Keep or Delete. First of all, I should say that I have a problem with the whole nature of lists on Wikipedia as well as in popular culture generally, where they often scarcely count as knowledge or even information but more as sound bites, and I don't think I've seen a good argument for them except when they are indisputable historical facts, e.g. list of British kings, Nobel Prize winners, and so on. I notice that in the breakdown of Wikipedia articles with the most hits, one of the top ones is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_French_people_3931.html" title="List of French people">List of French people</a>. I won't even comment on such an absurd idea. Be that as it may (and clearly I differ on the value of lists from others on this page, for me the main issue with the dictators list isn't even whether it constitutes original research or not or is NPOV. It's rather that, even though the term "dictator" is meaningful in a general, everyday sort of way, in reality it means rather different things in different historical contexts, and lumping all of these dictators together without explaining those contexts and the reasons for including each one distorts the political and social reality and tends to encourage simple-minded thinking, which isn't what Wikipedia is supposed to be doing. It seems clear that there is a huge difference between dictators who simply grew into or inherited a dictatorial position in some authoritarian state structure, dictators who usurped power from a constitutional republic or democracy, totalitarian dictators, and dictators who created a totalitarian dictatorship in the first place -- I'm sure that there are several other categories -- and, similarly, what it means to live in different dictatorships is quite different, depending on the nature of state power, the extent of countervailing powers, and various other factors. And it means something quite different to be a dictator as absolute ruler who by sheer will have thousands of people slaughtered and to be a dictator as the top dog in a bureaucratic dictatorship without such power. At different times in my life I have visited three different countries that legitimately count as dictatorships and had dictators -- one a Communist society, one a fascist dictatorship, and one an authoritarian constitutional monarchy -- but they operated quite differently from one another, and even though there is a sense in which the boss of each country was a dictator, the term obscures as much as it reveals, and putting them together on a list would really be distorting of the political reality. Furthermore, one could contest whether by definition the king in the constitutional monarchy was a dictator, even though if you knew anything about the society you would have to agree that he was. One way to think about this would be to ask ourselves, would be want to have a list of "rulers"? In that case we'd have to add George W. Bush, Tony Blair, and Jacques Chirac to that list. But to have them on the same list with Stalin and Hitler would be kind of silly. There are lists of "national leaders" and "heads of state", but those can be defined objectively and bureaucratically. So it seems to me that, to keep a list of dictators on Wikipedia, there needs to be a stronger and clearer argument not only as to why, but as to what it actually means (which I guess is similar to those who say that it's inherently POV). It also seems to me that there would need to be a prior discussion as to the subcategories of dictators (e.g. those I mentioned above and some others) and what the criteria would be for allocating individuals to those subcategories. <a href="../../../j/j/s/User%7EJjshapiro_7260.html" title="User:Jjshapiro">Jeremy J.

<dd>White supremacists are proud of being called so, therefore the list is verifiable. 69 is silly but well-defined. "worst ever" is a documented thing. "Terrorist" is a militant acting deliberately against civilians, a clear cut def, regardless he is "liberator" or mentally ill.

<li><b>Keep</b>, we are fully capable of making sourced distinctions.

<li>No, we cannot draft the kinds of list that you are giving as examples. No one here is saying that we can list "neocons?" Although there are some self-declared "neocons" who can thus be described as such, there are too few self-proclaimed "neocons" to justify drafting such a list. Show me such a list, and I will put it on VfD myself. No one here is advocating the use of the categories of "bourgeois" and "proletariat" states. (BTW, I have a strong aversion to the crude, instrumental Marxian notion of the state as the 'executive committee for managing the common affairs of the ruling class' in my work off Wikipedia.) Again, show me such a list, and I will put it on VfD myself. If indeed some misguided editor has started listing "bourgeois" and "proletariat" states, disregard for NPOV and NOR in one article does not make it right in another aritcle. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 04:49, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Try List of people described as neoconservatives. In regards to bourgeois and proletariat, I was thinking of occupations rather than states. The distinctions drawn can get rather fine, when it comes to professionals, such as MDs, corporate managers and lawyers. I'm not aware of any lists in this area however. We cover controversial distinctions all the time. While the neocon list includes "described" in the title, I think that is understood in all such lists, since citations should be required, although perhaps those should be in the article specific to the figure, rather than in the list article. If individuals want to contest entries in the list, and there are citations and consensus for the mention in the individual entry, then that his where it should be contested and not in the list article. Of course, some entries may not have individual articles or have not been discussed in some other other, and it is appropriate to request sources on this list page.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 09:28, 30 November 2005 (UTC)

As for "bourgeois occupations," any such reference in any article, let alone a list, should be deleted. I'm not aware of a Marxist literature on "bourgeois occupations."

<li>No reason has been offered?

Further, Jtdirl, Wizzy, Colipon, John Kenney and I, along with a handful of other editors here, I have provided a plethora of examples of leaders who fall into a gray area, and thus either way their inclusion or exclusion here is on the basis of the POV judgment calls of individual Wikipedia editors. If you do not remember a reason for deletion being stated, you need to take another look at the discussion threads.

<ul>
<li>Thanks for checking. Now, regarding the substance of your comments earlier, first, this list shows no sign of becoming a list of contemporary leaders. The author of the list appears to have included the 16th century in the domain of his research project; and 16th century entries are still listed. Second, you are mistaken in assuming that the removal of leaders who are not currently in power will mask the huge POV and NOR problems that got this article on AfD. The classification of contemporary leaders is just as often a murky POV judgment call as it is for less recent historical figures. Third, you seem to be basing your comments on the common misunderstanding conflating the term "modern" with "contemporary." Modern does not mean recent. On no non-arbitrary and NPOV basis can one make the case for the removal of removal of 16th century historical figures from the list of "modern day dictators," as the term "modern" arguably refers to historical figures going as far back in time as the 16th century. If the list is kept, there will be no basis to stop users from uploading their original research on leaders dating from as long ago as the Italian Renaissance, as there long-established arguments that begin the "modern " era in the 16th century or even in the late 15th century. Among historians, the term "modern" is one of the most debated, contested, controversial in their lexicon. No consensus has been established on the meaning of modern, just as no consensus has been established on the meaning of the term dictator. Some historians begin the modern era with the events following Bartholomew Diaz's rounding of cape in the late 15th century. Others begin the modern era with the Italian Renaissance. I know some historians who are among the smaller group of scholars who argue that the modern era begins with the Protestant Reformation. More often, historians argue that the modern era begins with the French Revolution. Meanwhile, many medievalists have long rejected the term modern, arguing that it is a construction based on horribly simplistic understanding of the period regarded as "medieval"—another term that many of them reject. More recently, historians associated with the currents of poststructuralism, postmodernism, and postcolonailism since the 1970s have often questioned the meaningfulness of the concept of the modern era, rather than arguing about when the modern era began. The questions of what the modern era is and when it began still lead to many heated and even emotional polemics between historians and scholars in other fields, especially as some members of the growing area studies departments in U.S. universities (particularly Islamic and East Asian studies) argue that established Western understandings of the "modern" era in historiography are loaded with ethnocentrism-- and may even be tinged with old assumptions that are "orientalist" or even racist. (I do not go so far myself, but I note their concerns. I generally fall into the group associating the modern era with the period following the French Revolution.) Given these many contentions in the historiography, even the periodization of the list is going to be inherently POV, based on an arbitrary POV judgment call regarding exactly which leaders were "modern.") <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 07:56, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I doubt you would fight a revert war because a well sourced entry happened to be a century or two too early to be considered modern by your definition. If dates are included, the reader could make his own judgement, and consider only those as modern as suits his purposes or interests. I can see valid arguments for dating it to the spread of the printing press, or too the time of the steam power, or whatever. Just because there isn't one right answer for every purpose, doesn't mean this article would not be useful.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:44, 1 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, you are correct; I would not fight a revert war because an entry happened to be too early to be considered modern by my understanding. I have just as little business pushing my POV and orginal research in articles as you or any other editor. If the only choice is between one editor's POV original research and another editor's POV original research, the article itself is the problem, not the editors, meaning that the only workable solution to the problem is putting up dispute headings and listing the article on VfD-- hence the fact that I have been working on the AfD as opposed to editing the list so that it conforms to my POV instead of another user's POV. (Unlike other editors, I understand that POV and original research must be weeded out because it is outside the scope of writing encyclopedic material on Wikipedia, even if I believe it to be correct. WP:NPOV and WP:NOR mean that what could be one's best written work off Wikipeida is insidious POV and original research on Wikipedia.) At any rate, your standard for allowing the reader to "make his own judgment" is hopelessly unencyclpedic. One could argue that we can allow anyone to upload his or her personal opinions in the articles, allowing the readers to evaluate them critically on their own-- a great principle we all should follow <i>off</i> Wikipedia. However, this is not going to fly in an encyclopedia based on Wikipedia's three core content policies of NPOV, NOR, and verfibility. On a final note, the dating is hardly the major problem with this list. It's just one of the many inherent problems here noted over and over again by many editors on this page. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 09:13, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. They are saying that it is impossible to create a list because too many people (eg, Mugabe, the Shah of Iran, etc) are regarded by some people as dictators but not by others. It is better to discuss the allegations of dictatorship on their own page, not make a list where only a handful would be unchallenged but vast numbers would be subject of POV edit wars. Even the name is unworkable: is 'modern day' being defined in the way historians describe it, or the way it is commonly understood. With guaranted edit wars ad infinitum over content, confusion over title, etc the list idea here is unworkable. Bizarrely, as Zoe shows below, even some sane people actually think Hitler wasn't a dictator (they are nuts in my view). Categorising someone as a dictator is inherently POV. It involves making a value judgment about someone's leadership, and balancing issues like context, cultural traditions, methodology of coming to power, usage of power, etc. (eg, if a state has a long standing tradition of military seizures of power and abuses of power, and a new military leader seizes power but doesn't abuse it <i>as much</i> as his precedessors and creates some form of weak democracy, does one compare him to western standards, by which he was a dictator, or his own state's standards, against which he might not be seen as a dictator?) In Chile, for example, some people on the right called Allende a dictator. Most people categorise Pinochet as a dictator. Put either in and you are guaranteed an eternal edit war here on those names alone. It makes more sense to describe people's rule on their own pages, or the pages of their country, rather than hang tags around their neck that rely on personal POV and put them, out of context, in a list. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:#006666; background-color:orange"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 13:24, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree it is definitely better to discuss the allegations of dictatorship on their own pages. This page should result in little discussion at all. If someone wants to challenge a name on this pages list, they should go to the specific page for the entry and challenge there where the editors have more specific knowledge and probably have already decided the issue. This page should rely upon the specific articles for all figures major enough to have their own articles. This page could also minor entries that don't have articles, but those should be sourced here, or on the page where they might have been mentioned as part of some percieved group. So for the most part this page should be a rather uncontroversial accumulation of the collective work of wikipedia on the various dictators.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 18:00, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

If you place such leaders on the list, you are entering the realm of POV. And if you <i>don't</i> place them on the list, you are supporting the opposite POV that they are <i>not</i> dictators. -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 04:35, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I might even be persuaded to shift from <b>Delete</b> to <b>Weak Delete</b> if this page became a Category instead. But my problem is not with Hilter, Stalin, Pol Pot.

<dd>The word is rather uniquely useful for its brevity. If it is to be softened, perhaps it is with another word such as "alleged", although that would appear too wishywashy for the likes of Castro, Stalin, Hitler, Mao and Pol Pot. I notice that for some reason this term arouses accusations of being too POV to deal with, while many of the articles openly discuss the seeming similarly POV distinguishing assessment of personality cults, without much conflict. --<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 06:08, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If the there are credible sources that make the case, even though controversial, they can be included, although perhaps they should be qualified per the contrary views. The list of dictators could have a separate section for those leading authoritarian, non-democratic one party states, and another section for majoritarian elected leaders who are much criticised for their authoritarian populist violation of rights, and destructive mismanagement of their economies. The distinctions would be informative. I'd rather have a proliferation of distinctions or sections on the one page, where they can be seen in contrast and comparison rather than on replicating figures on multiple lists on different pages. Musharraf is a military dictator who came to power in a coup. He may lack the state to violate the rights and impose the control that a Xiaoping or Castro does. But when one acts as these people have, it is only natural that some authoritative sources will make an argument that they are dictators. No harm and possibly a lot of good has been done by catagorizing them as dictators. Perhaps some of these figures will even be motivated to earn their way off the list.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:20, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>The list of dictators could have a separate section for those leading authoritarian, non-democratic one party states, and another section for majoritarian elected leaders who are much criticised for their authoritarian populist violation of rights, and destructive mismanagement of their economies.</i> Your cure is worse than the disease. Coming up with a taxonomy for different kinds of regimes (majoritarian, authoritarian, single-party, etc.) adds an even more problematic layer of POV, as there is a lot more disagreement over taxonomies for different kinds of regimes than there is on the definition of dictator. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:31, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>More categories and distinctions are time tested way of dealing with complexity, which is the real issue here, not POV. People working together in good faith can agree on the what definitions are being used at any given time. Since our reliance on sources means that material will be coming from places using different definitions of dictator, or whatever terms we are dealing with in wikipedia, it means that we have to qualify things. If some source is to call Mugabe as a dictator and have any credibility and informative content beyond mere name calling, then they will have to have justified and qualified their assertion, i.e., "I call Mugabe a dictator because he has these characteristics that are dictatorial such as acknowledging few moral or legal restraints on his power, etc...". Now, maybe you still don't think Mugabe should be called a dictator by your definition of the word, but at least you know what was meant by the person who did use it, and perhaps even agree that the other person, has in good faith, properly applied <b>their</b> definition of dictator to the facts, even if you still don't like or agree with their definition.--<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilverback_268b.html" title="User:Silverback">Silverback</a> 08:57, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Establishing what "generally" means is POV in and of itself.

<dd>Ok, then get rid of the "generally". It seems to be working on the movies listing, there are a number of editors over there that rigorously apply the caveat that I now see on my edit screen: <i>Please make sure your changes do not violate any copyright and are based on <b>verifiable sources</b>.</i> Each movie gets a blurb about why it's on the list and each entry is thoroughly vetted and verified so that the standards of credible, verifiable sources have been used. Sure, it'll take work, but looking through the history of this page, there seems to be more then enough folks interested in making sure that the standard of not pushing pov are met?

<dl>
<dd>I perfer to look at things on a more case-by-case basis. What may be workable on articles on movies may not work with history and politics. The problem here is the possibility of users creating bias through the selection of certain verifiable sources over others, possibly based on whether or not they conform to their own POV. There also the huge liklihood of bias in that sources that disagree with classification of certain leaders are much harder to cite. They often just don't use the term; and it's impossible to cite what a source may be implying but not stating explicitly. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 08:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>That can be avoided by detailing what sources can be used. For example <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a>, although permanently in POV dispute, does that. The word dictator can be misused, but I see little evidence that's ever stopped anything. Neo-conservative is often misused but there is a List of people described as neoconservatives. Fascist is routinely misused, but there is a List of fascists. I'm not sure why dictator is any more debatable then things like "worst", "best", "Fascist", "cult", etc that already exist in list forms.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 10:10, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There have been self-describing fascists and neoconservatives, so matters are not quite the same. To describe some people as fascists and neoconservatives is not POV, so long as the classification is based on their professed affiliations. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of vigilance on those articles, with many POV classifications slipping in that are not based on self-definitions, thus making the difference between those two articles and an inherently POV entry like list of modern day dictators somewhat unclear at first glance. The list of neoconservatives, in particular, has been broadened to such a great extent beyond those who use the term to refer to themselves (such as Irving Kristol and his associates) that I favor redirecting the article until it is cleaned up. Unfortunately, other articles may have problems similar to the ones found in this list; but we cannot allow deteriorating standards on those other others to serve as an excuse to lower the standards when creating new entries. Regarding the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_purported_cults.html" title="List of purported cults">List of purported cults</a>, I have not looked at the article, but judging from the title, it may not warrant deletion for the reasons emphasized on this VfD thread. While a comparisons may not be too helpful, as it is probably best to decide these matters on a case-by-case basis anyway, the description of a "cult" is easier to work with because there is always a large volume of literature on whether or not a certain organization is a cult coming from both sides of the debate. In the West there are large communities of experts regularly publishing large volumes of work monitoring and classifying cults. The term "dictator," however, is mostly used loosely as a pejorative, and never with anywhere the kind of rigor that some attempt to bring to bear in the classification of cults. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 11:03, 2 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm uncertain where you live that "dictator" is used in a looser fashion then "cult." To me dictator is pretty much just "a single ruler with absolute authority and lacking legal or constitutional restraints." A cult is often "any religion I personally dislike" or "any religion that fits one sociologists check off list." I can find just as many research groups willing to call a leader a dictator as I could ones willing to call a group a cult. More, probably, because the term has been <b>Less</b> misused then cult.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 11:12, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not referring to usage in informal conversations. I'm referring to the specialized professional publications. There are groups that try to use the term cult with some rigor, such as the Cultic Studies Review and ICSA's Cult Information Service. This is way outside my area of expertise, as I am not a social psychologist. But I was quickly able to find a list of links on cultic studies on a University of Calgary website. <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/links/journals.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ucalgary.ca/~nurelweb/links/journals.html" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> The term "dictator," however, is not subject to the same kind of academic debate because it is not used as an ideal-type by scholars, as it has little value as an ideal-type. The reason is that the usage of the term dictator is often not going to be too revealing in the end-- a matter that only Jeremy Shapiro has really touched on so far.

<dd>Before wading through this debate I would have thought that the reason that the term dictator hasn't been subjected to the same kind of academic debate as some other terms is that it is well enough defined such that a native english speaker would understand what it means. Additionally, I would have thought that it would be a matter of common sense when coming up with a list of folks that have been/are considered dictators. That a number of world leaders have been dictators is a matter of historical fact, it says so on the individual pages dedicated to each (well, most of them anyway), what's wrong with listing them all together for a single point of reference? --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEaster_Monkey_13f5.html" title="User:Easter Monkey">Easter Monkey</a> 11:54, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's one thing to claim that the usage is a "matter of common sense"; it's another thing to look at the specific histories in question.

<dd>Of course it is, mostly in passing, with the usage not being discussed in much detail. If anyone looks hard enough, he will be able to dig up some article calling a leader he dislikes described a dictator. Meanwhile, the less broad usage of the term will be lost because writers who don't regard certain leaders regarded by others as dictors aren't addressing the issue of why they don't use the term. Giving users a green light to push POV, so long as they try hard enough to bias the selection of the sources so that the citations fit their POV, is not the way to raise encyclopedic standards on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So....why not keep the list, and then take each of the entries on a case by case basis? (I perfer to look at things on a more case-by-case basis. Your words...) I've not taken the time to go to each of these individual pages to check for sure, but I would think that there would be (I would hope that there would be) a healthy discussion as to the validity of applying the term dictator to each one of those in turn. Thus, by virtue of the fact that each is under consideration for the application of the term dictator on their own pages, why can't we then list them all in one place? --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEaster_Monkey_13f5.html" title="User:Easter Monkey">Easter Monkey</a> 12:45, 2 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>POV judgment calls are not supposed to be determined by "healthy discussion as to the validity of applying the term dictator" among <i>Wikipedia editors</i>-- original research in no uncertain terms. I recommend considering the leaders other users and I keep on mentioning as examples (<a href="../../../p/e/r/Pervez_Musharraf_6841.html" title="Pervez Musharraf">Pervez Musharraf</a>, <a href="../../../v/l/a/Vladimir_Putin_50b8.html" title="Vladimir Putin">Vladimir Putin</a>, the rulers of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, <a href="../../../a/l/b/Alberto_Fujimori_b38a.html" title="Alberto Fujimori">Alberto Fujimori</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/g/Hugo_Chavez_1fdf.html" title="Hugo Chavez">Hugo Chavez</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonid_Brezhnev_ff56.html" title="Leonid Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, <a href="../../../y/u/r/Yuri_Andropov_e579.html" title="Yuri Andropov">Yuri Andropov</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mikhail_Gorbachev_c563.html" title="Mikhail Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Deng_Xiaoping_1b22.html" title="Deng Xiaoping">Deng Xiaoping</a>, <a href="../../../j/i/a/Jiang_Zemin_0f0a.html" title="Jiang Zemin">Jiang Zemin</a>, <a href="../../../h/u/_/Hu_Jintao_ccff.html" title="Hu Jintao">Hu Jintao</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Mugabe_10bb.html" title="Robert Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>, and <a href="../../../m/s/w/Mswati_III_6760.html" title="Mswati III">Mswati III</a>) in order to understand how murky the classification can be-- allowing any Wikipedia editor to exclude or include just about any leader of he is clever enough with the craft and rhetoric involved in the construction of the classification. In the end Wikipedia is best served by faithfully and rigidly following NPOV and NOR policies, not circumventing them creatively because certain Wikipedia editors just happen to enjoy drafting politically oriented lists. <a href="../../../1/7/2/User%7E172.html" title="User:172">172</a> 13:58, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Comment</i> Seems to me that Putnam is notable for being in so many non-notable vanity joke black metal/white power bands unknown to AMG with wikipedia entries. Or notable for having so many contradictory (&amp; unverifyable) wikipedia articles covering overdose induced comas, or improbable spatz with notable musicians which generate lots of name dropping wikilinks in his large catalog of wikipedia pages. Sure, AC is a valid band, making Putnam something like a lesser modern <a href="../../../t/e/s/Tesco_Vee_0e40.html" title="Tesco Vee">Tesco Vee</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/l/Billy_Milano_9b17.html" title="Billy Milano">Billy Milano</a>, but the entries relating to him -and his notable activities- reek of fiction. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 18:51, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I now realize that Channel 4 is a major network in the UK. However, as for these lists being standard practice, I have no respect for that practice. I found this article thorugh the random article link, thought it was an isolated problem, and nominated it. I would like to see the "several dozen more" which SimonP mentions deleted along with this one, but I recognize their nomination would be a futile effort.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm actually tempted to vote delete on this because these list articles are woefully incomplete compared to the categories that cover the same thing. I know that I personally have added network show categories to at least a couple hundred shows and I really don't want to have to repeat myself and list these shows again in a list article. I will wait to see how other people vote and comment before casting my ballot. (PS I'm aware that at least some of the network list articles have additional information such as current programming grids, so I'm not saying they aren't worthy of having articles.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 06:19, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We of course appreciate your work categorizing articles. Yes, this is messy and it needs cleanup. However, it does do something that categories won't; it lists programmes for which there are no articles yet. This list can also be annotated.

<dd>That's fair and certainly I wasn't intending to suggest categorizing is somehow better - it's just a matter of keeping the lists more or less the same. But in some respects I rendered my objection (such as it was) moot by mentioning that other network lists articles include additional info such as the program grids. Long story short, a <b>keep</b> vote (as if it needed it) with the suggestion the article be expanded like the others. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 16:47, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I counted Zoe, Quentin, D Monack, Renata3, HackJandy and Peyna arguing for deletion and Michan, RoySmith and Zordrac arguing against, which makes it pure numerically a borderline case. Proceeding to look at the arguments. I note that Zoe's nomination is very weak and Michan created the article as her/his first contribution. RoySmith almost convinced me to keep it, but in the end, the lack of credible references was fatal. If there had been a references to a national newspaper or magazine or something like that, I would have kept it, but blogs just don't cut it, I'm afraid. – <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 01:51, 3 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>NN amateur video series.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>; Anyone who has watched any or has followed all of these films would agree that this entry should definitely stay. While it is not very well known amongst those residing outside of California, "Kyle and Evan Do the Movies" is a serious amateur film project that will no doubt gain popularity as it progresses. I see no harm and only help in keeping this Wikipedia entry up for viewing. Perhaps those who believe it needs cleaning up should make specific points as to where and how it should be edited (more) so that it can be satisfactorily revised to meet those expectations. Thus far, only 2 out of the 5 who have voted for deletion have presented any reason as to why they think it should be done.--Xrockangelx 06:37, 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>; This amateaur film series enjoys mild fame in it's own underground way, and is an interesting student film series.

<ul>
<li><b>Abstain</b>. Although normally I'd grit my teeth and vote to delete this particular list against as a matter of consistency, Arniep's charge of a bad faith nomination holds weight. The nominator appears to be a sock puppet whose sole purpose is to rid Wikipedia of Jewish lists. The expansiveness of the rationale for nomination gives me pause. Surely there are enough show business figures (Woody Allen) and writers (Philip Roth) whose Jewish heritage influences their work in noteworthy ways. Sandy Koufax missed the opening game of the World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 16:06, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>First of all, the <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> nominations are just set up as a distraction by User:Arniep who himself went on a rampage recently and nominated literally dozens of lists for deletion on the basis of a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. I have been on wikipedia under an anonymous IP and finally decided to make a username because people were bitching about anonymous IPs on page deletions. For that reason, I am concentrating on deleting the lists that are the most numerous - among them happens to be a lot of jewish lists. A blatant call for anti-semitism on User:Arniep's part I expected, and he seems to be very immature. I already discussed with <a href="../../../v/u/l/User%7EVulturell_6ce1.html" title="User:Vulturell">User:Vulturell</a> that either these smaller lists need to go or the bigger list because they are virtual copies of eachother. There is no <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> nomination here - this could even be considered speedy delete material. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStabRule_e05a.html" title="User:StabRule">StabRule</a> 21:12, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did make a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> which I fully admitted, as a counter to mass deletion of Jewish lists by yourself under numerous sock puppet accounts. You seem to be remarkably au fait with wikipedia procedures for someone who has done just a few anon ip edits. Also, would you mind not deleting critical comments from your talk page (which were not from me by the way) as it is considered bad <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a>. I never accused you of anti-semitism so please withdraw that insulting remark. Arniep 21:59, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think the main problem here is this user leaping to nominate these lists without any prior discussion. It would have been the mature and polite thing to place discussions on the talk pages of these articles first. If the user had done that I might well have agreed.Arniep 22:49, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I don't know what the answer is for all these lists. I don't even like lists. I do know that I'm fed up with the daily noms or renoms for Jewish, Catholic, Christian, name your religion lists. It is strange that people feel the need to join wikipedia for the sole purpose of seeing something deleted. It is reprehensible that they do this for sensitive content involving religion. The Afd process itself is being perverted. I am therefore going on the record that from now on I will exclusively vote Strong Keep for any <i>positive</i> list that has any religion in its title. I don't care if someone does a List of Amish Proctologists- if I see it on AfD it's a keeper. And yes I meant positive. If I think the list carries the slightest negative connotation for any religion I will vote Strong Delete. List of Quaker War Criminals- No thank you. Just so everyone knows where I stand. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:39, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Originally the idea WAS for it to be up for deletion - but as soon as the page is deleted it will be used as an index. This is a common occurence for pages of the like.

<dd>Arniep, clearly you do not understand. You cannot vote "keep" on both this list and the smaller separate lists - for they are identical. You need to make up your mind on which to choose.

<li>Based upon the huge mess this created and actions taken by the person that listed all of these lists (spamming for votes, juvenile responses here and on talk pages); I think the best course of action is to keep everything and then sort it out on those actual pages in the discussion pages.

<p>A Google search of this party's name yields 2000+ hits. Most of them are forum discussions among politically interested curious at this unheard of party with an objectively fascist ideology. The party's actual presence doesn't extend beyond their tripod page.

<p>Hard to tell if this online paper is notable. Nominated for CSD, but I don't think it quite fits. I decided to nominate it for AfD to be fair to the CSD nominator (although I also left the CSD tag in place).

<li>I'm the webmaster of this somewhat languishing site(it's popularity has somewhat faded since 2001-2003 when it was most popular). That might leave me somewhat bias so I'll leave it to the community to decide whether this article should be deleted or not. I just want to address Gamaliel's first reason for deletion, website advertisement. I've seen some ext. weblinks on Wikipedia(and have nixed one link) that have been much more blatant website promotion than this article. More over, the article is more about the event(or it should be if not) than it is about the website, which isn't a commercial website. I have sold a handful of DVD's from the site, but I doubt that it has made me profit after all the expenses inccurred involving the website. That is all I wanted to say regarding this article.--<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> 04:16, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

I am from Sant Baljit Singh's organization, and there must have been a misunderstanding, as we did not want to begin the "Articles for Deletion process", though I would personally like to edit the article heavily. I would have done so but for my respect for the author since it would have involved large scale changes/deletions. And of course, I am subject to higher scrutiny for NPOV as a volunteer in Sant Baljit Singh's organization. Given this article's current state on the "Articles for Deletion" list, and pending no objections from the original author or the Wikipedia community, I plan to make the following changes to the article:
<ul>
<li>The author's link to raw transcripts of talks by Sant Baljit Singh given in non-public settings is of questionable appropriateness and value in a public forum, and would be considered a Copyright violation.</li>
<li>The narrative description of blow-by-blow events of the "Succession" from Sant Thakar Singh to Sant Baljit Singh could easily be summed up concisely as to dates, places, and significant aspects and facts, without infringing upon Copyright of Sant Baljit Singh or Sant Thakar Singh. Or that of authors of reports who never intended their writings to be made available on a public forum.</li>
<li>Cleanup of opinion, e.g., "His message on these visits has been both blunt and direct" or "Sant Baljit Singh is very different in background, temperament, and in method, from Sant Thakar Singh."</li>
<li>Refrain from quoting anonymous sources.</li>
<li>Refrain from quoting non-expert sources who never meant their writings to be available on a public forum and indeed never published them outside of the organization. Apart from Copyright issues and respect for the privacy of these individuals, I feel the value to the public is questionable.</li>

<p><b>Delete.</b> Take equal parts neologism and dic-def, stew in POV sauce and you have this page. It's a place holder for dubious, rarely used cruft from U.S. political wars (Democunt?!) an insufficient number of which are sourced and I think qualifies as an indiscriminate collection of info. And no, for the people who are concerned about POINT noms with lists, this isn't an effort at POINT. Specified, scaleable lists have a place. I don't believe this qualifies. And to forestall "but we need this page as a re-direct target," pages stay or go on their own merits. If you'd like a page on Communist epithets, OK--that would be specified and scaleable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 12:26, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>Just to make one final point given the predictable rash of keeps. An entry: 1) Gets a para in which case it deserves a stub and isn't needed on the page (an appropriate category properly serving as its placeholder) 2) Gets only a sentence in which case its a dic-def 3) Is a neologism and doesn't belong to begin with. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 13:12, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting article, but maybe requires a more NPOV, but <b>keep</b></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This seems to have a balanced POV — that is, that there are around equal amounts of every political sentiment and every kind of epithet in here. If not, then please add the POVs that you think are missing. In the case of dic-defs, this article has plenty of room for expansion, and there's plenty to be said on the subject; add a sentence or two. Remove neologisms, of course. By the way: if you expect a "predictable rash of keeps," then why nominate it here anyway? It appears you already have an idea of what community consensus will be. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 14:57, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Plenty of room for expansion at 70k? It actually makes more sense to break into five or six articles. Also, I can expect a keep consensus and still entertain the possibility of a delete and nom with a cogent reason. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:24, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can, but it clogs up the very busy AFD. And the 70k can be reduced by tightening the prose without removing much in the way of information. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_e8a5.html" title="User:Jacqui M"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_2117.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M"><sup>★</sup></a> 15:30, 26 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are a <i>186 sections</i>. "Prose tightening"? No, spin-off articles where possible. I think logically it can be spun off to the point where a category can fulfil its functions--as I say, Communist epithets makes more sense than a List of political epithets. If we're going to keep listcruft we should at least make it precise. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 15:35, 26 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Keep, but massive clean-up</b></s> it needs a working definition, and a pruning of nn and not particularly political terms.

<li><b>Keep</b> but update - to common/current terms 17:36 26 Novenber 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and edit. To be on the list, a term should be, I think, a significant part of public political discourse--things like "democunt", which due to its obscenity is absent from most places except for hard-core right-wing circles (as well as similar insults used by the left to slander the right) probably should be axed. --<a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEngineerScotty_c6c0.html" title="User:EngineerScotty">EngineerScotty</a> 04:03, 27 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Overly long and ough to be busted out into a category and individual articles. This article also suffers from several major problems.
<ol>
<li>"ownership" problem where a small <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clique.html" title="Clique">clique</a> of editors guards there prefered version.</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. In theory this should be kept, but in practice it suffers from two major problems - one is that it almost completely uncited <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, and the other is that it is being watchdogged by editors who don't appear to understand policy. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></small></sup> 05:33, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Cleanup is needed on most, but if a problem with an article can be solved, deletion isn't the answer. If <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> can be kept, this list certainly can as well. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 15:11, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because I don't see a real encyclopedia article here. This is a mish-mash of catch-phrases and buzzwords, a few notable enough to have independent articles but most not. Many are unverified in even the most basic sense. This page is not a "structural list" which might help the reader to find relevant articles, nor do I see much possibility that it could become so. However, I would not be averse to a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> to Wiktionary since many of these <i>are</i> valid definitions. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 15:40, 27 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, the article claims to be about a 16 year old who plays for a team that was before world war II. So, I suspect if it exists at all, maybe it is a student league? We haven't been able to verify it, nor the subject, nor the Sky Malta mentioned. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 16:57, 1 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Being Maltese, I don't believe Valletta schools have their own league. There is no secondary school in Valletta!! It must be some amateur club if it really exist. Its also interesting the footballer wants to be on top of the world. This is just a wish obviously! 19:21, 1 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm really not sure about this at all. Perhaps I shouldn't have put it in AfD; however.... as mentioned on <a href="../../../d/e/c/Talk%7EDecade_Nostalgia_e44e.html" title="Talk:Decade Nostalgia">Talk:Decade Nostalgia</a>, it could be construed as a collection of "original research" or POV subject matter.</p>
<p>Before you assert that it's about "popular perception" and nostalgia, not reality, I'd like to say this. The article primarily reflects an American perspective of nostalgia, and as I mention <a href="../../../1/9/7/Talk%7E1970s.html#.22The_latter_half_of_the_decade.22.3F_American_bias.3F" title="Talk:1970s">here</a>, this isn't necessarily the view held by other people; not even as *nostalgia*. Whilst the stereotypical 'nostalgia' view of the 1950s in many countries is undoubtedly that of post-war Americana, I believe that this applies less to other decades (e.g. 1970s, 1980s).</p>
<p>The article should <b>reflect</b> the (probably inaccurate) perception(s) <b>to the extent that they are currently seen</b>, but <b>it should not add to</b> a particular bias. To have a US-centric article would reinforce these views more than they currently exist, and would not be suited to Wikipedia.</p>
<p><b>Here's the problem</b>; the article already has some potential issues with POV/bias to begin with, but I think it would be hard to accurately reflect 'common' stereotypes without bias towards one's own cultural perspective. And I can see the whole thing descending into a horrid list of country-specific and argumentative stuff, obscuring the inherent generality of the "decade nostalgia" being described.</p>
<p>At the same time, this is no excuse for keeping a US view alone, unless that reflects the view of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>So, I am not voting for or against at present; although if the vote is to retain, I certainly intend keeping it as universal as possible; not as a historical article, but as an accurate representation of 'nostalgia'. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 13:31, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>As the person who already pointed this out in the article, I don't have a problem with "decade nostalgia" not reflecting reality; that's what nostalgia is! The reasons I nominated it for deletion are described above; that wasn't for that reason. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 13:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - the subject matter is inherently flawed because nostalgia is a personal perspective on a bygone era, and such a subjective view is impossible to describe in any one (or 6 billion) way(s). <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarneyboo_eb5f.html" title="User:Barneyboo"><font style="background: #ff66ff" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Barney</b>boo</font></a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarneyboo_2e94.html" title="User talk:Barneyboo">Talk</a>) 21:51, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, I disagree with this; the decade-nostalgia concept (whatever it's called) encompasses the *commonly held* views within a society about what it was "about". My problem is that it still varies from country to country, and whilst (e.g.) the 1950s have a common image, others such as the 1970s and 1980s don't, and this shouldn't be a discussion page. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 13:51, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is sources. Something that could be called decade nostalgia exists, and could be an article, or even several. But, without sources, this article is just personal ramblings, POV and OR. (BTW, all AfD pages are discussion pages. The goal is to reach a consensus, not just vote.) --<a href="../../../a/_/d/User%7EA_D_Monroe_III_2a7e.html" title="User:A D Monroe III">A D Monroe III</a> 14:29, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, no; I meant the article page itself. Of course we can discuss things here&#160;:) Actually, I have this problem with the 'decade' pages themselves too. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 18:36, 29 November 2005 (UTC)

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Zordrac is correct that the advertising has been removed. However, there was also the neologism charge, which a quick Google confirms to be likely true, with <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=biznik&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=lYe&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=biznik&amp;hl=en&amp;hs=lYe&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;start=60&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">only 50 useful hits</a>. Now I would not normally Google myself during an AfD closure, but this time it's important to verify the Google count claims in the debate and to see whether the neologistic claims have the basis claimed in the debate. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:40, 2 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> This company is very famous in Columbia, South Carolina and the surrounding areas. Perhaps instead of deleting it should simply be re-written by someone. See articles in the USC Gamecock, the Columbia Free Times and the Garnett and Black magazine. Also, the "Buddy Cop Show" premiere sold out completely a week in advance. Also they do not seem to be making money off their films, hence I do not see justification for copyvio. 09:05 30 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

The domain name of MaraWiki, zdome.net, has no Alexa ranking, so it doesn't sound a very popular website. –<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHapsiainen_6f9e.html" title="User:Hapsiainen">Hapsiainen</a> 21:23, 26 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Basically a high school amateur film project. Article doesn't attempt to establish notability, on the talk page they claim they were mentioned in a college newspaper.

<p>As in the vanity guidelines, fame is not a good indicator of vanity. Furthermore, real media coverage is based upon member W.marsh's own perspective. This article provides a neutral view on a cinematography team, not a high school amateur film project. If one were to actually read the article, he or she would realize that this team began with high school students but has moved on to be larger scaled. Responding to the notion of the article not establishing notability, there are references to the subject at hand, though not referenced in online publications. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.21.231.225 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.21.231.225_29bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.21.231.225">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>A very minor political figure on the far right of British politics. His highest office was apparently as a regional organiser for the "Sussex region" (most probably just the counties of <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Sussex_9ac8.html" title="East Sussex">East Sussex</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Sussex_237a.html" title="West Sussex">West Sussex</a>) in the 1980s. Since then he's been struggling to get the support of more than a handful of people behind his "grouplets".</p>
<p><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> poses two tests for the noteworthiness of politcal figures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature.
<ul>
<li>Troy Southgate clearly fails this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Major local political figures who receive significant press coverage
<ul>
<li>Certianly I'm not aware of his receiving significant national press coverage in recent years. I'm too young to know if he did in the 1980s, when he was most notable. I would be suprised if there wasn't a fair amount of local (Sussex area) coverage at the time of his arrest/trial but whether this reached the national papers I don't know.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Troy Southgate sent an e-mail to the help desk asking for his article to be deleted. After cleaning up the article with references, I put a notice on the UK Wikipedians Help Desk whether he was more notable than he seemed. National President of the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_National_Front_1140.html" title="British National Front">British National Front</a> might be notable enough. I doubt that a Sussex Regional Organiser is - even if it was in Labour, the Tories or Liberal Democrats.

<li>Upon reading the article, it seemed to be self-evident that this is original research. I was then utterly amazed to find, upon subsequently performing research, that <i>it isn't</i>. This comparison is one that quite a few people appear to have made, for several years now.

It is completely without sources, and it does not attribute the opinion to those that hold it, but instead presents it as Wikipedia's own opinion.
