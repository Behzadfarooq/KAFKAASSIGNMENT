<li>My apologies. The edit actually originated from <a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.81.26.42.html" title="User:198.81.26.42">198.81.26.42</a>, which also happens to be an anonymous AOL address.

<p>My white brother, let me say this only once. For hundreds of years, the black man's votes didn't count. This is nothing new. Oh no, there is no new thing under the sun, just as Solomon wrote in Ecclesiastes when the man was holding him down because he was black. See, he knew that there was nothing new about racism, nothing new about hate - but that didn't stop him from raising his voice and saying that there's a time for the brother man to speak out. There's nothing new about racism, but that didn't stop Malcom X or Martin Luther King or Rosa Parks or Jesse Jackson or Louis Farakon or Al Sharpton. And I'm not about to let it stop me from speaking up for my rights as a person, either. So you can say all you want that votes from the black man don't count. But let me tell you something, brother. Jesus was a black man, and its a black man who'll be your judge at the Judgement Seat. Then we'll see whether or not votes from the black man are counted, then we'll see. In the meanwhile, I'm gonna keep on speaking up when I see articles on my heritage being deleted for no other reason other than their race. I thank you all for reading this and pray that you'll make the right decision and let this article stand. Oh, let it stand, brothers, like Shadrach, Mesech, and Abednigo in the sea of fire - let it stand and be unharmed!</p>

<p>May I say that I feel where you're at, my FInal Fantasy playing sister. I feel where you're at, and I say Amen! Just this morning, I posted on the community forum, asking my brothers and sisters for help against the waves of racism that appear to be sweeping this site, and the man took my message down. But that didn't keep my message from reaching your ears, sister! That didn't keep my message from reaching your ears! For its not my message that speaks against racism, its the message of Jesus! See, you can hold the black man down now by deleting his messages all you want, but there is one black man's message you can't hold down! Yes, my sister, that black man from the hood of Nazareth spoke mighty words that can never be clicked away by the white man's keyboard. Let me just say, that nobody will be hitting "backspace" at the judgement seat, sister, nobody will be hitting "backspace" and deleting the words of the Book of Life. So that's why I still have hope, that in spite of all of this vile persecution, my article will be lead into the promised land.</p>

<p>Brother, my souce is first-hand experience living in Ethiopia. Twelve years of my life were spent in this country, and I vouch for this information. If you will not listen to the Ethiopians in regards to their own culture, who will you listen to? You want a white man to act as the authority on the black man's heritage?</p>

</ul>
<p>Try: "Jewels of Northern Africa," by J.P. Kiloma;Pages 346-349; 437; Appendix A "Pre-imperial Ethiopic Customs"</p>
<p>Also try: "They Shall Come from the East" by Brenda Holman for a brief mention of Anuzutica in a literary context (note the scene in the novel where the missionaries Miriam and James bicker with an Ethiopian envoy. They talk about "arcane riddles in which you've buried God as though he were a reeking body, to be dug up by your graverobbing sons when they ascend to power." Sounds a bit like the Anuzutica, no?). <i>(preceding comments from AOL address <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.74.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.74">64.12.116.74</a> -- <a href="../../../g/y/r/User%7EGyrofrog_366a.html" title="User:Gyrofrog">Gyrofrog</a> <a href="../../../g/y/r/User_talk%7EGyrofrog_91bf.html" title="User talk:Gyrofrog">(talk)</a> 04:43, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC))</i></p>
