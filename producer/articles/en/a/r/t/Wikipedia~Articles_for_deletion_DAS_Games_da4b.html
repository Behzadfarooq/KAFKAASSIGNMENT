<p>I've proposed this article for deletion since it appears to be promotional material from an account whose sole purpose is to promote this website. Until a few hours ago, the article's sole contributor was a user coincidentally named "DASGames". This user has no other edits. "DASGames" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DAS_Games&amp;diff=67384053&amp;oldid=67383937" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DAS_Games&amp;diff=67384053&amp;oldid=67383937" rel="nofollow">deleted</a> the {{prod}} tag shortly after I added it, and again later on, both times without discussion.</p>
<p>It's since been edited by anonymous IPs whose recent edits only have to do with the site in question, and one or two by what may be a sockpuppet account.</p>
<p>I expect the {{afd}} tag on the page to be deleted without discussion, just as the prod tags were. But he'll be unable to erase this page. --<a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr._Billion_29e9.html" title="User:Mr. Billion">Mr. Billion</a> 18:37, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep,</b> I'm sorry, I am new to Wikipedia, and I did not know how to explain myself. Yes, I am the owner of DAS Games... but I did not create the page to promote my site. I made the page so new members of my site, and anyone interested, can see the history of it, and edit it as new events happen. Those accounts were not sockpuppets, but members of my forums trying to contribute to the site's page. I did mostly all of the page myself, yes, but I just laid down the basics. I'm now leaving it up to however wants to in the future to edit and improve on it.</li>

Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">discourages</a> people writing about themselves or their own creations, but it is not forbidden. In any case, the article seems to be reasonably <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a>, which is one of our most important goals. I'd say the biggest problem about keeping this article is that DAS Games is not notable under our <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">standard for web sites</a>. I suspect this is what the nominator meant by the article being "promotional", though perhaps it could have been phrased in a less confrontational manner.--<a href="../../../k/c/h/User%7EKchase02_67a4.html" title="User:Kchase02">Kchase</a> <a href="../../../k/c/h/User_talk%7EKchase02_8fbf.html" title="User talk:Kchase02">T</a> 11:23, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> They were mentioned on G4 which is basically the top of gaming news commercially. If they can prove other sites they have been used as sources for that would further support it. I would remove the evolution of the page and list of editors etc as its very self promoting and doesnt speak about the content or stories the site has broke or other major sites that use or have used DAS Gaming for sources. Agreements or hosting etc for Nintendo or major companies would also help establish notoriety. I would give it time to grow some more. But based on the G4 and Joystiq, both major sites I think it should be kept. --<span style="font-family: Monotype Corsiva; font-size: 11pt"><a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZer0faults_ee8f.html" title="User:Zer0faults"><font color="red"><b>zero faults</b></font></a></span> <a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZer0faults_Archive_1_83a5.html#Signature" title="User talk:Zer0faults/Archive 1"><i><font color="blue"><sup><b>|sockpuppets|</b></sup></font></i></a> 12:08, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Being featured on <i>Attack of the Show</i> is impressive, as is the long list of (I assume; could easily be wrong) independent contributors. The article could stand to be improved — while its author has clearly done his best (well done), it's still quite evident that the site's creator was heavily involved in the article just from reading it — however, I don't see a good reason to delete it. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">befuddle me!</a>) 12:30, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

They have a "MySpace Girl of the Week" contest every week- does this mean that those three girls are all notable enough to be on WP? No. I love <i>AotS</i>, but a program on a not-particularly-popular cable/sattelite channel is merely one reference, and I wouldn't even call that reference point a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<li>I'll say it again, I did not make a Wikipedia page to promote my site. I didn't even think that being mentioned on AOTS was that big of a deal, it was just a piece of the web site's history worth mentioning, in my opinion.

<li><b>Comment</b> DAS - an admin will come through in a few days, review the arguments and decide which side has the stronger case, and make the decision from there (either keep, delete, or no consensus, which defaults to keep). As far as content and style goes, your article is ok for a starting point, and that's not really the issue here. The real difference beteen DAS Games and <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoosh.html" title="Smoosh">Smoosh</a> is the significant media coverage Smoosh has received, as evidenced on that page.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Although I'm usually skeptical of website owners creating wikipedia articles about their own products, it really doesn't <i>look</i> like a vanity article. Could use quite a bit of cleanup, but it talks about the site from a NPOV and the creator is obviously working in good faith. Still, notability is a concern, and wikipedia is admittedly not a web directory. On the fence, I guess, but why not? Note to Daylon - as ColourBurst mentioned, if all you want is the wiki software and you can host the site yourself, it is freely available. It would probably be a better option for you anyways, since you've stated that you intended the article to primarily be for your users. JoshWook 20:36, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
