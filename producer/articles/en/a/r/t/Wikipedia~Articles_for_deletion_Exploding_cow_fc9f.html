<p>"Exploding Cows" does not even seem to be a real issue and does not even seem to rise to the level of an urban myth. It seems as if this article was put up along with all the other animals. The subject just seems to be complete nonsense. ---Gothere 14:28, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If Dave Barry writes of exploding cows, then this topic does indeed serve a purpose. It becomes an anchor point for those who seek to research his works of comedy and parody. If we start deleting topics simply because someone thinks they are "pointless", then soon it cud lead Wikipedia into udder chaos. I say this: Let the exploding cow remain! (And if we attemtped to create an entry for every joke Mr. Barry comes up with, we would need to add at least 7 additional entries!&#160;;) --Pirateboy 08:56, 27-September 2006 (PDT) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by PirateBoy (<a href="../../../p/i/r/User_talk%7EPirateBoy_e0c4.html" title="User talk:PirateBoy">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PirateBoy_e11c.html" title="Special:Contributions/PirateBoy">contribs</a>) 2006-09-27 15:59:59 (UTC)</small></li>
<li>This is a valid article and should be retained. Exploding cows are a routine event, although not widely reported. This should really be left well enough alone. In fact, more research needs to be done into the subject of exploding cows and the wikipedia entry could even be expanded more broadly. --rbenjamin 27-Sept 2006 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.32.227.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.32.227.90_8091.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.32.227.90">contribs</a>) 2006-09-27 16:07:53 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article does no harm. It's not hurting the site or anyone who uses it. If you believe it to be nonsense, just ignore it and be on your way instead of insisting on taking it down, for which there is no valid reason anyway.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If an article is nonsense, then there is no reason to keep it. Leaving bad articles in the encyclopedia undermines its (admittedly already poor) credibility. If the encyclopedia knowingly includes nonsense, then it is a nonsense encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/j/c/User%7EDjcartwright_74e5.html" title="User:Djcartwright">Djcartwright</a> 20:32, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If we let individual's opinions decide which articles remain and which are deleted, Wiki would be in chaos, at least what would be left of it. I saw people arguing that a page on some aspect of physics (the specific one eludes my memory) needed to be taken down because it was "irrelevent."
<p>To those who consider this to be inappropriate, obscene, disgusting smut, let me remind you that many of Wiki's most viewed pages are lists of porn stars. This article is much more appropriate than any of those, yet this is the one that gets marked for deletion. This article also serves more of a purpose. It may just save some farmer's life by, say, teaching him not to light up a cigarette next to a cow that has just flatulated.71.100.4.176 19:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Retention should be automatic when the reason for deletion is it's "unencyclopedic". We don't need the userbox wars to carry over to other articles.

<li>Keep - Googles shows over a million hits for "Exploding cows". At a minimum it warrants a page for the extent of the urban myth developed around it. I agree a cross-reference to Dave Barry would be appropriate.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If we could just cite a reputable source for the composition of cow fart, there shouldn't even be an argument about whether or not to keep this article. It would be a definite keeper! Knowing the composition of cow fart is very interesting stuff.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I note that the following guideline on Wikipedia's page regarding article deletion, and specifically under the heading of what <b>not</b> to delete: "Articles we are not interested in -- some topics are of interest only to some people, but since Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, articles that interest some people should be kept." Exploding cow is part of American culture, as are the familiar topics of most widely syndicated or published humorists and social commentators. Not because of Dave Barry per se, but because of the result wrought upon our culture, the article should stay. 68.160.254.170 23:02, 27 September 2006 (UTC) Avon</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. No references or any other indication that this is a genuine practice.

<li><b>Comment</b> It has a reference now. And I should point out that whether or not it is an urban myth is irrelevent. Wiki still has an article on "sasquatch." Why don't you go try to kill that article? Just think of this article as describing an urban myth instead of trying to prove it. And as a previous user already pointed out, just because some individuals don't like an article, doesn't mean it should be deleted; this is even in Wiki's official policy. It does you no harm, and I don't see why any of you should actually care enough to fight so vehemently for its deletion.71.100.4.176 02:07, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Not one that's to the point. We all know that cows produce lots of methane; the question is do they explode if you light their farts? Your reference says no.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> As I have previously said, there are many Wiki articles about things whose reality is in question or already disproved. The fact is that even if the exploding cow myth is not true, it has still had a very tangible influence in pop culture, as evidence by the article's list of media in which it has appeared.</li>

<li><b>VERY strong vote for keep</b> Because I agree with EyeMD, Stev0 and the anonymous person who posted at 02:07, 28 September 2006. This article should stay, if only to dispel a (possible) myth surrounding bovine flatulence. It may not be as serious an issue as, say, cardiovascular surgery or 19th-century Russian literature, but it's a quite valid one nonetheless. Wikipedia exists to answer questions. If we don't keep this article, that's one less answer we can provide.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Widespread? It has a mere 875 google hits for exploding cow and 635 for exploding cows <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Exploding+cow%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Exploding+cow%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=lr%3D" rel="nofollow">[5]</a><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Exploding+cows%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Exploding+cows%22+-wikipedia&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. For an Internet fad, that's pathetic. This is an order of magnitude less important than even obscure anime.--<a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 19:07, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would also vote to keep this entry. Some of the beauty of Wikipedia is that there are articles on Shakespeare and articles on exploding cows.71.232.158.231 01:40, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
