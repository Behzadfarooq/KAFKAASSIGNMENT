<p>This was my independent study as an undergraduate. Figured wikipedia might want it. Alot of the paper refers to diagrams. If you want the actual picture files, e-mail me at mobley@alumni.fandm.edu. The actual concept that this article deals with goes by many names. "Whispering Gallery Modes" Is just one. It might not be the best subject line for the article. This all deals with highly theoretical optical physics. If after reading the article, you decide on a better subject line, please change it.</p>

<p>Robert Williams Hughes was a Virginia lawyer, a Civil War soldier, a Richmond newspaperman, and a federal judge. He was a member of an old Virginia family, whose ancestors included a Huguenot who established the Hughes Plantation in the area of Powhatan County, Virginia, before 1700. Hughes married the adopted daughter of Virginia Governor John B. Floyd. He was the editor of a Richmond newpaper before and after the Civil War, during which he served as a soldier for the Confederacy. In his public career, he went from fervent secessionist to moderate Republican, and became a favorite of President U.S. Grant, who appointed him as U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia and as U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia. Hughes' politican transformation led his former friends to call him "worse than a carpetbagger" and a "Judas." In 1869, Hughes fought a duel with a rival newspaperman, wounding his opponent. In 1873, Hughes ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for Governor of Virginia, losing to former Confederal general James L. Kemper. Hughes served as federal judge in Norfolk from 1874-1898. In 1875, he spoke at the commencement exercises of Booker T. Washington's Hampton Institute, and declared that it was gratifying for him to lay to rest the old belief that one race was inferior to another. He received an honorary doctorate of laws from the College of William &amp; Mary in 1881. He died in 1901 and was buried in the Sinking Springs Cemetery at Abingdon, Virginia.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-08_96a0.html" title="Edit section: [Phlaberstat]">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">[Phlaberstat]</span></h2>
<p>The once seemingly ubiquitous phlaberstat, when used correctly and with adroit dexterity, was used to remove wax and resin sealed boodlekin lids. The ingenious device was of great necessity in the early colonization, of the provinces. In fact, the phlaberstat was oft times exported being indigenous to only a few Canadian enclaves. This made for a thriving though short lived financial boom, to a finite number, of adroit artisans. The last recorded use of the phlaberstat was in February 1898, by the widow Mrs. Humphrey Popnecker, this being recorded, in the town minutes; of Leftovershoe, SK. The abrupt explosion and resultant stupefaction brought upon by the sudden releasing of so noxious and fetid a concoction demanded an inquiry, into boodlekin health issues. Apparently, the widow had inadvertently wielded her phlaberstat upon a long orphaned and forgotten container of boodlekin that had been misplaced, for decades. The closed casket funeral attested to the force used to seal boodlekin tins. The multitude attended, from miles around, corroborating Mrs. Popnecker’s notorious departure. Alas, the decline soon after in boodlekin favour dictated the demise, of this once noble tool. Now a sought after collector’s item it is an antique that makes for an unique wall ornament. It will always get the conversation started at any staid gathering.</p>

<p>stage blood is anything used as a substitute for blood in a theatrical or cinematic performance. there are many reasons for substituting real blood, such as ethical and sanitary concerns, concerns for the emotional well being of the actors, and because real blood is just gross.</p>
<p>there are many formulas for fake blood. While ketchup is probably the most widely used form of stage blood, and can work in a pinch, it usualy isnt very convincing, and can be expensive in mass quantities. perhaps the most common professional recipie consists of flour, water, corn syrup, and food coloring.</p>

<p>'<i>Bold text'</i><b>Bold text</b>INTERNATIONAL STATES PALIAMENT FOR SAFETY AND PEACE Intergovermental Organization of the States Via Marchese di Roccaforte, 10 - Sicily, 90145 Palermo ITALY</p>
<p><br />
The International States Parliament for Safety and Peace (ISPSP) was founded December 15, 1975 by a letter of the Constitution of the International Legislative Assembly. It was juridical recognized by the International Law and the first nations to recognize it were the United States and Italy. It is parallel to the United Nations and, like the United Nations, has representative ambassadors from all nations. The headquarters of the ISPSP is in Italy. The Lord President of the Parliament is the Archbishop Viktor Busa, President of the Council of the States. The International First Vice President of the ISPSP is Dr. Hugo Chavez Frias, President of the Republic of Venezuela. Mgr. Viktor Busa is an activist devoted to the cause of peace, defense of life, and human rights. He has been in the struggle for the cause for 25 years without a break, since the creation of the ISPSP. His visionary dream for peace in the world and respect for human beings makes his life really remarkable. Two years after the creation of the ISPSP, his partner and co-founder of the ISPSP and its first General Secretary, Monsignor Makarios III, died. Mgr. Viktor Busa went ahead alone, as the chair of the ISPSP, until Dr. Sypros Kyprianou (then new President of the Republic of Cipro) was elected Vice President International of lSPSP. Working together with his new partner, he created the Assembly of the Parliament, and in 1977, signed a convention with President Rodrigo Carazo, at the University of Peace of the United Nations, in Costa Rica. After looking for the concurrence of all of the nations in the world, through their representative governments, the Parliament counts with 400 senators, 800 deputies, ambassadors and ministers, who contribute, like their President and General Secretary, with their volunteer work, to the cause of peace. The work of the delegates and ministers of the ISPSP towards peace and enforcement of the respect for life and human rights includes rendering help and support to all of the people of the world, observing the right of safety and peace in alI aspects: moral, political, diplomatic, cultural, religious, economic and social. This is free to the governments. ISPSP organizes commissions to send to the country in need, with the participation Ambassadors and ministers and parliamentary diplomats, who travel in order to resolve conflicts and help to re-establish security and peace. Following the re-establishment of safety and peace, Lord Viktor Busa gives, as incentive, Peace Trophies to the head of the places or countries where the commission worked. The work of the Diplomatic agents of the ISPSP is paying off with good results in many places. Once a year, there is a congress of the ISPSP, where Delegates present their reports. Victorious interventions have been worked out and reported from the Diplomatic Crisis between Turkey and Cyprus&#160;; the Peruvian republic,crisis between Somalia and Ethiopia; between Iran and Iraq, Ecuador and Peru, and the conflict in Uganda. The ISPSP also has made a contribution of diplomatic intervention in wars of several countries and places, as in the Middle East, in the civil war in Sri Lanka, in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, in Rwanda, Congo, Angola and Mozambique. There are diplomats from the ISPSP working in South Africa, Moldavia, Russia and Chechnya. In support of the United Nations, Lord Busa and the ISPSP have participated in the Conferences of Addis, Ababa and Vienna. As observers, the ISPSP has sent parliamentarians to the general elections En Congo. The democratization of the Republic of Congo started in 1990. In this process, Lord Viktor Busa cooperated with the Congolese government in order to give the people assurance of security and to admit the need for immediate peace. ISPSP organized a local sub-division with several Congolese members of different categories, notable jurists, high functionaries, ministries, etc. to negotiate peace with aggressors from the borders of DRC. When the aggression intensified, Lord Busa himself organized a series of international conferences, in order to gather international support. This contributed to the acceleration of the United Nation's resolution in sending in the "blue helmets" and in assisting in the reconstruction of the nation. There are evidences of recognition of the authorities of several countries, who send to Lord Busa their letters, memoranda, and other tokens of their gratitude for the Parliament services. In 1985, Lord Viktor Busa personally got involved with the creation of the World Organization of the Indigenous and Aborigines Peoples. There are several ministers of the ISPSP working now at the front of the Andean Movement for re-culture of the Inca countries. The movement started in Arequipa, Peru and in Cusco, where several ISPSP r diplomats are working directly with the Inca natives in order to achieve a new interpretation of the past history of Perù, .</p>

<p>And is staffed only by an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>, the KCW began to slow down, between people losing intrest and personal problem with the wrestlers, Trask finally called it quits and closed the KCW down, much to the dismay of loyal wrestlers.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>, Trask decided to do the thing he loved to again, he reopened the KCW. Though his most loyal wrestlers would stick behind him, the others just resent him. Since over half of his old wrestlers turned their backs on him, Trask decided to give this reborn fed a new name, thus became, the ECWNET. Despite many beliefs, the "ECW" in dosen't stand for <a href="../../../e/x/t/Extreme_Championship_Wrestling_ced8.html" title="Extreme Championship Wrestling">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a>, but for extremly chaotic wrestling-new era of trampoline. In this new independent fed, a trampoline is used instead of a ring, because of the move options.</p>
<p>Fired up and ready to go, Trask waits for the reopening of the ECWNET in <a href="../../../a/p/r/April.html" title="April">April</a> of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>, where he will be main eventing the return show in a <a href="../../../c/a/s/Casket_match.html" title="Casket match">casket match</a> against Artimus.</p>

<p>Behind that name 'Musicom' stands three professional studio boffins and composers: Ernst W.Meinrath, Pierre Mussche and Renaud Charlier.</p>
<p>They met in 1989 and began crafting tracks of electronic ambience and atmospheric, orchestral pop, as soundtracks for adverts and films: Musicom was born.</p>
<p>After years of working for various fashion designers (Walter Van Beirendonck, Antwerp Academy, Olivier Strelli,…), special events directors (Dirk Decloedt, Franco Dragone, Luc Petit,..), film directors and producers, they struck up a relationship with cult film director Olivier Vanhoofstadt, and wrote some tracks in conjunction with the making of three of his films - Keo, Snuff Movie, and action thriller Parabellum. 'Face Down', the composition that appeared on Parabellum, crossed over onto European radio stations, and then made its way across to British record companies as part of a project tape. They signed with famous London-based record label One Little Indian, under the name Airlock.</p>
<p>The connection between them and films was kept alive with their work on Roman Coppola’s the 'Making of' of CQ. Furthermore, many of their tracks were used in films and series such as 'CSI', 'CSI Miami', 'As If', 'Model Behaviour', '5 go dating', and more. They recently completed original soundtracks for 'Personal Spectator' by Emmanuel Jespers (Fox Searchlight), 'Long Journey Home' by Celine Desauvage (Miramax) and 'The Room' directed by Giles Daoust (Title Films).</p>
<p>Musicom has also gained enviable reputation with advertising campaigns – national and international - such as Renault Scenic, Audi A6, Daïkin, Pioneer, ….</p>

<p>A bagel injury is a term used in medical jargon for an accidental cut suffered from using one's own hand to hold a piece of food (possibly a bagel) while holding a knife in the other to cut the food item. The suffer of the affliction slips and misses, and produces a cut between the thumb and index finger commonly referred to in emergency rooms and doctors offices as a "bagel injury". This can also refer to a similar cut or injury in the same area, produced by other means, but appearing the same.</p>

<p>Suilumbian was a term invented by a group of grade six students in the year 2003. One individual, whose name will not be revealed, has parents of Columbian Sri Lankan backgrounds. Therefore, fellow classmates including Adam Wang, deemed it necessary to categorize this person and his/her brother/sister into a culture of his/her own. Other proposals included Calunka and Cuilumbian- but the best sounding name was Suilumbian. Therefore, this person was deemed to have originated from the country of "Suilumbia."</p>

<p>Porn as defined in the dictionary: "Quote" : Sexually explicit material: films, magazines, writings, photographs, or other materials that are sexually explicit and intended to cause <b>sexual arousal</b></p>
<p>Sexual images industry: The production or sale of sexually explicit films, magazines, or other materials. Industry: The people or companies engaged in a particular kind of commercial enterprise. Censorship: Counterintelligence achieved by banning or deleting any information.</p>
<p>Facts about the secret side of Porn Addiction:</p>
<p>Husbands are now staying home instead of roaming the streets for illicit sex. This is surely a good thing in all aspects. Husbands and men do not bring foriegn STDs home to their wives or girlfriend respectively. Staistics indicate that some countries with high internet coverage have lower HIV and STD rates. Countries with lower access to porn material like some places in Africa, AIDS rates are very high. Something to think about you bet. Looking at sexual images usually cause sexual arousal and which can lead to masterbation. Is masterbation harmful? Yes and No. Sexual release is healthy. However, ejaculation for most men means that your sexual nature is suddenly reduced. Therefore, the urge to have sex with the wife later is quite unlikely. In this respect, masterbation is a 'sex with the wife tonite killer' Most wives who naturally love sex will find this very offensive. Wives who are frigid and who don't care much for sex will not notice a thing. Most wives usually put sex on the back burner, while for most men sex is always on the front burner.</p>
<p>The free avalability of sexual images on the internet is causing a problem for entities that use to make billions from this garbage.</p>
<p>Men use to go to the mall or such areas to to see the scantily dressed ladies as they proudly show off their beautiful figures and forms. But, something strange is happening. Women are becoming very conservative. They are covering up more and more and some are getting too fat and unattractive. So, going to the mall is not a favorite passtime for watching the ladies anymore, unless you are a addicted to shopping.</p>
<p>There are cities and towns where a man will never get to meet or see a scantily dressed woman. Especially, in climates where the temperatures are very cold. Being lonely and feeling cold is a lethal combination. Picture a man sitting around his computer surfing the Net watching naked women of every description with something warm to drink and listening to some nice music. Now, let me ask who would want to be on a cold lonely road or in a typically hostile envronment of a bar.</p>
<p>I am yet to hear of a man going blind or dying from looking at naked women on the internet.</p>
<p>The government has the power to censor porn. Why don't they?. They won't because they know that porn is no more harmful than having too much sex with the over sexed wifey. As a matter of fact having too much sex with the wife can be very exhausting if not harmful.</p>
<p>Porn addition is real if time is not allocated properly for other things in your life.</p>
<p>Porn is here and it will never go away. If every man had a plasant, beautiful loving woman to meet his sexaul needs, porn would go away. Porn is like a fantasy that some men resort to hoping to see that woman he could never ever see in a life time. By the way, when you see a sexual picture you don't care to see it again, but at the same time you want to keep the picture so that you will have the opportunity to see it again if you ever wanted to see it again. Very odd.</p>

<p>'The Wrong Man' is a play that is dark, political, violent, and not without occasional humour, which exposes us to the complexities and humanity of those engaged in politically motivated violence in Northern Ireland. The play, based in Belfast in the mid 1980’s, a time of unrelentless violence and a time for little optimism, centres on the activities of an IRA unit that is engaged in a ‘war’ on Britain. After a series of failed attacks on British Army and Police and arrests of ‘volunteers’ there is suspicions that an informer is active in the ranks of the IRA unit, and this suspicion falls on Todd Malone. The play is excellent in its portrayal of the ‘inside’ of the workings of the IRA and in his review of the play Michael Portillo said, "I rate it a clear success." It was "skilfully constructed" and Portillo particularly admired the "powerful" first and last scenes. *</p>
<p>In no way promoting, justifying or even sympathetic to the IRA, Morrison, (who coined the phrase explaining the Republican Movements Ballot Box and Armalite strategy, and has admitted being in the IRA) gives us a unique insight into the workings of the IRA, the cold callous nature of war, and also the humanitarian side, of people caught up in the romantic ideology of war. Well performed by a young cast, most of who are originally from Northern Ireland the play leaves one wondering ‘have they really got the wrong man?’</p>
<p>In the current climate of informers and agent provocateurs being exposed such as Denis Donaldson, and allegations made against Freddie Scappaticci as the agent ‘Stakeknife’ this play offers more than an educational insight into a side of Northern Ireland politics that many would prefer to be left unexposed.</p>
<p>The play has been widely acclaimed and has seen performances in London, Dublin, Belfast and Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Frequency Analysers: - Frequency analysers are major tool for noise source identification and enables designers to take noise control measures. Frequency spectrum of noise is closely related to the origins of noise production based on this principle frequency analysers split the frequency range in to a set of octave bands having the following standardised centre frequencies: 31.5, 63, 125, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k and 16k (Hz). For, serious noise control investigations, narrow band frequency analysers are required.

<p>Jim Lopp worked first at Eastman Dillion &amp; Co which then merged with Blyth &amp; Co (circa 1970) to create Blyth Eastman Dillon. Lopp worked at East Dillon, then Blytrh Eastman 1968-1977.</p>
<p>The two firms were both leaders in municipal or public finance investment banking; and when combined lead in almost every category for the following 15 years (leading in cateogries - airports, hospitals housing authorities and esp Lopp's specialy industrial development bonds (IDBs) and pollution control bonds).</p>
<p>Beginning with a larger issue with US Steel for $100 million IDB deal for entire plant in 1968, Lopp lead and founded the use of IDBs across the entire USA. He met Bob Kutak at an airport who was the founding partner of leading Omaha (and national) law firm Kutak Rock who teamed up with Lopp to work in this area.</p>
<p>After that first IDB deal in 1968, Kutak and Blyth Eastman Dillion worked together to obtian passage of IDB legislation in all 50 states. and so founded this business nationally.</p>
<p>Later they revised these statutes in all 50 states to include financing for pollution control devices and so also led this form o f financing nationally. The firm Blyth Eastmand was alsoways the leading firm in this category of muncipal onds every year from 1970-1985 and onward with largest competitors Goldman Sachs, First Boston, and Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Lopp left Blyth Eastman Dillon in 1977 to join EF Hutton where he became head of Corporate Finance and remained 1977-circa 1988. And left to head the financial guarantee company he founded for real estate projects -- see below.</p>

<p>Financial guarantee companies have AAA ratings and so obtain far lower interest rates on bond offerings they guarantee. Jim Lopp was one of the founders of this new industry.</p>
<p>And during this larger work on IDBs and pollution control bonds, Lopp also circa 1974 proposed and founded the MBIA (Muncicipal Bond Insurance Assoc) financial guarantee company which guarantees issuance of bond issues, esp municipal bond issues. MBIA has grown to be a leader in this new category of companywhich was created by Lopp and has since that creation in 1974, guaranteed 10s of billions in new bond issues. (other companies in this area are AMBAC (1971), FGIC, CapMac, etc)</p>
<p>MBIA has grown and expanded globally to insure bonds not only of municipal entities but also of banks; and in other areas as structured finance and securitization guarantees (as insuring / guaranteeing bond, notes backed by credit card, mortgage debt pools). See link below.</p>
<p>Later, approx 1984, Lopp also founded another financial guarantee company mainly to guarantee real estate porojects and other areas named ....</p>

<p>A theory first proposed by the Russian Dr.S.Lunskaya in 1972, that humans were actually created as the result of Aliens copulating with Monkeys thousands upon thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>The basis of this theory is studies of the Bible and other ancient religious manuscripts with the idea that the stories of angels coming down from the skies are actually descriptions of aliens and their space crafts.</p>
<p>More of an expansion on the theory as put forward by Erich von Däniken who wrote the Chariots_of_the_Gods</p>

<div class="dablink"><i>For other uses, see <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leap_of_Faith_9194.html" title="Leap of Faith">Leap of Faith</a>.</i></div>
<p>A <b>leap of faith</b> is the act of believing in something without, or in spite of, available <a href="../../../e/m/p/Empirical_evidence.html" title="Empirical evidence">empirical evidence</a>. It is an act commonly associated with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_belief.html" title="Religious belief">religious belief</a> as many <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religions</a> consider <a href="../../../f/a/i/Faith.html" title="Faith">faith</a> to be an essential element of <a href="../../../p/i/e/Piety.html" title="Piety">piety</a>. This association is disputed by those with <a href="../../../d/e/i/Deism.html" title="Deism">deistic</a> principles.</p>
<p>The implication of taking a <i>leap of faith</i> can, depending on the context, carry positive or negative connotations as some feel it is a virtue to be able to believe in something without concrete proof, while others feel it is foolishness. It is a hotly contested <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theological.html" title="Theological">theological</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophical.html" title="Philosophical">philosophical</a> concept.</p>
<p>This phrase is thought by many to have been coined by <a href="../../../s/%C3%B8/r/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard_528b.html" title="Søren Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a>, who is commonly caricatured as believing that the only way to accept genuine Christianity is through a leap of faith, which occurs through complete understanding that one's faith is independent of reason or evidence. Kierkegaard experts who have analyzed his authorship in Danish indicate that he does not use the Danish phrase which would translate into English as "leap of faith" anywhere in his writings. The association of the phrase with him seems to be an urban myth created by 20th century commentators on Kierkegaard who overlaid his work with a thick layer of their own biases and anxieties.</p>
<p><a href="../../../c/2E/s/C.S._Lewis_c0e9.html" title="C.S. Lewis">C.S. Lewis</a> argued that <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supernaturalism.html" title="Supernaturalism">supernaturalism</a>, a basic tenet of Christianity, can be inferred based on a <a href="../../../t/e/l/Teleological.html" title="Teleological">teleological</a> argument regarding the source of human reason, and thus no leap of faith is required.</p>
<p>There are many actions taken by people that are called "leaps of faith" either directly or in hindsight. An example of this theme in literature is shown in the <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odyssey.html" title="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>, when <a href="../../../o/d/y/Odysseus.html" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> must choose to abandon his raft and leap into the sea or face certain death from the wrath of <a href="../../../p/o/s/Poseidon.html" title="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>.</p>

<p><i>Dyacopterus spadiceus</i> (Thomas, 1890). The dayak fruit bat. Distribution.- D. spadiceus is considered very rare fruit bat species in Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo and none in Thailand. The species were netted in four sites at Poring, Kubah, Kota Samarahan and Pontianak all on Borneo. The specimens, MTA96268 and MTA96269 that were held at Universiti Tanjungpura, are the first record for this distinctive species in Kalimantan Barat, Indonesian Borneo. Specimens UMS0010, MTA96237, and MTA96238 from Sarawak and MTA96208 from Sabah are new additional records for the species in the sampling areas. These new sites have extended the range of D. spadiceus to the western and southern parts of Borneo.</p>
<p>Previous distribution records includes Selangor and Negeri Sembilan in Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra; Sepilok and Baturong Caves in Sabah; Baram and Niah areas in Sarawak (Medway 1978, Payne et al. 1985).</p>
<p>Biology and ecology.- A male and five female adults were mist-netted. Two females collected from Kalimantan Barat in Spetember 1996 were in early and late pregnancy. Both bats were caught in a mist net placed near fruiting Ficus tree in disturbed peat swamp forest. Females from Kota Samarahan and Kubah were lactating in September 1994 and August 1996 respectively. Two individuals were caught in the subcanopy (between 10 - 15 m ) by using a vertically-hoisted mist net placed in the Sungai Rayu at Kubah. The individual from Poring was caught in the emergent tree above the main canopy (&gt; 30 m from the ground level). However, the two specimens from Kalimantan Barat were taken from the ground level nets in a peat swamp forest.</p>
<p>There is no previous information on the biology and ecology for <i>D. spadiceus</i> as indicated by Medway (1978), Payne et al. (1985) and Mickleburg et al., (1992).</p>
<p>External measurements.- FA = 78.32±2.56, TL = 21.76±3.40, EL = 18.34±1.25, TB = 29.39±0.79, WT = 79.50±9.69; 4 samples. At Pontianak, Kalimantan Barat, a female was observed in an early stage of pregnancy with FA 78.33 mm and weighing 79.50 g, and another was in a late stage pregnancy had a FA 78.32 mm and weight 93.5 g. A lactating female from Kota Samarahan had a FA 80 mm and WT 80.5 g.</p>

<p><i>Chironax melanocephalus</i> (Temminck, 1825). Black-capped fruit bat. Distribution.- Seven specimens of <i>C. melanocephalus</i> were collected from the lowland forest at Kubah and Lambir, and beach forest at Samunsam, Sarawak, Borneo. The specimen that was mist-netted in Kubah National Park on 12 July 1995 was a first record for Sarawak (Abdullah et al. 1997). According to Payne et al. (1985) the distribution of C. melanocephalus in Borneo is only known from Sepilok in Sabah and Temburong in Brunei. The range includes Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and Sulawasi (Payne et al. 1985).</p>
<p>Biology and ecology.- The habitat where it was was caught was lowland mixed dipterocarp forest. Two specimens were caught in the understory of primary dipterocarp forest in Kubah National Park; one form the understory of mixed beach forest habitat in Samunsam Wildlife Sanctuary; and four from the canopy (between 15 to 30 m) of the primary dipterocarp forest in Lambir Hill National Park. These sites are new distributional records for C. melanocephalus in Sarawak and have extended the range of the species to the western part of Borneo. The bat normally roosts in small groups in tree ferns and in shallow caves (Payne et al. 1985).</p>
<p>All <i>C. melanocephalus</i> caught were adults, three males and four females. Two were in non-reproductive condition and others were in various reproductive stages. A female (MTA96041) caught on 21 May 1996 from Kubah was pregnant. In November 1996, two females caught in Lambir Hills National Park were in post-lactating condition, suggesting recent detachment or loss of juveniles. A male caught at the same site was observed to have enlarged testes. Medway (1978) recorded pregnant females in February and April in the upland area of Cameron highlands in Peninsular Malaysia.</p>
<p>External measurements.- 6 samples; FA = 44.45±1.28, TL = none, EL = 12.04±0.66, HD = 23.68±0.93(5), TB = 15.95±1.57, WT = 16.25±1.63, HB = 65.28±2.47(5), WS = 316(1), HF = 8.12±0.60(5), D5 = 57.04±2.33(5)</p>

<p>The Jewish World Review, or JWR, is a 5 day a week <a href="../../../e/-/z/E-zine.html" title="E-zine">e-zine</a> (Monday through Friday, except for legal and Jewish holidays) that features columns emphasizing the spiritual (as opposed to secular) nature of Judaism, advocating mostly politically conservative views, advice on ethics as seen through Jewish law, and lifestyle columns offering advice on finances and health.</p>

<p>Likewise, while the JWR espouses the spiritual nature of Judaism, it has no qualms about featuring the columns of conservative Christians such as <a href="../../../c/a/l/Cal_Thomas_d217.html" title="Cal Thomas">Cal Thomas</a>. It actually regards conservative Christians as its natural allies, saving its disdain for secular Jews who embrace no religion at all.</p>

<p>Matt was born in the Main Stand at Deepdale, Preston, Lancashire, on Boxing day 1975. He graduated from Bangor University in 1996 with a Bachelor's Degree in Oceanography. Shortly after graduating he and his cousin and mentor, Paul Wilder, created a small internet startup buying and selling agricultural supplies in the Stoke-On-Trent area and shipping small amounts of goods up and down the Fylde coast. The company was adsorbed by the internet giant Demon in 1999 making Matt and Paul millionaires, at least on paper, overnight. However, Matt and Paul soon lost their notional fortunes with the bursting of the internet bubble in 2000 and through a series of disasterous speculations in the property market. Paul now owns and trains racehorses from his stables based in Cootehill, County Cavan, Ireland. Matt now runs the Maelstrom LRP system from his Canary Wharf corporate headquarters.</p>

<p>Historically the name "Redon" has been used as "Rodon" to represent one of the Gods of the polytheistic ancient Illyrians. However, the name (throughout history was modernized to become "Redon"). The mythical God represented as "Redon" or "Rodon" corresponds to the "Lord of the Sea" or the "God of Water" identically as Poseidon has come to represent.</p>
<p>Redon is lesser known than "his" Greek counterpart, Poseidon, mainly because Illyrian tribes often dealth with external conquests. Secondly, written histories/folktales on the part of Illyrian tribes were less commonplace that those of the Greek City-States.</p>

<p><a href="../../../f/l/o/Florian_Pfaff_462f.html" title="Florian Pfaff">Florian Pfaff</a> Florian Pfaff (b. 1957 in Munich) is an officer in the Bundeswehr (German Military) who has become well known as a result of his <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacifist.html" title="Pacifist">pacifist</a> position.</p>
<p>After some controversial missions of the <a href="../../../b/u/n/Bundeswehr.html" title="Bundeswehr">Bundeswehr</a>, he became a pacifist and finally refused, on 20 March 2003, to participate indirectly in the Iraq war. After a week long psychiatric assessment (which was ordered on 20 March 2003) which resulted in no pathological diagnosis, he was ordered by his superior officers to stop testing whether he was participating in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Crime.html" title="Crime">crimes</a>. He refused to do this. In the end, the attempt of the leadership of the Bundeswehr to dismiss him summarily failed. On 21 June 2005, Florian Pfaff was exonorated by the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (German administrative court). His demotion which had been imposed by the Truppendienstgericht (military service senate) but which never came into effect was quashed. The state prosecutor stopped their investigation (into refusal to obey and disobedience) against him. Since then, Florian Pfaff is active in the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peace_movement.html" title="Peace movement">peace movement</a>.</p>
<p>He holds the view that the universal application of human rights and the priority of the rule of <a href="../../../l/a/w/Law.html" title="Law">law</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morality.html" title="Morality">morality</a> over power can only be achieved by non-violent and democratic means and that each and everyone must personally and consistently avoid committing crimes against this. In his opinion the first step towards peace is truth and the best method is to uncover evidence for the lies created for the purpose of making war. He is collecting and publishing (e.g. in presentations) evidence of such lies which are used to commit (or incite) politically motivated crimes. The judgement of the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (German administrative court) of 21 June 2005 has since been cited in a number of other cases and has led to the exoneration of many others who are opposed to the war in Iraq.</p>

The sporty runabouts resembled concurrent <a href="../../../h/u/d/Hudson.html" title="Hudson">Hudson</a> and <a href="../../../h/u/p/Hupmobile.html" title="Hupmobile">Hupmobile</a> models, but incorporated a creative friction-drive transmission of infinite-speed capability. Both four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines were available. Within two years the name was changed to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Petrel.html" title="Petrel">Petrel</a>, and the demise of the company in about 1913 was blamed upon cash-flow problems stemming from the over-stocking of various component parts which had been offered at discount by traveling vendors. One of its creditors was the Beaver Engine Company of Milwaukee, which took over Petrel manufacturing in an effort to recoup its investment, and the successor company to Beaver (Filer &amp; Stowell) kept a Petrel within its property for years. Another Petrel was housed within the Montague Motor Museum. === Sources === Antique Automobile 4.188.144.17 23:13, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The stone reliefs in the bulgars capital of Pliska and also in Silistra bare inscription in greek the language of the proto-bulgars. Neither of the bulgars words is turkic nor any of the names of their rulers is such. Most of the words are persian with mixture of caucasian and celtic words also. Considerable part of the proto-bulgar words are sumero-akkadian. In other words the bulgars after leaving the lands of the ugrians in the Urals came to the Caucases wher they mixed with cimmerians(sumerians) and others. In the name list(registry) of bulgarian ruler written in greek by appointment of king Asparook-founder of Bulgaria is present the name of Attila the Hun as one o of legendary bulgar rulers. His son Ernak also is on that list. After the death of Attiula in 453A.D 3 of his sons - Ernak,Ultindzur and Emnetzur setlle in present day Bulgaria as roman foederati along with their tribes. The hunnic word STRAVA meaning burial is still widely used today in Bulgaria as...ZARAVA,i.e burial. The turkish word for burial is different altogether. The were no turks in Europe nor the bulgars or huns were such. The byzantines never used the word turks to identify the bulgars but they used it to identify the magyars. Proto bulgar names for moths as...Alem,Enialem,Vechem,Vechtem,Tutom etc are not of turk origin. Words inscribed in columns in their palaces as ...Pile,Hloubram,Estrogin,Aso... are either sumerian,celtic or east persian but never turk. The first turkish alahuakbar state was that of the seljuks in the 10-11 century. Moreover todays populace of Turkey is 50% byzantine or other... and look rather european and not swarthy like the original animals that came from Asia and look...arabic. You can find them in eastern Turkey. The falsification that evrebody is turkish mean one thing...trying to find the place for this ethnos much earlier in history than it really is. On the other hand their propaganda tries to turkesize everything up to Vienna to find a way...any way to claim teritory which their army with the conventional weapons they have, can never militarily accomplish. Another bulgar tribe was that of the khazars. In the 500s A.D from the Urals a big wave of bulgars came to the Caucases to join earlier setlers-bulgars there. They were led by 3 brothers - Bulgarios,Khazarig and ?. Bulgarios with 10,000 bulgars was granted permission by emperor Mauricius to settle in todays Bulgaria as foederati of Byzantium. Khazarig and his horde stayed behind and after his death his bulgars took the name...KHAZARS. They will later found their own multi-ethnic emire - the khazarian empire. Aside from king Asparook,king Umortag in his letters to the byzantine Cinnamon will mention that"You may wanna make fun of our religion but that saame religion and our gods guided us to conquer the land of the Romans(the times of the huns)" Maybe Asparook and Umortag were kidding,right?!</p>

<p>A training wall is a coastal management structure used to retard movement of a mobile river entrance along a coastline. Training walls confine movement of the river entrance to a well defined position. Often the training walls squeeze the river flow to encourage a deeper channel that improves <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigation.html" title="Navigation">navigation</a>. A common problem for trained entrances is that the interupt sand drift along coastlines causing erosion on the downdrift side. A common solution is the construction of a sand bypass system.</p>

<p>The end of "Pratihar" rule was the beginning for Chawda dynasty. Their capital "Ahilyapatak" (Ahilyavaad" was established under new name as "New Pattan" (presently Patan). Before that during "Maitrak" period, "Chaap" dynasty (another name of chawda) ruled over "Gurjardesh". Even in "Vadhvan" "Diu" &amp; "Dwarka" there were few rulers of same dynasty. They were also known as "Chapotkat" or "Chawda".</p>
<p>In addition to this there were Chapotkat rulers in Saurashtra and Kachchh. Thus rulers of Chapotkat dynasty played an important role in the history of Gujarat, during "Maitrak" and post "Maitrak" era.</p>
<p>Gujarat attained its prosperity in political as well as cultural field in the long period from 942 A.D - 1300 A.D, during the reign of Solanki rule, who established their kingdom at "Ahilyavaad", the land of Chawda.</p>
<p>The description of Vanraj Chawda is found in the literature of Solanki dynasty. But no description of ancestors of Vanraj Chawda is found in any ancient literature. Although Jaishikhari, father of Vanraj has been described in Krishna Kavi's Hindi composition "Ratnamala" written during 17th - 18th century.</p>
<p>It is quite difficult to determine the exact beginning of Chapotkat rule in "Panchasar".</p>

<p>MLPA stands for Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification.</p>
<p>MLPA is a new, very sensitive, technique for relative quantification of up to 40 different nucleic acid sequences in a single, extremely easy to perform, reaction. Advantages: Sensitive: For MLPA analysis only 20 ng DNA or 10 ng total RNA are required. Specific: MLPA can be used to distinguish sequences differing in only one nucleotide. Reproducible: Coefficient of variability of each probe is 3% to 8 % when human DNA samples of 40-100 ng are analyzed. Simple: MLPA can be performed as a one tube reaction. MLPA is an addition-only method. High throughput: Processing of 96 samples will require less than three hours hand on time. The complete MLPA reactions can be performed in the same microtiterplate. MLPA reactions can be automated. Low cost per data point: All required reagents are included in the MLPA kits. The necessary equipment is present in most molecular biology laboratories. Several MLPA kits for specific applications are available.</p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>The <b>Duke of Britain</b> is a praedicatum that is vested in the Cymri peoples of <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> in North West <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a>, whose ancient pride is that they are <b>The Ravens of Rheged</b>: <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>, a native word that means <i>liberty, in free continuance</i>, is the only place in <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> that was not conquered by the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, which instead became a possesion of The Anglo-Saxon High King by way of a dynastic marriage in the 7th century.</p>
<p>There are many <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthurian.html" title="Arthurian">Arthurian</a> notions that surround the role of the people of <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> and the praedicatum Duke of Britain, such as the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophesy.html" title="Prophesy">prophesy</a> 'So long as there are Ravens in England's White Tower, England and its Commonwealth shall not fall'.</p>
<p>This <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophesy.html" title="Prophesy">prophesy</a> relates to the matter that despite being 'free', the Cymri of <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> cannot lawfully recover their former <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a> territories that were taken by the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> lest they commit <a href="../../../t/r/e/Treason.html" title="Treason">treason</a> of that 7th century marriage in the process; hence they are symbolically 'in the White Tower', whose other name is <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tower_of_London_2ba5.html" title="The Tower of London">The Tower of London</a>.</p>
<p>The only way that they can be 'freed from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tower_of_London_2ba5.html" title="The Tower of London">The Tower of London</a>', so to speak, is if the praedicatum Duke of Britain succeeds from The British Commonwealth.</p>
<p>And the only way that this can happens is if the English Sovereign commits <a href="../../../p/r/a/Praemunire.html" title="Praemunire">praemunire</a> - that is, 'anger against the communion of that which has gone before' - of the praedicatum Duke of Britain.</p>
<p>All of these intertwining threads are best portrayed by having a look at both the history and the passage of the praedicatum Duke of Britain, from the time when the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> left <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> in the year 410, and tracing its continuance to the present day.</p>
<p>The following history is courtesy of Haruson, a prince of Cumberland of that ilk (<a href="http://www.haruson.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haruson.com" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>), from his book <i>In Rheged we Ravens of Liberty Dwell</i>.</p>
<p><b>History of the praedicatum Duke of Britain</b></p>
<p>WHEN COEL HEN (THE OLD KING COLE OF OUR NURSERY RHYMES) took up the seat of the departing <a href="../../../d/u/x/Dux_Britanniarum_a414.html" title="Dux Britanniarum">Dux Britanniarum</a> when the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Romans</a> left <i>Priten</i> in 410 AD, <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coel_Hen_0ff6.html" title="Coel Hen">Coel Hen</a> became the duke of Rheged Priten – that is, he became the duke of <i>Liberated (or Free)</i> Britain, and assumed the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> prædicatum “Duke of Britain” in the process.</p>
<p>And where previously the seat of the Duke of Britain had been The Fortress of Camulos (<a href="../../../c/a/m/Camulos.html" title="Camulos">Camulos</a> was the ancient Briton’s God of War), as from 391 AD the official <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion.html" title="Religion">religion</a> of the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman_Empire_411e.html" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> had been <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christianity.html" title="Christianity">Christianity</a>, so when <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coel_Hen_0ff6.html" title="Coel Hen">Coel Hen</a> assumed the prædicatum Duke of Britain the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> prædicatum Fortress of Camulos was no longer its seat; in its place was <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camelot.html" title="Camelot">Camelot</a>: where the native <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> word <i>Cam</i> means <i>winding</i> or <i>crooked</i> (as exemplified by the <a href="../../../r/i/v/River_Cam_e457.html" title="River Cam">River Cam</a> that winds through the English countryside), <i>Camelot</i> became that place where all winding roads are made straight; hence <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coel_Hen_0ff6.html" title="Coel Hen">Coel Hen</a> assumed the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian.html" title="Christian">Christian</a> <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> prædicatum <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camelot.html" title="Camelot">Camelot</a> on the basis that it was already entailed to the prædicatum <b>Duke of Britain</b> from the outset of his reign.</p>
<p>And the <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> have always gone under the symbol of the <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven.html" title="Raven">Raven</a>, as the <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven.html" title="Raven">Raven</a> is symbolic of every <a href="../../../b/r/i/British.html" title="British">British</a> <a href="../../../o/r/a/Oracle.html" title="Oracle">oracle</a> of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> overcoming her enemies.</p>
<p>Indeed, upon a hill in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London.html" title="London">London</a> which is very curiously named <i>The White Hill</i>, the dying wish of an ancient warrior named Bran was that after he died his head was to be cut off and placed on the top of The White Hill facing south.</p>
<p>In <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a>, the word Bran means <i>Raven</i>, and upon that White Hill a tower was later built, called The White Tower, which also goes by another name … <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tower_of_London_2ba5.html" title="The Tower of London">The Tower of London</a> … so who has heard of the prophesy <i>So long as there are Raven’s in The Tower of London then England shall not fall!</i></p>
<p>Although this prophesy is translated that way from a native tongue, it is better translated <i>So long as there are Raven’s in England’s ‘White Tower’ then England and its commonwealth shall not fall!</i>: as one shall see, this <a href="../../../p/r/o/Prophesy.html" title="Prophesy">prophesy</a> is not about there being actual <a href="../../../r/a/v/Raven.html" title="Raven">Raven</a> birds in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Tower_of_London_2ba5.html" title="The Tower of London">The Tower of London</a>, but is all about the people of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> <i>continuing</i> to be retained as protégées of the English Crown … that is, <i>The ‘Ravens’ are in England’s ‘White Tower'!</i></p>
<p>SO IT HAPPENED, AROUND 449 AD, that the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> began their invasions of <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albion.html" title="Albion">Albion</a>, which meant that <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coel_Hen_0ff6.html" title="Coel Hen">Coel Hen</a> could no longer call himself <b>The Duke of Britain</b> on account that he no longer presided over all of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> – hence, he could no longer call his seat <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camelot.html" title="Camelot">Camelot</a>, so both prædicatums became vested in the <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> Britons – those in the contracted <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> who were awaiting that glorious day when someone who was qualified to use them could, doing so on the basis that they presided over all of Britain: that is, someone had rolled back the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> tide so that the whole of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a> was once again ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ in all of its own right!</p>
<p>Yet despite the fact that the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a> had began to advance over the land like an advancing ‘tide’, <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> itself still remained intact – that is, the land of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> itself was still unoccupied by anyone but <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> ‘and those grafted to the Briton vine’, so <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> had really only contracted in size in the face of the advancing <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> tide!</p>
<p>And although <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> has never been defeated to this day, her “continuity” into the present day is easily illustrated by considering the context that <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> was entailed to every high prince of any age since, which in itself, is helped by understanding those other names that <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> has also gone by (and ‘why’) – which <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> continues to go by (and ‘why’) – in the context of ‘who’ is referring to it, in ‘what’ language that they might be doing so, in the ‘context’ of the particular instance that they are.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH RHEGED’S HALCYON IS RECORDED BY THE BARD TALIESIN as being under the famed “Urien, Prince of the Ravens”, <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> was nevertheless later entailed to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> in 638 AD, when Princess Rhiainfelt - the <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> heiress - married Prince <a href="../../../o/s/w/Oswy.html" title="Oswy">Oswy</a> of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, who in 641 AD became the King of Northumberland in his own right and The 8th High King of (‘Anglo-Saxon’) Britain in the process.</p>
<p>Significantly, Princess Rhiainfelt is the only native <a href="../../../b/r/i/Briton.html" title="Briton">Briton</a> to have been both a “Queen” of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> and a High Queen of (‘<a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a>’) Britain – albeit that the latter was as entailed to the High King on account of being his wife.</p>
<p>The significance of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> being entailed to <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> was that in being so, its constitution was maintained, as in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>, despite being under an <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> High Prince, the people in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> continued no differently as if only under Princess Rhiainfelt, whose continuity was afforded by <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> being the protégée or benefice of the High King.</p>
<p>This status of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> being the protégée (or benefice) of the kings of Northumberland continued until the year 830 AD, when <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> submitted directly to the kings of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a> on account of the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_Wessex_2ac1.html" title="King of Wessex">King of Wessex</a> having brought the Northumbrians to his own submission at Dore in the previous year: Rheged was indeed a significant prize because in its people was vested the prædicatums <b>Duke of Britain</b> and <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camelot.html" title="Camelot">Camelot</a>, awaiting the day that they could be exercised by someone who had the right to do so.</p>
<p>So in the years 829 and 830 AD, the baton of Rheged’s benefactor was passed from the kings of <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northumberland.html" title="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> to the kings of <a href="../../../w/e/s/Wessex.html" title="Wessex">Wessex</a>, the latter in whom the line of The Crown of <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Britain_b139.html" title="Great Britain">Great Britain</a> is vested today!</p>
<p>AS A BENEFICE CAN TECHNICALLY BE DEFINED AS AN “income producing property (called a church living) held by a priest or churchman (esp a vicar or rector)” (OED), then in the sense of the prophecy <i>So long as there are Raven’s in England’s White Tower then England and its commonwealth shall not fall!</i> then ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ per se has been and is a benefice of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_of_All_England_c434.html" title="Primate of All England">Primate of All England</a> (one of the capacities of the <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archbishop_of_Canterbury_1091.html" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>), which is further expounded as on the basis that the <i>ecclesiastic</i> capacity of All England is vested in The Primate of All England (and not in The Queen who is only a layperson of the church), then unless the Primate of All England ensures that Rheged remains in it – that is, The Ravens of Rheged are in England’s White Tower (and in England <i>The White Tower upon The White Hill</i> represents the ecclesiastic authority of All England as established on earth by God, vis-à-vis The Lord’s Prayer, “Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven”: The Primate of All England can certify what is done in heaven however The Queen as a layperson of the church cannot!).</p>
<p>So <i>All England and its commonwealth shall not fall</i> so long as The Primate of All England ensures that His Benefice (Rheged) remains in England’s White Tower according to <i>Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven</i>” - as according to the prophesy if the Ravens of Rheged are lost from the (Primate of All England’s) White Tower then All England (and its commonwealth) shall fall!</p>
<p>So <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> is <i>The Benefice</i> of The Primate of All England on account that its ‘income producing’ capacity is His Grace’s ‘economy’ ~ that is, his “re-circulation” of the wealth of Rheged’s contribution to the continued security of the realm!</p>
<p>But although <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> is the Benefice of the <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primate_of_All_England_c434.html" title="Primate of All England">Primate of All England</a>, it is nevertheless still under the captaincy of its High Prince, who in this modern day is Elizabeth II. And of course if <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> is ever lost from “All England”, then both “The White Hill” and “The White Tower” shall also revert to the Ravens of Rheged, in whom they were vested so very long ago even before Bran’s severed head was put at the top of The White Hill facing south!</p>
<p>Why else would a native ‘Raven’ have his head cut off and then put on a hill facing south if it was not for the purpose of securing <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> under its legal benefactor: so in the case that <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> is lost from All England then both The White Hill and The White Tower become entailed to whatever Prince of the Ravens shall transpire to lead them as in such a case he becomes Rheged’s legal benefactor, who if ever ruling over all of Britain as it is variously dispersed worldwide (or if his heirs ever rule over all of Britain as it is variously dispersed worldwide) shall be able to presume the prædicatum Duke of Britain and call his seat <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camelot.html" title="Camelot">Camelot</a> in the process.</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH SOME SENSE OF WHAT A “PRÆDICATUM” ACTUALLY IS can be derived by merely associating the word ‘prædicatum’ with the expression “The Duke of Britain”, simply by examining the legal rights ( ~ ‘dica’) that preceded (~ ‘præ’) its very own indefeasible prospect ( ~ for example, the Duke of Britain’s ‘tum’ itself), then one can more easily understand the truth of the matter rather than relying on such “titles” that the principals of such prædicatums often create for themselves to make it easy for those who do not understand prospects of genre.</p>
<p>For example, the expression “Duke of Britain” is not a ‘title’ per se, however could actually be made one by the Duke of Britain himself, which in its most basic form is a ‘prospect’ where the incumbent (the ‘principal’ or ‘owner’) has the right to exercise the indefeasible rights of the prædicatum – such as the right of the Duke of Britain to call his seat “Camelot”, which being indefeasibly entailed to the prædicatum Duke of Britain itself yet being with its own ‘prospect of genre’, is also a ‘prædicatum’.</p>
<p>But the Duke of Britain can just as well call himself the “Dux Britanniarum”, as the Romans called the prædicatum in <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin.html" title="Latin">Latin</a>, or in any other actual translation of these words in any language: that the Duke of Britain would elevate any of these as a ‘title’ per se is vested in his prerogative to do so: for example, although the “Queen of England” has various ‘titles’ that have been created under the authority of her prædicatum, the truth of the matter is that she can also simply be called ‘Princess Elizabeth’ on the matter that “kings, queens, and princesses, are all ranks of ‘prince’”; and similarly, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, is also a princess as she is married to a prince, who may truthfully be called ‘Princess Sophie’ as in truth she is so – hence, in the generic scheme of things, Elizabeth is the High Prince of the realm!</p>
<p>So those who are interested in prædicatums are really those who are interested in getting down to the grass roots of a person’s indefeasible, heritable, ‘prospect’ – that is, the reality of ‘what’ indefeasible rights have been transmitted to them, the reality of ‘how’ such indefeasible rights actually manifest, and the reality of ‘how’ the indefeasible rights are themselves exercised.</p>
<p>Invariably, these can all be reduced to ‘instruments of language’ where the what, who, and how of a prospect is singularly called a prædicatum!</p>
<p>SIGNIFICANTLY, CURIOUSLY, AND FANTASTICALLY, by the year 945 AD <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> was being called different names, the use of which depended upon who was making the expression: the name “<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>” was being used by the native <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britons.html" title="Britons">Britons</a> in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>, the name “<a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Wales_df6e.html" title="North Wales">North Wales</a>” was being used by the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> on account that the word ‘<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>’ means ‘stranger’ (which is the Old English expression of the Greek word “Keltoi” which also means ‘stranger’ and from which the word ‘Celt’ derives); and the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh.html" title="Welsh">Welsh</a> (those in the region of modern day “<a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a>”) were starting to call their brothers in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> ‘Cymri’, on account that in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> the use of the name <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> was becoming a bit tenuous (if not tedious), in the sense that they were starting to lose hope that the people of <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> would actually roll back the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> tide as had been prophesied – hence even the ‘Cymri’ in <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> would use the very same expressions according to who was conversing with them at any point in time (and indeed, for some centuries in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wales.html" title="Wales">Wales</a> the vernacular use of the word ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ flipped to be a facetious expression of its actual meaning – the “<a href="../../../w/e/l/Welsh.html" title="Welsh">Welsh</a>” patience was running out!).</p>
<p>So as the centuries progressed, ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ became known as the Welsh/English hybrid of ‘Cumberland’ in the tongue of Westminster’s clerics, which name was acknowledged by Westminster’s clerics in 1974 AD as “<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>” (which demonstrates that the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Saxons_e82f.html" title="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxon</a> ‘tide’ is starting to roll back), on account that the name “<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>” is wholly <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> - the suffix ‘<a href="../../../i/a/_/Ia.html" title="Ia">ia</a>’ is the <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celtic.html" title="Celtic">Celtic</a> suffix for ‘land’!</p>
<p>The question of whether <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a> “is still <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>” – that is, “is still ‘Liberated’ or ‘Free’ ” - is upon whether or not <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a> was ever wholly ‘conquered’ by a prince who was other than its legal benefactor: as it was, ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ merely contracted and expanded according to the wax and wane of any particular age!</p>
<p>And in the year 945 AD King Edmund of England entailed <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and it wasn’t until 1216 AD that <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> was purchased back from Scotland (‘to wholly settle the matter’) – in the process fantastically facilitating Rheged’s complete avoidance of being included in <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>’s defeat of <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> in 1066 AD!</p>
<p>So although along the way there have been some minor ‘excursions of ill ambition’ – such as when <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunmail.html" title="Dunmail">Dunmail</a> declared himself King of Cumberland despite that <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> was lawfully entailed to <a href="../../../e/n/g/England.html" title="England">England</a> (who was killed and his two sons eyes gouged out for their treason) ~ and such as when the <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_of_England_5b1f.html" title="King of England">King of England</a> himself ravaged <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> in 1000 AD on account of regretting that his ancestor had entailed <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> to <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotland.html" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> in 945 AD ~ Rheged’s continuity into the present day from the year 410 AD when <a href="../../../c/o/e/Coel_Hen_0ff6.html" title="Coel Hen">Coel Hen</a> became the Duke of Britain has been continually maintained, whose native name is ‘<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>’ – which means ‘Liberated’ or ‘Free’ – and whether or not it is called “<a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>”, “<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>”, “<a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>”, “<a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Wales_df6e.html" title="North Wales">North Wales</a>”, even ‘Free Britain’ or ‘Liberty Britain’, the “Ravens of Rheged” can claim one thing that even the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English.html" title="English">English</a> cannot: <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rheged.html" title="Rheged">Rheged</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumbria.html" title="Cumbria">Cumbria</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/m/Cumberland.html" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Wales_df6e.html" title="North Wales">North Wales</a>, Free Britain, Liberty Britain – whatever you shall call her - remains wholly undefeated as she was not defeated by <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_the_Conqueror_976a.html" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> or anyone else.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-08_96a0.html" title="Edit section: Praedicatum">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Praedicatum</span></h2>
<p>Latin for <i>that which has been said before</i>, a praedicatum has special meaning in both Scottish and English Law.</p>
<p>In 1158 the Scottish King Malcolm III passed it into law that <i>he who had held land or heritage, for three generations, acquired an indefeasible right of property therein</i>, which, being subject to Tanist Law, <i>could be arranged to pass to one’s chosen heir, so long as one’s choice was made whilst one was still alive</i>.</p>
<p>These indefeasible objects, <i>that which has been said before</i>, became known as a <b>praedicatum</b>.</p>
<p>The English understanding of a praedicatum derives from the matter that England purchased Cumberland from Scotland in 1216, which in doing so acquired its existing princely praedicatums that were by then established in Cumberland for four generations ~ who thus became indefeasibly introduced as established in England, a matter that since the Union of the Crowns ironically compells the English King to recognise them if only for the matter that the same head that wears the crown is also the Scottish King <i>who already recognises them</i> on account of their Scottish lineage.</p>
<p>By tradition those with Germanic princely lineage were awarded the Talbot's Head in the crest of their English Coat of Arms (vis-vis The Prince Haruson's Coat of Arms <a href="http://www.haruson.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.haruson.com" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>, whose ancestor Richard The Prince Haruson arrived in Cumberland in 1056), who <i>if being established in Cumberland by way of the aforesaid Scottish route</i>, continue indefeasibly as princes of Cumberland today.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because of the similarity of the name Haruson and Harrison - the first means Golden Strength in its ninth century origin and the second means Son of Harry - in ancient times in English climes The Prince Haruson became known as Harrison of the North, which itself being in use in Cumberland for more that four generations prior to England purchasing Cumberland back from Scotland, became a praedicatum itself, <i>Harrison of the North</i> in English and <i>Haruson Y Goggledd</i> in Cumbric (a dialect of Welsh).</p>
<p>This illustrates that several praedicatums can be used to identify a single praedicatum (for example, the expressions <i>Haruson a prince of Cumberland of that ilk</i>, <i>Haruson Y Goggledd</i>, and <i>H.R.G. The Prince Haruson</i>, all identify the Haruson praedicatum, which in essence means that they are not so much titles but are instead <i>indefeasible natural language expressions of a person's heritage</i>.</p>

<p>Fringe theatres in London are known throughout the world, many of them established for decades and some reciving public funding. The Fringe Theatre Network (FTN) was founded in 1986 when London fringe venues felt the need for an organisation to support and represent them. FTN was registered as a charity in 1987. FTN exists to support and promote fringe theatre in London in a variety of ways. It provides services, support and a network of contacts for venues, producing companies and individuals working on the Fringe. As an 'umbrella' organisation it can act and speak on behalf of its members to statutory authorities, funding bodies, policy makers and other arts organisations.</p>
<p><br />
FTN is financed predominantly by members' subscriptions for its regular services with additional income for specific projects and capital expenditure depending on successful fundraising. FTN is run by one part-time Co-ordinator who is responsible to the Board of Trustees. FTN promotes its venues to theatre companies and the public, running a free publicity material distribution service every fortnight to around thirty venues within London. FTN acts as a database of information relevant to running a Fringe venue or producing Fringe theatre. One aspect of this has resulted in the Fringe Trade Directory, available free to members and on sale to non-members, which lists recommended suppliers and services needed to produce theatre in London - from costumes to graphic design, from lights to rehearsal spaces, all with the budgets of the Fringe in mind.</p>

<p>Motherprole is a term invented by Bancroft School Students on a skiing trip to Serre Chavalier in France. Motherprole has become a common saying among year 9 pupils and may well become a famous saying around the U.K as this saying has been reported in other schools in the Essex area. The reasoning behind the word "Motherprole" remains a closely-guarded secret.</p>
<p>Grammar Note:</p>
<p>Prole may be adapted to any context that the speaker feels the word desrves. The replaced word may or may not be similar to the word "prole". Here are some examples:</p>
<p>1.Shut the "Prole" up. 2.I thought "Proles" were straight. 3.Get the "Prole" away from me.</p>
<p>As of yet, this is not recognised by the English dictionary but we hope to change this!</p>

<p>The internet has given birth to new markets, a plethora of ways for companies to make money totally online. It sometimes comes as a shock to me that I can make money in something this is totally virtual.</p>
<p>A new service that is being offered to webmasters nowadays is something referred to as "paid forum posting". If you know any thing about web forum communities, you will know that having one on your website if highly beneficial. The posts lead to higher web activity to your site meaning higher page ranking in search engines, and the community eventually takes a life of it's own, a place for people to exchange information and learn more about you and your products.</p>
<p>Already we have seen how people can benefit from this service. Anyone that has tried to start their own community knows the pains of finding users to write on their topic. For those looking for information, there is none to be found unless something is there, and for those that are looking for a community to join, they are more inticed if they see that the people that are already posting are passionate about the subject. This is something that can be compared to the "cool kids" syndrome you experience in elementary school, where posters only like to join clubs that seem reputable and have a following.</p>
<p>Some bigger names in the industry include <a href="http://www.forumbulge.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumbulge.com" rel="nofollow">ForumBulge</a>, <a href="http://www.inb0x.com" class="external text" title="http://www.inb0x.com" rel="nofollow">inb0x.com</a> and <a href="http://www.forumboosting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumboosting.com" rel="nofollow">forumboosting.com</a>, only a few months old, but it seems the second generation <a href="http://www.forumbooster.net" class="external text" title="http://www.forumbooster.net" rel="nofollow">forumbooster.net</a>, <a href="http://www.forumboosting.com" class="external text" title="http://www.forumboosting.com" rel="nofollow">forumboosting.com</a> and others are the ones that are taking paid forum posting to the next level with features such as tracking the postings as they happen and other additional SEO services.</p>
<p>We are indeed moving into different commerce areas where something as simple as a web community is sprouting web ventures to help support them, and indeed there seems like there is an opportunity and demand for the service.</p>

<p>Eddie Cross was born <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish.html" title="Jewish">Jewish</a>, the son of a <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbi.html" title="Rabbi">rabbi</a>. A troubled youth, he repudiated his family and joined a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Nazi_5279.html" title="Neo-Nazi">Neo-Nazi</a> <a href="../../../g/a/n/Gang.html" title="Gang">gang</a>, hiding his Jewish roots. He had a single <a href="../../../s/w/a/Swastika.html" title="Swastika">swastika</a> tatooed on his cheek.</p>
<p>Due to a freak accident, Eddie was turned into an amorphous blob-like creature, pinkish in hue, that could engorge human beings, suffocate them, and suck the flesh off their bones, leaving their remains behind as a <a href="../../../s/k/e/Skeleton.html" title="Skeleton">skeleton</a>. Eddie was conscious and in control when in blob form, but seemed even more sadistic than he was as a human gang member. He closely resembled the movie creature <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Blob_8cfc.html" title="The Blob">The Blob</a>, except that Eddie's blob form had appearance of a face, with eyes and a motuh. Eddie's blob form had only one visibile reminder of his human form--his swastika near the eyes of his blob-form.</p>
<p>However, Eddie's blob form was not absolute. Within the large mass, his skeleton still could be vaguely seen, like a person within a large costume at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disney_World_ce48.html" title="Disney World">Disney World</a>. It turned out to be Eddie's one weakness.</p>
<p>Upon his transformation, Eddie swallowed his gang members and sucked the flesh off their bones. He then battled <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spiderman.html" title="Spiderman">Spiderman</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rocket_Racer_ce09.html" title="Rocket Racer">Rocket Racer</a>. He managed to swallow Spiderman, but before suffocating, Spiderman saw Eddie's skeleton within the blob's flesh, and, drawing on all his strength, delivered a viscious punch to the skeleton's <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaw.html" title="Jaw">jaw</a>. It knocked Eddie out cold, and his blob form coalesced onto Eddie's skeleton, rendering visible as a man once more.</p>
<p>The story seems inspired by some historical rumors that suggest (inconclusively) that <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who murdered so many <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> during <a href="../../../w/w/i/WWII_688e.html" title="WWII">WWII</a>, was actually of Jewish descent, and secretly loathed his own people. <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self-loathing.html" title="Self-loathing">Self-loathing</a> is a common <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trope.html" title="Trope">trope</a> amongst Jewish <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comedians.html" title="Comedians">comedians</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_humor.html" title="Jewish humor">Jewish humor</a>, so the rumors are often repeated for <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_comedy.html" title="Black comedy">black comedy</a>. <a href="../../../w/o/o/Woody_Allen_6fd3.html" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>, an <a href="../../../a/m/e/American.html" title="American">American</a> comedian and <a href="../../../d/i/r/Director.html" title="Director">director</a> of Jewish descent, famously used Jewish self-loathing to great effect in satirizing his fictional wife and sister in <a href="../../../d/e/c/Deconstructing_Harry_6d0b.html" title="Deconstructing Harry">Deconstructing Harry</a>.</p>
<p>The final pages of the comic have Eddie's father, the rabbi, talking with Rocket Racer and Spiderman about the evils of intolerance and hate.</p>

<p><b>OVERVIEW:</b> National Forests should satisfy both recreational activities, as well as sustainable extraction of resources.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>* MULTIPLE-USE SUSTAINED-YIELD ACT OF 1960 * *</li>
</ul>
<p>(Public Law 86–517; Approved June 12, 1960) AN ACT To authorize and direct that the national forests be managed under principles of multiple use and to produce a sustained yield of products and services, and for other purposes Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That ø16 U.S.C. 528¿ it is the policy of the Congress that the national forests are established and shall be administered for outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes. The purposes of this Act are declared to be supplemental to, but not in derogation of, the purposes for which the national forests were established as set forth in the Act of June 4, 1897 (16 U.S.C. 475). Nothing herein shall be construed as affecting the jurisdiction or responsibilities of the several States with respect to wildlife and fish on the national forests. Nothing herein shall be construed so as to affect the use of administration of the mineral resources of national forest lands or to affect the use or administration of Federal lands not within national forests. SEC. 2. ø16 U.S.C. 529¿ The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized and directed to develop and administer the renewable surface resources of the national forests for multiple use and sustained yield of the several products and services obtained therefrom. In the administration of the national forests due consideration shall be given to the relative values of the various resources in particular areas. The establishment and maintenance of areas of wilderness are consistent with the purposes and provisions of this Act. SEC. 3. ø16 U.S.C. 530¿ In the effectuation of this Act the Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to cooperate with interested State and local governmental agencies and others in the development and management of the national forests. SEC. 4. ø16 U.S.C. 531¿ As used in this Act, the following terms shall have the following meanings: (a) ‘‘Multiple use’’ means: The management of all the various renewable surface resources of the national forests so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the needs of the American people; making the most judicious use of the land for some or all of these resources or related services over areas large enough to provide sufficient latitude for periodic adjustments in use to conform to changing needs and conditions; that some land will be used for less than all of the resources; and harmonious and 10–4 Sec. 5 MULTIPLE-USE SUSTAINED-YIELD ACT OF 1960 coordinated management of the various resources, each with the other, without impairment of the productivity of the land, with consideration being given to the relative values of the various resources, and not necessarily the combination of uses that will give the greatest dollar return or the greatest unit output. (b) ‘‘Sustained yield of the several products and services’’ means the achievement and maintenance in perpetuity of a highlevel annual or regular periodic output of the various renewable resources of the national forests without impairment of the productivity of the land. SEC. 5. ø16 U.S.C. 528 note¿ This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960’’.</p>

<p>Boson stars are descendants of the so--called <a href="../../../g/e/o/Geons.html" title="Geons">geons</a> of Wheeler, except that they are built from scalar particles instead of electromagnetic fields. If scalar fields exist in nature, such localized configurations kept together by their self-generated gravitational field can form within Einstein's general relativity. In the case of complex scalar fields, an absolutely <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stable.html" title="Stable">stable</a> branch of such non-topological solitons with conserved particle number exists.</p>
<p>The present surge for such hypothetical stars stems from the speculative possibility that these compact objects could provide a considerable fraction of the non-baryonic part of <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_matter.html" title="Dark matter">dark matter</a>. In any case, they may serve as a convinient ``laboratory" for studying numerically rapidly <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotating.html" title="Rotating">rotating</a> bodies in general relativity and the generation of gravitational waves.</p>

<p>With a substantial volume of references to specifics of nautical lore from sailing yachts to river barges to nuclear attack submarines, Kilo Class represents an entertaining novel on one level. However, readers should take note in advance that the book takes an extreme nationalistic stance regarding United States foreign and military policy which may prove disconcerting to those unable to accept American political unilateralism and military interventionism.</p>

<p>Berticus is the bear who appears in the PBF cartoon, "Sgt. Grumbles". While he should be launching the counter-offensive, he is hiding in the bushes eating honey. This cartoon takes after the user "Berticus" from the GeneralMayhem forums. He is often referred to as a bear because he weighs like, 340 lbs. in real life, no shens.</p>
<p>The Berticus regime consists of a mob of unemployed alcoholics who post "BERTICUS BERTICUS BERTICUS" everywhere the username is seen. From Myspace to YTMND, WWU to UO, there is no question that this bear is the cutest and cuddliest of all internet celebrities.</p>

<p>Billy and Grim have an argument over whose life is easier, Billy's or Grim's. Mandy suggests that since each is so convinced that the other's life is easier, they exchange places for a day. Billy and Grim agree; however, at the end of the day, each is somehow transformed into the other, so that each has "truly" taken the place of the other.</p>
