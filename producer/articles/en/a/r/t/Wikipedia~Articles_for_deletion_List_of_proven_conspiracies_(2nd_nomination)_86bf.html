<p>Inherently POV listcruft. The inclusion criteria for this article are vague, and include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"an agreement between two or more natural persons to break the law (or have the law unconstitutionally changed) at some time in the future (civil conspiracy and criminal conspiracy); conspiracy in the sense of conspiracy theory; or actions undertaken in secret (and outside public legislative processes) to obtain some goal, usually understood with negative connotations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any list aiming to include any instance where two individuals conspire to break the law is going to be enormous and unmaintainable. It is hard to imagine such a list having any kind of encyclopedic value. Also, I feel that the list was created to provide some support for conspiracy theorists. Finally, the examples given in the list are very POV as an aggregate, because they come almost entirely from the US and reflect very badly on that country. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 02:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'List of people' is defined as 'lists of people within Wikipedia', so the person in question has to have an article and has to be notable.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had added 911, somebody removed it. That is an editorial issue. Inclusion is not vague, it is very specific and it is intended to be broad, broader than simply the legal act to include other notable conspiracies that are not necessarily illegal. The list ending up being big is not a problem, it has been up for a long time and has not ballooned. And the reason is simple, we only include notable people. I mean, just look at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people.html" title="List of people">List of people</a>, that is most definitely a list that is potentially bigger than a list of people who have had notable conspiracies. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 15:10, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's not vague? The criteria are being a proven conspiracy. What's considered a conspiracy? Blah blah blah blah people blah blah lots of people blah blah Nixon. When is something considered proven? When it's considered proven. So, we have a bloated definition which as a result makes no sense, and another circular definition. That's about as vague as you can get, short of "The things which are in it". -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">blah</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_User%7EAmarkov_80a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/User:Amarkov">edits</a></sub></small> 15:15, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It is a conspiracy when two or more people communicate in secret. It is proven when no notable scholar doubts that it factually happened.

<li><b>Keep</b> A highly encyclopedic topic, and some of the entries are generally accepted by historians as "proven conspiracies," such as the assassinations of Caesar and Lincoln, and the Gunpowder plot. It has some of less general acceptance, and it is proper to demand references besides other Wikipedia articles. Each conspiracy should have references to reliable sources. That is a matter for editing, not for deletion of the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> for several reasons: (1) Inherently POV. The first sentence: "This is a list OR INDEX of conspiracies considered proven to have existed or officially covered-up (and or later discovered) with or without newer evidence." Considered? By whom? The editors? Uncited sources? Putting an article on this list inherently pushes a POV on a question which is contested in virtually every imaginable example. (2) A conspiracy cannot be proven. That verb does not go with that noun. One can prove specific conspiracy theories, or specific allegations of conspiracy, or that a certain group conspired to do something. A "conspiracy" cannot be proven, however. Perhaps "List of Events Related to Proven Allegations of Conspiracy" would be correctly framed, but that title makes clear exactly how much value a list of this sort has. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColindownes_6ecd.html" title="User:Colindownes">Colindownes</a> 00:50, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> I believe that the list has been poorly maintained. I had to go into and make links to the articles, or sections of articles, that the elements in the list referred to. I believe that the argument "...include any instance..." fails as only <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notable</a> instances would be included. As it stands now, there are approximately 46 entries on the list. I don't believe that this is a large or unmaintainable number. I have personally edited and looked at ~30% of the entries, and had to link most of those to their respective articles. Generally, within the parent articles, the event on the list is undisputed (a.k.a. proven or generally accepted). There are a few exceptions. The Lincoln Assassination is currently unsourced. The <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_Act_a851.html" title="Federal Reserve Act">Federal Reserve Act</a> is highly disputed in its article (see also <a href="../../../f/e/d/Federal_Reserve_System_b397.html" title="Federal Reserve System">Federal Reserve System</a>, esp. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_System&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94851367" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Federal_Reserve_System&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=94851367" rel="nofollow">this diff</a> where it is clearly disputed). The Video Poker section doesn't reference an article at all, and should be excluded from the list. Actually, any element of the list that doesn't refer to an existing article should be removed.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>As to the question of "Who must consider a conspiracy proven for it to be included?", this answer is partially discussed above. If the topic is not generally disputed in the main article it refers to, that should qualify for inclusion in the list. General dispute should automatically categorize the topic back into conspiracy theory, not conspiracy (proven, accepted, or undisputed), thereby disqualifying it from inclusion to this list.</li>
<li>As to this argument here, "Besides, once a conspiracy theory is proved wouldn't it no longer be a theory?", I absolutely agree, and that is the purpose of this list. It puzzles me that such insight sits behind a vote for deletion.</li>
<li>Another argument in this discussion is, "A conspiracy cannot be proven. That verb does not go with that noun. One can prove specific conspiracy theories, or specific allegations of conspiracy, or that a certain group conspired to do something." These sentences seem to contradict themselves. They seem to imply that one a "conspiracy theory" is proven, we "dare not call it a conspiracy". Perhaps the common vernacular sublimely precludes such grammatical correctness. Also, we need not worry whether or not a conspiracy can be proven. Doing so would technically be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</li>
<li>The argument "Soapboxing, original research by selective synthesis" may be closer to valid. Since there is not a category setup for this, it is inherently difficult to peruse the mass of articles in wikipedia for qualifying entries to the list. I would propose that the selectiveness of the list, currently, is the result of the difficulty and time involved in scouring the whole of wikipedia to find items to include. This effort is further impeded by my above argument to the "dare not call it a conspiracy" response, that seems to remove the "conspiracy" classification from those entities, preferring to call them plots, scandals, cabals, operations, etc. We must remember that bias, and POV are not always very clear cut, and are not always to be confused with soapboxing. Indeed, a television newscast has a fundamental bias that cannot be avoided. This fundamental bias is to consider what news is newsworthy enough to be reported in the limited timespan that they have to report the news in. This natural bias can be more clearly seen on a local TV station's broadcast, rather than a 24hr cable news channel's production. I would go so far as to say that wikipedia's natural bias is a reflection of the accumulation of fundamental bias in the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">media</a>. I would like to emphasize that this is not always a conscious bias, just a product of "the way things work."</li>
<li>As to the name of the list, I personally don't prefer "proven" conspiracies. I would be more inclined to agree with either the term "undisputed", "accepted", "actual", or some reasonable combination like "generally accepted" or "actual undisputed" would be OK.</li>
<li>As for the argument that the list is based of confusing two homonyms, I would first point out that the two homonyms referred to were "legal conspiracy" and "conspiracy theory". As I have noted above, that which is theory should not be included on the list. That which is on the list and is still disputed as theory in the article that entry refers to should be removed. The homonym argument would probably hold more weight if it tried to make a distinction between general conspiracy and legal conspiracy. So, I'll take up that argument too. It should be noted that legal definitions are more watertight and restictive than the common vernacular definition. As far as I know the only definitions that are meant to be more watertight that a legal definition is a mathematical definition. I believe that the unnecessary constriction of the list to fix the more narrow definition of legal conspiracy to be inappropriate for this list, although it would be appropriate for a sublist.</li>
<li>The next argument, is one I'm slightly closer to agreeing with. And that is the argument of, vague inclusion parameters. I would like to direct your attention to <a href="../../../c/a/n/Candy_bar.html" title="Candy bar">Candy bar</a>. Please note that <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reese_Peanut_Butter_Cups_901f.html" title="Reese Peanut Butter Cups">Reese Peanut Butter Cups</a> is on that list. Is it really a candy bar? For POV inclusion in a list, take a look at this list .</li>

<dd>I do think that this article could use a lot of work. There obviously a couple items that don't belong. I feel that the only things that should be on the list should be articles in wikipedia. This means either their own article, or a section of a larger article that the item on the list brings attention to. The items should also be undisputed or generally accepted on those main articles. I think that this is merely an editing problem and does not warrant deletion of the list. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 23:42, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

In my high school history class, we learned about the assassination of <a href="../../../a/r/c/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria_362b.html" title="Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria">Archduke Ferdinand</a>. This was presented as a "lone assassin" acting under the pressure in an increasing environment of nationalism over many European states. We never went such detail over the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassination_in_Sarajevo_caf3.html" title="Assassination in Sarajevo">assassination</a> itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have noticed that shortly after I made my vote above, a couple of users who voted for deletion have been doing many edits to the article. These have been generally constructive edits. Much of the removals are ones that I would've done anyway, so they have been saving me the trouble of doing so. There are only a couple (maybe three) removals that I would disagree with, but for the most part their work seems right in tune with what I think should be done. There has been a decent bit of removal of text that didn't belong in the items, but the proper parts of those items remained. I can agree completely with those particular edits. To me, this seems to suggest that there has been a place for this list on wikipedia and that the real problems with it could be fixed by editing. I would like to spend the rest of this comment proposing better guidlines for determining what should be on the list.</li>

<li>Summaries on the list should follow, as closely as possible, the summary of the corresponding article. If the element on the list refers to a section in the article, the summary of that element should be an encyclopaedic summary of that section, or the conspiracy part of that section.</li>

<ul>
<li>This guidline will help keep soapboxing and original research out of the summaries in the list.</li>
<li>It is obvious that this will be a bigger problem for the elements of the list that refer to a section of an article. In this case, it may be a good idea if the primary editors of the article in question approve or actually create those particular summaries.</li>
<li>I think that many of the summaries could follow this pattern:</li>

<dl>
<dd>I appreciate the effort you're putting into this Umeboshi, but I really think its a lost cause. Take for example, your qualification regarding military operations, this would include every military campaign conducted by two or more allies in the history of the world. (Or any campaign conducted on the soil of a consenting third country, or any peacetime war plan), etc. And how is it that you come to define a conspiracy as an act coordinated between allies? Wouldn't it be equally "conspiratorial" for a team of individuals to plan an invasion? Does it really make sense to call the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Peninsular_Campaign_7cb9.html" title="Peninsular Campaign">Peninsular Campaign</a> a conspiracy? The only way I can see to salvage this list is to do something like List of major conspiracy cases and only include cases where people were accused of conspiracy in court, but even then the list is enormous and completely unfocused as you are combining say, Enron, with a case where a guy shoots someone and then another guy helps him cover it up (conspiracy after the fact). I would accept something like List of convictions under the RICO act, but clearly <i>legal</i> convictions are not the point of this list. Clearly, this list is about showing that historically, massive governmental or corporate conspiracies have happened in order to lend weight to the nutty conspiracy theories that Striver loves for one reason or another. That's POV pushing and its unacceptable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 17:22, 20 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My purpose in advocating the inclusion of military campaigns was specifically to keep away from pushing POV. I will agree that it would make the list cumbersome. Personally, I would prefer to keep most them out of the list, but I would not want to be accused of pushing POV. It may be a better idea to resurrect the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article and make it a real article that explains how military campaigns, plans and operations could be considered conspiracy and preclude their mention from the list. The article could then direct the reader to the appropriate categories and lists. One can hardly doubt that the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor_c6a2.html" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">Attack on Pearl Harbor</a> or <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operation_Overlord_76ce.html" title="Operation Overlord">Operation Overlord</a> were conspiracies, at minimum from the viewpoint of people who plan the suprise attack. The conspiracy article at the moment is nothing more than a disambiguation page. It used to a little better, it wasn't great but it was a decent stub. It seems what happened is that early on, it detailed criminal conspiracy, got a legal template, then split from the main article. I'm not disagreeing with the split, but after that it went downhill to nothing more than a definition and some links to other articles. When you take a look at the other articles like <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28crime%29.html" title="Conspiracy (crime)">Conspiracy (crime)</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_%28civil%29.html" title="Conspiracy (civil)">Conspiracy (civil)</a> there are only a couple of examples of specific cases mentioned in each article, and there is no direction to a list of events which would fall into those categories. The Conspiracy (political) article is even more pathetic, and could probably be merged into a good <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article. I do understand that the concept of conspiracy is a vague concept covering a lot of territory. I also understand that it is a human construct. I invite you to take a look at other vague, but simple, concepts that cover a lot of territory and have better articles:

<dd>These are all vague (to various degrees) human constructs that seem to require a larger explanation than just a quick definition and pointers to disambiguation links. Rather they try to discuss the topic with a small amount of detail without delving into a whole systematic exposition. While I agree that the conspiracy list seems to focus on massive government and coporate conspiracies, I don't believe that deleting the list is the appropriate answer to that focus. I have tried to create some guidlines to remove that particular focus and stay true to the general meaning of conspiracy. While the list might give a slight amount of weight some of the conspiracy theories out there, I would like to point out that deletion of the list might actually give more weight to them. This might seem counter-intuitive at first. If it can be shown that there is a history of shoving actual conspiracy in the corner, or displaying its vigorous dismissal, and if it can be shown that conspiracy theory is actively advanced in means and methods that help ridicule it, then it becomes much easier to add weight to the conspiracist view of events. A good list may help support the idea that conspiracy, while pervasive in the course of history, is full of mundane unconnected events, rather than a "topdown plan guided by the elite for generations to enslave humanity." The deletion of the list could be seen in the eyes of the conspiracy theorists as evidence that there are those that are too fearful of the list because it would clearly reveal such a plan. Personally, I doubt that any list of events in the wikipedia, conspiracy or otherwise, would ever reveal such a "master plan", as there is too much disconnect between notable events. It's part of the reason I use other methods in my own personal research on the topic. Now as far as being a lost cause, I would like to direct you to look at Tom Harrison's remarks on last years <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_proven_conspiracies_e53c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of proven conspiracies">afd</a>. He discusses the motivation that inspired it in the first place and warns that removing it would just have the effect of it popping up again in another form. I'll try to draw an analogy for you. Close by, in a small town, young teenagers used to meet up on Friday and Saturday nights in a parking lot on the edge of town. This had been the tradition for many years. One day, the chief of police got the "bright idea" to stop this, possibly because it made the town look bad or something. The result of this is that the teens just found other places to meet up, some of them outside the city limits. This made it more difficult for the police to keep their eye on the kids and keep them out of trouble. I think that policy has since changed and the old tradition is in full swing again, but I haven't been back to verify that in a while. Please don't take this as some sort of vague threat from me to force the list to pop up again if it's deleted. I'm not interested in causing trouble or disrupting the process of making a better encyclopedia. I'm just trying to impart some words of wisdom, "build a field and set the boundaries" and things will be easier to maintain in the long run. I am, however, interested in building a better <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article, as I described above. I may seek to do that later once I come up with a good plan to make it viable. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 08:16, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>Comment</i> Perhaps it would be best to limit the list to conspiracies to overthrow states. (Directly overthrow, anyway, so we don't have people arguing, e.g., that there was a conspiracy by FDR to let the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, go to war with Japan, and thus overthrow the Japanese state.) Focusing on that category strikes me as reasonably encyclopedic; but I don't think there's sufficient commonality between the Catilinian conspiracy, the Black Sox scandal, the Gulf of Tonkin incident (how is this a "conspiracy", BTW?) and DRAM price fixing to create any sort of meaningful article or list, per GabrielF's original remarks. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoess_95be.html" title="User:Choess">Choess</a> 21:13, 20 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The only way this article could be made useful and interesting is if WP:NPOV and WP:V were both rescinded. There are two real questions here. The first is "conspiracies." We are fooling ourselves if we defend this article under the pretense that "conspiracy," as used here, can be defined neutrally. If a conspiracy, for the purpose of this article, was defined neutrally, it could theoretically contain all coordinated human activity in all of history, with the only criteria for entry being the old saws "notability" and "significance." Meanwhile, the convenience of the list format is that it allows for an absolute definition of an event in precisely the same way an article's title does: the article title "Boston Massacre" states, conclusively, that the event in question was a massacre, no matter how much of the article itself is devoted to criticism of this view or if the article's description itself is more nuanced. The reality is that the structual flaw (intentional or not) of this list is that it inevitably uses the common understanding of conspiracy as a nefarious plot to do harm or evil to undermine WP:NPOV by allowing an editor to state CONCLUSIVELY and without in-article criticism that an act or event is an act of violence or other deliberate harm. The second question is over the issue of 'proof.' The same analysis applies: the list enables an editor to make a conclusive claim as to whether or not an act was undertaken by a conspiracy or that a group was conspiratorial. By the nature of the list, debate over the substance of this claim must be made on the talk page of the list rather than on the article page, where the complexity of opinions on the question would be made apperant to the end-user. The assumption that the end-user will appreciate the complexity of the issue upon viewing the main article on the subject is inappropriate. In summary, there is no reason why we should create more circumstances where WP:NPOV must be bent for the sake of brevity or convenience. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexeiSeptimus_d337.html" title="User:AlexeiSeptimus">AlexeiSeptimus</a> 03:01, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with very much of what you say. I have put a great deal of thought into this, and tried to find a way to keep POV out of the list. This is problematic due, like you say, to the nature of being able to define conspiracy neutrally. My solution was to keep the list from being able to make that definition in the first place, primarily by only allowing all entries to be articles. For the other issue you raise of proof, I tried to make a way to determine this, not proof but lack of dispute, by forcing compliance that it not be disputed in the main article. This helps keep the editors of the list from determining "proof". The more I keep thinking about this, the more ready I am to get rid of the list. This does not mean I'm ready to dispose of the issue that I feel is important, which is basically categorical navigation. The problem is that there is currently no way to navigate through the many commonly accepted conspiracies that have taken place in history. I would agree that including military campaigns, intelligence operations, assassination plots, and terrorist attacks to the list would make the list very large and unmanageable, keeping them off of the list is equivalent to pushing POV. Even selecting a smaller list of well known and generally accepted conspiracies also serves to help push POV. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 06:09, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>The more I think about it the more I feel that the list should be removed. Categories may be a better approach. The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy.html" title="Conspiracy">Conspiracy</a> article really needs to be worked on to help explain the concept in greater detail, then direct the reader to the various forms that it occurs in. I can agree that lumping anything that falls under the definition of conspiracy into a "hodgepoged" list is unwieldy. I can't agree with the idea that there is no better way to go about this, and that the problem will just go away with the deletion of the list. The activity I've witnessed in the 911 conspiracy articles seems to confirm this. There are quite a few people who have voted to keep because they felt the information had encyclopaedic value. It may not be the majority, but I don't believe that the are the "wacky fringe" types, and there should exist some solution that would help satisfy this value. Many who have voted for deletion have provided examples of known conspiracy, so there is little doubt that they exist. This means we're not talking about conspiracy theories here, yet conspiracy theories are well categorized. Why is it that conspiracies are not categorized? All it takes is not being disputed as ocurring and not being disputed as a conspiracy. This doesn't seem to be that difficult. Having them all on one list may be a mess, categorizing them by type doesn't seem all that difficult. Why are <a href="../../../c/i/a/Category%7ECIA_operations_88a6.html" title="Category:CIA operations">Category:CIA operations</a>, <a href="../../../f/b/i/Category%7EFBI_operations_f930.html" title="Category:FBI operations">Category:FBI operations</a>, and <a href="../../../n/s/a/Category%7ENSA_operations_fe86.html" title="Category:NSA operations">Category:NSA operations</a> not split between known and alleged? Does a reader have to browse through every article to determine whether they are known or whether they are alleged? A student doing a paper on a synopsis of intelligence operations would have to sift through the entire category to determine whether the op was real or not. The inertia that exists to keep vague the distinction between real and fairy-tale ultimately does a disservice to the end users of the project and help keep wikipedia from being taken seriously when people want to look stuff up along these lines. I mean it might be great for lining the presidents up by height, or listing every <a href="../../../g/u/n/Category%7EGundam_Mobile_Suits_8c88.html" title="Category:Gundam Mobile Suits">Gundam suit</a> known, but it seems to be really hurting in this area. I don't believe that this is an <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impossible_Mission_1f2f.html" title="Impossible Mission">Impossible Mission</a>, it just seems that no real effort has been put forth to make a solution for it. The ability of some to call spades, spades and ducks, ducks when they recognize a conspiracy theory seems to be inexplicably handicapped when it's time to cross the theory barrier into actuality. <a href="../../../u/m/e/User%7EUmeboshi_5534.html" title="User:Umeboshi">Umeboshi</a> 06:15, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
