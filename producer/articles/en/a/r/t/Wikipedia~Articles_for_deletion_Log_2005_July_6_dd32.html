<p>This likely vanity article just narrowly survived VfD because it was lumped in with a few other articles. This person allegedly was in some minor made for TV movie that may have aired in Brazil. No imdb entry for her, and the only google hits are wikipedia. Not notable, vanity, <i>and</i> unverifiable.

<li><b>Delete</b>, non notable. Also I would suggest that the "made for TV movie" is just some kind of cable access film created by high schoolers. Here is a photo from the movie's "official website": I highly doubt the New York Times ever reviewed the movie and called it "<a href="http://photobucket.com/albums/b238/watereffect/?action=view&amp;current=wateranuncio.jpg" class="external text" title="http://photobucket.com/albums/b238/watereffect/?action=view&amp;current=wateranuncio.jpg" rel="nofollow">even better than Doce 14</a>" (which was the other movie in the last VfD). <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHollyAm_2189.html" title="User:HollyAm">HollyAm</a> 6 July 2005 03:55 (UTC)

<li>That was already VfDed and didn't reach consensus due to fears of "systemic bias" against Brazilian unreleased movies. If anyone can establish that it is some high school video project shown on cable access and not an actual Brazilian film I think that could warrant another VfD, based on previous voters being mislead about the subject. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 6 July 2005 04:21 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>But you're only ASSUMING that it cannot have enough extra stuff written. With Wikipedia, you give an article the benefit of the doubt. Maybe not with one silly article, but when it's about the star of a multi-million dollar franchise, you don't even seem to be BOTHERING to give it a chance to improve. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 03:33 (UTC)</li>
<li>There, I've improved it, adding several bits of information that, if you were speaking the truth, couldn't have been added, because there would be nothing to add. But then, I showed that there was. And with the upcomming Pikmin 3 game, even MORE information will be added. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 03:53 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All you did was give a synopsis of Pikmin 1 and 2, as well as mention a future game (all of which is more relevant on the Pikmin Series page), and mention the SSBM trophy (which is fairly trivial, given there are hundreds of trophies). All information on Olimar should go on the <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a> page. IF and WHEN there has been enough written about him to justify splitting it off, then we should make Characters of Pikmin. If there's enough written about Olimar himself to justify splitting him off from that, then he can get his own article. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 04:05 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There IS enough information, if you had ever read the logs. It delves in on his personality. For one, SSBM was always there. Pikmin and Pikmin 2 may tell the plot, but they ARE the plot. The character has a wife as well, which is not mentioned in the Article. If that's not mentioned, imagine how much else isn't. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 04:21 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I still stand by my previous statement. If and when enough information is written about him (as in, on Wiki) then we can split pages off of the <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a> page. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 04:38 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For one, there IS enough content on him. Several paragraphs on the star of a million-dollar franchise WITH plenty of content to add onto the article is no grounds for deletion! You're basically saying that a character IS well-known, popular, notable and has enough content, but should be removed until the content is added. As long as it is known that the content is coming, there should be zilch for a problem. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 04:49 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And, like I said, almost all of what is actually there is a repeat of what's on <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a>. There's no reason to have two pages with the exact same content. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 9 July 2005 08:12 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>I don't really see what everyone's problem is with this. It's pretty well-writen, it's accurate, it's formatted, it has several paragraphs of information, and there's plenty of information that can be added to this. And if you say that we can't use log books, a lot of other famous characters use stuff that's not even in the games. Even Nifboy conceded that Olimar may have enough content to be his own page, but we should 'delete it until he does'. You know what? Why don't we delete that single paragraph of plot in <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikmin_series.html" title="Pikmin series">Pikmin series</a>? Then there'd be no need to merge, delete or redirect, because there's no duplicate information. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 18:47 (UTC)</li>
<li>And to debunk the idea that it's not good Wiki to describe the storyline that surrounds them, look at <a href="../../../l/i/n/Link_%28Legend_of_Zelda%29_c806.html" title="Link (Legend of Zelda)">Link</a>. His article has a large section about the story for each game! And that's a featured article, too. I don't see why telling the plot of Olimar's or Link's games is bad; the games are ABOUT them. -- <a href="../../../a/_/l/User%7EA_Link_to_the_Past_6a10.html" title="User:A Link to the Past">A Link to the Past</a> July 9, 2005 18:57 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> This page is very useful and informative and it is ridicuous to merge this page with the Pikmin series because of the content, while admittedly sharing info with the Pikmin series, is enough to stand on its own. -- Cvxfreak 9 July 2005 19:19 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think the Olimar article has a whole lot of depth outside of the Pikmin series, but that can be fixed. <b>Keep</b> for now. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan"><b><font color="mediumblue">Andre</font></b></a> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan"><font color="royalblue">talk</font></a>) 20:13, July 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but watch for maintaining NPOV. Perhaps a less emotionally charged title could be found for it, since "imperialism" has often been overused by people opposed to U.S. foreign policy (many Soviet and Khomeini-era Iranian officials seemed unable to mention the United States without using some form of the word "imperialist"). --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><sub><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">tɔk tə mi</span></sub></a> 6 July 2005 09:52 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Most objection seems to come from the use of the term imperialism &amp; the negative perception of this term. The article itself seems fairly even handed stating mostly that some believe this or that some historians have stated that. It could do with some more references &amp; the boxer rebellion section could be cut down significantly though as it doesn't touch on the USA actions in China for most of it. Some treatment of the modern extent of US military power &amp; bases could be useful if properly NPOV presented &amp; also arguments/reasons why the USA interventions/actions noted aren't imperialist but were motivated by some other causes. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllanHainey_d289.html" title="User:AllanHainey">AllanHainey</a> 6 July 2005 10:04 (UTC)</li>

Obviously, discussion of one of the most important trends in world history should be in WP, and this is the proper name for such an article IMO.

<p>I do not agree with Armadni's comment that I was attacking people. All I asked was if the people who are voting to delete my piece have taken the time to actually write an article themselves. I think it is a fair question. It is easy to criticise other people, but not so easy to come up with original work. It was a question, not an attack. I think that Mr Armandi needs to go and re-read my question. If he cannot even read a simple question then I doubt very seriously that he even read my article. I think that based upon the fact that Mr Armandi accused me of attacking him when I did not shows quite clearly that he is not a credible person to be voting on deletion of my article.--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 6 July 2005 15:14 (UTC)</p>

<li>Looks like a personal attack to me, and so does this comment. Implying that someone lacks credibility or didn't take the time to read your question or article is quite impolite. See <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a>. Regarding your question, I'll turn around and ask you another one: why does it matter whether or not voters have contributed to their own articles? Removing inappropriate content is just as important, IMO, as adding good content. The content in your article <i>is</i> simply a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">POV</a> summary of an event that is covered more completely elsewhere, and the bit about the prediction deserves, at best, a footnote in <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a>, if it can be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verified</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> July 6, 2005 15:28 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that any reasonable person would realise that my comment was a question. I do not agree with you that it was a personal attack. I think that if people are going to criticise other people's work then they should at least see what it is like to produce original work by writing an article themselves. As I said, I do not agree with you or with Armandi. Your opinion that my question is an attack is POV and is not substantiated by any evidence other than your own opinion, which I believe his highly biased.

<li>Questions can easily be personal attacks. <i>How long have you been a Communist?</i>, for example. Implying that those without substantial writing credits on Wikipedia shouldn't be allowed to determine whether or not to delete content, as you have done with your question, is akin to saying <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Ebert_1ae7.html" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> ought not to criticize filmmakers because he's not one himself. <i>Of course</i> my opinion is POV – that goes without saying.

<p>I wrote a really long reply to say what I thought about the comments that have been made on this page, but sadly, it did not save. Suffice it to say, I am not very happy about the things that some of the people have said and I feel that the individuals who accused me of attacking them are totally unsubstantiated in their claims and are only looking to pick a fight. I feel that the individual who said that I was impolite was impolite himself, so it is pretty much like the pot calling the kettle black. I feel that the person who said the article was nonsense should not have said it because it was rude (yet I am the one being accused of being impolite). I feel that Ben should not have called Ruth Montgomery a fraud because he has no evidence and his comment is slanderous, or perhaps he was calling me a fraud, I don't know. If Ben was calling me a fraud then his comment was definately slanderous because I have never pretended to be anything that I am not. I have no motivation to retype what I said, as it is only words. I know in my heart that the people who made the most offensive comments about me and my article are deeply unhappy people who have chosen the internet as an avenue to pick fights with people and I doubt very seriously they would have the nerve to do it face to face. If the people who made nasty comments were to say those things to someone's face the person would either laugh at them, hit them, or walk away - either way they would find themselves all alone in the world, which is probably why they are spending all of their time deleting articles on Wikipedia anyway. I do not understand how Hermione could say that title was poorly formatted, now that really is just trying to find things to criticise when a person complains about the formatting of a title.--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 6 July 2005 19:54 (UTC)</p>

I think that Ben's comment that me and/or Ruth Montgomery is a fraud should be struck from this page because Ben cannot prove his comments and it is libel. Ruth Montgomery is a very well respected journalist as well as a spiritualist, and if she were to read Ben's comments, which are not substantiated, then she could very well sue Wikipedia for defamation of character. I also think that the person who made the comment that the article was nonsense should delete the comment becuase it is not constructive. I am being asked not to take things personally, but some of the people who have posted comments have made some very personal attacks on me. The article was in progress and I was going to make an analysis of the chart, if anyone had bothered to read the discussion page they would see that the article was still in progress. If you would like to delete the article that is one thing, but please don't make nasty and offensive comments to me about me, Ruth Montgomery, or my article. The people who have made nasty comments like to see themselves as editors, but no true editor would be given such a position of responsiblity if they were not capable of giving constructive criticism in a positive fashion. The quality of many of the comments has not been positive criticism and I feel is a reflection of the mindsets of the people who posted them.</p>

<li>Let me try to go through this once more, since this issue is obviously very important to you. <i>"I am being asked not to take things personally, but some of the people who have posted comments have made some very personal attacks on me."</i> They have said things, but only you have to power to turn them into "personal attacks." <i>Maybe</i> some of them even thought they were making personal attacks, although I tend to doubt it for most of them. But even if they <i>thought</i> that, it doesn't make it real until <b>you</b> decide to believe it is. And even then it still isn't "real" because... oh, never mind. Let's pretend that I - in the persona of - "Icki" - am the person who has made all the remarks you consider offensive (and I might as well be guilty, because I've <i>thought</i> some of them even though I haven't written them down). You've then said that I, Icki, am a slandering, irresponsible, nasty, ungrateful, talentless, rude, bullying, miserable imposter of an editor, and have, by such behavior, earned unhappiness, social shunning, and an eternal damnation to a life of deleting articles such as yours. Well, everything you've said about me, Icki, is <i>yours</i>. What I <i>choose</i> to do with it is <i>mine</i>. I can scream like a banshee, go cry in a closet for an hour, kick a wall, fume for the next six months, or I can tra-la-la my way on to write, edit, or delete another article, grab the inner tube and head for the pond, etc., et al., ad infin. In other words, I can choose to take your words seriously, or I can dismiss them. I would bet real money Icki is doing the latter. Unless you enjoy working yourself up to a lather (and while the melodrama can create a certain adrenaline rush, it doesn't last), you might consider doing the same. It would seem you have talents that other people do appreciate, so why not give up on Icki as a total idiot, and go do something else more enjoyable? --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 7 July 2005 13:33 (UTC)</li>

<p>Please find attached a message that I sent to a person in Wikipedia asking that Ben be banned for his comments:-</p>
<p>I would like to make a complaint about Ben W. He has posted some libelous comments on Wikipedia about me and he sent me an email saying that I am a fraud and a liar. He has also taken it upon himself to delete articles, and I think that someone like that should not be allowed to make any entries on Wikipedia. One day he is going to say something about someone who is in a position to sue, and Wikipedia will be in a lot of legal trouble. Thanking you from banning this individual from the site for making libelous comments about me.</p>
<p>I would also like Wikipedia to know that I do not want Ben to send me any more emails. If Ben sends me any emails I will take his malicious communication to the police and seek legal action against him. I will also use the malicious comments that he has made in this site and ask them to look into the matter because there are laws about malicious communication and <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harrassment.html" title="Harrassment">harrassment</a>, and I consider his emails to me and his postings on this page to be just that.--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 7 July 2005 17:41 (UTC)</p>

<p>Mothperson, if you don't want any more emails from me that is just fine. I only emailed you because you made a comment and I wanted to speak to you privately about it, but if you don't any more emails from me that is just fine with me. I only sent you one email stating my case and that was all, so I would rather that you did not come on this public forum and try to make it sound as if I have been sending you lots of emails, by using the plural. I promise that I will never ever in a million years send you another email or acknowledge your existance in anyway if you will promise that you will not put in this public forum that I have been sending you plural emails when I only sent you one that I am aware of.</p>
<p>There seems to be problems with the editing of this page because I put comments in and try to save it, and nothing comes of it.</p>
<p>To be honest, I would rather that you just delete the article and this page as soon as possible because I am just to upset to worry about it anymore. The article really pales in comparison to what happened today. There are more important things to worry about, such as the bombing in London. I would rather focus my energies on positive things and not this page, which has become very negative. The people in the group have made some very nasty comments that have been directed at me, and I am very upset about the whole thing. I think that some of the people who have made comments on this page have some very serious issues with regard to bullying, harrassment, libel, slander, just to name a few.</p>
<p>With regard to the legal issues, if a person sends an email to another person's hotmal account, calling them names and saying hateful things then that is harassment. In England there are laws about harrassment and malicious communication, and I doubt very seriously that the police are going to care about Wikipedia's bylaws if BenW continues to send me emails to my hotmal account calling me names and saying things about me.--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 7 July 2005 18:29 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'd rather you didn't send me personal e-mails" doesn't imply that multiple emails were sent initially. Compare with "I'd like you to give me some more donut." It doesn't make sense <i>without</i> the plural. I think you're harping on Mothperson a bit too much with this. Anyway, if Ben-w sent you some nastygrams, that really sucks, but you have said some rather nasty things about him in this <i>public</i> forum, including unfounded accusations of libel and threats of legal action. Neither justifies the other, I'm afraid, and you continue to make blanket accusations of bad behavior and libel. Several people, including myself, have attempted to explain to you why the article and the expansion you have planned for it would <i>not</i> be appropriate for Wikipedia; we are met with varying levels of hostility, accusations of rudeness and libel, questions about our credibility and writing credits on Wikipedia, and veiled legal threats. The article's introduction is a summarization of the events of 9/11 and its aftermath, which you have put your own spin on. This material is covered much more thoroughly and neutrally in articles on 9/11 and related articles. A delineation of the chart, as I have explained to you on the article's talk page, would constitute original research, since you are doing some sort of astrological analysis yourself, and that sort of material is not appropriate for Wikipedia. The only verifiable fact in the article (outside of the introduction) is that Ruth Montgomery made a vague prediction about the 9/11 attacks that turned out to be off by a few years, and this is already covered in a less POV fashion in <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Montgomery_875e.html" title="Ruth Montgomery">Ruth Montgomery</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> July 7, 2005 23:04 (UTC)

<p>I do not object to deleting the article, per se. What I object to is the comments that people have made, directed at my article and me personally. People did not have to call the article nonsense and accuse me of attacking them when I asked a very legitimate question of have the people deleting the articles even written any articles themselves. I also feel that Ben W's comments about me are personal attacks. Andriod, I think that your thinking is very biased, so I am not surprised in the least that you would turn it around to try to make it seem as if I have done something wrong. I think that you would rather the people in this forum sit back and hurl abuse and say nothing. With regard to Ben W, he has sent 2 hate mails so far into my hotmail account and has said some really nasty things. I telephoned the police about the hatemail that BenW has been sending me and they advised me what to do about it. Basically, I was told to have no further contact with Ben W and if he continues to send me <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatemail.html" title="Hatemail">hatemail</a> then they will investigate the matter. Just because a person is in Wikipedia does not give him a licence to abuse and libel people. A person can say they disagree with the article without making personal attacks. Android, all of your comments to me have been very negative and I know that you are looking for any way to discredit me. You are not taking into consideration that I have feelings and do not like being personally attacked.</p>
<p>I do feel that some of the comments and hatemail I have received are by people who are very clearly unhappy and are not in the right state of mind to be posting messages here. I also have not made any veiled threats about legal action because if people send malicious communication into my hotmail account then I will report the incident to the police. There is such a thing as internet crime, you know. A lot of people think that just because they are on the internet they can act with impunity, and that clearly is not the case.</p>
<p>I think that in light of the London bombings, it would be far better if we focused our efforts in a positive direction and not this forum, which has become quite negative. I have already emailed one of the trustees of Wikipedia and asked for Ben W to be banned because of the libelous comments and the hatemail he has been sending me, and have asked him to close this page down because of the nasty comments made about me personally on this page. I have already informed him that I have reported the hatemail I have been receiving to the police.--<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">TracyRenee</a> 8 July 2005 06:00 (UTC)</p>

I don't personally believe in astrology or anything of that ilk, and I do think that <a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETracyRenee_37d9.html" title="User:TracyRenee">Tracy Renee</a> is acting irrationally, but several other people <u>have</u> made some impolite and unnecessarily brusque comments in this VfD. It does no good to point fingers and decide who started what, but the tone of this VfD has gotten absolutely childish. As absurd as it is to throw around legal threats over something so trivial, there are also much more courteous ways of telling someone that their article is unencyclopedic. You can't correct a wrong with a wrong. People who embrace logic and disregard concepts that cannot be empirically proven (as I feel most of us here are) often succumb to condescention when dealing with "spiritual" people, and it's clear that's what's happening here. We all know better than that. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> 8 July 2005 17:19 (UTC)

<dd>1) So Wikipedia is now a forum for listing everyone arrested for something? The accused is not a professor or a politician or even a public person. How is this appropriate for an encyclopedia? Furthermore, this seems likely to be applied in a discriminatory manner, since obviously 99% of criminals and accused criminals won't be listed. 2) This could open up Wikipedia for lawsuits of people accused and later proven innocent. Especially bad is when the article is NPOV and states things like "On several occasions, he would cut the hair of Asian women without their knowledge or consent." Typically newspapers and other reputable source make sure to qualify statements with "so and so is accused of ..." or "allegedly".

<dd><b>Comment</b> All of the above were reported similarly by mainstream, non-student news sources because the guy has confessed and admitted as much, making the cautionary language unnecessary. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowee_c487.html" title="User:Howee">Howee</a> 01:08, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>keep</b> The only real problem I see with the existance of this article is the point that it could be construed as a personal attack - however, I think simply what already happened, without a conviction at this point, is noteworthy - the accusations caused a great deal of buzz, conversation, anger that students weren't aware of suspicion earlier, and will likely have long-term effects on the university. If in two years that is not true and/or he is suprisingly cleared of charges, then the article should be deleted - the problem is not that it's an inappropriate topic, it's just that it's not a resolved story yet, and that resolution may, in fact, eventually make it non-notable, but right now I think it is definitely notable - this is not an obscure name in Princeton, certainly... that's the only area I can speak for. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 21:36, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<b>keep</b> I don't see how this page could be viewed as a personal attack. It's a NPOV article that simply recounts what the police report stated. The page also cites third party press articles about these alleged acts. There is no conclusion of Michael Lohman's guilt or innocence so it is not correct to state that this article may potentially open up Wikipedia for a lawsuit. The language in this article is no more discriminatory or libelous than any standard newspaper article. And, as others have pointed out, when this story broke, it attracted a lot of attention. Do a Google search for "Michael Lohman" and you will pull up multiple newspaper articles about this story. For better or worse, the story attracted lot of attention so Lohman is now a public persona. <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westworld.html" title="Westworld">westworld</a></p>
<p><b>delete</b> now that he has not been convicted, the page strikes me as dubious. Also, I don't like the precedent of non-notable non-public figures being posted. Is this moving into Megan's Law style sex offender lists??? See lots of potential for abuse, revenge, harrassment of private individuals. Willowx 6 July 2005 08:11 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is a really old discussion, neither the person who put this up for VfD nor I (at that point) had really figured out the whole VfD thing, and so it never got listed and after a few weeks it appeared that something like consesus had been reached - I removed the notice instead of listing it under VfD, which I now realize to be inappropriate but forgot to correct and apologize for playing <s>god</s> administrator. I still believe that the person is relevant due to the <i>impact</i> that he had in and out of Princeton. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 6 July 2005 12:31 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Let me try to illustrate the shock of this story and why it reverberated further out than the campus. There are 6500 total students at Princeton. Half, 3250 are females, and 10% of that number forms the Asian female population. The man was involved in 50-60 lewd acts. An entire ethnic body nearly systematically targeted! This was a petty pervert but he pulled off an intimidating feat. You can imagine why Asians far from Princeton reacted to this as a shocking hate crime. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lotsofissues" rel="nofollow">lots of issues</a> | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Lotsofissues&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">leave me a message</a> 7 July 2005 05:56 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm more than a little disturbed to see comments from some people saying that this Lohman story is not notable beyond "an ethnic minority". In my opinion, some of you are basically saying that because his actions only affected non-Caucasians, it doesn't matter. And I'm sorry, but that attitude is verging on being racist. Maybe that's not what you meant, but it sure sounds like it to me. As for this story only being a "local community" (i.e, Princeton University) story, that is clearly not the case. The story attracted a lot of attention from nationwide press, as others have already pointed out. In addition to the ones already listed above, here's a few more.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The main arguments for deletion seem to center on three issues: 1) the lack of a criminal conviction 2) the lack relevance to a non-Asian American (e.g. Caucasian) audience and 3) and the lack of national notability. I think if we examine each issue, it becomes clear there is insufficient cause to delete this article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>1. lack of a criminal conviction
<dl>
<dd>this does not seem to be a particularly useful criteria for notability</dd>
<dd>for example, OJ Simpson wasn't convicted of a crime</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>2. lack of relevance to a non-Asian American audience
<dl>
<dd>as pointed out above, even if the story was only of interest to Asians/Asian Americans (highly unlikely given the number of stories in non-ethnic, mainstream press e.g. Boston Globe, NY Post, ABC News, college publications, etc.), there are plenty of Asian and Asian American users of Wikipedia</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>3. lack of national notability
<dl>
<dd>as noted above, media coverage was not isolated to local, or even regional outlets, but included national outlets</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> BTW, Google search for ""Michael Lohman" +princeton" produces 250+ results. I'm new to Wikipedia, but I just read over the guidelines for VfD. Based on the "Google test", the lack of a clear consensus, and the principle of keeping articles when in doubt, it seems that there isn't sufficient evidence/support to justify deletion. Also, it sems that this VfD process has gone on quite a lot longer than it should (5 days). It would be great if an admin could please remove VfD notice. Does anyone know how to request attention to this effect? Thanks! <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowee_c487.html" title="User:Howee">Howee</a> 03:06, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was very obviously created in the first instance by some joker with a chip on his shoulder. It is of no general interest, and has been through numerous revisions, all adding joke-like insults about what appears to be an insignificant Internet forum somewhere. Even the current brief entry has Edge Magazine linked to gay magazine. The article is inappropriate for Wikipedia, and exists only for a few geeks to play around with.</p>

<li><i>Comment:</i> An exploitation film doesn't necessarily exploit anyone (except maybe the audience). It's synonymous with "grindhouse film": the sort of movies shown in cheap, disreputable theaters or drive-ins, usually with very short runs (one book I own on exploitation flicks is titled "<i>For One Week Only</i>"); mostly cheap independent productions with few, if any, aspirations towards anything beyond making a buck. Many of the better-known are now considered "cult" movies. Practically every movie Roger Corman or William Castle ever made was an exploitationer. Most exploitationers made now are direct-to-video. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 03:17, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep the article without the comma at the end</b> How is this a vanity page? It is a an article on a school. Schools are inherently notable. Needs to be expanded but should be kept. However delete the article with the comma at the end of the name, poorly spelled and unneccessary as the other article exists. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 03:24, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I cleaned up the article a bit, if anyone can clean it up more please do so. Also this VfD notice should be split up into two seperate VfD pages. It is somewhat tricky nominating these two together because one is a rather obvious delete/move vote (the one with the comma at the end) on the other hand the other is not a clear delete vote, by tying them together you make it harder for people to vote. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 03:27, 28 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>The debate over inclusion of schools that some have referred to above is, as far as I know, primarily an American one.

<li>Take this one for example. There isn't anything all that controversial in what is said. Mostly it is just boring non-notable details about a school.

<li>I'm personally opposed to articles about high schools, because only a <i>very</i> small number of them are <i>ever</i> legitimately notable enough that anybody outside of the city that they're located in is likely to have ever heard of them, but deletion vs. inclusion of high schools is a pretty famous can of worms around these parts.

However if we <i>did</i> deem you notable enough to be here your opposition to the page would NOT be recognised. Unless you threatened legal trouble or something like that. Our goal is to provide the facts, not what people want the facts to be :) Oh and as for not being allowed to use your name, we will only honor name suppression in the case of kidnappings etc. out of respect for the family while the case is going on. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 12:23, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>FROM Romath:</b> It most certainly is a page of lies and innuendo, NOT posted there by me. I came across the thing quite by accident, and only tried to CORRECT the lies in it, merely finding some fool keeps on putting the lies right back in. I even tried redirecting the page in order to have my full Rihannsu name entered, then hoopefully having a page where the TRUTH would be left alnoe, but to no avail. someone screwed that up, removed the full name refirect, then falsely accused me of trying to say 'Rihannsu'; was religion, which I never, ever did! I even tried blanking the pagew because of the all-too-frequent vandalism against it. Next, 'evil monkey; blocked me from entering in order to re-edit. I solved that crap by going to another computer and getting in. To thie very DAY-- the crap still goes on --- I re-edit to tell the truth----- certain individuals plaster the lies right back into it.</p>
<p>As I mentined before, this vanity page was NOT placed here by me, and since I am the person being discussed, Wikipedia DOES NOT HAVE my permission to keep this page. It also serves NO PURPOSE to see ridiculous editing wars in here, in a site that has potential as a valuable learning tool if used properly. Allowing ridiculous pages like this one to exist and remainis an error, both to the encyclopedia end of things, and legally.</p>
<p>As I have been asking for some timer now, PLEASE DELETE THE ROMATH PAGE. IT IS NOT MINE, I DID NOT PLACE IT HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND ITS LIES ARE CONSTANTLY BEING PUT RIGHT BACK IN AFTER I CORRECT THEM. DELETE IT PLEASE, AND AT ONCE. Romath</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't believe that it was started as a vanity. However the subject has been intensely involved in editing it over the last couple of weeks, principally to correct perceived "lies" and because she is strongly opposed to having her real name mentioned (though she herself has revealed it many times). She is a famous "kook" on the Usenet, but there is no NPOV way of saying so (that I know of), so her greatest claim to fame is not mentioned in the article. Merely starting a group doesn't give her much notability. The subject's objections to the article do not seem to be a sufficient reason to remove it, but in light of her minimal notability I don't see a reason to keep it either. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 6, 2005 20:33 (UTC)</li>

<p>FROM Romath: I post my name WHERE I WANT IT POSTED, yes. HERE is not it, and I have NEVER POSTED IT HERE.</p>
<pre>
It also has been posted AGAINST MY WILL on certainb sites, including this one, and in usenet.
</pre>
<p>As for the 'kook' crap, that is nonsense. A bunch of detractors supposedly nominated me for uisenet's kook of the month award years ago for my strong oppostion to certain lifestyle issues. Just because I am against such things, that doesn't verify I'm a 'kook' of any kind.</p>

<li>Ah, I see I misunderstood.

<ul>
<li>Now there is a principle which should be enshrined in the guidelines. However the origins of this article are moot as it has been heavily edited since then. The latest incarnation is mostly a total vanity production which was then substantially cut and slightly re-written by me. Regarding the notability of the subject: the large number of Google Group hits indicates that she may be notable, if we can find a way of describing that notability in a neutral fashion. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 7, 2005 09:37 (UTC)</li>

<p>Comment from Danakil: I regret not having able to respond to this before: I had to take a year off from contributing to Wikipedia (see my homepage for details). No, I am NOT Ernst Herrera Legorreta (EHL). But I happen to have met him personally (in an academic setting) while in Mexico and, being thus directly involved, it now seems to me that I shouldn't have been the original author of the bio article. Furthermore, I do agree with most of the other comments made here regarding the EHL article, and I concord with the idea of removing the bio article until more information can be obtained from other sources. The work of EHL is mostly known in the area of Programming Languages (a very serious, public source is the Mexican business magazine "EXPANSION" which has interviewed EHL at length at least two times, first in 1997 then in 1999, the records of which are available online through the magazine's web site). He has been (indirectly) nominated twice for the top technology prizes awarded by the Mexican Government (first, as the chief architect of Miramar Technology SAdeCV, and second, as the chief scientist of Tlallian SAdeCV). But of course, it could be argued that these facts, though indeed verifiable, do not qualify him for a bio article. To this I would comment that it might be reasonable to set slightly different degrees of minimum accomplishment to be worthy of a bio depending on the geographical context where the person in question mostly develops. Mexico is not the in the same league as the US in technological accomplishments. One final comment, regarding the Nahuatl aspect of EHL's work: unlike the work done in most US universities, that done in most of the Mexican ones (with some localized exceptions in certain academic areas, mostly from the UNAM and the ITESM) is *not immediately available online*, if it ever becomes so. This, I believe, explains the difficulty in finding online confirmation of EHL's Nahuatl-related work, which was done, IIRC, at the Universidad Autonoma de Tamaulipas and the Center for Huaxtec Studies in Tampico, Tamaulipas. I will try to find more information regarding that work and, in the meantime, I fully agree with the consensus reached about the deletion of the bio article. Nevertheless, I do believe that the NGL Programming Language (which was also removed at the time) should be reinstated. NGL is a descendant of the J Programming Language created by Herrera and about which there is firm, public information regarding its use by the government of several Mexican States (Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon being the most easily verifiable ones) in a large number of instalations covering, at least, 30 different municipalities. 201.135.18.50 07:01, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Improper nomination</b>.

<p>To add my own opinion to the list, a discussion of their strategy is problematic in an encyclopedia. Corporate strategies tend to be transient. They rarely have the sustainability necessary to create truly independent and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> articles. The <b>HP Way</b> <i>might</i> be an exception based on the volume of independent press coverage it received but even that is proving to be somewhat transient. In either case, it should be discussed in context whenever possible. In other words, this content might have been acceptable as an addition to the main <a href="../../../c/i/s/Cisco_Systems_74ce.html" title="Cisco Systems">Cisco Systems</a> article even though it was found to be inappropriate to have added as an independent article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 20:58, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Despite the very low number of participants in this discussion, I find myself agreeing with the nominator that the allegations about the company are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">unverifiable</a>.

<p>The current page shows an obscure usage of the word "Git", which is primarily a british slang term. It should be deleted to make way for a defintion, or a disambiguation page with a link to the definition.

<p>Note that this was originally on TfD, and only brought here, as someone pointed out, that TfD is only for the Template namespace. What I primarily wanted to achieve, was to outrule its use as a template, i.e. transcluding it with {{List of articles related to Nikola Tesla}}. I count only two votes against this intention, and these two also have reservations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Klonimus wants it as a Template but in the Template namespace and possible reformatted</li>
<li>Sam Spade wants the content in the Tesla articles but not as transclude, but by copy+paste.</li>
</ul>

<li>Yes that is incredibly interesting. what a vandal! however, in this case i would like to congratulate the "vandal" for a job well done as it is clear that deleting the VFD was an astute and foresighted course of action. do i have to remind my distinguished colleagues (above) the role of the internet in establishing and propogating cultural memes? while the google results might <b>currently</b> be "low", i suspect that as coverage of this case expands the term "hemadrone" will enter cultural currency. it has happened before. didn't, for example, the term <a href="../../../b/o/o/Boogeyman.html" title="Boogeyman">boogeyman</a> begin its life as a creature inside "the head of one person on this planet"?

<dd>Well, feel free to try and create a new meme, but wikipedia is not the place for <i>creating</i> memes, it is the place to write about already well <i>established</i> memes.

<p>On June 4, 2005, commons user <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pelloud" class="extiw" title="commons:User:Pelloud">commons:User:Pelloud</a> uploaded a photo of french artist Franz-Emmanuel Pelloud to WikiCommons. 14 minutes later, on 12:55, User:82.226.28.129 created an article about same artist.</p>
<p>It is not unreasonable to believe that the person with username Pelloud is identical with artist Pelloud and that he has written an article about himself. French Wikipedia do not have an article called "Pelloud". This clearly seem to be a vanity article about a non-notorious person and should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/u/User%7EThuresson_c5be.html" title="User:Thuresson">Thuresson</a> 6 July 2005 21:59 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Henri-Frédéric Amiel was professor of aesthetics only during 6 years, before being professor of philosophy during 27 years. The title of this article is not well choosen, there are no links to that article, and an article with correct title (full name) exists.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The reasoning given for deletion is that it is redundant with the Scientology category - however, the category has only a fraction of the articles. Lists and categories serve different purposes - categories are only navigation, not comprehensive listing of related articles. Plus what happens when you have a category of scientologists, category of significant places in scientology and the category scientology - then you have multiple categories and no way of strong linking between them. This page seems much more comprehensive than the category. I think it has value. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 6 July 2005 23:43 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is the wrong way to go about encouraging a move toward Categories. If you want to program a Categories system that is functionally equivalent and provide a robot to do the conversion, then we can talk. Otherwise, let the article be and engage in gentle persuasion to move toward categories.

<li><b>Comment</b> When I first made the comment on the talk page, quite some time ago, I wasn't sure what the categories were for. Visorstuff, you say that these kind of pages are for listings, but (after every article is put in the category) won't the category pages themselves work like listings? There is no info on the page, and the headers can be made with sub-categories. Is there something I'm missing, which can't be done with categories?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Either way, I don't think it's a good idea to remove these list pages one by one. <i>If</i> it is decided that they are redundant, it should first be proposed to the entire wiki, and then done to all these list pages. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDyss_f66e.html" title="User:Dyss">Dyss</a> 7 July 2005 03:38 (UTC)

<dd>I think list pages have much more merit and can go into great detail - some are very complex and there is no one category that would be able to cover more than 200 list article pages that are on some list pages - that would be impossible to navigate. In addition, many topics need a one-stop-shop for all the articles about them, and categories are too limited. I know of a couple list pages (I'd rather not draw attention to them because of this issue) that cover more than a dozen categories, but all the categories deal with one subject. This is not a new idea - even britanica has a topical guide index, if you will, that is similar, but has a category system as well as a see also system. All three are useful navigation tools and are much needed in my opinion for navigating such a large wiki. -<a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisorstuff_508e.html" title="User:Visorstuff">Visorstuff</a> 8 July 2005 00:15 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I will agree that a list article <i>could</i>, <i>potentially</i>, provide something that a category does not.

The precautionary principle emphasizes the potential costs of innovation, and its advocates favor pre-emptive restrictions on new technology based on the _potential_ harm that the new technology may cause. The proactionary principle emphasizes the opportunity costs of _not_ innovating, and it's advocates favor restrictions based primarily on _demonstrated_ harm. Although a neologism of relatively recent vintage, it succinctly names a large body of thought in opposition to the precautionary principle, that has heretofore, to my knowledge, gone unnamed. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrasch_08ce.html" title="User:Crasch">Crasch</a> 15:29, 17 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right, I missed that; I didn't check for other speedies since this page unfortunately isn't, regardless of how I turn policy around.
