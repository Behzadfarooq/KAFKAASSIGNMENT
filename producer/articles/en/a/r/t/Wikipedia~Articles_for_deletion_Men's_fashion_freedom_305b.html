<p>This term (in quotes) gets 333 Google hits, all apparently from blogs, forums and such. For that reason, and judging from the links that are supplied, I have strong suspicions this "movement" consists of a handful of individuals at best, and is therefore not sufficiently notable for inclusion (let alone attested by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). What encyclopedic content there is (about skirts for men) is already replicated at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirt.html#Men_in_skirts" title="Skirt">Skirt#Men_in_skirts</a>. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 21:36, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It's semi-obscure, but not any less worthy of inclusion than a lot of semi-obscure things (such as Jordanhill railway station). The word "movement" may be a little misleading (if it's taken to imply any kind of centralized organization), but it is in fact a real phenomenon. As long as the article is not a platform for Dr1819's personal advocacy, I see no reason to delete it. (If it reverts to being a platform for Dr1819's personal advocacy, then it would be worthy of speedy delete). <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 22:31, 7 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Then why don't you propose that <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordanhill_railway_station.html" title="Jordanhill railway station">Jordanhill railway station</a> should be deleted first? Actually, it's not a "very good argument" at all -- there are scads of Wikipedia articles on minor medieval monarchs who are also at least "semi-obscure" (for example)... As long as Dr1819 can be kept from exerting the leading role on the article (something which was a proven recipe for disaster in the past), I really don't see why "Men's fashion freedom" can't be a perfectly legitimate (though rather minor) Wikipedia article. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 01:12, 8 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> That could work -- the problem with Male Unbifurcated Garment last time was the content, not really the basic premise. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 01:01, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Object</b> because, as you can see from the links at the top of this discussion, "Male Unbifurcated Garment" was repeatedly recognised as non-encyclopedic by the community. Then as now, the problem was not the underlying phenomenon — no one disputes that some men do wear skirts — but the protologistic coining of terms to describe it by what appear to be a very few people on a mission. The actual phenomenon is quite well covered at <a href="../../../s/k/i/Skirt.html#Men_in_skirts" title="Skirt">Skirt#Men_in_skirts</a>, I think, and can be expanded there if necessary. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 05:39, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - That would be nice, but people keep deleting references to men's fashion freedom and MUGs there, too, again without taking the time to learn about how many people actually use these terms, both of which have been around for at least a decade. Also, Men's Fashion Freedom is a large superset of MUGs, and includes everything from wearing foreign (non-local) garb for men to the wearing of clothes generally intended for the opposite sex. MUGs, on the other hand, refers to the wear of a specific type of clothing that's primarily intended for wear by either men, or both men and women (as are sarongs in the South Pacific). Put another way, MUG-wear isn't generally about men's fashion freedom, and lumping it in with the Skirts is errorneous, as there are many forms of MUGs that are not skirts at all (Caftans, etc.) 12:07, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. Men in skirts is the wrong way to go. I would also point out to <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> that when a term is being used by major print sources on four continents, designers and manufacturers, it is no longer a protologism.

<ul>
<li>See, I'd be glad to vote "keep" if "Men's fashion freedom" were in fact a term "used by major print sources on four continents". The problem is that it is not. Dr1819 has posted a list of links (now in talk), of which all but one referred to forums, blogs, personal websites and other such internet ephemera. So we'd like to see (after what's now a week of discussion) some actual <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> print references, please. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 13:04, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> - unsupported claims and assertions which have been thoroughly debunked. This often-cited nonsense has been strongly countered with clear references to many thousands of men at numerous geographic locations around the world showing keen interest.

It seems to be a real movement (ie way of thinking), and has a fair amount of internet sites specifically about it. I'd like to note that wikipedia isn't about censorship, and small items like this men's fashion freedom movement is at very worst, harmless. Please don't delete an article because its badly written, or because Dr1819 might be acting like an ass. Delete an article if its on a topic that should be written about AT ALL. If it simply isn't well written *rewrite it*, thats what wikipedia is for.

<dd>I'd like to note that on the page <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Notability</a>, it says that "<i>It has been argued that lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion</i>" under the header <b>Notability and deletion</b>. The article goes on to say "<i>The problem with writing "Delete, non-notable" is not about whether the articles should be in Wikipedia, but that it is a quick phrase that does not tell another person why the article is non-notable.</i>" and "<i>The recent fundraising page says, "Imagine a world in which every person has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing." We are not doing that if we are deleting articles solely due to their obscurity.</i>"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It should be remembered that deleting based on non-notability is NOT policy. Its interesting to note that the main reason to delete non-notable pages is that they "clutter categories", which isn't a huge issue to begin with.</dd>

<dd>Is there any possible way we can merge and redirect this page - is there any article on a similar topic?

<li><b>Comment</b>: the purpose of notability is partly to ensure the ongoing accuracy of an article. See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotability_%28software%29&amp;diff=57110496&amp;oldid=52543064" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANotability_%28software%29&amp;diff=57110496&amp;oldid=52543064" rel="nofollow">this edit</a> in the software debate, where the article on a minor piece of software is inaccurate but it is not important enough to fix. Notability also gets away from <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> and ensures that many views are synthesised into a balanced article. Most new articles have a main mover, but my preference is for notable minority content to be added as a short section to a more widely edited relevant article first. When it has received peer review and grown established, it can be moved to an article of its own - as recently happened <a href="../../../j/a/v/Java_criticisms.html" title="Java criticisms">here</a>, for example. I haven't looked into the content of either article in detail, but a (possibly cleaned up version) of this could come in a section of <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fashion.html" title="Fashion">Fashion</a>, with MUG being included in <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothing.html" title="Clothing">Clothing</a>. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 06:50, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly suspect that neither the most of the regular editors of "Fashion" nor of "Clothing" would really want to deal with the topic in any systematic and sustained way within those articles, and I'm not sure that dumping the problem child on their doorstep actually accomplishes anything. There are plenty of stub articles on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/h/u/User%7EChurchh_dba4.html" title="User:Churchh">Churchh</a> 16:21, 12 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Perhaps we can find a better home. It only needs a handful of experienced Wikipedians at any one time to provide and keep balance. There is always the prospect that this subject will accumulate press reports and notability with time, though given that my small company gets hundreds of press reports a year, I think they have some catching up to do. I think the bit about MUG (strange name!) is quite interesting. I'll add a condensed version of this article to <a href="../../../c/l/o/Clothing.html" title="Clothing">Clothing</a> and see if it gets reverted. Perhaps they'll appreciate it. Obviously I have no <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a> pretentions if it doesn't work out. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 18:42, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: I haven't yet seen sufficient press coverage to ensure a whole verifiable article.

<dd>It looks like theres consensus to delete, so I won't push my points further. But i'm personally curious to know peoples' opinions as to what is wrong with labeling an article with {{cleanup}}, {{notability}}, {{sources}}, {{POV}}, {{OriginalResearch}}, {{NOR}} , rather than deleting them? I.e. what harm to stub non-notable articles like this do? <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 00:28, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>More entries in the database doesn't make it run any faster, it makes the life of cleanup ant workers that much more difficult, it clutter categories, non notable subjects detract from the notable ones basically. Besides if a subject is not notable, no sources are going to be available for writing a proper article. Worse, it's a slippery slope, deletion is what shields wikipedia from hundred of pages every day that could be "stubbed" and "kept". <a href="../../../e/q/u/User%7EEquendil_375b.html" title="User:Equendil">Equendil</a> <small><a href="../../../e/q/u/User_talk%7EEquendil_2b4e.html" title="User talk:Equendil"><i>Talk</i></a></small> 00:47, 13 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The database is filled with *large* histories of notable articles. Small non-notable articles aren't going to be a significant weight on the database. Of course, if theres more content, cleanup is going to be harder, and cluttered categories aren't an imperative problem.</dd>

<dd>One thing I could suggest is split up categories into notable and non-notable articles - with notable articles most prominantly displayed. I would think that would solve that problem. A similar thing could be done with cleanup work, notables should get precidence. However, since wikipedia is meant to be improved for the *readers*, I don't see how any of those arguments argue that deletion improves anything for readers. In my point a view an article thats labled as shitty (and is shitty of course), is much better than no article at all. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 01:16, 13 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I was quite surprised when I found out that 100 articles go through AfD each day, with many more speedied, avoiding considerable clutter. I like to preserve the compactness of information, and if useful information is spread over many insignificant articles, it becomes the job of every reader to collate it. Deletion should also help train editors on what is required and improve the quality of new articles they write and edits they make, so one deletion may result in many good articles. The discussions also ensure we talk to each other about what we are aiming for, stopping us all drifting ever further apart in our aims. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_B_Streater_f6ab.html" title="User:Stephen B Streater">Stephen B Streater</a> 06:20, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>But information is information, and deletion is basically censorship. I have absolutely no problem with full merges of material - merge and redirect. Whenever I find a search item that I expected to go somewhere, but didn't, I'll redirect - and thats what should happen to lots of this information, not a delete. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFresheneesz_184e.html" title="User:Fresheneesz">Fresheneesz</a> 07:48, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An encylopaedia contains knowledge, not just information. The information in this particular article may be more useful in context, and may have found a suitable new home. Having 200 articles, 50% of which are accurate, is deemed less valuable by WP than having 100 articles which are all accurate, even though this involves deleting 100 articles.
