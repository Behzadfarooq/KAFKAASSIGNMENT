<p>Bascom Mouton-Noted Acadian Musician.</p>
<p>Born/Died:</p>
<p>Many fiddlers and Acadian musicians have highlighted his work over the years. Tributes and songs have been recorded and referenced to his music. He was featured at the International Rice Festival in Crowley, LA in music and on a poster depicting legendary fiddlers of Acadian Music. A small portion of his earlier work was recorded by CODOFIL. The original audio tape was recorded in the home of the Mouton family on a rice farm in Morse, Louisiana. His wife Euzide Mouton performed with him and many other legends of Acadian music. They spoke Acadian French. The rice farm was located on a gully in a rural area near Morse, Louisiana. The Acadian philosophy of the Mouton family was that you could add a little bit to the gumbo and there was always room for someone hungry, regardless of their race, religion, or background. Many did that and were treated to music by the family. He was friends with Lionel Leleux, another famous Acadian Musician. Lionel Leleux performed his music. The web site <a href="http://louisdl.louislibraries.org" class="external free" title="http://louisdl.louislibraries.org" rel="nofollow">http://louisdl.louislibraries.org</a> has the song "Two Step a Bascom Mouton" and Waltz de Bascom Mouton (La Malheureuse) as remembered by Lionel Leleux. Theh waltz, VALSE À DEUX TEMPS is attributed to Bascom Mouton on the web site <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/" class="external free" title="http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibiblio.org/fiddlers/</a> Varise Connor learned the tune from Bascom Mouton at a party. There is an audio tape about Varise Connor, Eric Benoit, Michael Boucet visiting Bascom Mouton. Mouton family direct descendants live in Crowley, Lousiana and in Acadiana Parish. His daughter Ruby Marie Mouton Miles has preserved his guitar, fiddle and photographs.</p>

<p>When Sean Kingston reflects on his 16 years of life to write a 16 bar verse, he’s got plenty to pull from. Recently signed to Epic Records under multi-platinum producer Jonathan “J.R.” Rotem’s Beluga Heights label, Sean has found a musical refuge from a difficult childhood. From getting arrested to sleeping in cars and constant relocation, Sean’s colorful past weighs heavily in his musical style today.</p>
<p>Born on February 3, 1990, Sean Kingston spent his early youth in the Half Way Tree section of his parents’ hometown of Kingston, Jamaica – hence his name, before moving to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida at age six. By 1996, Sean’s love of music led him to a prodigious performance of Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You”, forever changing his path. “My mom heard me, and she started bringing me around to family members. Then, I graduated from singing, and started picking up rapping from listening to Ice Cube and Slick Rick.” The gangster raps of Cube and the storytelling of Rick the Ruler had a profound effect on the boy, who also was exposed to heavy doses of Buju Banton, Dennis Brown, and Rakim from his young parents. Not only did their music affect Sean, but so did their traits. “I feel like I’m my father, ‘cause I got a hustler’s mentality; if I want something, I’m gonna get it. I’m like my mom, because we’re picky about what we do, but we’re always gonna make the right choice,” says the 16-year-old today.</p>
<p>By his early teens, Sean Kingston was performing his raps throughout South Florida. “I did talent shows and showcases, but I never really battled,” he says of his effort to get discovered. With Ft. Lauderdale twenty miles north of Miami, Sean has already shared stages with Trina, Pitbull, Ludacris, Pretty Ricky, and Trick Daddy. Like Trick, Sean has definitely felt the allure of street life. Beginning with a breaking-and-entering charge at age 11, Sean has seen his share of trouble. As the youngest of three supportive siblings, this let down the boy’s mother, presently incarcerated herself for identity fraud. “I’ve been through a lot. I did 21 days in jail, been to boot camp, got sent to Jamaica, slept in cars with my family; I had a rough life,” says an appreciative Sean today.</p>
<p>Around 2004, Sean began incorporating elements of his Reggae heritage with his rapping abilities. The gifts have allowed Sean’s music to have a unique blend of street raps with Caribbean flare and catchy, homegrown hooks. This one-of-a-kind presence eventually led Sean Kingston’s music to the ears of chart-topping producer Jonathan “J.R.” Rotem (The Game, Rick Ross, Britney Spears, 50 Cent, Rihanna, Dr. Dre, etc.), who quickly saw potential in the teenage rapper. “He sent me two of his early tracks, and I recorded them, and sent them back in two days,” says Kingston. Soon after J.R. and Zach Katz signed the artist to their Beluga Heights record label – and subsequently Cinematic Music Group for Management, a three-way bidding war between Warner Brothers, Atlantic, and Epic/Sony developed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In addition to having J.R. producing the majority of the album, producers Cool &amp; Dre, DJ Khaled, Just Blaze and others are expected to contribute tracks. In terms of guests, Sean looks forward to appearances by Akon, Rick Ross, Baby Cham and Damian Marley.</p>
<p>As hip-hop moves away from the limited expectations of “kiddie rappers,” Sean thinks today’s young listeners deserve more, “When people hear my music, I want them to be inspired. Whether a White kid or a Black kid, I want them to know, ‘Damn, imagine me being in his predicament.’ I want to send messages, and I rep for the streets as a real ass nigga. It’s all about being true.” As most 16-year-olds are concerned with getting their driver’s license, Sean Kingston is sitting in the driver’s seat of hip-hop’s future, and like late great Biggie Smalls, he’s got a story to tell.</p>

Robyn has also been working as a professional demo artist, vocal producer, vocal arranger and choir director since the age of 16. With an infautation for love songs, Robyn wrote her first at the age of 8 -- for her boyfriend, a mature fourth grader, three years her elder LOL!

Robyn is constantly seeking out hot producers and songwriters for collaborations. She loves to write from a woman's perspective, capturing the joys, sorrows, frustrations, and achievements of love. "I would love to write for a lot of the new artists on the scene, as well as the ones who've been around a minute. I want the ladies to feel what I'm writing about. I want the fellas to get some insight on how we feel. I want to be a household name. I want people to hear the intro to one of my songs and know I wrote it... no matter who's singing it."</p>

<p>Today was a very special and fateful day. It was February 2: Groundhog Day. News reporters from all around gathered at the hole of Pardon-Me- Pete the Groundhog. This was indeed a fateful day because if Pete casts a shadow and is afraid of it, the world would be in for six more weeks of winter. Well, Pardon-Me-Pete stepped out of his hole, cast a shadow, and was indeed afraid of it and ran back inside. But how could he cast a shadow on a day like today with no sun? Back down in his home, Pardon-Me-Pete tells that it was not in fact his shadow, but a magic shadow cast by Jack Frost, the mystic sprite who creates snow and ice. Pete tells us the story of how at one time, many, many years ago, Jack Frost became human. Not to mention the reason Jack Frost helped out Pardon-Me-Pete with the shadow routine: six more weeks of winter for Frost, and six more weeks of shut-eye for Pete. The story begins long, long ago in a tiny village called January Junction. Mama and Papa, the pumpkin peasants, were busy harvesting pumpkins. This particular family was very poor, except for one copper kaputnik Papa managed to hide from that greedy, sinister ruler Kubla Kraus, king of the Karsecks. Well instantly, Kubla rode up on his mechanical horse Claimstomper and stole Papa's kaputnik. But all was not lost, for soon they received a visit from Jack Frost, which meant snow and ice, which also meant...Ice money!</p>
<p>Cutting coins from icicles created ice money. For the entire duration of winter, the village was rich with ice money. (I wish we had a system like that). Nobody could see Jack Frost, but he liked to mingle with the townsfolk anyhow. He even used his magic powers to save the life of Elisa, the daughter of Mama and Papa, who was inches away from going over a water fall on a block of broken ice. She was actually in love with Jack Frost and, as soon as he heard, returned home to the clouds to see the ruler of it all: Father Winter. Jack told him he wanted to be human. Father Winter reluctantly agreed, and so Jack Frost could be human until the first day of spring, unless he were to accumulate four basic human necessities: a house for shelter, a horse, a bag of gold, and a wife, then he would be human forever. So Jack said goodbye to his friends: snowflake maker Snip, snow gypsy Holly, the hail persons, sleet sisters, and the rest, and then he headed for Earth and immediately ran into Elisa. He identified himself as Jack Snip, the tailor. Elisa brought him home to meet the family. The next day was Christmas day, and they really saved money on presents here, because they passed around one imaginary gift and each recipient imagined it to be the gift they had always wanted; Father Winter made Snip and Holly human also so they could keep an eye on Jack. Snip identified himself as Fernando Leonardi Dopopolopolis. That same day, a handsome young knight named Sir Ravenaugh stopped by, looking for a tailor to mend his cape. Elisa fell head over heels for him; Jack learns that obtaining a house, horse and gold would be difficult since Kubla Kraus owns all of them and wasn't about to give any of them up. Jack decided he had to over throw Kraus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kubla Kraus set his sights on Elisa and, using his metal puppet and alter ego Dommy, managed to unsuccessfully woo her. He takes her back to his castle atop an icy, snowy mountain. He and his friends raced to Elisa's rescue. Now that he was human, Jack Frost had a harder time handling ice; Sir Ravenaugh rescued Elisa, while Jack, Snip and Holly were captured by Kubla Kraus' army of metallic knasty knights: Knute, Knick, Knorman, Knathan and the rest. They were imprisoned in Kraus' dungeon. They then overheard his plan to send 1,000 knights into January Junction and ransack the place. Jack had to do something, so he gave up his humanity to become Jack Frost again and cast a very fierce snow storm upon the town, keeping Kraus and his knights snowed in. And it worked. Until February when winter would have to end, depending on whether or not a groundhog was frightened by his shadow. Jack Frost made sure that he was, so winter would carry on another six weeks. But by April, winter definitely had to end, but Jack wanted another chance to be human. Father Winter granted it, until 12:00 noon. Jack raced to Kraus' castle and, imitating Dommy, managed to command the knights down the ice slope on the hill and become a heaping junk pile at the bottom. Father Winter makes short work of Kubla Kraus by blowing him away. Jack now had Kraus' castle, horse and gold for himself, but he needed a bride: Elisa, who at that moment was marrying Sir Ravenaugh! So, Jack Frost became his old shadow again and went back into the clouds...Until next winter. Narrated by Pardon-Me-Pete, the tale begins with Mama and Papa, two residents of the impoverished January Junction, having their last piece of currency stolen by the despotic Kublai Krauss, driving them into even further despair. Their daughter, Elisa,</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Grandma Heilwig">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Grandma Heilwig</span></h2>
<p>Grandma Heilwig is a major character in a 2006 Verizon television advertisement. She is intended to represent an unapproachable, unfamiliar, and possibly unpleasant juxtaposition to the usual grandmother expected by the grandson, also in the television spot. During the sketch, the grandson enters a living room where his parent is decorating a seasonal tree. Surprised by the stout, foreign lady before him, he questions his parent regarding the location of his better known grandmother. His father explains that Grandma Heilwig is there instead, referencing their telephone service which is not Verizon. In the end, it seems that Grandma Heilwig is there because the presumably better grandmother cannot be reached without a great expense on Verizon's competitor's service plans.</p>
<p>Throughout the advertisement, with each reference to Grandma Heilwig, who the father calls <i>Helwig</i> following English pronunciation rules, the grandmother in question repeats her name in a foreign accent using a German pronunciation, approximately HYLE-VIK.</p>
<p>Grandma Heilwig has become an instant commercial success along the lines of such notables as the Budweiser frogs, the Geico gecko, the Taco Bell dog, Duke (the Bush's Baked Beans hound), and the previous Verizon recurring advertisement character, the "Can you hear me now?" guy.</p>
<p>There are now print advertisements featuring the irascible grandma.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: VIPCO">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">VIPCO</span></h2>
<p>Vipco was one of the first independent video labels to start up in the UK. In the primitive early video days, there was a dearth of quality films to release so independent companies had to rely on sensationalist exploitation films with lurid advertising to capture the punters. VIPCO became famous as much for it's adverts as the films it released.</p>
<p>The Video Instant Picture Company (VIPCO) was started by Mike Lee and soon specialised in the kind of gory horror films that symbolised video's early years. Famous titles included THE BOGEY MAN, ZOMBIE FLESHEATERS, DRILLER KILLER and THE SLAYER. They also distributed more mainstream fair like CIRCLE OF TWO and BREAKER BREAKER (an early Chuck Norris film) but none of these 'conventional' films brought as much attention as the above mentioned horror titles. Maybe they brought the wrong kind of attention because although VIPCO'S horror titles were hugely successful the company became one of the bogeymen of the 'Video Nasties' scare.</p>
<p>'Video Today' magazine ran the breaking story in their September 1982 issue that obcenity charges were being brought against a number of video companies over extremely violent videos. ASTRA VIDEO (I Spit on Your Grave/Snuff), WORLD OF VIDEO 2000 (Nightmares In A Damaged Brain), GO VIDEO (SS Experiment Camp/Cannibal Holocaust) VIDEO PROGRAMME DISTRIBUTORS/REPLAY VIDEO (The Last House On The Left/Cannibal Ferox/Cannibal Apocalypse)and VIPCO (Zombie Flesheaters/Driller Killer/Death Trap) were among the first prosecutions. VIPCO's lurid posters for Driller Killer were partly to blame for the legal attention as it showed a man being drilled through the head with a Black and Decker. They weren't the only company to use such shocking images to sell their videos in rental libraries round Britain but they were one of the most remembered.</p>
<p>The final tally of banned videos (known as the DPP 39) included Zombie Flesheaters, The Bogeyman, The Slayer,Death Trap and Driller Killer but VIPCO had ceased trading by then and the company would remain dormant for the rest of the 1980's.</p>
<p>Unbelievably VIPCO would live twice. In the early 1990's Mike Lee started trading again and three of the first titles he offered were The Bogeyman, The Slayer and Zombie Flesheaters. These three infamous titles had now been passed as suitable for 18 certificates (with cuts) by the BBFC and VIPCO made much of their previously banned status. Since then, VIPCO has gone from strength to strength, specialising in cult and horror titles (including many of the former video nasties).

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Goldmann, Lucien (1913-1970)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Goldmann, Lucien (1913-1970)</span></h2>
<p>Lucien Goldmann was a leading propnent of socialist humanism in post-World War II French intelletual life. Born in Bucharest, he grew up in Botosani, a Moldavian town in the northeastern part of Romania. At first he was a member of Hashomer Hatsair (the Young Guard), a left-wing Zionist youth movement. He became a committed Marxist, studied briefly with the Austrian Marxist Max Adler at the University of Vienna and then at the University of Bucharest Law School. In Bucharest, he was active in communist youth circles but came into conflict with them because of his opposition to Stalinism. Goldmann studied in Paris in the 1930s but with the Nazi onslaught he fled to Toulouse and then to Switzerland, where he spent the war years doing research with the eminent psychologist Jean Piaget and writing a doctorate for the University of Zurich on "Man, Community and the World in the Philosophy of Immanuel Kant." It became his first book. He returned to France after the war where he emerged as a a leading philosopher and sociologist of culture with books like "The Human Sciences and Philosophy" (1952) and especially "The Hidden God: A Study of Tragic Vision in the Pensees of Pascal and the Theater of Racine." In "The Hidden God" he tried to show how great cultural creation is the product of "transindividual subjects." More simply, he argued that the works of the philosopher Pascal and the playwright Racine were not just individual products, but articulated the "tragic world view" of a social stratum (the legal nobility of 17th century France) in crisis. Goldman's theories sought to synthesize the ideas of Hungarian Marxist Georg Lukacs with those of Piaget. The aspirations of socialist humanists, Goldmann argued, were a "wager" akin to that made by French philosopher Pascal in the existence of God. "Risk, possibility of failure, hope of success, and the synthesis of the three in a faith which is a wager are the essential constituent elements of the human condition," wrote Goldmann. He called his method "genetic structuralism" and "dialectical humanist". He opposed the increasing intellectual dominance of structuralism and post-modernism in the 1960s and was a strong critic of Michel Foucault as well as of Louis Althusser's structuralist Marxism. But their popularity largely eclipsed his work after his death. Goldmann's later books included "Recherches dialectiques" (Dialectical Quests" (1959), "Towards a Sociology of the Novel" (1964), "Cultural Creation in Modern Society." His posthumous works included "Lukacs and Heidegger"(1973) and Epistemologie et philosophie politique: Pour une theorie du liberte" (1978). In the 1950s and 1960s Goldmann warned that Marxism had become too dogmatic and rigid, and he became an advocate of a "liberal socialism." Rather than centralized planned economies, he advocated "workers's self-magangement" within a decentralized "market socialist economy."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Gayton McKenzie">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Gayton McKenzie</span></h2>
<p>Gayton McKenzie is a South African motivational speaker who came to public attention in 2002 when he and a small group of inmates smuggled secret video cameras into Grootvlei Prison in the Free State province.</p>
<p>The motivation for this was McKenzie's shock at witnessing the nine-hour rape of a fourteen year old white boy. McKenzie, who grew up during Apartheid, and was classified racially as a "coloured", had entered prison as a racist. This event, one of innumerable rapes that he witnessed during his more than seven years in jail, changed his view. Corrupt wardens, who had sold the boy to a rapist gang, told McKenzie that there was "not enough proof" to do anything about the rape. This was in spite of the boy's physical appearance.</p>
<p>McKenzie, who, until then had been a committed criminal, having entered jail for, among other crimes, bank robbery, and who was one of the prison's most senior gang members, turned his back on crime. The secret video footage showed numerous acts of warden corruption, including buying prison food, supplying drugs and liquor, smuggling a loaded pistol into jail and, finally, selling a juvenile for the purpose of sex to another prisoner, who was also part of the video team. When the footage hit national television, and was also screened on <i>Oprah</i> and elsewhere in Europe, McKenzie's team became knows as the "Grootvlei Four". They were subsequently victimised in prison, with several attempts made on their lives. Three of the four men (other video makers' identities had been successfully kept secret) were finally released from prison after obtaining remissions of sentence for their exposure work. McKenzie went on to marry Nicolett Joubert. She was an advocate he met while still in jail when she was sent by the South African Presidency as a member of the Jali Commission tasked with investigating corruption in South African prisons.</p>
<p>After his release he went on a national campaign to combat ever-higher levels of crime in South Africa. His talks to school children were sponsored by a security company, and he is still serving as an advocate against crime. Thus far, he has reached 1.6 million South African school children of all ages. He was also voted the country's top corporate speaker for the last three years.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Likeaball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Likeaball</span></h2>
<p><b>Who are the Likeaballs?</b> The Likeaballs are a team of animated footy-nutty cartoon characters who are really 'ball-shaped-aliens' from another world. The Likeaballs were created by Jim Quick. The Likeballs is intended for kids that are between 6 and 11 years old anywhere in the world that have a sense of humour. The Likeaballs deals with issues that really matter to kids - such as anti-racism, and bullying. the Likeaballs champion the importance of teamwork in real life. The Likeaballs have been adopted by the FA Premier League as their official cartoon.</p>
<p>The LIKEABALLS' headquarters is a huge spaceship called BALL CONTROL. Weirdly, it bigger inside than out. Unlike the first one they built - which was tiny inside and huge outside. The error occurred when the 4-D holographic plans were drawn inside-out.</p>
<p>The DISLIKEABALLS HQ is a huge spaceship which is a giant screw - called a 'Screwship'.</p>
<p>The Likeaballs are lead by their Captain, Kickaball, they are famous all over the galaxy - but they have enemies too.</p>
<p>There is the mysterious T.H.R.A.A.P.F. (The Human Race Against Aliens Playing Football), a bumbling group of ne'er-do-wells who hate any aliens that play football.</p>
<p>Then there are the Dislikeaballs - ball-shaped-aliens from the same planet as The Likeaballs but these guys are really bad....and they fart. A very unpleasant bunch. Lead by the evil Count Horriball, the Dislikeaballs will do anything in the world to beat Team Likeaball - at anything. They hate them being the best. No matter how much the Dislikeaballs cheat and plot they can never be victorious - as they cannot work together as a team - and that's their biggest problem.</p>
<p>Every Likeaball has their own strengths and their own weaknesses, but by working closely together as a team they figure-out answers to every challenge that come their way.</p>
<p><b>MEET THE TEAMS</b></p>
<p><i>TEAM LIKEABALL'</i></p>
<p><b>Kickaball</b> - is the Captain of Team Likeaball. He is always ready to lead the team to victory whether on the pitch, or off in an alien space battle. Kickaball is a master at keeping up morale - everyone’s that is except his own. It’s tough at the top and being captain is not an easy job. Especially when Knowledgeaball seems smarter than you, Invinciball more powerful and Adoraball so much cuter. Even when he’s mistreated, Kickaball always sees the best in everyone and is full of encouragement for those around him. His biggest problem is self-doubt at times of great stress. His greatest skill is pulling together a team who are all so different and getting each player to contribute in the best way they can. No wonder he’s captain – he’s so likeable!</p>
<p><b>Manageaball</b> - is an organiser and a passionate one at that. She likes to keep everything and everyone in order. As her name implies she is the team manager and is rarely off the phone. She wants to be in control of everything and can get impatient with Kickaball’s patience, when he is trying to be sensitive with upset players. As far as Manageaball is concerned everything should have been done yesterday. Likely to be found pacing the sidelines and shouting complaints at the players, the referee, the fans, anyone! She does get carried away sometimes, but she always tries to pull herself back together and be polite. Manners are important to her, they’re just hard to remember.</p>
<p><b>Invinciball</b> - is a bit of a superhero. Unfortunately he’s so full of himself that he could use a little deflating from time to time. He is a fantastic player, but with an ego to match. Invinciball has a tendency to think he’s the only player on the pitch or at least the only one that matters. But his strength can be his weakness too, since he has been known to knock his mates out of the way as he powers his way towards the goalmouth, oblivious to those in his path. He has another weakness too. He can’t stand criticism. Luckily he has a shield to protect him from it. But take away that shield and subject him to criticism and he shrinks and finally transforms into his poor, useless, feeble alter-ego – the very tiny one they call, Forgetaball!</p>
<p><b>Knowledgeaball</b> - is the brainiest of the Likeaballs and an inventor too. He always puts his mind to solving the problem, but that doesn’t mean he always comes up with the right answer. Even brainy people can make mistakes and sometimes Knowledgeaball gets so caught up in the details of a new invention that he forgets what he was inventing it for. But sometimes a brainy solution can come in very handy, especially when you’ve just lost the ball and two players in a black hole, or you can’t work out how to defeat a team of powerful robots without a lot of rewiring. At times like that a little knowledge can go a long way and a lot of knowledge might even save the day!</p>
<p><b>Fashionaball</b> - is obsessed with fashion. She is always trying out new styles to look even cooler and trendier than before. She loves having her picture taken more than anything and is quite convinced she should be famous. She will stop play to rearrange her jacket or fix her hair and has been known to call time-out for a shoe injury. But fashion isn’t only about what you wear it’s about how you handle yourself too. Being cool is more important to Fashionaball than anything.</p>
<p><b>Laughaball</b> - is a joker. He tries to see the comic possibilities in everything and always wants to make people laugh. When the team is down a good laugh can be a great pick-me-up, but when there are serious problems Laughaball just doesn’t seem to have the right attitude. But Laughaball is a very enthusiastic team player. He loves everyone and only wants to be loved back. His feelings can be hurt easily. There’s nothing sadder than the tears of a clown, but he is also quick to cheer up again. He doesn’t mind laughing at his own jokes!</p>
<p><b>Adoraball</b> - is cute and she knows it. She likes to play the innocent one and can be very beguiling. Invinciball will do anything for her and she can charm most of the Dislikeaballs too. She likes to act helpless and shy, but in fact is quite capable of impressive feats of action from time to time, which surprise everyone and about which she just shrugs, smiles and blushes.</p>
<p><b>Believeaball</b> - is very honest. She never tells a lie, but she can’t keep a secret either. This is something that you have to be very careful about. If she knows too much and she meets the Dislikeaballs she’ll tell them everything. Luckily she is an amazing striker and some of her goals are truly unbelievable! Disguiseaball is a master of disguise, a shape shifter, a morph! He can change into anything from a rooster to a chair, a computer to a dinosaur, but certain characteristic features always remains – his distinctive sunglasses, big red nose and moustache. Some things just aren’t easy to hide.</p>
<p><b>Reverseaball</b> - has two faces - and not only that, him-and-him are joined at the seam like Siamese siblings, Reverseaball doesn’t always know whether he’s coming or going. Talk about sibling rivalry – Reverseaball is always torn about what to do. Two heads aren’t always better than one.</p>
<p><b>Inflateaball</b> - the team’s goalie. A great big balloon of a player that can inflate to order. The only problem is he can’t hold his inflated position for very long. Then he’s off - all around the place.</p>
<p><b>Stretchaball</b> - she’s one of the best footballers. Capable of changing shape in an elastic manner. She can be twisted – but she’s not bitter.</p>
<p>Collectaball she collects anything – from cats’ fur-balls to atomic clocks. She knows all there is to know about – Stuff!</p>
<p><b>TEAM DISLIKEABALL</b></p>
<p><b>Count Horriball</b> - is the leader of the Dislikeaballs. He insists that he’s not just a captain, but the only Leader in town and is of the firm belief that everyone should bow down before him. He carries a cane to make himself look important but the cane is a ‘mini-me’ version of the Count, called Mutiny, Mutiny spends his time arguing and criticizing the Count, but it is a love-hate relationship.</p>
<p><b>Combustaball</b> - has a fiery temper. In fact she has a fiery everything, fire exuding from chimneys on her head. She leaves a scorch on the pitch and gets angry about everything. If she could only cool down a little she might have a lot to offer, being a passionate player, but she has a very short fuse and gets inflamed about the tiniest thing. The rest of the Dislikeaballs dare not complain unless they end up roasted too.</p>
<p><b>Destructaball</b> - is not too bright, but he’s very big and he’s hard too – being made of iron like a wrecking ball. The last thing anyone wants is to bump into Destructaball. Being rolled over by him isn’t much fun either. Destructaball is usually very obedient and wants to please Count Horriball, but he does have a soft side and he feels bad if anyone gets hurt. Destructaball can actually be very sweet. In fact if Count Horriball would only stop shouting at him and let him make up his own mind he’d probably in his heart of hearts like to be a Likeaball.</p>
<p><b>Disagreeaball</b> - doesn’t like to be told what to do. Whatever she is told she prefers to do the opposite and at least argue about it. In fact arguing is her favourite pastime. If you say black she’ll say white if you say go left she’ll go right. She just enjoys being difficult far too much to do things any other way. But the Likeaballs know her only too well and she can be rather easy to fool. By pretending they don’t want her to do something they want her to do they can make her do almost anything at all! Stealaball doesn’t believe in possessions. As far as he’s concerned everything belongs to him or at least it ought to. He can’t help taking things and steals indiscriminately. The problem is that not being able to have something only makes Stealaball want it even more.</p>
<p><b>Disposeaball</b> - is pretty disgusting. He is a foul smelling, foul acting slob. He wastes everything and throws it on the floor. He is not only the biggest litterbug in the universe, but also a slob. She always looks like she rolled through something disgusting, but hygiene is not exactly one of her big concerns. Loves eating from garbage tips. He’ll also eat your furniture if you’re not careful.</p>
<p><b>Miseraball</b> - is just a very grumpy dislikeaball. She drags her heel and hangs her head and just looks fed up all the time. It drives Laughaball nuts. He’d love just once to be able to make her laugh. But so far, no joy! She’s a ball in a rut. Uncontrollaball is a complete and utter lunatic. A wild and crazy ball with a mind of his own or maybe no mind at all. Think Tasmanian Devil, but without the relaxing rest periods in-between. Deflateaball is really mean. His nose and his fingers are lethal weapons – long and sharp – he loves sticking it into other people’s business not to mention their backsides. He loves taking the wind out of things. The Likeaballs have to be very wary when Deflateaball’s around.</p>
<p><b>PAM and DAN</b> - An ubiquitous pair of Human TV rolling Newscasters. Pam and Dan follow both the Dislikeaballs and Likeaballs adventures. Pam is the smart one – and Dan, well - Dan’s the Man! Not only can they can view any Likeaballs’ situation through unseen wormhole ‘cameras’, they can converse with anyone at the same time. Nothing is secret from Pan and Dan. The only unknown is, do they hate each other or are they smitten? They provide the narrative that drives - and sometimes explains, the storyline.</p>
<p><b>THRAAPF</b> - stands for The Humourless Race Against Aliens Playing Football. They are a Shadowy Organisation of Earthlings that hates any alien playing the beautiful game, and in particular, ball-shaped aliens. So they are dedicated to ridding Planet Earth of the Likeaballs…..Scary! Fortunately, they are also bumbling and ineffectual.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft</span></h2>
<p>The "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft" (Goethe-Medal for Art and Science) was a German award. It consists of a silver, non-wearable medal (62mm, after about 1938 69.5mm in diameter) which was authorized by Reichspresident Paul von Hindenburg to commemorate the centenary of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's death on March 22, 1932. This medal should not be confused with the "Goethe-Medaille in Gold" (Goethe-Medal in Gold) of the Weimar Goethe Society (51 awards from 1910 to 2005), the "Goethepreis der Stadt Frankfurt" (Goethe Prize of the City of Frankfurt) which since 1927 has been awarded first annually, then triennially (41 awards from 1927 to 2005 - no medal), the "Goethe-Plakette der Stadt Frankfurt" (Goethe Plaque of the City of Frankfurt), or the "Goethe-Medaille" (Goethe-Medal) of the Goethe-Institut, which from 1955 to 2006 has been awarded to 312 personalities from 57 countries. With more than 600 recipients, the "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft" is the most widely distributed award named after Goethe.</p>
<p>UNDER HINDENBURG - 1932-1934</p>
<p>Originally meant to honor persons who had performed some service in connection with the 1932 Goethe Memorial Service at Weimar, the "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft" was since April 1932 in Hindenburg's name given to Goethe-scholars, artists, scientists, government officials and politicians. Between March 18, 1932 and June 19, 1934 almost 200 persons were honored, 159 of these before January 30, 1933. Among the first 55 recipients of the Medal were Chancellor Brüning, and the Nobel Prize winners Gerhart Hauptmann and Thomas Mann. Starting in April 1932 there followed Max Planck and the current or future Nobel Prize bearers Nikolas Murray Butler, André Gide, Knut Hamsun, Verner von Heidenstam, Gugliemo Marconi, Albert Schweitzer, Fritz Haber and Richard Willstätter. Other recipients were Benito Musolini, José Ortega y Gasset, Wilhelm Furtwängler, Otto Klemperer, Carl Goerdeler, Paul Ernst, Hans Grimm and E.G. Kolbenheyer. About one quarter of the honorees of the "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft" before July 1934 were non-Germans. Women were rarely considered; only Ricarda Huch, Agnes Miegel, Ina Seidel, Feodora, Grand Duchess of Saxon-Weimar, Enrica von Handel-Mazetti and the Turkish writer Seniha Bedri were apparently thought to be worthy of the Medal. In Hindenburg´s name this medal was last awarded under the date of June 19, 1934.</p>
<p>UNDER HITLER - 1935-1944</p>
<p>Beginning in 1935, Adolf Hitler, in his position as German Head of State, took over the awarding of the "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft". At the time of writing, the names of about 270 of the estimated 400 recipients of the Medal between 1935 and 1944 are known to the present author. Among them are the Nobel Prize winners Hans von Euler-Chelpin, Johannes Stark and Heinrich Wieland as well as five women: Anna Bahr-Mildenburg, Hedwig Bleibtreu, Agnes Bluhm, Isolde Kurz, and Lulu von Strauß und Torney. Under Hitler the Medal was generally awarded only on high birthdays or other important anniversaries. Many of the recipients were followers of National Socialism. Jewish candidates were no longer considered (until January 1933 at least eleven Germans of Jewish origin had been honored by Hindenburg with the Medal, although Albert Einstein was ignored). The last "Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft" was awarded in November 1944.</p>

<p>Following a meeting at the Corn Exchange on the 28th September 1872 the club was formed. the first real game though was played on the 22nd November 1873 against Kidderminster on the Recreation Ground in front of a large crowd. Kick Off was at 3:00pm and despite strenuous efforts by both sides, time was called at 4:50pm neither side having scored a goal. Early records have been lost but it seems that in the early days the foundations were laid due to a close association with Bromsgrove School, an association which has continued to the present day.</p>
<p>There were great problems running a rugby team in a small market town like Bromsgrove in the latter part of of the last century and without motor cars, away match travel must have presented a challenge. Nevertheless, the local paper, The Messenger, reported that in 1888 "The Wasps," as the original club was named,"won considerable fame for the town of Bromsgrove in the Football world" In its early history the Club was suspended for two periods due to lack of support and during the 1890's players were drawn from as far afield as Worcester, Droitwich, Malvern and Birmingham.</p>
<p>Games were originally played on the Recreation Ground, but in 1889 the club moved to a pitch on the Kidderminster Road. From 1893 until 1914 it played either on the 'Rec' or the Cricket ground in New Road, The arrangement varying from season to season. From 1919 intil 1939 the club rented a ground of its own adjoining the cricket ground in New Road and returning there on re-forming in 1946 after World War 2. In 1955 the club at last moved to it's present ground at Finstall Park, albeit with only one pitch. The ground was purchased with the aid of a loan from the RFU and a great deal of the levelling and drainage was carried out by club members. Over the years the headquarters have varied greatly and meetings have been held at various hostelries and private houses including the Corn market, the Institute building in New Road, the Golden Cross Hotel, Perry Hall (then a private residence), the Dragoon Hotel at Aston Fields (Now the Ladybird), The Cross at Finstall, The Roebuck Pub ( now demolished) and at Long last in 1957 the club moved into its own clubhouse at Finstall Park.Since then the club has extended to enjoy four pitches, a training area and the clubhouse much extended. More recently, and in order to guarentee the future, we have gained registration as a Friendly Society.</p>
<p>Whilst the club has never achieved national honours, it has provided rugby for thousands of players over the years and continues to do so, fielding 5 teams each Saturday, plus the Crusaders, our renowned veterans team, Colts, Under 17s and Mini &amp; Junior teams from the ages of 8 to 16 on Sundays. We have enjoyed Success in the North Midlands Cup, (winners 1982, semi finalists 1998)The Worcester Floodlit Cup (winners 1998 Runners up 1999) and the 2nd Team Cup organised by our pals, Kidderminster. Over the years we have also been proud to see players from Bromsgrove represent England Colts, The most recent being David Hunt (1999), England under 21's, the North Midlands and Worcestershire &amp; Herefordshire County. Many players have progressed via the M&amp;J's to the 1st XV and gone on to National sides with our best wishes.It reflects the changes in the game to read a report from The Messenger (Our local weekly Paper) dated 14th March 1891 for the first round of the Midland Cup. "Bromsgrove were drawn to play Leicester at Belgrave Road and played in front of a crowd of over 6000 spectators! They went down by 4 goals, 2 tries and six minors to nothing" How would we fayre if the match was played today?</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-12-20_23fe.html" title="Edit section: Red Road (Glasgow)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Red Road (Glasgow)</span></h2>
<p>The Red Road estate in Barmulloch, Glasgow consists of eight high rise tower blocks. Six of these high flats are 31 storeys high and the other two are 27 storeys high. In 1969, when the first residents arrived in their new homes, the Red Road was the tallest housing estate in Europe(although it did not contain the tallest residential flats in Glasgow. Bluevale Street and Whitevale Street in Parkhead hold that title) and contains over 1200 flats. The flats are currently marked for demolition.</p>
<p><b>Conception and Construction</b></p>
<p>At the time of their conception in the early 1960s, they were built to re-house Glaswegians living in the inner-city slums such as Gorbals and Townhead while also attempting to appeal to middle-class people wishing to sample "the high life".</p>
<p>Although the construction of tower blocks throughout the city was widespread, the construction of the Red Road was controversial not only because of its height and density, but it involved the first high-rises in Europe to be made using a steel frame rather than the common-place, brutalist concrete frame. The flats were also given a corrugated steel exterior as the architects were far sighted enough to know that as the decades past, fashions would change. Therefore, to ensure their creation would remain stylish, this steel shell could be easily removed and replaced by different colours or materials to match whatever was in vogue at the time. This showed that the Red Road was planned to remain part of the Glasgow skyline beyond the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><b>Problems</b></p>
<p>However, the flats were poorly designed and residents had to cope with the typical grievances of living in a tower block. Elevators were frequently out of use, virtually making the residents on the higher levels house-bound, especially the elderly. Dampness in the flats brought with it a series of problems such as mould and also was detrimental to the respiritory system, leading to some cases of residents developing asthma. A criticism of the location of Barmulloch was that it was too far the city centre to be desirable to the middle-classes that the Glasgow Housing Association(GHA) were hoping to attract. This meant that some tenants lived there not because they wanted to, but because they had to. This became more and more widespread in the Red Road as the flats decayed. The high concentration of poverty led to crime levels soaring and the flats reputation as a dangerous place to live rising. The lack of amenities such as shopping and leisure also contributed to unrest among tenants as they became disillusioned with their homes. Isolation was also an issue. Uprooted from their former communities around the city centre, separated from their families and friends and with few pubs and chances to socialise with their neighbours, many tenants became unhappy, some even to the point of mental illness.</p>
<p><b>Decline</b> The GHA recieved complaints about the Red Road from unhappy residents as early as 1972. By 1975, vandalism and poor living conditions were becoming serious problems and only 7 years into the Red Road's life, some flats were becoming uninhabitable. In 1980, two of the blocks were deemed uninhabitable for living in as the estate prematurely fell into disrepair. The GHA made renovations to the flats in the 80s however much of this work was undone following a series of disruptive residents and the infectious decline the estate was in.</p>
<p><b>End</b> In 2005, the GHA announced that the "village in the sky" was to be demolished along with many more of Glasgow's high rise homes. 153/183/213 Petershill Drive (one of the 27 storey squat blocks) is expected to be the first to be razed to the ground in 2009 and the rest is expected to join it by 2015. Glasgow's skyline will likely never be the same again. However, a sizable number still live in the flats (including asylum seekers) and the GHA will break up what has developed into a strong community, after a hostile start, once more.</p>

<p>Britt B</p>
<p>Britt B of bloomington MN has gained much reknown for being the most kick ass person alive today. Her outright stench of sexuality drives most men to their knees within seconds. She also is very talented, creative, and intelligent. Historians with knowledge on the subject would equate her to the holy trinity except better because shes so freaking sexy. The holy trinity shares power whereas britt's power is all encompassing and omnipotent. Though, most scientists believe she uses a flow chart going in this order (1) Britt B (2) Britt Jr (3) her boyfriend. as a means to establish rank and power. While most scientists question what her boyfriend is even doing on this chart, there are sources from high atop the mountain that it was at the omnipotent ones request. Her name is synonimous with excellence or being number 1. It can be used in many different ways. Example 1)Wow! i really pulled a britt b today when i aced that test. Example 2)Wow! janie you really look britt b in that dress. Example 3)"We are the britt B's" as recorded by noted recording artists queen. Some speculate that with a little bit of working every known word in the english dictionary or vocabulary. So if you your are in bloomington, minnesota, or her boyfiends apartment and you happen to cross her path Bow Down muthaphucker!

<p>people may consider this website as cool and smart. Well yes they're right! but there is alot more things than cool on TV shows Etc... well if you watch any of these cool things please contact wikipedia and let us know what they are. cool is a word most described as either people who where sunglasses or maybe just people that have a really good personality.This ensures lots of people to like these people by their personality. Not many people have over 100 friends. well there is someone. he isn't famous, he's just an 11 - 12 year old boy, quite small, but EVERY single person in his comprehensive school knows him. even me as an adult knows who he is. im not mensioning any names here but this is an important issue the world should know about... everyone is cool not just a few people. everyone is equal to each other! there is not a better encyclopedia website better than this! so take advantage get knowledge off people</p>
<p><br />

<p>The Olympus C-2100 UZ was a revolutionary digital camera at its time, closely paired with it's brother the E-100 RS. Both of these cameras are nearly identical, except that the RS has lower resolution but can shoot an amazing 15 frames per second. Even six years later, this is still the fastest camera produced.</p>
<p>Both of these cameras are note worthy because they're the only compact digital cameras ever produced by a company other than Canon, using a Canon lens. ( Both cameras have a 10x zoom, ranging from 38 to 380 mm eq. ) In fact, these were the first compact digital cameras to offer image stabilization by several years. "IS" has become popular and is now built into many cameras.</p>
