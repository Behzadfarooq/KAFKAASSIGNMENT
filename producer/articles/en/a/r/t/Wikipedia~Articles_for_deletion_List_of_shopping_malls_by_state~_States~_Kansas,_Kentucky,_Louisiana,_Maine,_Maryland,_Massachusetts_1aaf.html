<p>This is a multi article nomination. It's part of a series of noms of all the lists on list_of_United_States_shopping_malls_by_state The following list articles are covered by this nom:</p>
<ul>
<li>List of shopping malls in Kansas (already had an <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shopping_malls_in_Kansas_e3b5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shopping malls in Kansas">AfD</a> with result no consensus)</li>
<li>List of shopping malls in Kentucky (this item is not present as of this writing but is mentioned for completeness)</li>
<li>List of shopping malls in Louisiana</li>
<li>List of shopping malls in Maine</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_shopping_malls_in_Maryland_de34.html" title="List of shopping malls in Maryland">List of shopping malls in Maryland</a></li>
<li>List of shopping malls in Massachusetts</li>
</ul>
<p>These lists are bare lists with no explanatory text. Although some of the malls are blue links, <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShopping_malls_in_Kansas_8c04.html" title="Category:Shopping malls in Kansas">Category:Shopping_malls_in_Kansas</a> (and etc for the other states) also exist and seem to serve exactly the same purpose. I'm not sure I see why these lists should exist. The talk pages do not give much support (useuall none in fact). See also <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_shopping_malls_in_North_Carolina_72a8.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shopping malls in North Carolina">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of shopping malls in North Carolina</a> for more rationale on this.

Note also that these nominations are being kept in small chunks to make it easier on the closing admin, deleting 40+ articles and all the links might be a bit much for one admin... ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:24, 25 July 2006 (UTC) (note, more chunks coming, doing this in chunks is a lot slower than individual noms per list)</p>

<li>DO NOT DELETE. THIS IS INTERESTING INFORMATION. ITS EXISTENCE IS NOT HURTING ANYONE OR ANYTHING AND IS HELPFUL TO THOSE WHO SEEK IT. IT ORGANIZES LISTS OF MALLS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA INTO A SINGLE LOCATION FOR EACH STATE. YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY ANALYZE HOW YOU SPEND YOUR TIME IF YOU GO AROUND RECOMMENDING THAT THINGS BE DELETED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FIT YOUR OWN VISION OF WHAT WIKIPEDIA SHOULD BE OR BECAUSE THEY DO NOT MEET YOUR OWN NEEDS WHEN YOU USE WIKIPEDIA. THINK OF OTHERS' NEEDS BEFORE ACTING SELFISH AND OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE.

<li><b>Delete</b> useless listcruft. To the user above, please lay off the caps and sign your posts with 4 tildes, like this (~~~~). This list is too obscure for more than a few people to use. If someone wanted to find out which malls were in their area, they could use a phonebook. Wikipedia shouldn't be used for this kind of thing. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 16:07, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>It is merely your opinion that "this list is too obscure for more than a few people to use." How, exactly, would you be privy to that information? A phonebook would not have direct links to summaries of retail offerings, location, history, etc. of the malls in a particular state; Wikipedia, on the other hand, does. Why not get a life and stop worrying about deleting other people's information? Too little info is a problem; too much isn't hurting anyone except for wiki-trolls who spend their time harassing other people on here as though they own the place. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.33.49.251 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.33.49.251.html" title="User talk:129.33.49.251">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.33.49.251_d524.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.33.49.251">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>There are no links on these articles, nor should there be. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of knowledge. Please stop asking users to "get a life". This is not your information, if you think it is, you don't know what a wiki is. You are the one harassing users here, and you are the closest one here to a wiki-troll. This is a vote and discussion page, stating my opinion is certainly not acting as if I owned the place. I would appreciate it if you would be more civil, and state your opinion in vote form so the closing admin can more easily take it into consideration. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 03:52, 27 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am concerned that someone like yourself, who seems to have only a passing acquaintance with the English language, thinks he or she is responsible for writing and editing information in the public domain. I would recommend that you be permanently banned so that those who actually know the rules of English grammar could revise and expand Wikipedia without being harassed by those who decide, willy-nilly, that accurate, well-written information should be removed simply because they personally do not find said information to be useful for their own purposes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.33.49.251 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.33.49.251.html" title="User talk:129.33.49.251">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.33.49.251_d524.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.33.49.251">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>As I said before, this is a vote/discussion page. Stating my opinion, which happens to be the same as 15 others, could not be farther from willy-nilly. You must have a limited grasp on the meaning of the words "well-written". This is a list, listing the malls with a hyphen next to the mall stating the city. Being banned is for vandals, impersonators, and users who continually disrupt wikipedia. I would reomment that you read wikipedias policies. Would you please quote some of my bad grammer? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikibout_ac75.html" title="User:Wikibout">Wikibout</a>-<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikibout_dc98.html" title="User talk:Wikibout">Talk to me!</a> 16:02, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - a reasonable start at organizing information that is locally important. Wiki is not paper, and unless these are factually incorrect, not verifiable or notable they are not harmful. Categories work fine for articles that have entries, lists are good for developing those articles. 01:37, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
