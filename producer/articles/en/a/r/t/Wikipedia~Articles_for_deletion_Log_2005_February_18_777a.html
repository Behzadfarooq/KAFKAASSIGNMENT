<li>I have recategorized several hundred articles in the past 72 hours. As a result, several dozen of a questionable nature have been posted to VfD for discussion. In hindsight it does appear that Carol Alt should be de-listed from VfD even though the article is in dire need of improvement in order to prevent a future relisting; it is premature to cast judgement on the other three you mention and I firmly stand behind all my other nominations.

<li>Concur with GRider. I am equally guilty of posting a large number of VfDs over the last couple of days, but both of us are working on heavy categorization (he in bio-stub, me in dead ends) and as a result, sometimes poorly written pages fall through to VfD even if their subjects would be worthy of inclusion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Yes. The AMS is a major organization... that presidency alone merits inclusion. This is obviously not vanity. Please don't nominate things for VfD you're not sure of yourself... i.e., don't ask questions in your nomination. A nomination is an implied "delete" vote, so you need to justify your nomination just as you'd justify a delete vote. Also, do a bit better research. Your 113 hits number is misleading.

<li><b>Delete</b> if that's all there is. Just another name in the credits. Shows like Letterman have teams of writers (and considering its a talk show most of the show is taken up with "unscripted" chat between host and guests (not totally impromptu, but usually not scripted by a separate writer)).

<li>Comment: "Notability", as we use the word on this page, is not a statement of Point of View. It is, rather, a proxy for a judgment call about the community's ability to maintain this particular article - to keep it <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verifiable</a> and to protect it for all time against subtle vandalism. Articles on extremely obscure topics of popular culture are unlikely to draw the necessary critical mass of informed reader/editors to protect the article. This is, of course, a judgment call.

Not everything that fans of a particular hobby or performer or institution could possibly want.

This guy seems to have been particularly interested, amongst other things, in steamboats.

<li><b>Comment</b> People involved with body modification do tend to have personality quirks that are hard to forgive, however in talking about the surge of popularity of body piercing in modern times the influence of Doug Malloy was pivotal. It is deeply regrettable that distortions and outright lies can be traced to people integral to the evolution of the industry, if that is reason enough to ignore their positive influence then there is nothing left to say about the people who created the modern body piercing movement. <a href="../../../r/a/f/User%7ERafti_Institute_170e.html" title="User:Rafti Institute">Rafti Institute</a></li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I disagree with OntarioQuizzer about the articles' creation "bordering on vandalism", although I haven't researched the edit histories and talk pages to verify more. It appears that a well-intentioned editor thinks (not unreasonably) that a Jeopardy! ToC winner is notable enough. (<a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith</a>; <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers</a>.) My opinion is that there's barely notability enough for one line in a <a href="../../../j/e/o/Jeopardy%21.html" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a> article's Former Champions section, below a Former Record Holders section. Not enough for a biography article unless there's some much more significant noteworthiness for some other reason. But the article's anonymous creator was probably being reasonable in finding these people "noteworthy in their field"... much more reasonable than if he or she insisted on posting the scores of every week's show for however many years the scores were available. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:12, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Is an album by Underground Resistance. Group appears on Google enough times but I don't see how the artist warrants a page just for an 90s album. Not sure some of the description of the album does the genre justice either, it doesn't appear to 'define further developments' as stated.</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. I believe there's nothing notable about shopping malls, as every town has at least three of them. I see little point in the list, either. Note that 95% of all links on there are red. There's probably some shopping malls worldwide that are notable for some reason, those should be listed. But the current list is as pointless as the List of dog names (because there's no feasible limit to it, and its members are inherently unencyclopedic). <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:27, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The Mall of America, West Edmonton Mall and the King of Prussia complex are all suburban malls which are famous because of their size. The latter two malls were once a lot smaller, about the size of a typical surburban mall, which were eventually expanded and remodeled to their present size today. As the author of the Westmoreland Mall article, I feel that you are making a mistake by wanting to delete my article because you feel that it has no importance to the general public. There is a growing number of mall historians today that study the history of shopping malls and how they affect the nature of the community and the businesses surrounding a mall. While the Westmoreland Mall may not be very notable, it is the largest mall outside of the Laurel Highlands region of Pennsylvania, plus the mall site has an historical significance, and you can read about that by checking the article. My question is why are you attempting to delete my article and only this one? I've checked the other articles and they don't have the same notice on them.

<li><b>Comment</b>. As pathetic as it sounds, yeah there is. A mall wasn't just invented to drive everyone's minds into the world of consumerism that we find in America today. When inventor Victor Gruen talked about his plan for a shopping mall, it wasn't just going to be a retail building surrounded by parking lots, he was talking about creating a turn of the century community, a place with houses, schools, parks, and smack dab in the center--a shopping mall. The mall was supposed to be the centerpiece of the community, like an indoor downtown. But his remarkable concept turned disasterous. It didn't go as planned, and he realized that the shopping mall was driving all the mom and pop businesses out of business, and he died regretting that. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.117.9.html" title="User:64.12.117.9">64.12.117.9</a> 07:36, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this to be unencyclopedic, as it doesn't serve any of the purposes of lists. It's unfeasible to make a complete lists of shopping malls anywhere, most shopping malls in general are entirely not notable, and if the list were complete it would serve no purpose. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:29, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Seconded. <b>Keep</b> on with restrictions as noted above. With shopping malls going by the wayside in many areas with the coming of the Big Box shopping area format, and retailers like Wal-Mart pulling out of malls all over the place in order to go standalone, there's a gem of an article on shopping malls as a style of commercial area going by the wayside. But to try and list every mall is futile. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 14:52, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Puh-leese! Can we just get rid of this? How is a global list of shopping malls even remotely encyclopedic? And how would you control the limitations that are being proposed, anyway?

<li>This list as it stands should be deleted. One way I'd suggest to keep it is re-naming the article to something like "notable shopping malls" and stipulate any malls added must have something notable about them, like the world's largest, etc. 67.41.179.191 00:18, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, what you have established here is that an article on <a href="../../../s/h/o/Shopping_mall.html" title="Shopping mall">shopping mall</a> would be encyclopedic.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be uninteresting to people who have no interest in shopping malls, but there are many retail historians out there who do find interest in malls and a comprehensive list would be beneficial to them. Every mall holds some special value to them, whether you care about it or not. A mall usually doesn't get any respect until it's dead and demolished, and speaking of this, I've been noticing lately that the list is starting to be covered with defunct shopping malls and since this part of retail history is significant, it would be a wise idea if there was a category for that alone, and then there could be a little history of that mall, just like on deadmalls.com.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> on the basis that the malls mentioned have historical value. There are thousands of malls, however only the largest, strangest, and most complex should receive any notability. It's almost like the schools. Also this list wouldn't be quite as unmaintainable as say the List of people from the United States. Which reminds me, maybe there should only be a US list. -- <a href="../../../r/i/f/User%7ERiffsyphon1024_ff13.html" title="User:Riffsyphon1024">Riffsyphon1024</a> 08:01, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's shorter which is an improvement. But it still calls itself a "religion" and claims to be aiming for "godhood." However, it's the lack notability that's the main issue. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 21:28, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I cleaned it up, but I didn't alter the basic content, which would require more research. The connection to cosmotheism suggests to me that it isn't unreasonable to characterize it as a religion, and their aim of "Godhood" fits into that context also.

<dd>I could start the slimvirginist religion today and create my own websites, but that wouldn't mean I'd be using the word "religion" as it's generally understood, and more importantly, wouldn't mean slimvirginism should have a Wikipedia entry.

<dd>Well, yes ‚Äî and the peculiar and unexplained use of 'godhood' as something that a group of human beings can achieve puts it pretty firmly in the kookiness bracket, whatever other changes are made. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis (<font color="green">ŒúŒµŒª ŒïœÑŒ∑œÑŒ∑œÇ</font>)</a> 21:57, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Whenever I hear that word, I think of the British man, former Green Party leader or activist, I believe, and former television sports presenter, who became a godhead, but I forget his name . . . Got it. David Icke. Pronounced Ike, but I always think of it as "Icky". Ended up with two wives, or a wife and live-in mistress. It's interesting how godheads often end up with several devoted women followers. Perhaps that's Dnagod's goal. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> 22:09, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. <i>So many</i> things wrong with this.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Term is being widely used throughout internet forums and is likely to be found in Anime-related discussions. Although "Narutard" clearly shows relation to Naruto anime, this phenomenon was evident in the times Dragon Ball series were popular. "Narutard" might be considered as descriptive term for a certain type of fans of Anime series that grew extremely popular, yet are not necessarily very sophisticated. Fans, who are fully devoted to the fandom yet completely lacking skills to express their devotion in an intelligent way, thus reverting to pointless discussions, trolling, lame cosplay and intolerant points of view.<i>unsigned vote from 84.188.255.127</i></li>

Thank you for spotting this Rick, if only I could have raised this issue myself. So the question here is: what is the existing precedent? Are we currently hosting articles on any other newscasters/reporters, living or deceased on Wikipedia? If so, why? Does the fact that her death happened live, while on the air, and then in turn received global press coverage, significantly increase her notability as a result in contrast to other reporters? Do the 1140 google matches for this individual become more meaningful after taking into consideration that this accident occured nearly 20 years ago in 1986? If you believe this is non-encyclopedic Rick, please explain why and what one must accomplish within their lifetime to "justify" an article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete,</b> original essay, neologism. The funny thing is that I think it's a valid and noteworthy observation. There really <i>was</i> a uniformitarian orthodoxy prior to <a href="../../../l/u/i/Luis_Alvarez_af80.html" title="Luis Alvarez">Luis Alvarez</a>' presentation of the asteroid impact theory. Some may remember <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a>, a nutjob with who wrote a book or books in the 1950s, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worlds_in_Collision_7485.html" title="Worlds in Collision">Worlds in Collision</a> being the title of one of them, full of cockamamie theories about how all sorts of BIblical miracles were explained by planets randomly knocking other planets to leave their orbits at the right time so that they could part the Red Sea, cause the Flood, etc. I think the manna from heaven that fed the Israelites in the wilderness was supposed to be edible hydrocarbons from a comet's tail or something. Anyway, he was scorned by the scientific establishment, in part because it was just felt that the universe didn't work that way. Geological events were the results of slow, continuous processes. Then Alvarez came along, and my first thought was "Wow! Velikovsky stuff!" Now we live in a world where all sorts of things are thought be caused by asteroids smacking into planets. There really has been a change in our world view. But such comments probably belong in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniformitarianism.html" title="Uniformitarianism">Uniformitarianism</a> and/or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catastrophism.html" title="Catastrophism">Catastrophism</a> and should be cautious and well-sourced.

<dd>I apologise, after further investigation it would seem that these days the terms NIE and NIC are quite interchangeable, this had not been the case when I studied Economics. I would argue that industrialising and industrialised are different in that an article about NIE's would include discussion on how the economies change/industrialise, the concept if you will, while NIC would be giving cases where this has happened, However to avoid confusion I think it might be best to go with Kappa's suggestion - short def at <a href="../../../n/i/e/NIE_e965.html" title="NIE">NIE</a> and <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newly_industrialized_countries.html" title="Newly industrialized countries">NIC</a>. Then expanded <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newly_industrialized_country.html" title="Newly industrialized country">NIC</a> article to include reference to indicators -- <a href="../../../l/o/c/User%7ELochaber_a720.html" title="User:Lochaber">Lochaber</a> 17:14, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Simpler, I would have thought, to <b>delete</b> and replace with redirect to <a href="../../../n/i/c/NIC_2200.html" title="NIC">NIC</a>, and add "also known as Newly Industrializing Economy" somewhere in the first paragraph of <a href="../../../n/i/c/NIC_2200.html" title="NIC">NIC</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 17:46, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I just think that it's a bit more complicated than that... the relationship is more that a "Newly Industrializing Economy / Country" becomes a "Newly Industrialized Economy / Countries". However I think the main problem is that the article at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newly_industrialized_countries.html" title="Newly industrialized countries">NIC</a> is actually about Newly Industrial<b>izing</b> Countries rather than Newly Industrial<b>ized</b> Countries. However, realistically I don't know that anyone is going to correct this or that they even require seperate articles, especially given that both states are transitional. In my opinion the best situation would be if the two articles were merged under "Newly Industrial<b>izing</b> Economy" (or Country) and the fact mentioned that "Country" and "Economy" are interchangable (add redirects), as far as I'm aware NIE was the original OECD term, though if anyone knows better then please say so. What does anyone think of that suggestion? --</dd>

<p>While I have actually heard of them, I hold the opinion that demo groups aren't particularly notable. What is the consensus on this? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:58, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>A very valid question: Where do vintage-era <a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a> groups fit into our community's notion of "notability"? Does this article offer any potential value to our readers, and does that value outweigh the costs of diskspace and hosting on our servers? A narrowed down search of "Northstar +Sweden +demo" returns about 1070 google hits, most of which are relevant. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Northstar+%2BSweden+%2Bdemo" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Northstar+%2BSweden+%2Bdemo" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> Is google a fair metric when taking into consideration that this group lived and died years before a time when demoscene groups used the internet? Where does "the bar" lie for these organizations, and do the same rules apply to those who existed during the mid to late 1980s? <b>No vote.</b> GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 17:46, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Indeed a valid question. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but a 'demo' as released by a demoscene is basically a piece of vanity - pretty pictures, music and/or special effects combined with a list of names and greetz. Quite frankly making such a demo is easy for any competent programmer, and therefore not notable. I do believe the demoscene originated in the pre-internet days, where they were part of the hacker/warez/courier scene, and served to promote one warez group over another. Several well-known names come to mind from the early PC scene, or MSX or C64 (BH Legend, Razor 1911 and TRSI, to name a few). Also note that these demos were often marvels of graphical efficiency in barely a kilobyte of assembly code. I would like some feedback and discussion on this matter, but I tend towards the opinion that the 'early' demoscene is notable, whereas the 'current' demoscene is not. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 22:21, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I haven't been following the dispute on the page (and the British media appear to have largely got bored with the area several years ago and moved on to newer conflicts) so I fail to see why, exactly, a redirect is inappropriate. The article contains a misspelling, and the unrecognised self-styled Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is, I believe, within the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Since we aim for NPOV, a Stalinist refusal to mention what is going on in the area is not an option, so the self-styled republic must be mentioned at some point in the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> article. Unless someone can demonstrate that this spelling is widely used except as a spelling mistake, this article can only exist as a redirect. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 16:12, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This particular page, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Nagorno-Karabahk_1996.html" title="Republic of Nagorno-Karabahk">Republic of Nagorno-Karabahk</a>, was created, just the other day, to express the POV that the region is no longer a part of <a href="../../../a/z/e/Azerbaijan.html" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. The specific contents of this page was one side of an edit war and was being regularly reverted. Other pages such as <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic_of_Nagorno-Karabakh_5308.html" title="Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh">Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh</a>, Rebublic of Nagorno-Karabahk, Rebublic of Nagorno-Karabakh, <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_Republic_7dc0.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh Republic">Nagorno-Karabakh Republic</a>, Nagorno-Karabahk Republic, and <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno_Karabakh_Republic_2ff0.html" title="Nagorno Karabakh Republic">Nagorno Karabakh Republic</a> were also created or had an existing redirect replaced with the disputed content; note the various spellings. Many pages were edited to point to the disputed content instead of the <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> page. The misspelled ones are gone, excepting this one which doesn't qualify for speedy. It is a piece of snot that needs to go away (the spelling, not the POV). I have no doubt that it will if I write several more pages about it! This is all being worked on at <a href="../../../n/a/g/Talk%7ENagorno-Karabakh_05f4.html" title="Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh">Talk:Nagorno-Karabakh</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/g/Nagorno-Karabakh_a51f.html" title="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. These are the real pages; if the discussion there concludes that there should be an article with the word "Republic" in it, we would use one of the correctly spelled pages, not one that has a typo in its name.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- asimghaffar, I strongly recommend that you find another place to do this in. Wikipedia is not the appropriate place. Maybe <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org" class="external text" title="http://www.wikinfo.org" rel="nofollow">wikinfo.org</a> might be better. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 21:17, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Looking at the current section headers, it looks more like a research paper than an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 21:17, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete.</b> Despite the rough start, the article, in its current form, (though still incomplete) does conform to the 'norm' of other, similar, articles such as <a href="../../../g/r/o/Groupware.html" title="Groupware">Groupware</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_teleconference.html" title="Video teleconference">Video_teleconference</a> . The article meets the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. In fact, the comments of Zzyzx11 are not correct in regards to the "look" of the paper when compared to such norms (delineated above). Some of the initial comments (e.g. by Radiant) were made because the article was initially only an outline with no content.
<ul>
<li>As for the content of the work, it is, in fact, encyclopedic, and even properly referenced; the content reflects the views of the establishment in CSCW.</li>
<li>The article is appropriate. The article is not original research. In its current form, there is no longer any violation of the Wikipedia deletion policy ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy</a> ), and thus should not be deleted. Therefore, my vote (based on the article's compliance) is <b>Do not delete.</b> - Funflyer at 08:17, 23 Feb 2005</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. According to the page history, the previous comment was made by Funflyer at 08:17, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC). Secondly, regarding the comment I wrote above: <i>"Looking at the current section headers, it looks more like a research paper than an encyclopedia article."</i> I made that comment when only the Introduction section was complete and the other sections were completely blank. <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 10:50, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. (Thanks Zzyzx11; I added my sig &amp; better format from my 23 Feb comment). The article is complete. It is Wikipedia compliant. It is also quite useful in the fields of CSCW and HCI/HMI. If there are any other suggestions for improvement, or if any opinions still exist for deleting this article, please state them. Otherwise, I see no reason this article should still be a candidate for deletion. --Funflyer 18:59, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>EXTREME KEEP.</b> As was already noted in this article, Kewlers have won several awards including the International Scene Organization's "2003 scene.org awards", the most prestigious award one can receive and the analogous equivalent to the Academy Awards for the demoscene. They were also the single most nominated group for the recently announced (as of this month) 2004 scene.org awards. Did you get the memo? Next time <a href="http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/" rel="nofollow">just fucking google it</a> and not waste everyones time with ANOTHER wholly unwarranted vfd. ‚Äî<a href="../../../r/a/d/RaD_Man_2e7f.html" title="RaD Man"><b>RaD Man</b></a> (<i>talk</i>) 19:06, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Hey RaD, man, google is not the only test. For example, there is Alexa, which seems to indicate that many of these demoscene web sites are pretty obscure. If scene.org has an Alexa rank of 215,000, being absolutely the most famous dudes on that site isn't very convincing. There is also Google Groups, which has only 39 hits for "Kewlers" . You obviously think the demoscene is notable and confers notability on its leading figures; but other people are entitled to disagree. So, chill, please; be a bit civil, and stop trying to force your opinion through on bluster. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:04, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>RaD Man is only following suit - VfD something on Wiki and everyone will attack/defend it with Google hit stats. (I know it's silly, but still it's a fact that they do it and this is the best precaution.)<br />
About the Alexa ranking: True. It's low compared to e.g. Slashdot. But count the number of websites on that ranking and you'll see that actually it isn't bad at all compared to a repository-site. // <a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGargaj_5184.html" title="User:Gargaj">Gargaj</a> 21:41, 2005 Feb 18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. This article was in much better shape than many of the botanical sub-stubs I've been marking recently (which are, for the most part, being kept). BM also raises an interesting point: What "test" must an article pass in order for an article to be kept? Kewlers for example receives 2830 hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Kewlers%22+-wikipedia+-dictionary+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Kewlers%22+-wikipedia+-dictionary+-encyclopedia&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[25]</a>. Is that not enough? Must it also achieve a high number of Alexa points on an awards site which it is not directly related to? How do demoscene groups compare in notability in contrast to, for example, internet memes? <b>No vote</b>.

<li>Gamaliel‚Äî It already mentions that they're receiving the lion's share of nominations at this year's <b>scene.org awards</b>. You don't need to know it ahead of time, I already spelled it out for you. If you opt to discount this annual awards show as "marginally notable", that's your call.

<li>See that's the problem. A demo group is actually a group of people who think they're great and release small (or large) graphical/musical demos to tell the world how great they are. I do believe that the demoscene is notable only to people who are part of it. That is not particularly encyclopedic. The fact that they have an internal contest does not make them notable. I don't think I've ever seen them mentioned on TV or in newspapers. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:10, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>No, you are wrong. Perhaps you have "demo group" confused with "<a href="../../../r/a/p/Rapping.html" title="Rapping">rap group</a>". The purpose of a demo is artistic expression.

However, they are those hairs in your inner ear that tell your brain about which way your head is accelerating. This definition has nothing to do with what they really are (except as a description of a special case, I presume). Therefore, not even transwikiable. I'm not a bio guy, so perhaps there's enough research to build a whole article out of, but I should imagine it probably should just be a dicdef.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>After reviewing the article, I am not convinced that this is a "mere dictionary definition" and am uncomfortable with the majority opinion (which was to transwiki). However, I also can find few references which validate this topic. I am going to exercise my discretion on this one and keep it (as "no concensus") for now. I have added the "dubious" tag to the article and put an explicit request for citations on the article's talk page. If, after a reasonable period, no one has come forward to verify the contents of this article, it may be appropriate to re-nominate it for deletion. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:56, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I agree with the previous entry. My point is that the <a href="../../../t/e/t/Tetration.html" title="Tetration">tetration</a> entry is full of people‚Äôs personal research. Because I am new to Wikipedia I wanted to move the material elsewhere instead of just deleting it. The following is from a page I added last night that was immediately deleted explaining my issue. I have no problem with the deletion of that page either but the following problem remains.</p>
<p><b>Text from former page</b> The initial motivation of this article is the practical need of researchers in the field of tetration and Ackermann function to grapple in a dignified manner with the fact that this phenomena persists, despite the fact that Internet search engines now make it easy to locate prior work. Particularly confusing is the continual introduction on the Internet of redundant nomenclature and notation. This is likely due to the intractability of extending tetration and the Ackermann function from the positive integers to the real and complex numbers. The chaotic nature of these problems has resulted in their suspension within the domain of <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protoscience.html" title="Protoscience">protoscience</a> for decades, if not hundreds of years. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Geisler_fdad.html" title="User:Daniel Geisler">Daniel Geisler</a> 3:08, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These people have had a world record in finding the biggest known primes, and are for that notable. I can think of many things to expand with: Date of birth (and death when that time comes), occupation, where do they live, nationality, for how long had they been hunting primes for the GIMPS project, more detailes on the find: the exact time the computer finnished calculating vs when they themselves saw the result (human vs computer "discoveries" are interesting in it self). Say I wanted to find out who the youngest prime-record holder was, I'd like to be able to look these people up in wikipedia. Or, if one of them is, say, a dentist, I'd find that an amusing trivia and an interesting detail. One of the many that makes wikipedia great. I can't see all these things being merged easy. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a> 14:59, 26 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> and delete individual pages. There are hundreds or thousands of volunteers who have given CPU cycles to GIMPS: these people here are simply the lucky few whose computers happened to be assigned a range that contained a prime. Certainly they didn't necessarily do any more *work* than any other volunteers. It might be useful to know biographical details (in <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanes_8450.html" title="User:Shanes">Shanes</a>' example, that one such person is a dentist), but this can be put in the GIMPS article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. What makes a character "official"? Apparently Nomi Sunrider is a character from a story that took place over three issues of the comic book "Tales of the Jedi", published by Dark Horse Comics in 1993 and 1994. They were collected into a trade paperback, along with other stories, in "Tales of the Jedi: Knights of the Old Republic", published in 1994 by Dark Horse. She also figured in some other Dark Horse comics published in 1998. Are we compelled to have an article on every SW character that has ever appeared in a Lucas-licensed comic book? I hope not, since this seems pretty crufty. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:52, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Lusas-licensed sounds reasonable. I don't want one article per character, I'd prefer to see them merged into lists or whatever, so comic readers can find them if they want to, but they don't bother random page users very often.

<li><b>Abstain</b>. I will now use this to justify my creation. I have been watching the discussions about <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html#Militants" title="List of Muslims">List_of_Muslims#Militants</a> (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Muslims_ed54.html#Terrorist_list" title="Talk:List of Muslims">here</a>) and when I saw no parallel list for Christianity it did trouble me. I have no axe to grind just a sense of curiosity about how this will be dealt with and how this will affect the afore mentioned list. I likely should have thought out my entries better but I would like to know if the list is bad because the subject matter is inherently worthless (which would then have to apply to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html#Militants" title="List of Muslims">List_of_Muslims#Militants</a>) or if my shoddy attempts at starting this list are the problem. I hope someone acknowledges the point I am trying to make (and the resolution through that) although I don't fully agree that it must always be POV because militancy is not as subjective as terrorism. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 01:58, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The basic problem with a list like this is that the criterion for inclusion is not clear or coherent. On the current list, the fact that Cromwell and Rudolph are both "militants", just illustrates that the concept of "militant" being applied is so broad as to be almost meaningless. Furthermore, even if one could agree on a coherent criterion, it is likely that there will still be a range of opinion as to whether a particular person fits the criterion. That is, whether someone should be included on a list of "Christian militants" is probably going to be a matter of opinion, a point of view. With a normal article, e.g. Christian militancy, editors can present possible rival definitions of the term. They can describe how manifestations of Christian militancy have evolved over the last 2000 years, and they can present arguments and facts for and against inclusion of various individuals as examples of militancy. A list is binary: someone is either included or not included. This means that any editor with an intermediate position regarding a particular person is necessarily not served by the format: they must come down on one side or another and that may not reflect their opinion correctly. And, as between the inclusion POV versus the non-inclusion POV, someone must win and someone must lose, since a particular person cannot be both in the list and not in the list at the same time. Generally the editors aiming for inclusion will win, because removing a name from a list will be decreed to be "removal of information" and therefore vandalism. So, a list like this is inherently opposed to NPOV. The same applies to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html#Militants" title="List of Muslims">List_of_Muslims#Militants</a>. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:04, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>I definitely see your point and that is why I had reservations about this. Since no progress was being made on the Muslim militancy debate and no VfD would work since it is only a section I figured I'd do this. My only hope is that the admin who deals with this deals the same way with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslims_773b.html#Militants" title="List of Muslims">List_of_Muslims#Militants</a> and any other such pages. That, in the end, is the most important outcome of this, not only NPOV in an article, but NPOV among separate articles and leaving one but not the other brings a POV into wikipedia as a whole and I hope everyone who voted here will help press the issue there as well. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 20:57, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is this an example of vanity, or notability? Are executives of companies large and small notable? In this example, does being the vice president of a division of a company which provides services to the petroleum industry establish a firm footing in notability to make this individual worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia? How large must a company be in order to justify a seperate article for each member of their executive staff? What are the qualifying factors?

<li><b>Keep</b>. The company is traded on NYSE. He is an Executive Vice President. I would say the bar of notability should be set such that VP's and higher of companies traded publically on a major exchange (NYSE, NASDAQ, FTSE, NIKKEI,...) are included on that basis alone. Also, "Chakib Sbiti" gets 464 Google hits.

The company itself has a market capitalization of $43B on $12B in revenues with 77,000 employees - clearly large enough to be asking the question. As a general rule, I don't think we should go below the top 5 in each company and often not even all of them.

<li>"Charles Christopher Parry (1823-1890) is well known to botanists worldwide. More than eighty new species of flowering plants were named from Parry's Colorado collections, and many more from his collections in Mexico and the American Southwest. Fascinated with mountains, Parry made barometric observations that permitted the first accurate estimations of the high peaks. Yet his greatest contribution to science was through the distribution of his botanical collections to the museums of the world." - from an Amazon capsule review of <i>King of Colorado Botany</i>.

<p>Carrie Nuttall is a photographer who works primarily in the music industry. Does this alone make her notable and worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia? Does the added fact that she is married to the drummer of the progressive rock band <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rush_%28band%29.html" title="Rush (band)">Rush</a> make a difference?

<li><b>Keep</b> as a photographer, she's notable enough to have published a book.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article should definitely be expanded though. Neil Peart is sufficiently noteworthy that his wife warrants discussing merely by association with him. He isn't just <i>any</i> "rock band member". The fact that she's an artist in her own right as well (and a pretty good one too as far as I can tell) is a bonus.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> going by others' assertions of notability. If it was just by the article, I'd say ideally but non-urgently "merge" with the drummer's article. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:19, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

A review of the google hits confirms that she is a photographer but gives little indication of her skill or renown (ignoring the fluff pieces by her publisher). Unless other evidence can be presented of her independent notability, I am inclined to <b>merge and redirect</b>. Again, if this were a new article, I'd give it the benefit of the doubt.

But in the case of Toronto, I'm less certain of what would be appropriate; Toronto city council directly serves more people than six of Canada's ten <i>provinces</i>.

<li>I would sort of like to get an idea of what people are voting to keep here, and why, especially because the citing of "precedents" is very common, and I see a few brewing now. Is it because he is a councillor for a large city? Because he was the mayor of a small city (do we inlcude mayors of all smallish cities then? Towns? Villages?)? Because the merging of the cities was controversial? OK, but does that make him more notable than the merger? Do we have an article on the merger, as it seems so significant to some? If not, why not? And if so, why isn't he just mentioned there? Right now the article says he's a council and ex-mayor, and it comes up with 3 ways of saying he's a conservative. Can anything else be said about this guy other than how many kids he has and where he grew up? I basically hold the opnion that people are usually notable for doing notable things. Politicians are in a position to do plenty of notable things, but just sitting on a committe or whatever is not in itself notable, at least not on a scale like this. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:26, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>If Wikipedia was following more what paper encyclopaedias do (eg. Britannica, World Book, etc), then the guidelines for adding or removing material would be more strict. Alas since the catchcry has always been "Wikipedia is not paper", it is a free-for-all on anything and everything, which is where the problem is. VfD can only do so much or so little in the face of "populist" articles at the expense of genuine encyclopaedic ones. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 07:26, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>They do though, Kappa. VfD is a process of electing to keep (or delete) articles not by merit alone but by which article/s can gather the most support either way. Articles up for VfD are thus subject to not whether they are just encyclopaedic but whether they can receive the most amount of popular support, even if the article is perfectly valid in other encyclopaedias. I am willing to bet that over a period of a few years Wikipedia will become the largest sex and entertainment "encyclopaedia" on the internet, while anyone wanting to do research on let's say a botanist who discovered a certain species in the Far East won't find it here because it wasn't popular enough for inclusion/retention. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 10:20, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong disagree</b> with Rhobite and Kappa. Wikipedia is neither paper nor consistent, but those arguments are equally valid (or invalid) for inclusion of everything.

<li>Comment: My reason to keep this article is the same as Spui's, and because it's useful for navigation, a bit like a road itself. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:51, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was responding to Georgia Guy's suggestion that this article should only be kept if a similar one is written for every other interstate. I think that's a silly, invalid reason to delete information. The reason I voted to keep this article, on the other hand, is because it is verifiable and useful information. That's pretty much all I need to see in order to vote "keep". My definition of "useful" may not be the same as yours. I hope this reason satisfies you. <a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERhobite_7e81.html" title="User:Rhobite">Rhobite</a> 06:35, Feb 20, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes it is. And for what it's worth, I agree that it's useful (and, obviously, verifiable). However, I do not think it's encyclopedic. For instance, a list of phone numbers is very useful, and for that we have phonebooks. A list of local supermarkets is useful, and for that we have the yellow pages. And a list of interstate exits is useful, and for that we have roadmaps. None of the three are very useful to people who don't live at that particular place. You don't look in an encyclopedia for navigation, you look there for valuable knowledge. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:11, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Verifiability is also not the same as encyclopedic. Most things that are verifiable (such as our local swimming pool) do not belong in an encyclopedia. And many things that are <i>not</i> verifiable (such as the existence of UFOs) do belong here. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 10:11, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Concur with BM, Wikipedia is not a roadmap. Should we have a separate list with exits for every road in every country of the world here, then translate it into every language Wikipedia hosts? For every road in the US, for that matter?

<p>Is there really a systemic bias towards internet memes and articles which gravitate towards subjects that appeal to children in their late teens and early twenties on Wikipedia? Take this article for example; considering that a number of articles on local politicians, independent films, and university professors are deleted from Wikipedia on a continuous basis, is this meme really that noteworthy? More notable than a Chicago Alderman, a Councillor of Toronto, an adult film star, or a published author? If your answer to this question is "yes", why?

<li>I think the question is whether this is a fad, or whether it's still a valid meme a year from now. "All your base" has been around forever, but many young memes simply die out.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is vast. It can contain multitudes. Getting too constricted is always a mistake. If the meme fades the requests will fade. This isn't a paper moon or a paper tiger or a paper encyclopedia. It is not so finite. It can let things in that seem to have no lasting significance at the time. Time will take care of interest.

<li><b>Keep</b> The February 26, 2005 article about Numa Numa in the <i>New York Times</i> ("Internet Fame Is Cruel Mistress for a Dancer of the Numa Numa" by Alan Feuer and Jason George) was the site's top forwarded article for the day (and continues to be so as of this writing). The issue of Internet privacy is important here; as a means to discuss that issue, Numa Numa is a useful touchstone.

<li>This isn't a joke - seriously. The US took research into alternative methods of warfare quite seriously, with the idea that not testing something just because it seems very, very silly may be a bad move in the long run. So, apart from anything else, they tried staring at goats to see if they could will them to die (one goat did, but it was statistical that if you stare at a goat for long enough one will have a heart attack). Col. John B. Alexander is another name to look up related to this. Since then they dumped the hippy ideas, and took on things such as playing the Barney the Dinosaur theme on a loop to prisoners to try to make them crack.

<li>So you're saying that if the US government did something really, really silly that relied on them breaking the laws of physics to work, we should just pretend they never tried it? Why not delete the article on SDI, since it was economically and practically impossible? Or, hey, communism doesn't work, so let's delete the article on communism. I think an article on the US PsyOps thinking of the past, relying on publicised sources such as Ronson's book, is worth having.

<p><b>Delete</b> Seems to be advertising. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanymead_e521.html" title="User:Ganymead">Ganymead</a> 01:03, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s>It does indeed look like advertising. <b>Delete</b> unless rewritten and some degree of notability established. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:08, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</s></li>
<li><strike><b>Delete</b>, but I will change my vote if somebody can make a satisfactory stub.</strike> <b>Keep</b>. Seems to be notable enough, despite not exactly being Wikipedia material. --<a href="../../../s/n/0/User%7ESn0wflake_8d39.html" title="User:Sn0wflake">Sn0wflake</a> 03:13, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Hard to tell with Internet companies, but their name gets about a million Google hits, and they claim to be "the home of over 3 million users". How many of those are active they don't mention, but seems to be a pretty sizeable company. <b>Keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, but I'll take advice if anybody knows the field better. In the meantime, am NPOVing. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 03:14, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Now slightly more factual content, and neutral, but still could use expansion. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 03:18, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't think Proboards would need to advertise on Wikipedia, but would probably be more at home in an article on free forum hosts such as EZboard. <a href="../../../h/e/d/User%7EHedley_1075.html" title="User:Hedley">Hedley</a> 22:33 Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Proboards isn't as major as <a href="../../../e/z/b/Ezboard.html" title="Ezboard">ezboard</a> (which needs expansion even more than this one), but it's one of a handful of top runners-up. This is well above the level of what normally passes as notability for a website. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 03:13, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
