<p>The last time we AFD'd this article a bunch of people said 'she is probably notable, but we should do this again in a ~year'. Well, it's been a year and we need to reevaluate this person. Is she notable? No. She is a nobody. Nothing about her is unique or special (lots of people runaway, apparently). You could argue that the "media circus" around her was notable, but then the article should be called the "Runaway Bride incident". However, just because this person received media coverage does not mean she or the coverage is notable. No. Basically, the media made a mistake. Why should we be forced to cover their mistake? One rule of thumb that I use is "Keep the article if it can be featured", but this article is unfeatureable. There is just not enough to say about such a unimportant person. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><i>B</i>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><i>S</i>egue</a> 14:08, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I personally don't care about her one way or another. But given that <a href="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/georgia/news-article.aspx?storyid=53192" class="external text" title="http://www.firstcoastnews.com/news/georgia/news-article.aspx?storyid=53192" rel="nofollow">bobbleheads</a> of her are now being marketed, it seems premature to delete the article. There still seems to be at least a trashy kind of notability associated with her.<a href="../../../b/j/o/User%7EBjones_50e8.html" title="User:Bjones">Bjones</a> 14:16, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Trashy indeed. Let's not get the dirt on ourselves. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrokenSegue_79a9.html" title="User:BrokenSegue"><i>B</i>roken</a><a href="../../../b/r/o/User_talk%7EBrokenSegue_2c3b.html" title="User talk:BrokenSegue"><i>S</i>egue</a> 14:17, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> she's notable via major media coverage. Whatever we think about her or the story ("trashy" definitely sums it up) it is notable and should be covered, IMHO. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 16:01, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to Runaway Bride incident per nom. The media circus is notable, but not the person. <a href="../../../e/i/v/User%7EEivindFOyangen_8646.html" title="User:EivindFOyangen">Eivind</a><a href="../../../e/i/v/User_talk%7EEivindFOyangen_a46e.html" title="User talk:EivindFOyangen"><sup>t</sup></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_EivindFOyangen_607b.html" title="Special:Emailuser/EivindFOyangen"><sup>@</sup></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_EivindFOyangen_8edc.html" title="Special:Contributions/EivindFOyangen"><sup>c</sup></a> 16:10, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to Runaway Bride incident. 10 years from now, people will still remember "the story of that runaway bride", even if they don't remember her name. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStev0_d3b3.html" title="User:Stev0">Stev0</a> 18:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not understand the rationale of "why can't we forget her?". Why not happily forget her on a page just like the many many articles on forgettable TV series, Pokemon cards and other trivia. When and if some incident comes up and somebody reacalls the Willbank's fiasco for the sake of parallels, then the Wikipedia article will be a useful source of information on that, at the time, notable incident. The information is verifiable, it was sufficiently notable and may be called on again.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 20:29, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If it is renamed, United States and 2005 should probably be in the name too, "Runaway Bride Incident" is very vague. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 21:40, 27 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If we delete everything we'd rather forget about, will we be deleting any reference to the OJ Simpson trial and the whole Monica Lewinsky affair, too? Also, if you say "That Runaway Bride" to someone (at least in the U.S., and probably other countries where U.S. news is common), they'll know exactly who and what you are talking about. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStev0_d3b3.html" title="User:Stev0">Stev0</a> 21:48, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Rename</b> to Runaway Bride incident. It was a historical event in American <a href="../../../p/o/p/Popular_culture.html" title="Popular culture">popular culture</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per AYArktos. He has a point. She is at least as notable as some obscure Pokemon card or other fancruft. What, are we low on disk space? --<a href="../../../r/o/g/User%7ERogerd_6b4d.html" title="User:Rogerd">rogerd</a> 23:14, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's not that she deserves to be notable, or that the incident was notable. She's well on her way to being a stock figure in urban/media folklore, or popular culture, or whatever. Nobody ought to care about <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nicky_Hilton_bfe3.html" title="Nicky Hilton">Nicky Hilton</a>, either, but that's not the issue. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 23:38, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and do not rename, major media coverage at the time and continues a pop-culture figure.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- the event was a big enough media storm to reach pop culture status leading to the marketing of Bobbleheds and the like, and involved the FBI and Georgia Bureau of Investigation. -- <a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELonghair_25a8.html" title="User:Longhair">Longhair</a> 05:59, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> -- I vote to keep the page just like it is. People voting to delete it obviously care enough to take their time to comment here. I personally love that dummy. Keep her here!</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't think it is notable enough. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 09:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - she has not been forgotten by the media - see Google news search for steady trickle of articles. For example <a href="http://www.altmuslim.com/perm.php?id=1678_0_24_0_M" class="external text" title="http://www.altmuslim.com/perm.php?id=1678_0_24_0_M" rel="nofollow">The Forgotten Story Of Iman Muhanna Mohammad (found through Google News)</a> references Willbanks to contrast how the media treats incidents involving women of colour with white women.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a>\<sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 18:58, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm inclined to vote <b>delete</b>, but since deletion seems an unlikely possibility, I suppose I will case my vote for <b>rename</b> as above or <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_white_woman.html" title="Missing white woman">missing white woman</a> (or perhaps we could add her and all the others to a list of missing white women or some such thing). Failing that, let's try doing another afd in <i>ten</i> years.-<a href="../../../p/l/a/User%7EPlasmaDragon_68d9.html" title="User:PlasmaDragon">PlasmaDragon</a> 16:00, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- Who cares if the "media made a mistake"? She is notable by many standards. I mean, lots of kids fall down holes, but does that mean that we should consider deleting the <a href="../../../b/a/b/Baby_Jessica_e287.html" title="Baby Jessica">Baby Jessica</a> article because she wasn't special enough? That article is even more passé than this one! No, both were media darlings for a time, and both have name recognition worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../d/i/c/User%7EDickClarkMises_5a2d.html" title="User:DickClarkMises">Dick Clark</a> 22:01, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and do not rename per some suggestions; create redirects as necessary. Why would we throw away good content which has been online over 1 year? Ridiculous. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 04:10, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia is not limited for space and so we can provide articles that record past media frenzies. Keeping only the instances where the media were right and deleting those where they got wrong is hardly NPOV. I've got no opinion either way on the rename suggestions. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 16:02, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
