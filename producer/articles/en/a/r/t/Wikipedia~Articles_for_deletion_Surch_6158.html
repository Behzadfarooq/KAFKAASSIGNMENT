<li><b>Include</b> The page has been completely changed and the issues that you have talked about are taken out. But im going to disagree. Alexa is a widely used tool on the net and a creditable reference. There are many pages on wikipedia that list alexa. in addition you are referring to googles backlinks but not taking into account that they update on a whim when they want and how they want.... pagerank has not updated in almost 4 months so that is a completely unfair bias. Did you check msn or yahoo? Surch's traffic is far beyond most sites so the suggestion that it’s unknown is simply not true. I understand the issues with the first article but they have been changed.
<p>In addition, surch's alexa rating of 73K is a 3 MONTH average... todays total was 32K and our page views per user was higher than googles. So while we are new and our userbase is not that of the big3 it is growing and our users are consistent.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. --Surch 08:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Though the article does look somewhat better than it did when I first nominated it, it's still lacking sources. While I can appreciate that Surch might be a useful tool, unless there are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> out there that review the site, or something else that makes the article meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, the article cannot be included at this time. Additionally, I believe the editors above that refer to crystal-balling mean that a lot of the reasoning for inclusion of the article is based not on what the website/company has accomplished, but what it expects to -- in other words, that Surch isn't yet well-known, but will be. Let me state that although I still feel the article should be deleted at this time, I have no prejudice against recreation in the future if Surch turns out to be wildly successful and then meets criteria for inclusion (and I wish Surch well in this respect). --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I understand but there are hundreds of thousands of sites listed on wikipedia that have nowhere near the audience that surch has. In fact our Alexa rating today was 18K... Again, 8.9 page views per user. Alexa IMO is creditable enough. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=surch.com&amp;url=surch.com" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=surch.com&amp;url=surch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=surch.com&amp;url=surch.com</a> Please check todays totals then look at page views per user. Surch has not made in that page any reference to what it expects to do rather what it IS doing. I would suggest a site that gets well over a million uniques a day to be VERY well known. You make suggestion to "wildly successful" show me any site that is other than fortune 500's and then why dont you delete all the rest..that would leave wikipedia with say maybe a few thousand sites. --Surch 21:46, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. I suppose you are, to a point, correct. I will repost when surch meets the standards of Wikipedia. Although Wooty, its funny that you only reference google. I think someone once said... "We are all nothing but a flock of sheep, a button collar starched and bleached." In addition...Who was it, the macintosh boys that were turned down for VC by some no-name banker? Hrm. Funny that. I suppose at this point I will ask that surch be deleted.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are problems with Google, sure, but at the moment it's the best way to determine notability, unless you've got a bunch of links from notable websites handy.
