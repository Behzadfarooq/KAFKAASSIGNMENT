<p>I have no strong feelings about this nom one way or the other, but it has been suggested that it is somehow unfair not to have this article up for deletion when the article List of Playboy Playmates with D-cup or larger breasts is. So, this nomination. This article has been nominated twice before, see discussions <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_2nd" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_2nd" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Previous discussions seemed to get tainted fairly quickly with accusations of bad faith and other shenanigans, so let's try to keep to a minimum here, OK? My only concern with the article is that it's performer by genre. We've had some consensus emerge recently that "model by magazine" is unacceptable (see discussion of Category: Playgirl and Category: playgirl models <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_5#Category:Playgirl_models" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_5#Category:Playgirl_models" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the categories for Playboy models, Playboy Cyber Girls, Playboy Coeds of the Week and Playboy NSS models <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_14#Category:Playboy_models" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_November_14#Category:Playboy_models" rel="nofollow">here</a>. This may not be the same sort of issue but since previous discussions devolved so quickly an actual discussion of the article and the performer by genre situation is appropriate. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:30, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no good reason to delete this. The list is informative, if incomplete. If anything there should be a cross-referentce to the Playgirl model article (which by the way should also never have been deleted). [[User:JD] Dec. 19 2006]

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The fact that some performers are <i>marketed</i> as having large breasts (as opposed to merely <i>having</i> large breasts) is verifiable and vaguely notable.

<li><b>Delete</b> as unsourced, and as unmanageable because there is no objective way to determine exactly what qualifies as having a "big bust." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a></li>
<li>Most magazines and websites (like Score, the biggest magazine that focuses on busty women) usually consider D cup as the minimum size to be considered a big bust. <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 04:20, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as poorly defined. The lead says it's based not on marketing, but on having DD cups or larger. However, this is totally arbitrary <i>and</i> is based on obviously inflated marketing.

<dd>Except "comfortable" is not a recognisable category of cars (but "<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_recent_automobile_models_by_type.html#Luxury_cars" title="List of recent automobile models by type">luxury</a>" is), whereas "big-bust" is a recognisable category of porn actress.

<dd>Car categories are generally applied by third parties or by reputable manufacturers, at least. This list is only based on what porn stars have to say for themselves, and the article itself says such things are regularly inflated. A better analogy would be List of big dick porn stars -- we could put a size requirement on such a thing, but it still comes down basing a list on material known to be unreliable. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 04:19, 17 December 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's hardly "only based on what porn stars have to say for themselves": there are women on this list who, undeniably, have very large breasts. Also, since what makes this list notable is the popularity of big-tit porn, the fact that any given model <i>claims</i> to have large breasts is significant (and may even be a valid criterion for inclusion on the list!). <a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 04:47, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

(not all of this is porn), not just women who happen to have large breasts (i.e., Pamela
Anderson, Dolly Parton, etc.).

<dd>Yet pamela anderson is a performer known for her big breasts. Why is she listed as excluded? As for going by what porn stars have to say, we don't have such things as abstract undeniable facts around here, we require claims to be cited to reputable sources. Someone's promotional bio is not a reputable source for things that are often puffery, nor are our own observations of photographs. Such a thing would be considered <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 05:08, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pamela is not included because this is a list of peformers known for appearing in a particular subgenre of pornography, rather than known for having big boobs (which again is why what their actual measurements are is irrelevent). They are "big-bust performers", not "performers with big busts".<a href="../../../f/i/g/User%7EFiggyBee_3e70.html" title="User:FiggyBee">FiggyBee</a> 07:57, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Many people want to find information specifically about big-bust sex-perfomers because this is their natural sexual orientation and their interest. The purpose of Wikipedia is to provide factual information to people who want to know.

My only concern is that this article is likely to become populated with more and more redlinks as time goes on, as individual articles on these models tend to get AFD'd as these folks don't tend to get the awards necessary to meet <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a>'s criteria. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:17, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> one of the most popular pages on wikipedia. completely agree with Dekkappai --<a href="../../../h/e/x/User%7EHexvoodoo_cd57.html" title="User:Hexvoodoo">Hexvoodoo</a> 07:59, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. It's probably easier to classify who has modeled large breasts for publication than it is to, for example, determine what city or U.S. state someone is "from" when they lived in multiple cities, yet we have still "People from" categories. Also, the reasoning here doesn't make logical sense: List of Playboy Playmates with D-cup or larger breasts is <i>more</i> specific a subject than this article, so it would be a delete consensus on this article that would imply AfD on the other article, not the other way around. Letting AfD-keep advocates from one article drag more general articles into their mess comes close to the "someone lists one of your favourite articles on AfD and calls it silly" example in <a href="../../../d/o/_/Wikipedia%7EDo_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_f384.html" title="Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Do not disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. --<a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7ECloseapple_0d0e.html" title="User:Closeapple">Closeapple</a> 20:12, 19 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Unlike the Playmates one, this is encyclopedic and worthy of inclusion. Since many of these performers are famous -specifically- for their bust size, it's significant enough to warrant a list. <a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelin_3044.html" title="User:Maelin">Maelin</a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaelin_3bd2.html" title="User talk:Maelin">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Maelin_b8b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Maelin">Contribs</a>)</small> 00:45, 20 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This debate more than the existance of this article has proven the complete confusion over what Wikipedia actually is. This would <i>never</i> make it into an encyclopedia. It doesn't really matter if it stays or not, no one is going to be harmed by this article being here. But why bother defining Wikipedia as an encyclopedia when in reality it is just a collection of random information. Let's just give up trying to market ourselves as an encyclopedia and be honest about what this project really is... a searchable database of random information. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 12:32, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Exactly, Martin. And Wikipedia, as it is currently set up, will <i>never</i> be a rival to traditional encyclopedias on the traditional subjects-- science, mathematics, history... At best, it will be only an easy starting point for information on these subjects. Articles on these subjects by anonymous, uncredentialed editors is <i>never</i> going to rival writing by experts in their fields. It is <i>exactly</i> subjects like this, which will not be found in traditional encyclopedias, and on which is is nearly impossible to fine unbiased, non-commercial, sourced information which is Wikipedia's strongest point. Articles like this are <i>exactly</i> the kind in which Wikipedia has the advantage over traditional encyclopedias and other reference sources. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 16:49, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> That I agree with. So what I was thinking was this: rather than spend time debating if something is original research, sourced etc. why not just face the facts as you described them above? Debates like the one we are having here are surreal. We are trying to apply academic principles to determine the value of a list of big-bust models. Am I the only one to whom that sounds totally surreal? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 16:57, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, I've also noticed the surrealism that can creep up in these arguments on more than one occasion, but I suppose that's to be expected. I do agree with Wiki's original research/NPOV/sourcing rules. Just because an article is on a non-traditional subject doesn't mean it can't be well-written, sourced, etc. These are valuable policies. I do think that these rules are sometimes applied more strictly-- sometimes absurdly so-- to some subjects than others, depending on the biases of particular editors. But that's another issue. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 17:09, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree that those are important policies. They just aren't very suited for debating a list of big-bust models. And if we agree that this is the kind of articles that Wikipedia does better than anyone else then maybe we should consider the criterias we use when discussing this kind of article or at least to what degree we should apply these policies. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 17:28, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I think what we're getting at here is the difference between form and content. My understanding is that Wikipedia strives to be an encylopedia in <i>form.</i> Its goal is to produce well-written, reasonably unbiased, appropriately sourced articles on a wide variety of subjects, like a traditional encyclopedia. However, when editors seek to delete articles like this on the grounds that they are "unencyclopedic," what they mean is that they are unencyclopedic in <i>content,</i> not necessarily in form. "Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia," means Wikipedia does not seek to imitate the <i>content</i> of a traditional encyclopedia, only its <i>form.</i> So a well-written article on every pop-culture reference in one episode of <i>The Simpsons,</i> or a list of Playboy Playmates whose bra cup is D or above, as long as they are encyclopedic in <i>form,</i> are perfectly appropriate. That's my take on it anyway. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:45, 21 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thank you. Putting it that way it becomes much more clear to me what is meant by the word <i>encyclopedia</i> around here. I was getting to the point where I was getting frustrated but putting it like you just did it becomes perfectly clear to me. I hope a lot more people than me read your responses to me because it really clarifies things a lot and would make many of these AfD's a lot more to the point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 18:58, 21 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as per Figgy. Also, there are several ways to define what "big" means. Having a size D or up, inclusion in big-bust videos/magazines, self-identification as having large breasts, these are all options. All of which can be sourced.
