<li>I took the liberty of making the main article the title so that people actually get to read the reasons why the band is notable before getting to the silly articles about their albums. A quick check will reveal that this is <i>not</i> a 'walled garden'. There are links from major articles into <i>Salvation Air Force</i> and <i>Tom Howard</i>.

<li>I hate to put a damper on the spirit of debate, but <b>why</b> do we think this band is non-notable? They satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in at least three different ways; they have recorded several albums with a major record label; they have toured internationally; they have worked with major names in the music business. Everybody is entitled to their opinion but I'd really appreciate it if someone who said 'not notable' would say <i>why</i> they think that. Thanks. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 16:52, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the debate is re-framed and re-defined it's always easy to question what's been said in the past but your lobbying to keep the band appears to be sincere. I will take the position that the band may or may not be (barely) notable -- although the Let's Boogie For Jesus! article shows that a band member (Donnie Gossett) wrote most of the songs, produced the album, and the album's label was donniegossett.com (for authors in print media this looks and feels like vanity press) -- that notwithstanding, its members and its albums are not. Not every album issued by even an undisputedly notable group is worthy of an article: some major artists have no discography (e.g., <a href="../../../g/l/e/Glen_Campbell_544b.html" title="Glen Campbell">Glen Campbell</a>) or where they do, see the discography section of many important artists and you'll see an absence of links (e.g., <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Cash_discography_fcd4.html" title="Johnny Cash discography">Johnny_Cash_discography</a>) or red ones. Now, perhaps some people think that Salvation is bigger than Campbell or Cash, but IMHO they're not. Moreover, members of notable groups are not inherently notable. For example, see, e.g., the article <a href="../../../a/2A/t/A_Teens_f253.html" title="A*Teens">A*Teens</a>; each member's name is a redirect to the group which says all that need be said about the members which in some cases (like birthdates and places) is more extensive than those of Salvation's member's long-winded articles. The A*Teens, regardless of what you may think of them, have sold 8 million albums -- the Salvation article provides no sales numbers, so no assertion of notability on that score. So, in short, the band may or may not be a vanity-press produced group either barely notable or just not notable. The band members and its albums are clearly not notable. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:02, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wouldn't disagree that the articles on then individual albums need to go, but the early albums for this band were on <a href="../../../m/y/r/Myrrh_Records_a086.html" title="Myrrh Records">Myrrh Records</a>, a division of <a href="../../../w/o/r/Word_Records_5fdc.html" title="Word Records">Word Records</a>, definitely not a small player, especially in the Christian music business. I'm not sure they've sold 8 million albums but this is definitely not vanity publishing. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 21:21, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have less problem with the group than with the albums and band members. It seems we're at least on accord there. But as I understand it Myrrh has gone through some change of control and that it's name was apparently detached from its legacy, but I'm not familiar with when that happened and it's not really worthwhile to figure that out -- others will do so. The named album that was the original title of the AfD is the one that appears to be vanity publishing and nothing you've said contradicts <i>that</i>. However, as the original nomination was for the albums and the band members, my vote on them remains <b>Delete</b>. As for the band itself, I'll take <b>no position</b> and let the consensus consense (nice made up verb?) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 04:40, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrash_3aff.html" title="User:Krash">User:Krash</a> also left some explanations on my talk page pointing out that the band gets no entry on allmusic or Amazon and only 400 or so Google hits, plus the article was written mostly by one person. Honestly I have to admit that those are very bad signs and I would be skeptical myself. All I could say was that the band was mainly active long before the internet, and (I would have to admit) not big enough that their back-catalogue is still on sale in anything except specialty used outlets. I don't know what happened to Myrhh later, but at the time they were owned by Word, and Word was unquestionably the biggest publisher of modern Christian music, in the days before it was fashionable.</dd>
<dd>I should also probably say that Let's Boogie For Jesus! <i>does</i> look like vanity publishing. My vote for that is now <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> 23:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
