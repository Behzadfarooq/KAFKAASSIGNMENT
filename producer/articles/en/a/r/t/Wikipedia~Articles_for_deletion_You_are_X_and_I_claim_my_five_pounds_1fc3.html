<p>Wikipedia is not a repository for articles about relatively infrequent internet snowclones occurring occaisionally on usenet. Basically, non-notable neo-phrasism, and this sort of thing is the gateway article to a mountain of new articles, with variables in their names. Maybe if the article were about the original phrase, with a note that it has spawned many snowclone usages, but for crying out loud, Wikipedia is not your clubhouse. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 07:34, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't realize Ad Hominem Attacks were a legitmate portion of discussion. Might I ask what bearing my contribution history has on whether or not this very article is in any way notable enough to be its own article? The google search on "You are * and I claim my five pounds" gets a paltry 614 hits. not that that's definitive proof, but for comparison, "I for one welcome our new * overlords" gets 113,000 hits. And it doesn't have its own page.<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 12:57, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> <i>Ad hominem</i> attacks are not acceptable here (see <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>), but the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> says that arguments/votes from new users may be given less weight or no weight. Some deletion debates prompt a flood of votes from people who are interested in the topic but who don't know Wikipedia policies and disregard them in voting. When your only contributions are delete tags, rather than editing researched facts and citations into articles, it's reasonable to note this. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 13:59, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hi: I'm a new user here myself. I found this discussion because I was voting at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Anabasii_27e7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anabasii">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Anabasii</a>, which is from the same guy. I didn't realize that arguments and votes from new users don't count. Does that mean I shouldn't have bothered voting to keep the anabasii article (and probably this one, since it looks good to me)? I thought new users were allowed to participate everywhere on Wikipedia. Jimpartame 14:07, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, I think I messed up the threading on these comments. Jimpartame 14:19, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The part about them being deletions, then, is irrelevant. It is about my new-ness as a user. So, really, the comment should have been, "User is new, disregard his comments without considering them on their merits"? is that official wikipolicy? <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 14:06, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is not exactly like that. There is no official Wikipedia policy to ignore votes from new users. What is meant here is a guideline to give less weight to votes from new users, with little or no actual reasoning or explanation. Your comments on this AfD debate are well-written and reasonable. Therefore I don't think they will be automatically ignored just because you're new. What the guideline is meant for is to ignore votes that only consist of "<b>Don't delete!</b> This is a cool phrase!", and to ignore votes that appear to have been written by the same person with multiple user accounts. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:27, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> JIP is correct. We don't treat new users' contributions here as zero-value. I apologize if my note explaining ajm's posting made TerrorIsland or Jiumpartame think otherwise. If you have facts that are relevant under WP policies, please <i>do</i> tell us those facts and cite sources where they can be verified. If you are merely making assertions without factual backing or ones that don't help determine whether the article meets Wikipedia policies, the administrator who closes the AfD debate will usually give less weight to a new user's words (if apparently well-intended), or give no weight to it (if suspected of being intended for self-promotion or feuding or otherwise not to improve the encyclopedia). Remember also that AfD is a discussion seeking consensus, not a vote. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 22:26, 14 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> If this is really a forum for discussion, I am surprised at the number of people who indicated their position as a vote, rather than trying to discuss the matter. Very few people have responded to my contention that a catchphrase, even if popular in variation (like a snow clone) gets an article for the phrase itself, not the template with a variable in it. I don't understand why, if this isn't just voting, very few people are discussing the things I said, and instead list a vote followed by some positive feature, like, "notable". <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 22:48, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think you're confusing ad hominem and personal attack. A reply can be <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> without seeming like a vicious personal attack. Any response to a challenge that weighs the qualities of the person levying the charge instead of the merits of the charge itself is an argument ad hominem (against the man) rather than against the claim itself. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 14:09, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>As long as we can call me a name before deciding to keep the article, I suppose all is well. I am not a deletionist, unless by that you mean someone who thinks that there are some articles which should be deleted. Because then, sure I am. Phrases of that form get 614 google hits. Can anyone tell me where all of theses uses are that mysteriosly don't come up on google searches? Also, why is this article about the phrasal template and not about the origin phrase, which is how all other snowclones are listed?<a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 13:54, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have struck out my comment as it was not serious, I just wanted a chance to use this phrase. Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, I was a huge fan of Amiga computers and games. I read many British Amiga magazines regularly, and thus became more familiar with British culture than most Finns of my age. I noticed that several magazines contained this phrase, but I had no idea what it meant or where it had come from. Then I found it on Wikipedia and it explained it to me. These mentions obviously do not show up on Google as it does not yet search through printed material. So that explains why I think it is notable. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:17, 14 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Doesn't it seem odd to you that most catchphrase articles are about the original catchphrase, rather than having a variable in their name? Shouldn't the article actually be "You Are Lobby Lud and I claim my five pounds?" Or merged in to the Lobby Lud, article at least? I still think its not notable enough, but I am confused why people who do think the content is notable enough think the article should be kept rather than merged, moved or redirected. Also, I apologize for misinterpreting the tone of your initial vote. Sometimes its hard to tell when people are kidding on the internet. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrorIsland_fc70.html" title="User:TerrorIsland">TerrorIsland</a> 14:23, 14 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The expression in the title is not notable. In fact, it is either not a complete expression, or it accuses someone of being the letter 'X'. I think you mean the expression "You are Lobby Lud and I claim my five pounds" is notable.
