<p>Wait a second everybody. These articles may not interest you. That doesn't mean that they are entirely uninteresting in any objective sense. I am beginning to sense a hint of elitism and privileged snobbery in some of these postings. Christendom may be a small college in the South, but for those who attended it, and those who are interested in it, St. Kevin's is a notable phenomenon. FYI, the videos were shown to the whole college and many alumni and residents of Front Royal.</p>
<p>Agree wholeheartedly with the judgment of that last post. An accredited institution of higher learning merits a post on this encyclopedia, so why can't its dormitories as well? There are those nationwide who have attended this college and lived in this particular dormitory. They are entitled to chronicle the histories of the years in which this dormitory was operational, since there are those who will have interest. Most especially, those who are prospective students or alumni. You all sound extremely supercilious, to say the least.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I removed the speedy tag. The criteria, (CSD A7) says "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance. If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead. For details, see Wikipedia:Deletion of vanity articles." Unless you can point to a place where it says that being a political candidate is specifically <b>not</b> to be considered an "assertion of that person's importance or significance", the article <b>does</b> make such a claim, and therefore cannot be speedied under A7. Nevertheless, I agree that it is nn, and should be deleted. Just not speedied, at least AFAIK. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJesseW_sig_acb0.html" title="User:JesseW/sig">JesseW, the juggling janitor</a> 09:08, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Statement of one's job is specifically mentioned as not being an assertion of notability. Obviously, some jobs (head of state of a country, for example) are exceptions. Trying and failing to get a job can't in my book be considered an assertion of notability either then. However, since the speedy tag was removed, there's obviously disgreement, so it looks like it'll be dragged through Afd. I personally still see no reason not to speedy this, but Afd is for when there's disagreement, so here we are. I noticed there's been some backlog in Afd lately so I'm looking for ways to reduce the number of articles that have to go thru it.

<li><b>Keep</b> To point out to people: it has been confirmed in a trailer that there will be a skull kid, as featured in the picture. However, as for what we know right now, this new Skull Kid could be a main character. If you'd like, put a "subject to change" notice.

<li>Dude, log in to vote on the AfDs for your pages. The others deserve to know that you're the author, and therefore biased.

<li>Two problems with that. A) The title has no merit. No one who understands Wikipedia is going to type "Skull Kid (Twilight Princess)" any more than they would type "Skull Kid (Ocarina of Time)". There's nothing to suggest that it's a major character, most people don't even know it's present. B)If this skull kid does appear, it's likely to be unrelated to the one in <i>Majora's Mask</i>. There's more than one skull kid, they were minor enemies/characters in <i>OoT</i>. So the redirect you suggest would be misleading. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikidSmaht_d49d.html" title="User:WikidSmaht">WikidSmaht</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/k/User_talk%7EWikidSmaht_41da.html" title="User talk:WikidSmaht">talk</a>) 09:59, 19 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Agreed</b> Hi, this is Aidan Coughlan, just agreeing with ya there. I didn't put up the page myself, it was probably one of the shallower of my friends (who was fairly overawed by the fact that I was in the paper, she thought this qualified me as some sort of celeb! Go figure!) so it's definitely not a vanity thing - although i had no objections to it being up, despite it being a tad odd, once it started getting vandalised I realised it's better off coming down.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Someone seems to have a grudge against Family Guy&#160;;-) Seriously, they are episode pages like those of any other series. There is no original research in them. As for "cite", the episode which is summerised is a valid source. The person who made these accusations should back them up, as they seem pretty random and unfounded to me. And while he's at it, he should justify why he's going after Family Guy episodes only. Is it more researched or sourced to describe an episode of another series? Or is he planning to mass-delete all episode pages of all series?

<dd>The "debate" was when the page was porrly written, not when it was uncited. It is original research; the authors are getting their info from their knowledge of the episode.

<dd>So by your judgement, any movie/book/tv show page that has a summary of the work is "uncited original research"? That's nonesense. It is cited, and the source is the movie/book/tv show being summarised. And if that's "original research", then every page where something's expressed in the writer's words instead of being copy-pasted from a book or encyclopedia - which is to say, every single page in wikipedia - is guilty of original research. And since we cannot copy-paste articles from encyclopedias (you know, with those pesky copyright laws and all), then we might as well shut down wikipedia right now and save you the trouble of listing every last page. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:02, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, Wikipedia is a ternary source, so it shoud get information from secondary sources.

<dl>
<dd>It is not an <i>interpretation</i>, it is a <i>summary</i>. It is a factual description of what happens in the episode. "Peter gets trapped on a desert island. He comes back after several months, and finds Brian has married Lois. He wins Lois over again." There is no original research in there. If the text were to read, say, "In a very unoriginal plot twist, Peter gets trapped on a desert island. But the Robinson story was better. Lois married Brian -- ewww gross, bestiality is wrong! But Peter wins Lois over again, yay Peter! He's so great, I love him so much!" then that would be a fan interpretation of the show, and you'd have a case. But there is nothing in wikipedia policy against putting factual information in - in fact, that's what wikipedia in for.</dd>
<dd>And another thing, did you actually read the <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> page? I'd like you to find me a part of it that can says, or even that can be loosely interpreted as saying, that a factual NPOV movie/book/tv show summary constitutes original research. That's kinda important for your case, since you're aiming to delete most of wikipedia based on that argument. -- <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22:16, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm all for compromise, but I'm not sure I follow your logic here in asserting that the articles are uncited. It seems to me that if an article is about a TV show, the <i>show</i> is the citation... the citation is implied and should be obvious. Same goes if I am writing an article for a film; the plot summary, cast, etc are technically "uncited" in that I have not made a citation, but the <i>film</i> is the citation. Now if I write something about the critical reception, that requires a citation. So, what exactly are you suggesting? Are you saying that one can't write an article about a television show unless a secondary source has summarized its plot, therefore providing one with a citation? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 23:03, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes it does, but the problem with it is that <i>Family Guy</i> is so symbiotically connected into American pop culture that Wikipedia is better able to put it all into context. In this way it is very different from another TV show that has its own Wiki, <i>Star Trek</i>. In some ways, the <i>Star Trek</i> universe is highly self-contained, it could exist in the absence of 20th Century American pop culture. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECromulent_Kwyjibo_1af7.html" title="User:Cromulent Kwyjibo">Cromulent Kwyjibo</a> 20:44, 3 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I have found these guides to be incredibly useful, especially when attempting to decipher the many vague (I was born in '90) cultural references made on Family Guy. The guides are really just factually summaries; the WP policy isn't holy writ, and I believe that quite reasonably, we can bend the rules a bit. And yes, if you did delete this extensive amount of work, you would have to do so for just about every uncited TV show entry out there and minor article stub. If you must, put that uncited banner above the article.

<li>I certainly wish we could bend the rules here (seriously), but with editors treating even short essays as concrete, unbreakable rules (notability), I don't expect to see rule-bending here. It's either accept the rules or, when a deletionist is losing a battle, <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">flat-out ignore</a> them. At this point, <b>I am not trying to delete all this work.</b> I realize that they are great articles as far as quality of writing is. I just wish that the rules would stop being bent for TV shows and someone could introduce citations. If an article is uncited, it's original research, which is no-exceptions banned on Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../c/c/o/User%7ECcool2ax_5c31.html" title="User:Ccool2ax"><font color="blue">Chris</font></a> <a href="../../../c/c/o/User_talk%7ECcool2ax_7ce5.html" title="User talk:Ccool2ax"><font color="green" size="1">Ccool2ax</font></a> <font color="gray" size="1"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ccool2ax_93c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ccool2ax">contrib.</a></font> 03:56, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It would be absurd to delete virtually every TV show and movie page on Wikipedia, but almost all were written by a viewer based on what they saw rather than by citing a third party summary.

<li>This is getting nonsensical in my opinion. Research on any topic is at some point original. Can a shared experience i.e watching a tv programme be considered research? Research suggests pursuing something to an end no-one has reached before. There is nothing on any of the Family Guy pages that anyone couldn't find out through seeing the relevent shows. It's a matter of knowledge rather than research. As a British person watching Family Guy I don't get all of the cultural references.

Amazingly, his buddy John Self (so called reviewer) not only continue to hound unprovoke Mr Wright, but they've started a hate campaign via <a href="http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.jessejameson.blogspot.com</a> and <a href="http://www.crapauthors.com" class="external free" title="http://www.crapauthors.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crapauthors.com</a>. This call for a deletion from two unstable characters such as Connor Wolf (Dave Briggs of Ely) and John Self (John Simpson from Belfast)who also run another <a href="http://www.palimpsest.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.palimpsest.org.uk" rel="nofollow">hate-filled and prejudice site</a> is highly questionable at best and just simply wrong at worst. Again, the facts are clear. Look at the history on wikipedia regarding this so-called deletion. Connor Wolf bagan this. Look at the other crap he has spouted about any reputable author connected with Sean Wright and <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crowswing_Books_11b6.html" title="Crowswing Books">Crowswing Books</a>. This guys (John and Connor) are duping you. They spread shit wherever they can. Check them out!<br />
<br />
If this article is deleted (along with all the others that Connor Wolf is attempting delete in connection to Sean Wright and Crowswing) then the admin guys and girls are condoning a prejudice, dirty tricks campaign that began on Palimpsest.org.uk 21 months ago! These two guys need deleting from Wikipedia, not Sean Wright and Crowswing Books, or any other legitimate author connected with Crowswing. For God sake check out the facts!!! Wikipedia's reputation depends on it. The following authors are involved with Crowswing Books (who are NOT a vanity publisher, far from it). Many of these authors have long and notable publishing careers. Allen Ashley, Andrew Hook, Michael Mirolla, Gary Moeser, Lisa DuMond, Gary McMahon, Che Ballard, Jeff Gardiner, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Mills_3f04.html" title="Sam Mills">Sam Mills</a>, P.

If you take the time to check out these authors you WILL find that many have been nominated or won the World Fantasy Award, British Fantasy Award, or International Horror Guild Award. These are legitimate, reputable, verifiable awards. Do a bit of research - in the name of sanity and fair play.</li>

You are accusing me of being someone else, which is fine, but you should stick to the discussion at hand. This article is a vanity piece created from an unregistered user and all the other articles related to it also since they are promotional and not informative. I've taken a look into the authors you mention and the only one of any note was Ramsey Campbell, whom you have not published.

<li><b>Keep</b> Considering YOU - Connor Wolf - began the Sean Wright page on Wikipedia, I find your argument rather hollow and confused. As can be seen from the list of edits and discussions, this article has developed in the spirit of neutrality. Check out the ealiest history to see that it was so. Connor Wolf lies through his canine teeth. Here's Connor's first attempted, referring EVERY review of Sean Wright's books over to one site - his site!!! at Palimpsest.org.uk [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Wright&amp;oldid=21237683" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sean_Wright&amp;oldid=21237683" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><br />

<li>Unsigned user above: (who is, most likely, [Sean Wright]]) I <i>don't</i> have a site and I did not create this page; only edited it. So, for the last time, I am not the person you think I am. Believe me, I've read those reviews and - having only had experience of Jaarfindor - I can wholeheartedly agree with the people who wrote them. Try to understand, however, that although that site may have a campaign against you, Connor Wolf is not a member of it. Believe me, your writing is <i>that</i> bad that it's not unlikely other people will begin to question why you bother, like I did. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConnor_Wolf_efa1.html" title="User:Connor Wolf">Connor Wolf</a> 08:17, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - long and significant legal battles ensued in Australia - connected to the amount of damages he received from the Govt personal injury insurer after the accident (which was judged to not have been his fault). Witnesses in court included Hollywood <i>pundits</i> who testified Blake was destined to be a star of Mel Gibson proportions, so should receive much more damages for loss of future earnings. Another legal battle I believe concerned the capping of the amount for damages - which differed in the state where the accident occured (South Australia) and the state where Blake resided (New South Wales)... should he get the lower South Australian amount or the higher NSW figure I believe was one argument I don't have the details at hand but this is a big and notable story. <a href="../../../m/i/n/User%7EMinorEdit_0301.html" title="User:MinorEdit">MinorEdit</a> 02:29, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This site is already covered in some detail at Government Simulator. It is not notable enough for its own page as it certainly has less than 500 players. This borders on advertising and vanity.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a bad faith VfD.

NavalWar1800 also disobeyed the page's instructions to keep the links alphabetized and moved the USGS external link to the top of the list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Government_simulation&amp;diff=23260265&amp;oldid=23084843" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Government_simulation&amp;diff=23260265&amp;oldid=23084843" rel="nofollow">link</a>. The last VfD motion was made by USGS members who (wrongly) believed AGS members were trying to delete their page in Wikipedia. <b>Additionally, more than half of NavalWar1800's contributions to Wikipedia have been directed toward deleting this entry.</b> NavalWar1800's decision to add nearly a page of USGS information to the Government Simulation entry, coupled with his move to delete this page immediately after another USGS-sponsored VfD failed, calls his credibility into question. <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>. <a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcarlson33_70ca.html" title="User:Bcarlson33">Bcarlson33</a> 17:27, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> That some other agency is keeping track of it with a Wiki or any other means shouldn't have any bearing on whether Wikipedia has an article or not. On second thought, as it might add to the verifyability of the info, it could actually subtract form the arguments in favor of article deletion, if verifiability had been under question, which in this case it hadn't. Borderline article in my opinion, and I don't feel strongly enough on this one to take the time to decide which side of the borderline I'd rather be on. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 04:05, 18 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> There is simply no reason to maintain this page. It is pure advertising. It is not notable in any way and it is covered (and has a paragraph's worth of writing) on the Government Simulator page. Absolutely no reason to keep unless we intend to start allowing advertising for every internet game that pops up. I might also add that their having a Wiki does not add to its legitimacy. They track their in-game events so they can remember who their President etc. was. It is irrelevant to the purpose of an encyclopedia that tracks factual events in the real world. <a href="../../../n/a/v/User%7ENavalWar1800_82d3.html" title="User:NavalWar1800">NavalWar1800</a> 03:34, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Certainly a previous AfD whose result was "no consensus" does not constitute a sufficient reason to keep. I was going to vote "delete" because the article doesn't indicate any distinction beyond lots of these other exercises. Some make a voting member of anyone who registers. But a Google search gives lots of hits (9950 using the three words in quotes, which are pretty generic even in that sequence). Many high hits are WP (we're #2) or mirrors. Some high hits are other games or face-to-face simulations, and I'm not sure how much this one stands out from its field. I noticed that the only "innovations" cited in the article are different features than this simulation's predecessor. Nothing indicates it meets <a href="../../../i/_/_/WP%7EI_cd77.html" title="WP:I">WP:I</a> if there are just a few surveys of what's out there in this category without any real indication of pioneering or changing its field or garnering attention of many thousands of people. <b>Weak delete</b> per NavalWar1800 unless someone can demonstrate more significance. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 06:31, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. PHWComics is a non-profit team that makes comics basically just for the fun of it and entertainment to show others. They are not in it for making money and this article does not exist for "free advertising". It is merely here to tell people who PHWComics is, what they do, and maybe even teach people a few tricks and techniques for making comics along the way. Go and check out the site and take a look if you don't believe me. -- <b>Zeus (PHWComics fan)</b></li>

<p><br />
<i>Note from a member of PHWComics--</i> As a member of the mentioned site, we are not looking for free advertising, we are non-profit. We are part of a larger community that uses something called Garry's Mod for Half-Life to to make comics, contraptions and more. The mod is basically a free physics sandbox for the game Half-Life 2 from VAVLe Software, and it a little bit of an Internet phenomena that we felt should be documented. We feel that it is no more of a advertisement than the page for Homestar Runner page also featured here. -- <b>BrashFink (PHWComics)</b><br /></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not notable. Even if it isn't advertising it still doesn't warrant an article. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandy_Johnston_1e7a.html" title="User:Randy Johnston">Randy</a> 23:21, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<i>Note from a member of PHWComics--</i> Well, one of the comics, namely mine, "Apostasy" was notable enough to be in 3 major British Magazines; PC Gamer UK, PC Zone and FHM UK Edition. Some of the other sites that have featured it are 1up.com, BoingBoing.net, GameSpot.com and SlashDot. It was also featured on G4TV's "Attack of the Show" Go do a google search for "Apostasy Comic", there are tons of links, even in other languages. If it is voted out, that is perfectly fine. I just wanted to note that we were not "looking for something" by posting this, we were just trying to add to the greater "net consciousness" about something. -- <b>BrashFink (PHWComics)</b></p>

<dd>I don't dispute that it's relatively well known for the moment, but so are lots of Internet e-mail forwards and novelty websites, very few of which deserve any mention in an encyclopedia. What is this article going to say six months or a year from now, when the interest in this bile has died down and the website is defunct? "Briefly controversial rant against Southerners copied by many <a href="../../../w/e/b/Weblog.html" title="Weblog">weblogs</a>, some approving, some disapproving"? IMO, this kind of thing makes Wikipedia into an compedium of stuff-I-just-heard-about instead of a proper encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../t/y/s/User%7ETysto_ecb9.html" title="User:Tysto">Tysto</a> 02:50, 19 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Abstain</b> at this time, because I am too disturbed by the website itself. I am from the South. The website that the article refers to is a hate-filled misinformed rant directed against a small percentage of southerners, the ones Hollywood uses as clichÃ© villains. Yes, there are <i>Bubbas</i> who own assault rifles and fly the Confederate battle flag (and might not recognize any of the real Confederate flags). They are a minority. This is the Bible Belt so there are people who think they are Christians preaching hate against homosexuals. Those two groups alone do not make a majority, but voting with other conservatives and some moderates get a slight majority. Nationally, in the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2004_3ccd.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2004">2004 presidential race</a> Bush received 50.7% and Kerry received 48.7% of the of the popular vote. To assume that everyone in the South thinks the same way based on which party wins elections is just wrong. The web site just is another divisive factor in the United States, based on regionalism instead of some other prejudice. Ask yourself as you think about this AfD - <b>is notoriety the same thing as notability?</b> I will vote later, after I have had some time to think and to review the Wikipedia article for NPOV and to review policies. -<a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 23:58, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This either needs to be pared down or deleted. According to this list, nearly every celebrity in America and parts of Europe is a gay icon. Just because gay people like a certain celebrity doesn't make that person some kind of idol to the homosexual community; the vast majority of the people on this list hold the same status with gays as they do with blacks, whites, men, women, and yes, heterosexuals. I realize that gay icons exist-- Cher, to be sure-- but 99% of the people on this list do not have some kind of special affinity directed at them by gays, nor do they possess some kind of high standing in the gay community. They just so happen to be heavily lusted after in gay pop culture (Bruce Willis, for example)-- the same way they are lusted after by straights.70.242.12.23 04:56, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Vociferously seconded. Cher, ABBA, Judy Garland, the Village People et cetera, all undeniably gay icons. Jennifer Aniston? Not so much. Besides, methinks a distinction must be made between gay icons and celebrities who simply happen to be gay or bisexual themselves, no matter how famously, infamously, or flamingly.</li>
<li>This item should be deleted. The category 'gay icon' is meaningless. So-called gay icons are also admired by all sorts of people. How about a left-handed'peoples' icons list or a color-blind peoples' icon list? The other problems is who gets to decide who is a gay icon? The decisions have to be totally subjective and, thus, invalid. Also, the implication is that whoever is a gay icon, is gay themselves. In the vast majority of cases that, of course, is not true. Get rid of the aritcle. ArielS</li>

<li>I agree, it has nothing to do with raising the profile of the gay community. On the one hand, the choices are verifiable, by having discussions about why or why not certain people should or should not be listed...with members of the gay community, of which I am one.

<li><b>KEEP</b>.I think that to dismiss it out of hand as being flippant or somehow peurile is unwise. This entry presents something of a second rate paradox, but nevertheless it is saying that it is what it is. So I believe that for Wikipedians to act responsibly in this matter they surely must accept that a Squub is what it says it is. Its all very well dismissing this entry as a protologism, but where do you draw the line? to whit; at what point did "protologism" cease to be a protologism and enter the lexicon? I ask because the English language predates whatever point in time the word protologism was cobbled together, and it was only cobbled together to apply a label to a thing. So a body of guardians preserving our glorious language at that point in history in the same way that those crying for deletion are doing now would have succesfully prevented the establishment of the term "protologism" which would effectively render this call for deletion irrelevent, unintelligible and illogical. A Squub is a thing, and Wikipedians calling for a deletion ought to take measure of their pulse and perhaps re-read the democratic manifesto of Wikipedia before consigning this neologism to the incinerator.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkMarion_0f8b.html" title="User:MarkMarion">MarkM</a> 14:41, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think anyone is "consigning this neologism to the incinerator".

<p>May I therefore ask a couple of question that may appear to be facetious but in fact in neither case do I intend to be:</p>
<p>1. At what point would you consider the term sufficiently used to qualify for inclusion? 2. In general, is the acceptance of a neologism on a scale grander than 'X' one of the prime requirements for qualification?</p>
<p>In respect of question one, I would suggest that for Wikipedia to establish a quantity-quantifier system would lead to a similar situation as now faces the Kansas board of Education. A recent declaration that for a religious movement to qualify for the curriculum required 'X' amount of followers immediately prompted worldwide adoption of the religion of the Flying Spaghetti Monster in numbers that swamped the Kansas Board's own "Tipping Point"... I use a neologism there with my tongue in my cheek you understand.</p>
<p>In respect of question number two, Could I ask that you consider that whatever figure you decide 'X' might be, it would require individuals of greater than that number by at least one significant other to conceive of and declare new words ABSOLUTELY SIMULTANEOUSLY for any evolution of vocabulary to take place. So even if you say 'X equals 1' then no new words can ever be brought into existence unless two people simultaneously conceive and declare that word.</p>
<p>I look forward to your response. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkMarion_0f8b.html" title="User:MarkMarion">MarkM</a> 14:41, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia is not a personal weblog, it's an encyclopedia. Users should not be making paragraph long articles on themselves. There is ample area for discussion and socialization on this site, however, creating articles for this purpose is not beneficial to the community. 153.104.16.114 23:03, 17 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
