<li><b>Weak Keep</b> A few releases listed on <a href="http://allmusic.com" class="external text" title="http://allmusic.com" rel="nofollow">AllMusicGuide</a> and Amazon albeit on obscure label (Slap A Ham).

<li>Delete: I can't quite agree with the above. (I have an AMG entry on my band, and I zealously oppose an article on it, so I'm not being hipocritical.) The reason is that the article says nothing, really, about a band, but merely offers a substub about a <i>guy in the band</i> who owns some..something... and then that there is a screen name in use with the same name. Basically, two CSD "empty" articles combined into one.

<li>Delete: It's not a web radio station, according to the article. Thus, if this is an actual radio station, the article is mistitled, as it should be listed by call letters, and not slogan or trade name. Verification is therefore made all the worse.

<li>Oh, radio was their medium, absolutely. Duck's Breath Mystery Theater and Firesign Theater were, with the National Lampoon Radio Hour, very popular high brow entertainment in the early days of FM (1970's). Their albums sell/sold well, and their syndicated shows were very popular. However, they were never a visual act, and Nick Danger, in particular, is very thin visually. This is the scene that the first Saturday Night Live cast came out of (not this particular troupe, but the nightclub and radio performers of the West Coast in the 1970's). <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 04:32, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as the article is factually correct and NPOV, it should not be up to the author whether it is included or not. Ms. Barber is notable for her publications both on and off the Web. What's with calling someone a "terrible person"?

notmyrealdomain is more then a forum. To some, it is an entire way of life. In the forum private section, some of the more venerable have made such threats as to kick their dog if the site is not listed in Wikipedia. By no means am I an animal lover, but I would hate to see a dog be needlessly kicked. notmyrealdomaintites are all very upset. Also note that notmyrealdomainism may eventually evolve into a religion.</p>

Let me explain this last: These are practices that qualify as "unsafe sex," but they are not practices that are unsafe inherently. Inasmuch as "safe sex" and "unsafe sex" are both compounds that refer implicitly to HIV/AIDS, they have lost their literal meaning of "safe" and "unsafe" + "sexual intercourse." 4.

<dd>Comment: This is a hard call, so I'm exercisigin my judgement. Several said the entry to be kept only if changed to some titles. For instance current title (about "standard classes") has a HUGE <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. The titles as "known by many" are way ambiguous, etc... There's also a majority of delete votes (almost twice as keeps) but I concur with several math fellows here that this list is not the proper approach. However there are some interesting ideas (an entry about NAMED formulas, etc.... and I want to chip one more: how about an entry about trig formulas, one about calc formulas, etc so you can put them in context and explain the relationships between them (as they relate to the same topic) so to avoid the list gathering for the sake of gathering (and then using a category to group those themed lists)?</dd>

A title like that would provide some sort of logical rationale for the choice of the results presented.

<dd>The fact that this article was in several encyclopedias does not mean that it is not inherently misleading. Referring to any group of philosophers whose only common attribute was geography as a school is misleading--they didn't all agree with each other, and were from several different time periods in Ancient Greece. Perhaps this usage is sufficiently common that it should be retained in Wikipedia as a stub to point at schools of philosophy which are not arbitrary classifications.

<dd>Let me retiterate and summarize, there is no Ionian school. I have no idea who on the Internet is promulgating the notion, but you know, once something gets said once, it gets repeated over and over. The pre-socratics are not physicalists, neither are they all monists. As for the panmetabolists, that term is incomprehensible to the general public and certainly is not ancient. Wikipedia seems to be having a lot of trouble with its philosophy. I suggest that getting back to basics will improve things considerably. Don't we have to think about the public? As a bottom line, I would like to say, if you have to start out by saying there really is no Ionian school, you aren;t building any confidence that what you say is true.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 19:28, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>PS</b> I'm really talking to you, aren't I , Karol? No, the reasons you cite are not enough to distinguish an Ionian school. The coast of Anatolia was diverse, Different dialects of greek and different languages were spoken there. So there is no geographic unity. As for the cultural background, it was Hellenic. The Ionians came from Attica and bronze age Peloponnesus. Why not call the Athenians Ionian? And the mythology, they didn't believe anything no other Hellene didnt believe. Where's the distinction? And physicalist? A very obscure neologism I dare say. It is nowhere defined. I don't see ANY method at all here, sir. No way to distinguish an Ionian school is presented.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 05:11, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am replying upon request. I don't doubt there were substantial differences between the particular Ionian philosophers, and we know they didn't "collaborate", but they <i>had</i> alot in common, at least in my view of them. I can't argue specifically about cultural backgrounds and history, because I don't feel knowledgable in that area. In any case, grouping philosophers into schools is really a <i>post factum</i> job, chronologically speaking, so the concept of "school" goes beyond who they were and what they spoke/wrote/thought to include our contemporary interpretation of their philosophies. I'm probably writing more than needed. Let me just add that <a href="../../../p/h/y/Physicalism.html" title="Physicalism">physicalism</a> is not a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> (you can also find references outside Wikipedia), and I know I used the term "off limits", but that was intended, becuase I couldn't find a better one at the moment - perhaps materialists? <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 08:19, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for your reply. The discussion seems to be centering on the concept of materialism. See the next comment. My main doubt is that I do not see the "materialism" as distinctively Ionian.<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 18:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The "Byzantine Empire" never considered itself that. To it's subjects, it was the Roman Empire, and they considered themselves Romans. They preserved Roman culture for nearly a thousand years after the Western Roman Empire fell. But historians have a problem with calling it the Roman Empire, because the original territory of the Roman Empire was lost. Oh well. They can call it whatever they want. It's a convention. That's what names are. Conventions. "Byzantine" makes it easy to differentiate the later Roman Empire from the earlier. Which brings us to the distinction of the Ionian school of philosophy. So what if it's geographically based. It's also called the Melesian school, also a geographical distinction. It was started by Thales of <i><b>Melitus</b></i>, so go figure. Thales had a couple really cool disciples (well one disciple and one sub-disciple), and some contemporaries who no doubt benefited from all their wisdom. Between the lot of them they pumped out enough philosophical <i>material</i> to be considered a school. For this, maybe we should call them "materialists". Hey, I can make any distinction I want, but that won't get it in an encyclopedia until it becomes some kind of consensus. But they are already materialists by another more popular distinction, and Ionians, so let them stay in our wonderful encyclopedia!!! We can work on my new definition of materialism later. <a href="../../../g/o/_/User%7EGo_for_it%21_6ef5.html" title="User:Go for it!">Go for it!</a> 16:18, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I recognize that the term 'Ionian School' has widespread usage. But I thought that since the 1911 Britannica article recognized that the term did not refer to a coherent classification scheme, perhaps it might be time (after almost a century) to remove it. I suppose I will have to keep the article, and try to stay NPOV in a (hopefully brief) discussion of classification schemes for philosophical schools in the article. I will start a discussion over on the Philosophy tasks, since this seems to be more specialized than just deletion.</dd>
<dd>Out of curiosity, what kind of criteria would an article from 1911 Brittannica have to meet in order for it to be deleted? Factual error and/or extreme bias? <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhiteC_f18a.html" title="User:WhiteC">WhiteC</a> 17:30, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>More on materialism. I like the way this discussion is centering in on materialism, which is partly at the heart of the problem. I grant you many of the philosophers - Thales, etc. and the pluralists - DO seem to be concerned with the explanation of nature. 1) What do we moderns call their interest? I'm not sure materialism does the job, as our materialism (I think - maybe I'm wrong) implies that there is no spirit, no God even, and that matter and the laws of matter are supreme. None of the philosophers thought that. Also, we want to avoid any connection with our physics, as the only one who thought numerically was Pythagoras, and he is not an Ionian. 2) What do you do with the incipient skeptics - Heraclitus and Xenophanes etc. The latter is not in the article but he was an Ionian. Is Ionian to include all Ionians or just some of them?<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBotteville_e5b2.html" title="User:Botteville">Dave</a> 18:27, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

This article should be expanded to show that there was a diversity of organisations within the movement, many with different agendas, even though with the same professed goal. While there was overlap with organisations there was difference too - the Ku Klux Klan and the non-conformist movements (eg Methodists) on the Australian gold fields are not the same. How such disparate groups co-existed and their successes with prohibition and early closing in the early twentieth century would make an interesting article beyond the scope of what is already there and the article on the movement.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">A Y Arktos</a> 08:48, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Agreed, this is no place for obituaries.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I agree! I understand the purpose and it noble, however I beleive it in appropriate. Entries such as these are ok now, but allow this, and you must allow all</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. there is no conspiracy here and it's sick to crawl all over it when none of you actually care what happened.</li>
<li><b>What?</b> Why should it be deleted? What if it was your kid?</li>

As the game in question has been released worldwide and is a large part of pop culture and gaming culture, it is of widespread interest and worthy enough to have its own article.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Clearly, Cody Cox was very important to the people who knew and loved him and his death is tragic. To be encyclopedic, though, there needs to be some indication that the story is more notable than many similar stories. This story does not seem to have been picked up by news sources outside of North Carolina, indicating that, at this time, it is still a local story. Sadly, killings are sufficiently common place that they are not, in themselves, notable. Additionally, the last section (The Conspiracy) appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. This is doubly inappropriate for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a> 04:46, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete:</b> This is an information database as it should always be, free from personal opinions and feelings. If his death has a noticable impact, then it should be kept and Cody wil be put up there with Martin Luther King and Abraham Lincoln, and the other important historical figures, until then.. sorry. On the otherhand, I'm sorry for your loss and may you try to find another way of keeping Cody's memory alive. <small><i>Unsigned vote from User:216.58.17.167. <a href="../../../p/b/u/User%7EPburka_537f.html" title="User:Pburka">Pburka</a></i></small></li>

If I wished to insert a comment that distorted the events that led to the death, (ie given how there are different viewpoints, someone inserted writing in support of the person who stabbed Cody Cox) then how is it a reliable reference?

<li><b>Keep</b> However a Category for African musicians sounds like a good idea. An advantage with this though is all the red names can hopefully inspire someone to "turn them blue." Usually a list with a great many red names I think is a bad sign. However African issues are so poorly dealt with at Wiki anything that encourages better coverage I think is a good idea. All the names there needing to be filled could do that.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 06:00, 19 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Two reasons for keeping this list: 1) The red links are suggestions for new articles, as Anthony said. 2) If you want to search in <a href="../../../a/f/r/Category%7EAfrican_musicians_0708.html" title="Category:African musicians">Category:African musicians</a>, you need to browse all the subcategories as well to find a musician if you don't know his or her nationality. <a href="../../../r/i/k/User%7ERiki_4a69.html" title="User:Riki">Riki</a> 12:54, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Kappa and T. Anthony. You can't categorize red links and we need them to improve coverage of African music. It also makes searching for a musician a lot easier if you don't know where they live.

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> this list is useful.

Removing this list will only lead to the need for 42 eternal three sentence stubs like List of Benga musicians, which will do nothing but exacerbate the existing bias. / <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 05:12, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Given that the only thing these lists have at the moment are names, one wonders why the search box in the sidebar won't suffice. The only other reason I've heard expressed for keeping this list and the other one that I proposed for deletion is <i>not</i> that a reader will find the list useful in its own right, but that it will somwhow act as a spur to improve the coverage of this area of knowledge by Wikipedia. Exactly how this magic is supposed to occur is never explained, but I'll assume for the moment that it will somehow occur. If that's the case, why shouldn't this list be moved to Wikipedia:List of African musicians that Wikipedia needs articles on or more normally Wikipedia:WikiProject African musicians? <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 07:03, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"Exactly how this magic is supposed to occur." You get new people interested in African musicians. If this is placed in the category of that name all the better.

There might be an article on <a href="../../../m/i/_/Mi_Fu_20f6.html" title="Mi Fu">Mi Fu</a> without that list, but it would've been done later and the list gave me a job to work on, with pleasure, for a time.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>The search box would suffice if the search result could yield a list of African musicians sorted by country (now, that would be magic). This list, like every other list on wikipedia, is a compliment to the search box, and a compliment to categories. With your argument, all lists should be deleted. According to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists">Wikipedia:Lists</a>, <i>Some lists are useful for Wikipedia development purposes. The lists of related topics give an indication of the state of the 'pedia, the articles that have been written, and the articles that have yet to be written.</i> This and other examples of why this list is useful is given there. / <a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 14:02, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are three purposes <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_f2e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists">Wikipedia:Lists</a> gives for lists, Information, Navigation, Development.
<dl>
<dd><b>Information</b> Unlike a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Academy_Awards_ceremonies_5930.html" title="List of Academy Awards ceremonies">List of Academy Awards ceremonies</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Baku_metro_stations_cecf.html" title="List of Baku metro stations">List of Baku metro stations</a>, or anyother number of lists on Wikipedia where there is some reasonable prospect that a person would seek the list as a whole and thus as information, why would anyone seek this list as information in its own right and not as a aid to navigation or development? By its very nature it is inherently incomplete and can never be completed. There is no indication of why these African musicians and not others have been included. Considered only as information it is at best a collection of indiscrimate information, not worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia.</dd>
<dd><b>Navigation</b> There is nothing in this list that is an improvement over the ability to navigate provided by the category system. It lists its entries in alphabetical order for each country, the same as is provided by the category system. Considered only as an aid to navigation, it is not an improvement over categories (at least in its present form) and thus not worth keeping.</dd>
<dd><b>Development</b> I will concede that this list is potentially useful for development (if we can find someone who is willing and able to do the development), but since it has no other apparent value, it belongs in the Wikipedia namespace, not the main one. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 16:54, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>At the risk of repeating myself, this list offers the navigational advantage over the category that users can see every member without having to click on a separate link for each country. From the point of view of information, it has the advantage of including an alternate name for Steady Bongo, which a category cannot do. From the POV of development, we are much more likely to find someone who is willing and able to write articles about African musicians if these people actually find this list, which is much more likely if it's in the main namespace, linked from other pages and google-able, than if it's buried in the wikipedia space. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:50, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sorry I shouldn't name call but using a rugby union site as evidence for rugby league in a country is clearly wrong.

Despite being an active site there is no mention of seasons post 2003, and the guestbook has loads of people asking about rugby league in Canada, but no replies suggesting there is. It's quite clear that the sport is dead in the country but I'll try find better sources.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by James Bowes (<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJames_Bowes_06a3.html" title="User talk:James Bowes">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_James_Bowes_7843.html" title="Special:Contributions/James Bowes">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>There were Ontario and Manitoba 9-a-side leagues up til 2003 as evidenced by this site <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/" class="external free" title="http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/ab7/canadianrl/</a> (you need to run the cursor over the left hand boxes for the link). However, all evidence suggests that rugby league in Canada has been dormant since 2003 (at least on an organised level, who knows if there have been ad hoc matches). I think the article needs heavy improvement as to describe rugby league as an emerging sport there is both inaccurate and a non-NPOV as there's no evidence it will ever emerge there. Not sure of the split but I would assume all rugby league in Canada was allied to Super League, as it was in most countries, with the ARL largely being localised.</dd>

<p><b>Speedy delete</b>. This article is a disgrace. RL is not played IN Lebanon but the sport in Australia is played by a number of Lebanese ex-pats and, in order to artificially increase the number of teams playing in its so-called "World Cup", the RFL included a team that largely consisted of these ex-pats and called it the Lebanon national team. This is disinformation of the worst possible kind and it has to be said that it is typical of certain elements in the RL fraternity who will go to any lengths to "talk up" their undeniably minor sport. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeWilliams_3db4.html" title="User:GeorgeWilliams">GeorgeWilliams</a> 10:49, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>May I kindly ask you then when a person is notable enough to stay in Wiki? Are there generally accepted rules?</p>
<p>One indication may be given above: “whether he is more notable than the average per the "professor test" I wouldn't like to say”. What does this mean? Although my publication list <a href="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/" class="external free" title="http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/" rel="nofollow">http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~svozil/publ/</a> includes more than 100 articles in scientific journals, as well as two monographies, I might not be “notable enough”.</p>
<p>Or is it the Google science scores?</p>
<p>With regards to Google science: there seems to be an interesting methodological problem coming up here: <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> reports 268 entries after obviously searching for “Karl Svozil”; i.e., <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Karl+Svozil+" class="external free" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Karl+Svozil+" rel="nofollow">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=Karl+Svozil+</a></p>
<p><br />
But a search for an abbreviation of “Karl”, namely “K. Svozil” <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=K.+Svozil+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" class="external free" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=K.+Svozil+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=K.+Svozil+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=</a> reproduces 745 entries</p>
<p>One might consider the following articles written in well-known journals about my work recently: <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn7535" class="external free" title="http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn7535" rel="nofollow">http://www.newscientist.com/channel/fundamentals/dn7535</a> <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4097258.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4097258.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4097258.stm</a> <a href="http://www.nzz.ch/2005/07/06/ft/articleCXN7B.html" class="external free" title="http://www.nzz.ch/2005/07/06/ft/articleCXN7B.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nzz.ch/2005/07/06/ft/articleCXN7B.html</a></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is an interesting example of (I believe totally benign and unintentionally) how to downgrade a score within the same database; and an interesting example of scoring in general --- see my article on related subjects: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0208046" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0208046" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0208046</a></p>
<p><br />
In summary: I would be very interested in criteria as to when an academic is “notable enough”. Thank you for clarification.</p>
<p>I would also be most thankful for clarifications as to why this “Article is in pressing need of cleanup.” Thank you for this as well.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>; It is quite common to discuss deletion of articles created by their subject, so I do not think that the nominator did anything particularly strange in this case. In particular, it is always considered a bad idea to write an article about oneself (<a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a>). It is also true that we have some articles written by their subject, such as <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Hewitt_103a.html" title="Carl Hewitt">Carl Hewitt</a>.
<div>Regarding this particular entry, I think that the main issue is not the <i>number</i> of hits, but the number of <i>citations</i> to articles. The first two results of Google scholar <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22K+Svozil+%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22K+Svozil+%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> (books) get 107 and 38 citations; the first article gets 31, the second 27 and so on. Now, if we wanted to follow what my friend Uncle G once proposed (which would be ideally the best thing to do), we should read all papers citing Karl Svozil's papers and see what the other authors say about the cited article. Just we do not have enough time for that. On one point Karl is wrong: searching</div>

<li><b>Thank you</b> Paolo, for this clarification. Let me say one or two things about self-publishing (which is now standard practice in physic e-print archies such as <a href="http://arxiv.org" class="external free" title="http://arxiv.org" rel="nofollow">http://arxiv.org</a> ): if you try to avoid self-publication officially, you get inofficial self-postings. The most natural thing is to self-post from other identities (remember the scandal at Amazon about fake reader comments written by the authors?); or to ask some friends to post a given text. I could have done this. I could also ask some of my international friends to post for me in my favor, but I refrain from doing this; mostly for pure lazyness and curiosity. I could even approach some of my students who work for the wiki community here an Austria.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be frank, the reason why I decided to put up this page is because I wanted to create an entry on <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endophysics.html" title="Endophysics">endophysics</a> (which I suppose will get deleted now by <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> as well&#160;;-) because I have been invited to give a talk in Tübingen and will be able to speak about this entry with Otto Rössler there. Of course, you or <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> might decide that endophysics is something for quacks, and then all this is in vain, from both perspectives. But yesterday I thought that I got so much already from wikipedia, and I should give something back. Today I have second thoughts.</p>
<p>The real problem in my opinion are guys like the moderator <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> who hides in anonymity (he/she has not even an email entry!). He/she did not contact me in the SFU case but rather decided to immediately purge the entry out of existence for reasons of "copyright", (substituting my entire entry incl. logo etc by a single line), which are obviously incorrect. With such practices, I am afraid, Wikipedia will not prosper in the way it should. Still, a very interesting experience!</p>
<p>And as to the "correctness of the publication list on my website": you would be astonished about the harsh reaction of the scientific community on fraud. I might not survive such a scandal professionally, and nobody I ever knew personally (and I am in this business for quite some time now) did such things!</p>
<p>Let me ask the wiki community one thing: I obviously seem to be interested and reaching out. I am member of a scientific communitiy. Why not take a chance and see how I can be made to practical use for wikipedia, instead of attempting to fight me off?</p>

<dd>books.google.com and www.a9.com with "books" checked as the search have much less of that bias, by the way. I was going to post some results of those searches but it's just all too borderline. Karl Svozil returns more hits than the first three professors listed alphabetically in the current roster of University of Wisconsin Department of Zoology, but fewer than the major professor I had when I was there. My best <i>guess</i> is that a case can be made for his being <i>somewhat</i> more notable than the <i>average</i> professor. A search on the surname "svozil" in a database called the Proquest Research Library turns up exactly one hit: "Short notices of books -- Randomness and Undecidability in Physics by Karl Svozil" in Endeavour. Oxford: Sep 1995. Vol.19, Iss. 3; pg. 137. Not overwhelmingly impressive for a database which "indexes more than 2,000 periodicals and provides the full text of nearly 1,000 of them. It has a mix of general interest and academic journals that cover the arts, business, education, health, humanities, psychology, sciences and the social sciences. It contains periodicals covering multicultural and women's issues and international affairs." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:32, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Karl, I think you are misunderstanding what is going on here. I hope you don't feel that I'm on a personal crusade against you, and I hope you are not insinuating that my nominatins were made in bad faith.
<ul>
<li>First, I am not a moderator, I am simply the nominator in this two AfDs. Like most Wikipedians, I do not give an email address on my userpage, but you could have left a message at my talk page which I check regularly.</li>
<li>Second, I originally nominated <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigmund_Freud_University_Vienna_7ed0.html" title="Sigmund Freud University Vienna">Sigmund Freud University Vienna</a> because I thought (and still think) that this educational institution is not sufficiently notable for inclusion in Wikipedia, given that it has no track record at all except for the accreditation. (I hope not every single PädAK or SozAK is going to get a page now.) But if consensus is going the other way, so be it. I only later discovered that the text on that page was a blatent copy &amp; paste from the SFU website. You are surely aware of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright_law.html" title="Copyright law">copyright law</a>, to which Wikipedia must adhere like everyone else. Hence, I tagged it as a copyright violation, which is why the page was <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedily deleted</a> by an admin, not be me (I can't do that since I'm not an admin). I have no objection to the current SFU page if it survives AfD. You are as free as anyone else to expand it, and I would encourage you to do so.</li>
<li>Third, concerning this nomination, there is consensus on Wikipedia that not every academic should have an encyclopedia entry here. Personally, I don't think that every Austrian ao.Prof. is encyclopedia material, and there are many in my own field who are very far away from it. If you have made outstanding, unique contributions to physics, then you absolutely should have an entry, but the page currently on review here does not describe anything like that. If a page was created by its subject, this is usually an indication to the contrary, without any prejudice to your case.</li>
<li>Fourth, I find no reason why <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endophysics.html" title="Endophysics">endophysics</a> (which I know nothing about) should be deleted. The page might do with some cleanup (for comprehensibility). Keep in mind that pages here should be understandable to the general public. It is certainly to the benefit of Wikipedia if you use your time to create and expand pages on topics you are an expert it. I hope that these AfDs (which are a normal Wikipedia quality control procedure) do not discourage you from editing. This was certainly not my intention. Best, <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 09:28, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> The first and fourth point I understand; they are organizational. Thank you for the clarifications.
<ul>
<li>In the second point, you state that Wikipedia should be *more stringent* than the official accreditation council set up by the Austrian government in granting university status; in particular listing as university. I disagree with you in this respect.</li>
<li>Your third point stating that “I don't think that every Austrian ao.Prof. is encyclopedia material, and there are many in my own field who are very far away from it” is an interesting judgment from your side. In this respect you seem to agree with the present government, in particular concerning the addum "a.o." as compared to "o." or just the recent "private nothing". Here, the fine tuning of the Austrian university with all its subtle indirectnesses can be studied anecdotally&#160;;-))</li>
<li>May I give a hint which I also tell my PhD students and younger colleagues when they start getting their first requests for peer review from scientific journals? First think, then recommend rejection&#160;;-) This may sound a little bit arrogant from my side, but it helps others to create new science rather than frustratingly cope with quasi-objective opinions with very little substance. --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlsvozil_c6b1.html" title="User:Karlsvozil">Karlsvozil</a> 11:10, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Two things:
<ul>
<li>Let me clarify that I do not believe that every o.Prof. should be included here as well, especially given how the appointment process sometimes works.</li>
<li>Your (slightly offensive) second hint is absolutely out of place here. As it stands, the page Karl Svozil still does not explain how Mr. Svozil is of encyclopdic interest. It's just a resumee with a list of research interests. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 13:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: what's the story with this "oProf", "aoProf", etc? I don't know about the others, but I'm not following the discussion much.
<div>Martg76 gave a good suggestion about the Karl Svozil article: summarize what you have actually done, rather than your interests. Regarding the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endophysics.html" title="Endophysics">endophysics</a> article, it may be also a good idea to add some references (possibly with some link to articles that are available on-line).</div>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Looking at a few of the websites which turned up in a Google search and the fact that his own article claims he has written three books, it seems he passes the "professor" test under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> but the article certainly needs work and it would be helpful if more notability could be stated in the article. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 05:23, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>suggestion</b> while passes the professor test. The author wasn't aware of attitudes/precedents against autobiography and made the contribution in good faith.

<p>I disagree with a deletion for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(i) this is not just a private "pop" stile university, but it has been *officially* accredited by the official accreditation commission set up by the Austrian government recently.</p>
<p>(ii) I do not agree with Martg76 that if an institution was founded recently, it should not be entered into wikipedia.</p>
<p>(iii) I do not agree with Martg76 that if no student &amp; staff numbers etc are given, the institution ought to be deleted: by the same standards, the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of technology (the university I am professor) would have to be deleted from wikipedia as well.</p>
<p>Hence I strongly recommend revising the deletion procedure and keeping SFU online on wikipedia.</p>
<p>In case of doubts, I also strongly encourage Mart76 or anybody else to contact me directly.</p>

<li>In my opinion, deletion of this entry would result in an incorrect and inconsistent wiki knowledge base, since SFU *is* an official Austrian university, no matter if you keep the entry or not. Deletion of the entry would result in the fact that some moderators or users purge an existing Austrian university out of the wiki database.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case I would kindly like to know when an Austrian university would be acceptable as an entry in wiki.</p>
<p>In my opinion *by definition* it should be included in wiki if it is included in that official list: <a href="http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/cont/de/privatuni.aspx" class="external free" title="http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/cont/de/privatuni.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.akkreditierungsrat.at/cont/de/privatuni.aspx</a></p>

<li>The original claim of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> (please see above, first entry) was that SFU has no staff and no students. This is provable incorrect.</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> now points out that (please see last posting), from his judgement, SFU is not "notable". This is a shift in argument. I disagree with this claim.</li>
<li>However, there is another interesting issue here: disregarding the official Austrian accreditation council, which decides in a lengthy and very considerate process about an institution's university status, a user in the status of <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> could argue for deletion on the basis that this decision is *not sufficient* for a listing of this institution in Wikipedia; thus making Wikipedia's entries effectively incomplete. This quite subjective way would not correspond to methods by which I personally would like Wikipedia to add information; it is certainly not in accordance with practices I know in science. (It appears to me that by analogy, somebody could argue that <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobelium.html" title="Nobelium">Nobelium</a> is not worth mentioning because it is "so rare";-) --<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlsvozil_c6b1.html" title="User:Karlsvozil">Karlsvozil</a> 15:13, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The shift in argument is due to this discussion and changes to the page resulting from discussion, which has brought more facts to light. In that sense, it has certainly been fruitful. Originally, the page did not give figures about students and staff. The website does not state any such figures either (at least I couldn't find them), it doesn't even make clear whether courses have started yet. As said before, the page seems to indicate that the "staff" consists mostly of people normally teaching at state universities. I highly doubt that the figure of 80 given at the page now refers to 80 full-time employees. With respect to the criteria for inclusion, I don't think that government approval is particularly relevant. Lots of institutions and things need to get goverment approval. The general criterion is "notability" or "importance", which, however, is nothing that could be subject to scientific review. It's of course highly subjective, which is why we have discusions here to reach consensus (which seems to be going in favor of this page anyway). <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartg76_fbde.html" title="User:Martg76">Martg76</a> 16:30, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This is a very interesting discussion, and at least I learn a lot from it. Because the way I tend to see an Encyclopedia like Wiki is like this: the world out there is factual and "quasi-objective", and there should be a corresponcence between the world and its representation. Effectively, what is implemented here is a (more or less) pluralistic-democratic way of "voting" how this representation should look like. This sounds reasonable, because all representations are man-made by definition. However, for me as a physicist it appears questionable to "vote" for or against certain things which are fixed by convention (such as the SFU case, which was settled by the Austrian Accreditation Council) or by Nature itself---it would, to repeat the extreme case, be questionable to "vote" for against the inclusion of an element in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">Periodic table</a>. ---<a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarlsvozil_c6b1.html" title="User:Karlsvozil">Karlsvozil</a> 10:42, 21 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If there are cases of people who got into chess because of the attendance at a religious group's activities, then that belongs in their article. Putting them in a list with co-religionists who perhaps learned chess in the navy, at school, on a gay safari in the Congo, or whatever, tells you nothing. Would we stand for a list of people who learned chess in school clubs, I think not. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 00:19, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Let me rephrase because that's not how I meant it. "If there are cases of chess players who got into it in <a href="../../../s/y/n/Synagogue.html" title="Synagogue">synagogue</a> or <a href="../../../y/e/s/Yeshiva.html" title="Yeshiva">yeshiva</a> I'd say keep, under the understanding I mean restrict it <b>only</b> to chess players who started like that." I think learning from a religious institution would be more noteworthy then a school and I think religion can effect almost everything in a person's life. This is a very marginal possibility on that so I am not voting keep or voting at all.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>I'm not familiar with all of the Wiki's features, but it seems to me that a category such as "Jewish Chess Players" should not be a category in and of itself, but an intersection of the "Jewish" and "Chess Players" categories.

<li><b>Comment</b>. While I see why this article was nominated based on its current form, I would definately vote to <b>Keep</b> it if the pictures were replaced with words describing the opening sequences. Furthermore, I find it disturbing that this AfD for a potentially encyclopedic topic was done without a single comment about it on the talk page for this article. I think it should be discussed there before anyone even considers closing this AfD. <a href="../../../e/w/s/User%7EEWS23_debe.html" title="User:EWS23">EWS23</a> | <a href="../../../e/w/s/User_talk%7EEWS23_56e9.html" title="User talk:EWS23">(Leave me a message!)</a> 08:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps because of the stereotype that Jews aren't good at sports, Jewish athletes generate a lot of interest. See, for example, www.jewishsports.com, www.jewishsportsreview.com, www.jewishsports.net, etc. A list might allow for extra info (e.g., "converted after end of career") not possible in a category. -- <a href="../../../m/w/a/User%7EMwalcoff_a391.html" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> 02:55, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> As evidence that these lists do not reflect a neutral point of view, I point out that virtually all of the lists of these kind are lists of people whose achievements are in areas considered respectable and praiseworthy. <i>If the purpose of these lists were the neutral compilation of information,</i> then, since Wikipedia considers porn stars to be encyclopedic, and includes a List of male porn stars and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_female_porn_stars.html" title="List of female porn stars">List of female porn stars</a>, I would expect to see religious/ethnic breakouts of these, too. But in fact, we do not. The motivation for these lists is the patently the cultivation of ethnic/religious/national pride. There's nothing wrong with that, but it is not an appropriate use of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 16:25, 20 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Although odd if you want say a list of confirmed Papal mistresses or Catholic suicides I don't think I'd go for deletion. There already is <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sexually_active_popes.html" title="List of sexually active popes">List of sexually active popes</a>. Although it offends me on some level I'll concede it's notable in history. Things like "Jewish criminals" I thought was sounding like flame bait, and also too broadly defined. There were Jewish gangsters during prohibition so I could cautiously see a List of Jewish-American gangsters(if heavily scrutinized) as historically noteworthy in the way <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Italian-American_mobsters_a474.html" title="List of Italian-American mobsters">List of Italian-American mobsters</a> was considered to be.

<p>There are several problems with this article:</p>
<ol>
<li>The entire show is one long series of rapid-fire gags; there are hundreds of them. You might as well include the whole script as there are few bits which are not intended to be funny.</li>
<li>Some things count as a gag in some eyes and not in others, other things might be counted as either gags or plot devices depending on POV. The list is subjective.</li>
<li>I see no need for an article on the gags in the shows separate from the show articles themselves, which are not over-long.</li>
<li>If the shows were generally serious then a list of humorous moments might be worth having, but since the concept is humorous this, too, does not argue for a separation of the humour to a separate article.</li>
<li>It's listcruft.</li>
</ol>
<p>And I say the above as one who liked the TV series and the first film a lot. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 15:55, 19 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>There are numerous new users who's pages are delted. Some are even wrost than AfD, and in this case, I mean Speedy. This article seems to blatantly advertise Microsoft's interview, and Wikipedia is <b>not</b> a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">how-to</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><sup>KILO</sup>-<sub>LIMA</sub></a> 20:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> I think my article should at least be merged with the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry. Microsoft was one of the first, if not the first company to develop this unique style of interviewing. Since other companies like <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a> and <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo.html" title="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> also use this type of interview, it is becoming more commonplace, so I can see why people might want to merge my article with Microsoft. I did spend a good deal of time crafting the article and you can find that the content is factual and well-written. I only decided to write this page after reading the Microsoft entry and seeing that "Microsoft Interview" was not linked to a Wiki page. I think that those who are more familiar with the more traditional behavioral interviews will learn something about how technical interviews are conducted. -- Suvablee0506 18:21, 16 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can't see what makes the interview process unusual, personally. The procedure and the questions all seem pretty standard. This may be because, if the article does have a purpose, it's hidden in all the stuff that frankly, doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia entry. We don't need to know, for example, Microsoft's current job postings, or that they pay for your accomodation, or their <i>expense claims procedure</i> (which is, btw, identical to every other expense claims procedure). Or rather, we would if we were applying for a job at Microsoft, but no-one who isn't could possibly find that information interesting; that means it's not suitable for an encyclopaedia. If it's a unique style of interviewing, then tell us about it and remove all the other stuff, because I honestly can't see it in this article. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 18:37, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I do see your point. Perhaps I can incorporate some of what I have written in "The Second Round Technical Interview" and and "Interview Questions" into the "Business culture" section of the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry and delete the separate entry for "Microsoft Interview"? - Suvablee0506 18:45, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Me too. Perhaps merging would be better. But no large amount of detail should be added. It is only a process as to whether someone should ge a job at Microsoft, or not. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKilo-Lima_bc04.html" title="User:Kilo-Lima"><sup>KILO</sup>-<sub>LIMA</sub></a> 18:50, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. There is neither anything notable nor encyclopedic about this entry.Microsoft's interview process is not particularly different than the interview process for other similar companies.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Back in the 80s and 90s, the Microsoft interview procedure was influential and innovative. I don't diasagree that the article needs to be cleaned-up, though. The talk page suggests there was a far more interesting version previously available, but I don't see it in the history. Can it be resurrected? -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 19:05, 16 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> If that's true, then I think the article can be rewritten with that fact as its focus, and less detail on all the steps of the interview process, many of which are common to every job interview in every field, dating long before the 1980s. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:32, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It was no intention of mine at all to create an entry that would cause controversy. I was just reading the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> entry and found the wiki-link to "Microsoft Interview" with an unwritten article. I was totally unaware that it had been deleted before. I understand everyone's concern about the entry. Perhaps an addition to the <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> entry could include a description of a technical interview using the Microsoft interview process as an example. Obviously, only parts of the current article would be used. I myself am leaning towards deleting the "Microsoft Interview" entry and merging parts of it with possibly <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> because that type of interview is becoming more commonplace. I am however against deleting it outright before at least some of it is used somewhere because I did do genuine research and put forth an honest effort. Any thoughts? - Suvablee0506 23:27, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't worry too much about the controversy, honestly. We try to assume good faith and I'm sure there's a way we can use some of your material.

This interviewing process is drastically different from what the majority of other companies use. There should be somewhere on Wikipedia to document this.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unencyclopedic, the pracice will surely change over years. As an anectode: I know about one guy who got hired by Microsoft (as a tester) w/o any interview at all (a student who finished university, not someone with big name). He was recommended by a friend (who even didn;'t worked in MS) and got in without being asked <i>anything</i> at all. So the article isn't even correctly describing reality. <a href="../../../p/a/v/User%7EPavel_Vozenilek_41f7.html" title="User:Pavel Vozenilek">Pavel Vozenilek</a> 22:05, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would everyone be okay with just using some part of the entry and merging it with <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> to describe a technical interview using Microsoft as just one example? The <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> entry has a section on behavioral interviews but not technical interviews. Again, I am not against deleting the entry but not before some of it is used somewhere.- Suvablee0506 17:26, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> As has been noted above, the subject of the article is particularly noteworthy because of its originality and subsequent effect on many companies, especially in the 80's and 90's. However, the article itself is not spectacular. It should be condensed, refocused, and placed either on the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> page or the <a href="../../../j/o/b/Job_interview.html" title="Job interview">Job interview</a> page, the other with a note and a link. <a href="../../../r/e/x/User%7ERexmorgan_3f09.html" title="User:Rexmorgan">Rexmorgan</a> 03:16, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This entry combines three major reasons for delete in a single article: 1. it is a list; 2. it is fancruft; and 3. it is about schools. Seriously, the problem is that articles of this kind are supposed to be lists of articles, and I doubt that more than one article on a star wars school will even be written. At least, the argument “this school is real” does not apply here.

</ul>

<dl>
<dd>1. Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country*</dd>
<dd>2. Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country.</dd>
<dd>3. Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour over notable musical venues in at least one large or medium-sized country*, reported in mainstream media.</dd>
<dd>4. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</dd>
<dd>5. Has been prominently featured in any major music media.</dd>
<dd>6. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such.</dd>
<dd>7. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability.</dd>
<dd>8. Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award.</dd>

<dd>I looked for and did not find evidence of any of the above. So I brought it here. And I may be wrong, someone may have evidence that it meets these criteria, but band vanity is sufficiently common as to make it quite understandable that one would be sceptical.

The company's own web site contains the same history, created by the same person (Rob Mitchell, whom the article tells us is the founder of the company), a scant few days before he submitted this article to Wikipedia.

<p><b>Delete</b>-I worked on this and have voted in favor of many lists so this might be a surprise. However even while working on it it struck me as kind of pointless. Living to 90 is increasingly not that odd, even for a celebrity. In my own family many of the people who lived to be elderly lived over 90 years.

<li><del>The second Death Star was a sphere of machinery somewhere between 180 and 900 kilometers in diameter (depending on the sources one holds to be authoritative)... (these sources are discussed in detail in the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> article)</del></li>
<li style="list-style: none"><del>
<li><del>it has been established in Star Wars comics and novels that some Ewoks had been removed from Endor in the past for use as pets or slaves... (Source needs to be made explicit, but this at least suggests that one exists)</del></li>
<li><del>Some Expanded Universe sources maintain that Endor was not significantly affected by the destruction of the Death Star and life continues there as normal. One other suggested it was destroyed, but the author had taken pains to paint it as Imperial propaganda... (These sources also need to be made explicit)</del></li>
<li><del>In one of the Star Wars Tales comics, an Imperial veteran of Endor makes an apparent reference to the holocaust theory... (Again, it'd be nice to get a reference for exactly which comic)</del></li>
<li><del>In the 'Jedi Academy Trilogy', by Kevin J. Anderson... (this source is very explicit)</del></li>
<li><del>"Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy" describes how the Rebels... (same here)</del></li>
<li><del>The two Ewok telefilms are set on a non-devastated Endor... (these are <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Ewok_Adventure_805d.html" title="The Ewok Adventure">The Ewok Adventure</a></i> and <i><a href="../../../b/a/t/Ewoks%7E_Battle_for_Endor_27de.html" title="Ewoks: Battle for Endor">Ewoks: Battle for Endor</a></i>)</del></li>
</del></li>
</ul>
</del></dd>
<dt><del>
<dd><del>The sources I noted as needing to be made more specific don't appear to have been filled in yet, but that's an argument for <i>improving</i> the article rather than <i>deleting</i> it. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 00:44, 20 November 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><del>Almost all of those sources do not refer to the Endor Holocaust at all; the inclusion of facts related to the speculation is irrelevant to a discussion of the speculation itself. Of the sources listed:</del></dd>
<dt><del>
<dd><del>1. The information about the size of the Death Star is not in contention, the OR discussion of how those facts are interpreted is; the unverified weasel phrases like "are speculated" need to be verified, and no sources do that.</del></dd>
<dd><del>2. The comics and novels talk about Ewoks being removed from Endor, a fact which is completely unrelated to the verifiability of the Endor Holocaust.</del></dd>
<dd><del>3. The sources alluded to flatly contradict the Endor Holocaust, and again it is not mentioned by those sources, with the exception of 4. below. More weasel phrases and unverified worded misdirection: "Pro-Holocaust debaters speculate that".</del></dd>
<dd><del>4. This is the only legitimate source that actually talks about the Endor Holocaust, and it is only mentioned in passing. Using only this source - as Wikipedia is supposed to - would produce a one-paragraph article.</del></dd>
<dd><del>5. This source again flatly contradicts the possibility of the Holocaust but *does not mention it*. Again, facts are being used as Original Research - the facts are not in contention, what they are being used for is.</del></dd>
<dd><del>6. Weasel words again: "by possible implication"? Again, no mention of an Endor Holocaust.</del></dd>
<dd><del>7. Another flat contradiction of the Holocaust, without the Holocaust being mentioned.</del></dd>
<dd><del>In summary (sorry for the long post; gosh it's fun being an Endor Holocaust denier!) the facts are verified, but their relationship to the original research that is this article is almost entirely negative. So the argument to keep it is based on all the verified evidence in the fiction that contradicts it?</del></dd>

<dd><del>I think you're misunderstanding the point of a Wikipedia article on something like this. The point is not to prove that the Holocaust "happened". The point is to <i>describe the arguments</i> that have been had about it. This distinction is demanded by the NPOV policy. All those sources that "contradict" the Holocaust are still quite relevant to the argument itself, as are the sources that only address background issues that are frequently used by people who are participating in the argument (size of Death Star, extinction of Ewoks, etc).</del></dd>
<dt><del>
<dd><del>All these issues about references and original research had been raised on the article's talk page long ago and had been left there without argument or comment. It would have been nice if you'd tried addressing them there rather than diving straight into an AfD nomination where these sorts of extensive discussions tend to clutter the process. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 19:23, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><del>No, I understand what it's trying to do; I'm contending that there is no demonstration that the discussion has existed anywhere but in the realms of fanboards, and that it therefore fails verifiability requirements. Bryan provided some sources for the facts in the article, but none of these demonstrate that the *discussion* has existed in a verifiable source. I'm pointing out that all the sources listed (bar one, as mentioned) don't even mention the Endor Holocaust, so they do not contribute anything to the verifiability of the topic. I've listed this as an AfD rather than aim to improve the article because my research suggests that the premise of the article is itself unverifiable. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 21:29, 20 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd><del>The discussion of the legitimacy of the SWTC source is the most convincing part of this argument (I'm using OR in its technical sense, as an article lacking legitimate sources; perhaps verifiability would have been a better use of the terminology?), however the description of the site as a personal hobby of the author, and one unaffiliated and unsupported by Lucasfilm, in my opinion undermines that legitimacy. In any case, Wikipedia dictates *multiple* legitimate sources to prevent overly hypothetical irrelevancies like this appearing.

<li><del><b>KEEP</b>. This has been a major debate among the fan community for years, and has generated multiple technical documents and commentaries on both sides of the debate. The debate does have <i>some</i> official involvement and legitimacy, in that physicist, Dr. Curtis Saxton, who once did an in-depth article (which is in the external links in the wikipedia <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor_Holocaust_90d5.html" title="Endor Holocaust">Endor Holocaust</a> article) about and explaining why he supports this issue, is the author of the <i>Attack of the Clones</i> and <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> incredible cross-sections, which are official works from Lucasfilm that give technical analysis for parts of the <i>Star Wars</i> universe. Gary M. Sarli, another physicist has even written an entire paper (which is also linked to on the Endor Holocaust wikipedia page) on the issue, explaining, using mathematical models, why the holocaust couldn't have happened. And the fact that <i>Inside the Worlds of Star Wars Trilogy</i> mentions the issue and Howstuffworks.com elaqborates on it, should be enough to show the legitimacy of the debate.

<dd><del>It's not about 'winning' and 'losing', it's about what's appropriate for Wikipedia. The last AfD listed this as 'no consensus', which means just that: there was no consensus about whether the article should be kept or not, and that in cases of no consensus Wikipedia errs on the side of keeping things, as it should. It appears that there still isn't consensus (unfortunately), but that's a good reason to keep debating it, not stop. <a href="../../../z/i/g/User%7EZiggurat_41bd.html" title="User:Ziggurat">Ziggurat</a> 22:16, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</del></dd>
