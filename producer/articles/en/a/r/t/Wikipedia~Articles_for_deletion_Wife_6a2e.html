This article doesn't even get the basic dictionary meaning right - it is not a word purely associated with marriage.

<dd>Thanks for joining, how does your comment contradict the article's definition?

<dd>Not so much a contradiction as an indication of the purpose of the article. When the article has little more than a non-inclusive dictionary definition with an error in it (Old German Weib was not obsolete), it doesn't look like the article was created for the sake of the topic. It was very obvious that it was there purely to make a point, and not very well at that. What point? I'm not sure, but it seems to be part of the battle between advocates of SSM and right wing Christians. I note, though, that the article has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wife&amp;diff=107946689&amp;oldid=107690623" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wife&amp;diff=107946689&amp;oldid=107690623" rel="nofollow">changed</a> quite a bit since it was nominated, and may be salvageable. -trishm-</dd>

<dd>i am neither right wing nor ssm or who else, just interested in history and literature, as you see. Question, though: it never said, "Weib <i>was</i> obsolete" (which doesnt make sense to me right now), "obsolete" meant "not in use today", which is true, "Weib" means "Ehefrau" in both colloquial and legal German. If that is what you meant?

<dd>I guess we were talking at cross purposes, and you've won me over. I didn't mean to categorize you, it just seemed that the article was being used as a weapon in some idealogical war. "Weib" is archaic, for sure, but still survives a weiblich, so I reacted a bit to "obsolete"; and I'm sure your German is far superior to mine. Now I can see the potential in the article. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrishm_3029.html" title="User:Trishm">Trishm</a> 04:43, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>Other items marriage does not mention: <a href="../../../h/u/s/Husband_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Husband (disambiguation)">husband (disambiguation)</a>, similar terms like housewife, the education for wives at wife.org, support (make necessary) a disambiguation.

Well, even if i am not allowed to say who i am talking to, it would still be productive to post questions like whether novels count as a reference (edit: ie. what sources are acceptable in the context of wishing this article sourced) either here or somewhere it would be seen by more people. I am not saying this to anyone in particular. No threat intended.

If it is a good idea to start splitting the article for length purposes, the way it should be done is not to create dicdefs and fill them with historical anecdotes, but to simply create a (set of) timeline(s) of marriage practices in different regions. This would be much more encyclopedic, and an appropriate title for one of these might be <b>Marriage practices in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries</b>, for example.

<dd>Secondly, the purpose of this article is not length, but what i just said, and have kept saying. It does not repeat the kinds-of-marriage issue from marriage, either.

<dd>Well, I can see that it's not limited to that time frame, that's why I'm suggesting <b>a set of</b> such articles, divided by whatever historical segments are appropriate. There's very little to be gained in having these dicdefs and just filling them with a variety of historical anecdotes. If the coverage is too long for <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marriage.html" title="Marriage">Marriage</a> (and I'm not convinced that it is) then the way to do it is is by articles on those historical periods, not just dumping grounds for anything and everything from every time period. â€”&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> â€” 21:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
