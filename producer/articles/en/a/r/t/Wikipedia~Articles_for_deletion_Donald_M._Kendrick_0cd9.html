<dd>Please review WP:Music at your earliest convenience. Please review the article for the Carnegie Hall link - or are you contesting the NY Times as a valid source?.

<dd>Don't blame me for your miscite on this afd page.

<dd>The one Times review of the Carnegie Hall performance is largely sufficient for me. Furthermore, I didn't have to search very hard for the link since despite your denials it was a source in the article. And while your selective quoting of the review is interesting, the Times does go on to say that "<i>The chorus -- a combination of the Wayne State College Choir, the Donald Kendrick Chorale and the Long Island Masterworks Chorus -- produced a reliably robust, polished sound</i>". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:21, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Great so he played one time with a bunch of other performers and sounded good with Wayne college, and Long Island performers. The issue is notablity and the source said "the ensemble" was hired "<b>because it was inexpensive, not because it was distinguished.</b>" That is an article from 11 years ago. Anything current to prove notablity? <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbusto</a> 00:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are sincerely interested in Mr. Kendrick's career, please read the article and follow the links. You will see that this "choir teacher" is far more accomplished than you are willing to acknowledge and has been actively touring. In the meantime, by repeatedly selectively misquoting a bolded passage from the Times - that was actually attributed to a musicians union protesting the use of foreign performers - you are seriously demeaning your argument. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:21, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>LOL. Follow;
<dl>
<dd>1) The article states "Mr. Kendrick debuted in Carnegie Hall with the Verdi Requiem in 1995" with a NY Times article linked.</dd>
<dd>2) The NY Yimes article says "<b>Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians challenged</b> the orchestra members' visas, <b>contending that Mr. Tiboris hired the ensemble because it was inexpensive, not because it was distinguished</b>."</dd>
<dd>3) Then the article continues: "The <b>performance of the Verdi Requiem on Saturday evening showed that the union may have a point.</b> Although the orchestra's strings produced a unified, warm sound, its winds were lackluster, and its brass players muddled their big moment at the start of the Tuba mirum. The performance, conducted by <b>Donald Kendrick</b>, was surprisingly leisurely; only the most overtly dramatic sections had any real drive."</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Alas. Carnegie Hall is available for all to rent. There's a New York company that specializes in bringing out-of-town choirs to NY to sing there - for a fee.

<dd><b>Additional consideration</b>: International tours is, like the Carnegie gigs, an overstatement. I've been on these tours as well; you pay for your tour (usually it's 2 weeks or so on a summer vacation) and sing several concerts in churches in various cities. Tours like this are a staple of the volunteer choral singer's life - most of us have been on one or more of these.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Does your choir teacher takes choral tours to Eastern Europe and China, and release records sold through Amazon from the tours&#160;? -- <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBeardo_5fe6.html" title="User:Beardo">Beardo</a> 12:35, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No, but that's also not part of the guideline being cited as reason to keep. The keep votes say to keep because of the concert guideline of WP:MUSIC, and I made my reply to that. This issue is tangential at best and we can address it when that article goes to AfD. Also, it would be best not to refer to her as my choir teacher, as I haven't been in a choir for many a year.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm confused. This <i>is</i> AfD. This is it. The article will be deleted today if the consensus is <i>Delete</i>.</li>

<li>I believe I made that quite clear within my response when I introduced the segment being cited in my attempt to show why what holds true for a band or musician might not necessarily be the best arrangement for a conductor.
