<li>Unfortunately it seems the user who wrote the original article was not an experienced wikipedia writer, similar to myself in that respect. As an old Salopian myself, however, I took the liberty of researching the topic and found the real verifiable source in "Salopian Slang", published around 10 years ago by Salopian Publishing. Thus I dare say the article is not eligible for deletion for the cited reason of "Wikipedia is not for things made up in school one day". In fact, this proposition is a deep misunderstanding and neglection of the public school culture, a relevant topic for any encylopedia and therefore more than at home on wikipedia. Any attempt to delete it, I propose, is undermining what I consider to be the values of wikipedia and is thus, I hesitate to add, fairly hypocritical. Might I also propose that users refer to the "shrewsbury school" article on the site, which indicates a good deal of the school's ancient tradition and, notably, defines it as a public school- not a high school as on user mentioned on this page. I hope this is helpful.213.254.171.194 20:16, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I am unable to find any indication that any book entitled "Salopian Slang" exists, nor is there any record anywhere of a company called "Salopian Publishing" ever having existed. This is apparently the second nonexistent book that someone has tried to cite as verification. (Regarding the use of terms, a large number of Wikipedia editors are Americans, for whom "public school" means something totally different (opposite actually) than it does in the UK, and "high school" indicates any secondary school. To use "public school" would have been confusing and misleading.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 20:22, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I thank Fan-1967 for his/her comment, though I feel a little hurt that he/she considers the book I quoted, "Salopian Slang", to be nonexistent. I question whether the user is looking in the right places. Allow me to assure him/her that the book exists (I have a copy on my desk at this precise moment) and urge him to look harder. As a relative 'noob' to wikipedia I ask the user how best to put a copy (perhaps scanned) onto the internet in order to make it truly verifiable, bearing in mind that it is a commercial publication and thus has copyright issues attached with it. (I again thank the user for his comments about public school/high school but, as a proud Brit myself, and given that the school in question is in England I will continue to refer to it as a Public School.) <b>Proud in Opposition.</b>213.254.171.194 21:45, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you have a copy handy, perhaps you could look on the copyright page and find the ISBN number. All copyrighted, published books have them. An author name would be nice also. Also on that page should be a full name and address of the publisher. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 22:05, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment - I can find no evidence of the book and when I spoke to a friend's son who is at the school, he had never heard of any of those words (besides the ones that are in general use as a slang anyway). --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 08:30, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's pretty safe to say that a publishing company that does not appear at all in any web search is nonexistent.

<li><b>Beef It</b> - I say give it a massive beef (look it up)! If a load of idiot Americans really want to delete the article that much then give them the gratification of doing so. There is a massive tradition at Shrewsbury and no bald (look it up) deletion from an equally bollocks encyclopedia is going to destroy those deep-rooted foundations. I notice that the user called fan 1967 has some kind of really cool award for deleting stuff off wikipedia(?) so I propose that we let HIM delete it. Perhaps a small ceremony would be in order?
