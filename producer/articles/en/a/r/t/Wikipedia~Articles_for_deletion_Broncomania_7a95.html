<p>This is an article about the message board for the <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denver_Broncos_cd7b.html" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>' fan website, and it's a kind of a mess. I don't think the website itself is particularly notable; it's obviously pretty popular, and it gets over 100 000 Google hits, the vast, vast majority of them are simply hits for the site itself, not references in other media or the like. Size does matter, but I don't think this one really meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. I almost was bold and just did a redirect Denver Broncos, but first of all, I kind of anticipated a lot of argument about that so I decided to skip that and go straight for the AfD, and secondly, it seems a little untidy to redirect something that has to do with a website to an article that is not at all about the website. Anyway, in addition to all this, the article has serious POV problems, it includes weird lists and usage instructions, has a thoroughly unencyclopedic tone of voice, and is generally pretty much a mess. I'm sure it could be salvaged if the topic was noteworthy enough, but I don't think it is. Perhaps an article on the Broncos' website would be more appropriate, and the discussion boards could certainly be dealt with there, but apparently one doesn't exist at the moment. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 14:39, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Oh, and just as an FYI, User:Snk16, the most frequent contributor to the article, just now removed the AfD template. I restored it and asked the editor to not do so again. In the meantime, the article is devolving into some sort of a slapfest between people who got banned from the forum and people who think that's great or something, I don't know. I'm sure a good time is being had by all. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 15:03, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>sorry about deleting the AfD template thing. That was my fault, won't happen again. These trolls who were banned are going on about it and editing some bad stuff, and no it's not fun, so please delete it.</li>

<p>WTE says....Keep this page. it's a great opportunity to speak the truth about the tyrannical rule of Steve Harbula. The oppressed registered users of Broncomania do not have a forum to express their displeasure with the site. Wikpedia provides that vehicle. Let's keep the motor running and keep this site open. The truth must be told!!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Personally, I fail to see how this forum is notable enough for an encyclopedia article.

<li>I don't see this as a <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">early close under SNOW</a>, and we need to evaluate input from everyone, not just the creator of the article, even if they're saying delete, but I'm also not seeing notability here so I think <b>Delete</b> is the correct action. <b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 22:20, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I also agree, I think you all should delete the page because it's a soapbox now...</li>
<li><b>Please note</b> for anyone wanting to vote CSD G7, that only applies to a <i>single</i> creator, not when people have been working on it for a while.

<li>I was the dude who made constructive edits to this. I figured I should try to save this, but it's become even more of a drama fest than anything else.
