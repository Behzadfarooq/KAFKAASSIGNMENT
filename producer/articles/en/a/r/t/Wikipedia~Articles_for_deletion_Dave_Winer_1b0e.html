<li><b>FYI</b>, note article history and discussion at <a href="../../../d/a/v/Talk%7EDave_Winer_881e.html#Deletion" title="Talk:Dave Winer">Talk:Dave Winer#Deletion</a>. I find it extremely lame (and a waste of resources) to use AFD to resolve a content dispute. The nominator has few other edits than this recent activity. Yes, the subject is noted for self-serving statements, but that means you provide a sourced counter-argument. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 04:50, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Assuming that it's a bad faith nomination isn't really in the spirit of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, is it? I do think <a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a> has some legitimate complaints about the article, and it needs to be cleaned up - just the problems with it do not, in my opinion, merit deletion. —<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERandom832_2ea5.html" title="User:Random832">Random832</a><small>2007-01-24T13:30:16<a href="../../../r/a/n/User_talk%7ERandom832_8f73.html" title="User talk:Random832">UT</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Random832_9c40.html" title="Special:Contributions/Random832">C</a>(01/24 08:30EST)</small>
<ul>
<li>I'm not assuming the nomination is in bad faith, simply suggesting that it may be. In other words, based on <i>my</i> reading of the talk page and Nirelan's contribution log, the nomination of this article to AfD does not appear to be in good faith. And, yes, I agree that Nirelan has made some valid editorial points. Like <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a>, my concern is that we've gone from "0 to AfD" without the appropriate page-based discussion. -- <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcoTolo_8040.html" title="User:MarcoTolo">MarcoTolo</a> 01:51, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I admit there are refrences to him, but most of them contain false information. For example, this article orignally said that ScriptingNews was one of the first blogs. However, blogging exisited long before his site was created or he became interested in it. Also, RSS was created by Netscape and Dave talked Harvard into controlling it. While he has told those refrences that he played a part in creating blogging or RSS it just isn't true no matter how many sites link to it. Dave has the power to influence the media because he worked for Harvard, but that shouldn't give him the power to influence a community site like Wikipedia.<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please look at the top of the article. I disproved the main reasons to give Dave an article. If major items like that are not true why should we waste time and space to create a biography of a man who did not really invent anything?<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>You are addressing what you perceive as inaccuracies in the article. These are not reasons to delete the article. Please do not use AFD to address content disputes. Nirelan, has it ever occurred to you that he did not parachute into Harvard out of the clear blue sky? His notability, for better or worse, was well established before that time. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 08:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dhartung, If any of us claimed to have invented a widely used program Harvard would probably take us seriously as well. However, the truth is that he tried to sell outliners and basicly had to give his company to Symantec because his own company was so unsucessful. --<a href="../../../n/i/r/User%7ENirelan_b5fc.html" title="User:Nirelan">Nirelan</a><a href="../../../n/i/r/User_talk%7ENirelan_bfaa.html" title="User talk:Nirelan">Talk</a></li>
<li>Nirelan, it's good that you deleted your potentially libelous comment here<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dave_Winer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103169094" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dave_Winer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=103169094" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. I don't know where you were or what you were doing 1997-1999, but I was an early blogger (third public blog using <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger.com.html" title="Blogger.com">Blogger.com</a>, three-digit Blogger user number<a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/884" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.blogger.com/profile/884" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>) and I have also used Userland products. The problem with Winer has never been "lies" as even the people he has alienated -- which is a large number of people -- respect his accomplishments. The problem has always been whether he allowed others credit or control. He sold outliners back in the pre-web days, and he adapted quickly and successfully to the web, and he was an enthusiastic evangelist for blogging even before the word was coined (see <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">blog</a>). This article and his claims regarding his career are necessarily contentious, but asserting that his accomplishments are non-notable misses the point of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (which is for better or worse), and your efforts to turn the article into an <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">attack page</a> really demonstrate the bad faith of this nomination. The fact that you're trying to dismiss a Harvard appointment as based on lies really demonstrates how thin your argument is. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 00:06, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - There are 79 references to Dave Winer in Google News alone at the moment. There's no question he's notable enough for Wikipedia. Don't use AfD to deal with NPOV and article quality objections. <a href="../../../r/c/a/User%7ERcade_aa62.html" title="User:Rcade">Rcade</a> 12:50, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nirelan has removed the AFD tag from the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Winer&amp;diff=103480473&amp;oldid=103479289" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dave_Winer&amp;diff=103480473&amp;oldid=103479289" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> - does this count as a withdrawal?

<ul>
<li>I concur, removal of the AFD notice by the nominator is generally interpreted as intent to withdraw the nomination. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:07, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
