<li><i>Cockadoodi Car" was a phrase frequently used by the psychotic protagonist of the Stephen King novel, Misery</i>. No it wasn't.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I disagree that there should be a redir. "Cockadoodie car" is used approximately <u>once</u> in the whole book/film and has no defining effect on either plot or characterisation (<i>pace</i> an analysis of Wilkes' repressed vocabulary and any connection between her general repression and her psychosis).

<li>I think Annie Wilkes' imperious attitude towards literature has had an effect on all of you. She insisted Sheldon burn the manuscript she detested, and now you are all crying to "burn" this article.

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> What is the matter with you people? Have you had too much 'bitchly cow corn'? Never have I experienced so much outrage on such a simple article. Merely published to highlight some of the better scenes, as a fan of the movie, I would have thought there would be some degree of appreciation for my efforts. Whereas many internet users have complimented me on such a moving and interesting article, it was inevitable a minority of miserable readers would complain. Frankly, what would Annie Wilkes say? something along the lines of "What is the matter with you people?"...I suspect.

<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> It's is not I who have taken this issue to personally. In constructing this article, I took great care in to adhering to any regulations that govern the quality of articles submitted in to Wikipedia. The points I have chosen to highlight in my article are fact based, so it utterly baffles me as to how 'some' people still choose to dispute the truth. Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but certainly FACTS are undisputable, and it was my assumption that Wikipedia is suppose to be FACT BASED. So perhaps those who moan about their own interpretations of the movie, can post their offensive comments on a chatroom ELSEWHERE. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 161.74.11.24 (<a href="../../../1/6/1/User_talk%7E161.74.11.24.html" title="User talk:161.74.11.24">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_161.74.11.24_8cc3.html" title="Special:Contributions/161.74.11.24">contribs</a>) 10:32, November 8, 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<p><b>The Author</b> The anonymous person (with IP Add 161.74.11.24) is me, the author...I had no intention of masking my identity, merely as I do not sign in everytime, I leave a comment. But if you were to have read the comments by Samuraiman89 (Author) and Anonymous, you should realise the conistency and continuations of the same points made. Such immature behaviour as 'Socking' is very unlikely to be adopted by myself over such a trivial issue as this article.....after all, we're not exactly arguing about the merits of world peace, or some deeply important goverment inituative.

<p>I am an avid reader of Stephen King Novels, and with Misery being my favourite of them all, I was utterly disappointed to find out that people were petitioning for this fantastic and humorous article to be deleted.</p>
<p>As a journalist for an independent magazine, in which the fantastic phrase 'Cockadoodie Car' was voted the No.1 most memorable phrase in a Stephen King novel (with It’s ‘can you float?' coming in a close second), I believe that all fans of the novel and movie should be able to express their own personal views and interpretations of the depiction of the Annie Wilkes character in any way, shape or form, and wherever they wish, and that is exactly what the author of this article has done. I personally think that it is utterly repugnant, revolting, vile, nauseating and absolutely appalling that some people would rally together and demand that this article be deleted. Once again I must state 'repugnant'!!! Wikipedia is a place for people all over the world to share knowledge defined as ‘the fact of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or association’. With this definition in mind I believe that the author has done nothing wrong as everything that is stated in the article was something gained through the experience of reading the book or watching the movie. Nothing mentioned in the article has been falsified they are all of fact, and I am sure they were not intended to disparage the character in question. This article is merely a description of certain scenes depicted in the movie, and I think it goes without saying that Kathy Bates did not receive an academy award for her performance in this film for nothing.</p>
<p>What era are you people living in, the Puritan era? Is this a remake of the classic Salem witch hunts? I’m half expecting for you all to demand that the author be burned at the stake (along with the article)? Once again I must state ‘repugnant’. This kind of bullying will not and shall not be tolerated. If the author of the ‘Cockadoodie Car’ article had made false statements leading to a false representation about the book or film then I would see the need for this cause of action. But I have read the book and watched the film a countless number of times and the phrase is fundamental in describing the mental state and actions of Annie Wilkes.Oh the misery 22:08, 8 November 2006 (UTC)M.

<p>More than happy to obilge, but I do not appreciate meritless accusations.</p>

<dd>I wish Annie Wilkes was here now to give you all a good dose of medicine and send you straight to bed! I also hear she has superb expertise in <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chiropody.html" title="Chiropody">chiropody</a>. I'm sure she would object to all this bickering, as "It has no nobility!" lol! 80.47.141.248 15:32, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>If she were here, she would be expected to object based on Wikipedia criteria. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 15:55, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><i>No actually, if she were here, should would probably clonk everyone over the head with a typewriter, for trying to sabotage an article about her". As <a href="../../../l/i/n/Ling_Woo_68a8.html" title="Ling Woo">Ling Woo</a> would say "I'm getting bored".</i></p>

<dd>As Ling Woo also said, "I'm deaf to condescension. Right now I could hear a pin drop!" Hold on, I'm not sure I'm "comfortable" with what I just said. I think it has just set off the nervous twitch in my moustache. 80.47.162.46 23:40, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>A bit off topic, sorry, but I must say that the AfD is one of the more entertaining parts of WP. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 01:03, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Is that a positive response for my article? "Sniff, Sniff"</p>

<dd>He's not complimenting you, he's complimenting me and my razor sharp wit and use of Ally Macbeal catchphrases in a time of crisis. I'm not sure what I think of this article, as reading it caused a severe case of acid reflux in which I began to choke like Claire Ottoms. Bile. 80.47.148.228 16:40, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
