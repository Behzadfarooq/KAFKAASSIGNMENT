<li><b>Keep</b>, this list is well maintained and of specific scope and likely to be desired by those interested in Presidents. I don't think you can call it indiscriminate information when many people consider a candidate's occupational history when voting for them. So worth keeping. <a href="../../../n/o/s/User%7ENoSeptember_Signature13_6820.html" title="User:NoSeptember/Signature13"><font color="green"><b>NoSeptember</b></font></a> 13:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Amercians seem to make a fairly big deal about what their presidents did before they became president, so unlike general lists this one might actually be useful. I would have voted to keep the Phillipine presidents one if I'd seen it.

<li><b>Delete</b> We're not here to create index after index, which is what all these "Presidents (of <i>any</i> country) by XYZ" articles really are. This particular article is unnecessary and verges on being just a collection of facts unified by one factor; it also almost vergest on trivia taken outside of the context of a biography of an individual. It's enough to have the biographies of each of these presidents to contain their prior occupations. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:22, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per reasons here and at the other half-dozen presidential lists that people are trying to delete. I don't understand how anyone could even begin to argue that information about presidents like this is unencyclopedic? If you're not interested in politics, fine, go read other parts of wikipedia -- but why try to destroy something that is so obviously interesting to so many people?--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 19:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with you that this is interesting, and I am interested in politics, but interesting is a matter of opinion and it is not a reason for inclusion (just as "boring" is not a reason for deletion). <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 19:47, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I know. But I'm tired of stating the case that I and others have made at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Children_of_the_Presidents_of_the_United_States_99a4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Children of the Presidents of the United States">here</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Parents_of_the_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_4937.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Parents of the Prime Ministers of Canada">here</a> and several other places. These lists are clearly encyclopedic, and I'm really struggling to assume good faith to editors who classify this sort of information as frivolous trivia, and are nominating all these lists for destruction. "Notability" is a matter of opinion as well, and apparently the definition of the word "indiscriminate" is a matter of opinion on wikipedia. I'm genuinely frustrated by these nominations. The ability to index something in multiple ways makes wikipedia <i>better</i> than any other source of information. These lists are notable by any standard, verifiable, relevant, useful, discriminate, more important than 95 percent of the content on wikipedia, etc., etc. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>!!! There's no good reason to destroy these indexes.--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 22:17, 13 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>And there are those of us who are probably tired of stating our contrary case in these discussions. You're right, notability is largely a matter of opinion, and as such we're all entitled to our opinions. What you may see as "destruction" others, like me, may see as diminishing the overall value of this encyclopedia. Throwing around loaded terms like "destruction" doesn't really convince me that this list is "clearly encyclopedic". Saying so doesn't make it so. I see this list as clearly trivial, but likewise, saying so doesn't make it so, so I rely on the observation that this is simply a bunch of otherwise inconsequential facts strung together only by the fact that there happen to be "presidents" involved. I'm also not clear why anyone with a contrary opinion is being lumped into whatever spat is going on with Philippean-related topics. Some of us just browse AfD and comment on those articles that garner our attention. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 02:39, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You honestly think that it's unimportant what presidents did before they were presidents? Even though it's incessantly covered and important to millions of people when they vote? Even though a president's early career is covered in probably countless news articles before the election, and however many biographies after? It's unimportant what sort of previous experience the people that lead countries have?--<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 08:27, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It shouldn't be too difficult to come up with guidelines or rules that could rope in the more serious "Presidents by XYZ" lists. Topics that are or were important to voters or to the lives of the presidents themselves could stay in and those that are not could stay out. IN would be height, military service, religion, basic information about their wives and family, reasons for dying; OUT would be things like taste in music, dental hygiene, what musical instruments they might have played. All the IN stuff would be potentially useful (very broadly defined) to people seriously studying history and of some interest to the rest of us, the OUT stuff would be totally useless to the historian. Them's my thoughts, anyway. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 21:49, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> who the hell cares if President X used to clean toilets!? You wouldn't have a List of Monarchs of the United Kingdom by Previous Occupation (ie Prince of Wales, Princess Royal etc) and this is no different to my mind. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 22:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I care if President X used to clean toilets! Isn't that opinion Jcuk? Just because the Philippine lists aren't getting enough support doesn't mean Kevin Ray has to lash out at the related lists. Being insulted is no reason to start a nominating frenzy. The information can be merged and people interested in world politics can be given the heads up instead of this. Many of these lists are good tools for research no matter what country's leaders they are about. It can save a lot of time when trying to gather information. Many people would find it interesting of informative to find out what world leaders did before and after rising to their status, like <a href="../../../g/o/v/Governor-General_of_the_Philippines_c89d.html" title="Governor-General of the Philippines">Governor-General of the Philippines</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Howard_Taft_3129.html" title="William Howard Taft">William Howard Taft</a>.... <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 23:48, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Well, thats your prerogative to care. But it's also a list of indiscriminate information held together by the single fact the people mentioned in it happened to be President of a country. <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> 00:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as prior occupation is very often used to identify Presidents and classify their styles (e.g. <a href="../../../a/b/r/Abraham_Lincoln_11e8.html" title="Abraham Lincoln">The Railsplitter</a>, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Truman_9c27.html" title="Harry Truman">haberdasher</a>) and is also frequently a campaign issue positive or negative (<a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">CEO President</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">actor President</a>). In particular the number of Presidents who have been lawyers, Senators, or Governors is often of interest. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 23:51, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
