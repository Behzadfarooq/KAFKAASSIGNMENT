<ul>
<li>I don't understand this comment. What does stability have to do with this? There are a number of very unstable elements on the current periodic table. As far as I can see, the relevant distinction is between synthesized and unsynthesized. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 19:53, 26 August 2005 (UTC)]

<ul>
<li><i>Theoretically</i> speaking, the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Island_of_stability.html" title="Island of stability">island of stability</a> is a very important aim for synthesizers, to prove theory versus experiment. And so are the last chemically stable elements. These are marks to aim for to test theory against reality. The other elemetns are just targets to get your name in the paper. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 17:06, 27 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay. I continue to be perplexed by your argument. There are a number of unstable elements in the peroidic table, and they are very important for theoretical reasons and as building blocks for higher numbered elements. It is very likely that elements in the <i>island of stability</i> will be extremely unstable too. I simply don't understand your argument. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 11:27, 28 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Certainly. But if every single one of the hundreds of thousands of schools in America is notable, I fail to see how any of the far-smaller number of state, U.S. and Interstate highways can be deemed non-notable.

<li>As much as I can appreciate this sentiment, it has nothing to do with the matter at hand. If someone spent 100 hours working on an article about his belly button lint, I would feel bad about the wasted effort, but that would not change the validity of the article.

<li>They *are* encyclopedic, in the views of a goodly number of editors. This isn't like an article on some fan forum or a crufty screed on a Star Wars character who got 5 seconds of screen time. These are articles on important links in the transportation network of the United States, which are encyclopedic for being (relatively) permanent, publicly-constructed, widely used and verifiable.

<li>You heard it here! Roads are the new schools. I remain utterly convinced by the suggestion that institutions that obtain state-level grants for their construction and maintenance can be described as "non-notable". When we remove neutral, verifiable information from Wikipedia, we degrade it in a small way. If we continue to do so, we end up degrading it in a large way. We have no noticeable namespace problems, we have no noticeable diskspace problems, so the only real reason for removing something from Wikipedia is the suggestion that the information could be damaging to the project. In what way does the information that there is a road leading out to <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._George_Island_1801.html" title="St. George Island">St. George Island</a>, designated Florida State Road 300, damage Wikipedia?

<p>This firm was added to the "Law Firms" article. It is a well known law firm in Maine and New England. I will delete it if that's what people want, but it's not an advertisement, no more than the article for any of the other law firms. There's not solid reason to delete this page. I will continue to expand it and improve its quality, if allowed. I've started other articlessuch as the University of Maine School of Law and greatly expanded Searsport, Maine. If given the chance, I'll make this just as good as those. Please let me know when this is resolved so I can remove the tag and continue my work. Thank you. AFethke 02:17, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't see any indication that this firm is in any way notable. We don't have, and IMO shouldn't have, an article on every small law firm in the world. <b>Delete</b> unless edited to indicte the encyclopedic significance of this firm. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 02:26, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>If you'd like,I can cite the hundreds of times the firm and its members have been mentioned in various media outlets, the countless appellate cases they have argued and the case citations, (meaning the firm has been instrumental in shaping the course of Miane and federal law) the fact that their members are (were) the Presidents of the State Bar Association, County Bar Association, Maine Trial Lawyers Associaiton....balh blah blah. It may be small, but all firms in Maine are considered small. In fact, Gross Minsky is condered a medium sized firm in Maine. If firms have to be over 50 peoples to be notable that knocks out every firm in Miane, NH and almost allof Vermont. That's not right. How else could I prove it its notability?AFethke 02:31, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I will probably be the only person voting for the article, given the small legal communbity here in Maine, so delete it if you will and I won't argue anymore. I just think it would be a mistake. Just mentioning in the list of law firms on the law firms page would be fine I guess. Just think about it and don't be so quick to judge.AFethke 02:36, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Woah, I would have waited more than 10 minutes to put a VfD tag on.

<dd>I would generally interpret <i>Alpha</i> as unreleased in any meaningful form. For that matter, Google doesn't see any relevant reference in the top 100 apart from the developer's personal page and the project host. I did see the League of Ordinary Shuffleboard Players, though. If notability can be established, I'll be happy to recant. —&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a>&#160;|&#160;<small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a>&#160;/&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 03:09:43, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well, The name "Alpha" doesn't represent it well, if you want to find more relevant google results search "losp liero open source project". <s>Can I remove the VfD status now..&#160;?</s> <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonir_65b3.html" title="User:Yonir">Yonir</a></p>
<dl>
<dd>That string you suggest gives 27 hits before Google lapses into similar pages. Seeing correct results for the full version of the acronym does suggest that, if it survives, the article should be renamed. Regardless, the VfD needs to run its course. —&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a>&#160;|&#160;<small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a>&#160;/&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 04:02:09, 2005-08-26 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>I realized that I'm not supposed to delete VfD status now reading in the "Guide to Votes for Deletion".. So you're saying that a page must be named after the search line that will make google give the most relevant results..&#160;? If the League of Ordinary Shuffleboard Players want a wikipedia page they can make a "ambigouty" (sp) page.. (well, they don't "deserve" a wikipedia page I guess though&#160;:p) Anyway, I don't think that "LOSP Liero Open Source Project" is the best string for results, as it is usually reffered to as LOSP, this just gives only relevant results. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonir_65b3.html" title="User:Yonir">Yonir</a></p>
<p><s>btw how do you add the "personal info" line (such as "—&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_e5f3.html" title="User:Lomn">Lomn</a>&#160;|&#160;<small><a href="../../../l/o/m/User_talk%7ELomn_137a.html" title="User talk:Lomn">Talk</a>&#160;/&#160;<a href="../../../l/o/m/User%7ELomn_RfC_1736.html" title="User:Lomn/RfC">RfC</a></small> 04:02:09, 2005-08-26 (UTC)")</s></p>
<p>Since LOSP is pretty much a thing of the past, cant it just be moved in under <a href="../../../l/i/e/Liero.html" title="Liero">Liero</a> just like Joosa was? Wikipedia is suppose to have everything right? But now it doesnt if things get deleted. So at least put it somewhere else. Either with Liero or with Gusanos. <a href="../../../u/l/v/User%7EUlvbot_8b83.html" title="User:Ulvbot">Ulvbot</a> 06:11, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>though both Liero and gusanos refer to "LOSP", that's what made me create the article on the first place.. <a href="../../../y/o/n/User%7EYonir_65b3.html" title="User:Yonir">Yonir</a> 12:56, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Gusanos deserves his own page on Wikipedia, since it's actively being developed.

<p>ok, I merged LOSP into <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gusanos.html" title="Gusanos">Gusanos</a> (I think it's better there, since the games are merging too, makes sence to merge the articles&#160;;o) and changed the links for LOSP to the gusanos section on LOSP (gusanos#LOSP).

<p>Advertising, just barely, what do you think? <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">inks</a> 03:49, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>(Comments by page creator, batsonjay)<br />
<b>Keep</b> - I intend to make it less an advertising page, and point out more *pedia concepts. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkypaws_784e.html" title="User:Inkypaws">lnks</a> just reviewed the page after I'd made my first editing/creation pass but hadn't finished the process.</p>
<p>I intend to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Chirp to point out that most Project Management Software applications address the wrong problems for most people who try to use them. (e.g. most people why try a project management package really just want to manage a flow of tasks, not "manage a discreet project" where timelines, resource allocations, etc. are studied.) Project Management is a particularly well-developed skill and art, but beyond the needs -- and skills -- of most people. Yet most Project Management Software packages studiously focus on implementing this art, and leave users in the dark about alternate ways of managing an ongoing flow of work. I can and will make this point on the Project Management Software page, but I can't do it all there. It is more appropriate to draw the full contrast on a page for Chirp to point to for more complete discussion of the issue raised on the former page;</li>
<li>Point at this page from SyncML. Chirp incorporates a novel application of SyncML. (SyncML is normally thought of as useful only to syncrhonize contact information between a phone/PDA and a computer. Chirp uses SyncML for application-level data synchronization.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I know Microsoft Project is a well-known application, but if Chirp software gets deleted for "Advertising" reasons, then so should the <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Project_caa0.html" title="Microsoft Project">Microsoft Project</a> page out of fairness. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsonjay_f372.html" title="User:Batsonjay">Batsonjay</a> 04:22, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Jay, no offense intended, but there's no way that Chirp software (or Plum Canary for that matter) merits a Wiki article. Neither are notable yet. Even if you were to re-write as you describe, it would fall under the category of "original research" or "point of view".

<p>This page should be deleted because it was created inartfully. I tried to create it hierarchically under the "Project management software" page for two reasons: 1) The product name (Chirp) is the same as an existing page for the word <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chirp.html" title="Chirp">Chirp</a> which deals with a completely different subject. In order ot create a disambiguation link, I first created the Chirp page "under" Project management. 2) I then decided to create a page called Chirp software that was NOT under <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_management_software.html" title="Project management software">Project management software</a>, and point the disambiguation link there. I think this is a better placement. Therefore, this first page ("under" Project management software) should be deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatsonjay_f372.html" title="User:Batsonjay">Batsonjay</a> 03:58, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but a little <b>comment</b> I'm fed up finding articles (and particularly legal ones) that assume, but don't state, that they are refering to the US. No problem with lots of US articles - lots of problems with the assumption that the US is the default subject matter arround here.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I substantially revised this article back on January 6–8.

On January 26, <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">User:Neutrality</a> deleted the disambiguation page, moved "Judiciary Acts (US)" to "Judiciary Act", and put a disambiguation link to the Australian Judiciary Act at the top of the page.

<dd>Trollderella, as I said yesterday on a different VfD, notability as an inclusion critereon is clearly inferred from the following section to the Wikipedia <b>policy</b> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: <b>"Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia."</b>. If I own a cat, and take a picture of that cat, then I could make a factual and verifiable article entitled I have a cat, and you would vote keep for it because it is both factual (one can look at the picture in the article) and verifiable (if you don't believe the picture, you can come to my house and the cat will be there).

<dd>Perhaps, but I can't see how, you're constructing a strawman about a silly article that can't be verified without conducting original research, and trying to make the argument that articles that are referenced and do not need original research to verify are not valid because you might write one about your cat.

<dd>And to look at the some of reasons given by Xed to keep: first, we have no idea how many members the site has, it being private. Re: Points of Rock, the criteria for maintenance of geographical location stubs has <i>no bearing</i> on the criteria for maintenance of pages about non-notable subjects (i.e., my house has seven residents in it, should I put a page up on Wikipedia?). Parodies don't make a site notable in an of themselves. And mention by Jason Kottke doesn't make a site notable (or if it does, we have a lot of work to do cataloging all the sites, memes, people, places, and other subjects he's covered and adding those citations and references to those articles). <a href="../../../d/e/l/User%7EDelfuego_7a53.html" title="User:Delfuego">Jason</a> 11:21, August 26, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Zoe, is it really necessary to have a running commentary of what you think of every vote I make?

<li>It's necessary to comment on every incorrect vote, when the vote is in opposition to deletion policy.

<li>By creating the article, and moving this information into it, along with more, if possible. If it were not likely to lead to more dogged pursuit by you, I would do it myself.

<p>When I cheked this out I originally listed it as a speedy delete as I was unable to find any reference to Squodge mcdodge anywhere. This was removed later. Later after I asked for references the blog link was created. The blog was created in August. There was also three email contacts. One was not valid and eventually I got replies from Steve Harris &lt;stevharris@gmail.com&gt; "If this is about the wiki thing, then Squodge wasn't really a major thing, surprised it was put on wikipedia. Suppose i could get pics and stuff if you relly wanted" and Chris Sawyer &lt;sawychris@gmail.com&gt; "i can provide images. blogs arnt good enough apparently".

<p>1) The Dialectic has history from before 1861. The earliest paper records show somewhere before 1770.. although it could be older still, and no doubt is (i.e. it is unlikely that the first ever record would be kept etc).</p>
<p>2) On the Dialectic page, it should be 'Reftable Debate' not 'Refutable'.</p>
<p>3) I think student societies should be separate from unions they may or may not be affiliated to. They are, after all, separate organisations.</p>
<p>4) If someone created a page for the Hawks Club (i.e. the sporting blues assoc. at Cambridge) there wouldn't be such an outcry. I am surprised there isn't a page for this historical society.</p>
<p>5) I would also point to the TCD Phil and TCD Hist societies - why do these have separate pages, when they ostensibly do the same thing - why not merge the pages? I don't think mere 'age' is a good enough reason to keep some things, and remove others - it is somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p>6) The 139 plays a very distinct role, one clearly different from the student union it might happen to use for it's dinners.</p>
<p>R Marrs</p>
<p>R Marrs is running several issues together, some of his comments about other pages should be dealt with on their own merits, not dealt with here. There is not yet a page for the Hawks Club, I reserve judgement on whether to treat it as notable. I can't find the pages for the "TCD Phil" and "TCD Hist" societies, could he point us to them? The crucial point he is missing here is that if the 139 Club is notable, then every student club at every university in the world is notable. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 23:26, 2005 August 28 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Why shouldn't every student club at every university in the world have a place? My understanding of Wikipedia was that these quirks and idiosyncracies made it unique. ("Trinity College Dublin" contains the links to TCD Phil &amp; Hist)P.S. I am currently President of the Glasgow University Union and no sock puppet! --Niallrowantree 17:45, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This last comment is by an anon user, I suspect some sockpuppetry. I have had a look at the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_College%2C_Dublin_ea97.html" title="Trinity College, Dublin">Trinity College, Dublin</a> article, it says "Trinity College has a vibrant student life with 96 societies and 50 sports clubs", are we really going to have a Wikipedia article for all 144 clubs, and the same for all other universities? TCD Phil and TCD Hist are the only 2 student clubs at TCD who appear to have an article, they and GU Dialectic have a lengthy history and organise some sort of significant intellectual activity, not just a booze-up once a term, several student clubs at GU do more than that. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 17:16, 2005 August 29 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hawks Club - from my understanding it is a club for all the Blues at Cambridge. This would include some sporting stars such as Rob Andrew, Gavin Hastings and some not so sporting stars such as Hugh Laurie. I presume this would be dealt with separately from say the Cambridge University Sports Association, although they are obviously linked together.</p>
<p>The crucial point PatGallacher is missing is that there is no reason as to why every student club at every university isn't notable. Will The 139 be allowed on here if one of their alumni becomes a Captain of Industry or a politician etc? I would argue such arbitrary distinctions are nonsense. If people are arguing for it's inclusion, surely that alone nearly makes it worthy of inclusion?</p>
<p>Would it not make Wikipedia a more vibrant encyclopedia to include quirks such as The 139? I don't think we have heard good enough arguments from PatGallacher - and surely, it is for the 'deleters' to prove their case.</p>
<p>Moreover, the real fact of the matter is that not all societies will fill up the pages of Wikipedia. For example, Eton College has it's own entry but is really only an educational establishment which happens to have had a few old boys go on to do a few things. Would you object to this because every school in the world might want an entry? No clearly not, because clearly not every school in the world wants a page on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Sock Puppetry? I'm not exactly sure what that is being relatively new to the Wikipedia phenomenon. Niall Rowantree is the current president of the Union, and I think was the person behind the original 139 entry. I would get in contact with him, his details are readily available on the GUU website.</p>
<p>I think this comes down to simple snobbishness. 'GU Dialectic has a lengthy history and organise some sort of intellectual activity, not just a booze up once a term, several student clubs at GU do more than that'.</p>
<p>If The 139 held debates, political rallies or brainstorming sessions would a page be approved? If PatGallacher had any contact with either the Dialectic, or the Phil and the Hist, he/she would know that rather a lot of their activities are based around 'booze ups'. The fact that something is new should not preclude it from entry, and the fact that something is not 'intellectual', and I don't know where that allegation comes from whether it is true or not, should preclude entry either.</p>

Furthermore, I notice the Glasgow University Shinty Club has it's own page. Neither particularly historic, promotes drinking far more heavily than The 139 (which bizarrely seems to be a criteria) and probably not particularly noteworthy under most people's definitions. I'd keep it, but I think we have a precedent for University Clubs at Glasgow getting their own page.--86.130.145.220 21:39, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Robert Marrs's points are not persuasive. He gives reasons why a "Hawks Club" entry would be suitable: the prominence of members, the international name recognition it has. "The 139 Club" has neither of these attributes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Equally his argumentation regarding "Eton" is self-defeating. Arguments against the inclusion of other schools would clearly be if they were "not sufficiently notable"; the very same charge being leveled against "the 139 Club" entry.</p>
<p>His points regarding "booze-ups" and linking "Glasgow University Dialectic Society", "TCD Phil" and "TCD Hist" are unconvincing. While drinking may occur in those other institutions that is not their primary activity nor constitutional function. Their role is a public one, which "the 139 Club"'s is not: to debate.</p>
<p>Despite Mr Marrs's comments: newness should preclude entry, unless the institutional is unusually notable.</p>
<p>There is no "right" to be included in "Wikipedia". Instead there are criteria which make inclusion worthwhile to a global community. A primary one being "sufficiently notable". Brown27 11:34, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>1) I've had rather a lot of experience of TCD Phil, TCD Hist and the Dialectic, I wonder very much whether you have? If not, your opinion is somewhat valueless. You are assuming things that might not actually be true. 2) I would say a decent definition of encyclopedia means 'A comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field, usually arranged alphabetically, usually dealing with the entire field of human knowledge'. Surely including The 139 would make Wikipedia more 'comprehensive' and such articles would meet the criteria of a 'wide range of subjects'. Limiting things on somewhat arbitray bases such as 'newness', 'fame' and the 'activity they do' is somewhat snobbish and prescriptivist. Why is boozing any less valuable than some students debating, if this is what The 139 actually do? Why is the relatively new (and non-historic, non-famous) GU Shinty club allowed a page? 3) The 139 isn't even particularly new, as it is based around a historical event - highlighting how important that event is to some people. However, as they are independent of the GUU they should not be lumped together here. --RobertMarrs 12:55, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</b> it says somewhere. I would regard <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow_University_Shinty_Club_e2b7.html" title="Glasgow University Shinty Club">Glasgow University Shinty Club</a> as only borderline notable, but it has been in existence since 1901, represents the university at a recognised sport, and has had some significant successes over the years. Merely commemorating a notable event does not make you notable, I suspect POV pushing. We already have the "average professor test" i.e. to be notable you have to have done more than the average professor, I suggest we add the "average student club test". <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 16:44, 2005 August 30 (UTC)</p>
<p>But if this test was to be brought in, you would have to delete GU Shinty as they aren't terribly notable - 103 years old, a few successes, hardly Kingussie Shinty Club. Surely POV pushing is what this is all about - you think it should be out, I think it should be in. POV pushing by using the page itself is nonsensical, there is no point of view pushing on the page it merely relates facts. Unless, you think that the club itself has an agenda - which would make nearly every club in the world not worthy of inclusion.--RobertMarrs 17:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>On another point who actually makes the decision here?--RobertMarrs 17:56, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - not notable. GlasgowUni 22:24, 2005 August 30 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>SAVE</b> This is very much a note worthy club because of its relationship to the critical shift in membership status for women at the last all male student club. If this event and the club it created is not note worthy what is? --ViaVeritasVita 11:05, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the interest that this has ignited is reason enough for keeping it!--Niallrowantree 11:31, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>- not notable The 139 club is certainly not worthy of note. It is only a few years old and amounts to drunken boyish tomfoolery. The original 139 (who voted not to accept women in 1981) have never been at or even associated with this club- if you can call it that. Infact they would be disgusted at the behaviour of some of the members at this dinner. All this amounts to is vanity. 62.49.29.190</li>
</ul>
<p>Um, do we accept votes from people with no name? Because surely that is more likely to involve sock-puppetry? On the last post, it seems to me we have a classic example of POV pushing. 1) No name 2) Allegations that, let's face it, cannot be upheld. Debate the issue on it's merits (which on the whole have been widely sidestepped) not on whether you like the club or not. --RobertMarrs 07:56, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The 139 may be there, ostensibly, to commemorate a past event but the fact that the club is only a few years old speaks even more against it. That there was no previous club, from what I can tell, or even if there was the fact that it was discontinued (if it did exist at all a continuous existence since the vote has not been mentioned on this site), implies that this event, whilst of note in the history of the Glasgow University Union, seems not important enough even for a "society" to be formed in its honour, let alone to have a seperate entry dedicated to it (in the form of this nascent club). If those around at the time did not feel strongly enough about it then those, twenty years later, cannot claim to be maintaining any sort of grand tradition of note. It's a bit sad really</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, I can vouch for brown27's remarks as to these debating societies. Mr Marrs' argument, such that it is, that "I have considerable experience- do you!" is not only pathetically childish it is also exposes the duplicitous nature of his whole approach here. Perhaps to Mr. Marrs debating at Glasgow University is only about gettign drunk, but to the vast majority there is a higher purpose, as exhibited in the Constitution and in the long, long, honourable traditon and history of the Society. The fact he refuses to admit this- despite his great experience- is quite scandalous and undermines his case. The argument, at any rate, was not about whether there is drinking but if that was the primary purpose. It evidently is not in the case of the Dialectic Society but is in the case of the 139 Club.</p>
<p>The reasons to delete it are so numerous. The reason to keep it seems to be based on the merits of non-existent entries. Perhaps that tells us something. The 139 cannot claim anything to the public good, the public interest, the public knowledge- it is the definition of without note.</p>
<p>--Brian Roberts 12:00, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Um, ok good some actual arguments. Thanks Brian. Firstly, my points regarding my experience with the societies (GUD, TCD Hist and TCD Phil)were that I had direct first hand experience of those societies, I doubt very much whether 'Anon' does. If they don't have experience of these societies, how on earth can they claim to know what they do or how they operate? They cannot - surely? Moreover, my point for the Hist and the Phil was that there was a precedent for two linked societies having separate pages (i.e. they do the same thing at the same university), and I also pointed out the precedent of The GU Shinty club - which would also meet your criteria of being without note. I think my knowledge of the society in question is shown above, where I've tried to correct factual errors on the GUD page... On drinking - ah reductio ad absurdum, the old classic. My point about GUD drinking stands. 45 people speak in a GUU parliamentary, double that number (at least) go to the after debate drinks. Moreover, for many of GUD's members are there primarily for social reasons - only between 8 and 10 debate competitively outwith the GUU. So for many members, as these examples show the main point is the socialising. Nothing wrong at all with being a social member, I am happy to say while I was at university I enjoyed both the debating side and the social side.</p>
<p>On your point regarding the original 139. Many refused ever to set foot in the building after the mixing issue, so it would be a bit difficult to keep things going. Moreover, there are other societies that keep such traditions at Glasgow alive but aren't quite as public as the 139. I point to 'The Lion and Unicorn Club' amongst others, so the spirit has indeed lived on.</p>
<p>I think the encyclopedia definition that I gave is a more compelling argument than your definition of 'without note', but at least you have been good enough to give one.</p>
<p>TTFN--RobertMarrs 13:12, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Further to Rob's post. There are numerous all-male societies around campus for undergraduates and graduates, and many of the original 139 attend these dinners. The Diners Club (I think now defunct) operated for a good few years; The Winers Club (still in operation); the LAMB Club (still in operation, standing for Last All Male Board); The Lion &amp; Unicorn (still in operation although numbers are drastically down); The Jolly Rodgerers (now defunct, ran by a board member throughout the 1980's and 1990's); The 139 Club (as discussed above, relatively new although admittedly thriving); The 21 Club (rather unsavoury even by University drinking standards, I think now defunct)the Monkey Steakers (I think disbanded, but ran for many a year).</p>
<p>Also, of some importance, is the Girlie Dinner. This dinner is run by girls in and around the GUU, and has been running for over 10 years. However, it does seem to have taken a nosedive in recent years and does not have the 'fervour' of The 139.</p>
<p>A number of those clubs appear to be defunct. However, of course if students are offered a chance to get drunk for very little money people are going to come. The other clubs mentioned are old boy clubs- which are different entities. But none of this undermines my point- the purpose of these "societies" appears to be to drink. However many people who ATTEND debates go for drink, that is not the point of debating. And if it is then that is truly sad. I will also add that the number of people who can go outside the university to debate competitively is rather limited due to places available and funding. I would 10 was a very high number indeed.</p>
<p>Secondly, as to other pages like the Shinty club. No-one has claimed that this society is the definition of a club of note. We are not discussing the nerits of the Shinty club entry, rather the merits of this entry. The fact there are other illegitimate entries uncontested does not mean this illegitimate entry should be allowed.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. (I'm the original author) -- The entry has been accused of vanity, which may seem the case. (I'll be the first to admit that I'm a little vain.) In any event, each of the sites mentioned are, in fact, the "largest on the web in their particular genre". While other editors of this fine site may not personally be aware of these particular sites, this does not change the fact that when I say "the largest", I do so based on unbiased numbers. I did not claim that they were the best (etc.), as this would be mere opinion, but "largest" is a term used to define a measurable statistic, which in these cases, refer to sheer volume of information. At any rate, the Jake Russell article has been signifigantly modified to better "fit in" with the encyclopedic nature of this site. One other issue that I should mention, as it concerns editors involved with the original article re: <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_539c.html" title="The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>. I don't mind that my entries are moved, as this is the very nature of Wikipedia, but the reasons given is that the link to HHGTTGOnline.com is "suspected vanity". This is not the case. I reordered the sites in a legitimately fair order. HHGTTGOnline.com is the largest fan site. DouglasAdams.se is the largest fan-forum. ZZ9 (while a worthwhile group) is a fan appreciation society, and not as relevant to the majority of surfers simply looking for information, pictures, merchandise, etc.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Ok, guys. I understand why you want to delete these pages. I just don't like the hidden presumption that I'm willfully spoiling the Wikipedia. I guess I don't understand the vibe here. It seems every entry has to be <i>interesting</i>. Wikipedia apparently has no ambition to reflect the real world, where there are also little known initiatives. Or is it the fact that I'm involved in the above mentioned entries? How else are you getting people motivated to write an article? It's either interest or involvement. I now learned involvement is not done. So be it. But I didn't mean to do harm. Good luck with the Wiki. -- <a href="../../../j/u/i/User%7EJuiceboyy_3f5f.html" title="User:Juiceboyy">Juiceboyy</a> 19:14, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. For me, this is a hard decision. On one hand, as it stands this article fails to establish importance -- it does mention that his grandfather was a <i>Kegnazmatch</i>, an honorific in Ethiopian feudal society equivalent to a <a href="../../../b/a/r/Baron.html" title="Baron">baron</a>, yet the external link given does not resolve &amp; the paragraph that we have fails to establish notability. (Thousands of Ethiopian intelligentsia -- in this case, people who could read &amp; write -- were murdered by Gaziani during occupation.) On the other hand, however, a Google search found <a href="http://www.cpa.ed.ac.uk/edit/2.01/asrat.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cpa.ed.ac.uk/edit/2.01/asrat.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> and <a href="http://ethiopianreview.homestead.com/Article_AsratWoldeyes_Jun93.html" class="external text" title="http://ethiopianreview.homestead.com/Article_AsratWoldeyes_Jun93.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> which show that he was the foremost physician in Ethiopia, a Professor of Medicine, &amp; a political figure who was jailed by the <a href="../../../d/e/r/Derg.html" title="Derg">Derg</a>.

I know, I know, you're going to claim that some kind of verbal tradtion handed down from father to son, or argument from inference from some other page that has nothing to do with deletion policy means that it really is.

<li>While the word "notability" may not appear on the deletion policy page, its synonyms do in the criteria for speedy deletion, to which I wish articles like this were subject. If it is policy you want, let us consider <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which states categorically that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. That something can verifiably be said to exist does not make it worthy of having an article here. The fire hydrant outside my home exists, and I'm sure I could find a great deal of documentation regarding it which would not constitute original research. However, its notability, except to the neighborhood dogs, is suspect. If you are really looking to participate in a project which collects knowledge like so much string and tinfoil, may I suggest <a href="http://www.everything2.com" class="external text" title="http://www.everything2.com" rel="nofollow">Everything2</a>, where inclusionists are welcomed (be aware, though, that even in that paradise, some articles are not accepted). <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 00:56, 2005 August 27 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I somewhat resent the fact that, every time it is pointed out that nowhere in deletion policy is 'notability' mentioned, the discussion is taken immediately to 'oh, then you must be a lunatic who wants to keep absolutely everything, no matter how stupid it is'. That's simply not true, and not a fair characterisation of my position. If there is some synonym of notability that is, in fact, in the deletion policy, then why not use that? To demolish that extremely common and frustrating strawman, again, I really suspect that there is not enough documentation on the fire hydrant outside your house to write an article that would give information about that fire hydrant that was not true of any other one, except it's location. It would have no possibility to grow beyond a sub-stub, and would be better being merged into an article on fire hydrants in general. I am not advocating maintaining a list of all fire hydrants, this is clearly one of the things that wikipedia is not.

<li><b>Comment by the author</b>: I've no problem that you would like to delete this article since, I have to own up, that the contents of the article is yet weak. We will work on the topic some more years and return later. But what I do not appreciate, is that someone blames us for doing open-source software by calling us "kids" in a public domain as the wikipedia (<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 14:18, 26 August 2005). I think that judgeing over other people who write articles is nor in your responsablility nor is it the philosophy of wikipedia. It casts a negative light on the very good idea bases wikipedia. Anyway thanks for the feedback. thrawn at orxonox.ethz.ch, 00:10, 31 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was: <b>no consensus</b>. For a non-admin, this is a tough call, so I hope I don't get called for making it...but I'm calling this one "no consensus, therefore send it back to the drawing board". I feel fairly confident in doing so, since even the nominator noted that the version at the time of closing was significantly different from the version at the time of nomination. I'm going to close the VFD, because I don't see that the later discussion was even mildly contentious, but I'm also going to add a {{<a href="../../../c/l/e/Template%7ECleanup_258a.html" title="Template:Cleanup">cleanup</a>}} to the article, and let those editors working on the article itself decide when to remove it. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 07:42, September 1, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - (Just a vote by the page creator.) A case has been made that the material is covered in the Chirp software page, which itself is subject to a VfD process at the moment. It's possible a reasonable path is to delete the Chirp software page and simply let it have it's information in the Project Management Software product table, then leave this "corporate stub" page (we *do* have a user community, which can justify the entry) solely for the purpose of maintaining links from that table.

<li>It was rather a different page until you removed half the article. If you are going to slap a vfd tag on a page at least have the intellectual honesty not to remove its content and then pretend it is something it isn't. That's just slimey and its not the only page you have done that to.

<li>Even if true, and frankly I don't feel like spending the time to check on that right now, it doesn't affect this article in the least. If the information was vital to this subject, it should have been included in this article to begin with. What I see in the article is a bunch of messy writing that takes the POV that a particular theory about how certain length units originated is undisputed fact. (Couldn't you at least spell <i><a href="../../../l/e/a/League_%28unit%29.html" title="League (unit)">league</a></i> correctly?) The article dealing with that theory, <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscientific_metrology.html" title="Pseudoscientific metrology">Pseudoscientific metrology</a>, can use the portions that can't be moved into the appropriate articles on ancient measurements that present the bald facts of how units within a particular system relate to one another without speculations into their ultimate origins. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 14:42, 27 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> While a single article about all this would be encyclopedic and desirable, it is abundantly clear that <i>Mille passus</i> is the wrong name for it and that Rktect is unable to write about it in a style that is comprehensible to others or to follow Wiki-standards of formatting and organization. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 17:05, 31 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are hundreds of different ancient measures which each deserve their own article. Why don't you pick one, write an article in a style you feel is comprehensible to others and show me how you think it should be done? <a href="../../../r/k/t/User%7ERktect_7070.html" title="User:Rktect">Rktect</a> 18:41, August 31, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why don't I? Two reasons. First, by and large, when considered in isolation, potential articles on the hundreds of ancient measures are little more that dictonary definitions that may be suitable for inclusion in the Wiktionary. It's only when considered as a system that they reach the level of being ecyclopedic instead of dictionaric. Second, I don't have access to reliable sources that would enable me to write an article on this topic. <a href="../../../c/a/e/User%7ECaerwine_4090.html" title="User:Caerwine">Caerwine</a> 20:07, 3 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>"The New Oxford American Dictionary, in August 2005, gained media coverage when it was leaked that the second edition contained at least one fictional entry. This was later determined to be the word "esquivalience", defined as the willful avoidance of one’s official responsibilities, which had originally been added in the first, 2001, edition. It was intended as a copyright trap, as the text of the book was distributed electronically and thus very easy to copy."</dd>

<dd>Well, it doesn't exist, but it does, if you see what I mean. It's been in the news recently, which is why (presumably) someone put the page here...

<p>This page should be deleted because it is a poorly-written summary of a <a href="../../../s/p/o/SpongeBob_SquarePants_f415.html" title="SpongeBob SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> episode. An episode summary like this does not require its own page, but rather should be listed with its parent article (the article for the show), if desired. Note that this request only refers to <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_Monitor_beb0.html" title="Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> with a capital M. There is a separate article entitled <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hall_monitor.html" title="Hall monitor">Hall monitor</a> about school hall monitors that is fine for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchuminweb_da4b.html" title="User:Schuminweb">Schuminweb</a> 23:02, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> VfD is not clean up, "poorly written" is rarely grounds for deletion; VfD is not the place to discuss merging. Saying it "belongs in the parent article" is not grounds for deletion. There is also precedent for TV episodes in Wikipedia, and there's a whole category full of SpongeBob episodes. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> 23:15, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I unhappily have to agree with Soltak, with the important caveat that even totally trivial crap episodes of complete and utter shite series that aired for six months on late night cable in Norway are considered worthy for inclusion.

<li>Luckily in the online wikipedia SpongeBob and Botticelli are not in competition with each other, so we don't need a POV on which is more valuable. The tricky part comes when they <i>are</i> in competition for space, such as for a limited-size downloadable version.
