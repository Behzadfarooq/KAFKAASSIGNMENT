<p><b>Nu Mu Nu Fraternity</b> (Nu Mu's) is a collegiate social fraternity with 33 national chapters. The Fraternity was founded at Union College on October 22nd, 1822. The founders of the Fraternity, Hubert Cotton, Stephen Walter Johnson, and Howard William Clark, founded Nu Mu Nu as a literary organization. The Fraternity was founded to battle the tyranny of Kappa Chi Society, a secret society on Campus. The Nu Mu's excelled almost instantly on campus, winning many of the underclassmen over with their high vows of honor and strong convictions. The secret teachings of Nu Mu Nu as well as the weekly meeting places are kept completely secretive even to this day.</p>
<p><b>Expansion of Nu Mu</b> In 1854 a group of undergraduate students from Marietta College visited the Nu Mu's seeking initiation into its order. These men became known as the Beta Chapter. These two chapters, Union and Marietta, operated as the only two chapters of Nu Mu Nu for the next 50 years. In 1904 Nu Mu began to expand, opening chapters at Princeton, Hampton-Sydney College, State College of North Carolina, and Duke University.</p>
<p>To this day Nu Mu is ever expanding with 33 chapters all across the United States, with special concentrations in the South and North West.</p>
<p><b>Symbols of Nu Mu Nu</b> These symbols have esoteric meanings reserved only for initiated brother.</p>

<p>Peter Guillamon was born in Kearny, Arkansas in 1984. His parents being strapped for money soon moved into a trailer park in South Carolina. This is where he began writing and becoming more interested in the culture of the street.Given the name "CHEM 162" he began taggin and marking nearby trailers and barns in the area. Chem 162 coming from his love "dropping science" and chemistry. The 162 came from his high score in his favorite nintendo game(Excite Bike).Everything was all lovely until a tornado destroyred their home.His parents were having problems so at the age of 10 his moms bounced on his old mans and moved to the crime side the New York time side, the Shaolin land. This is where he shortened Chem 162 just to "Chem" and it stuck. After some problems at the local elementary school "Chem" dropped out of PS 36 at the age 11. With no job and no school his mother felt it was time for him to leave. So equipped with a Pilot marker and a hobo pack on a stick he headed south to New Jersey.Where he met some other drifters who encouraged him to ride the trains with them. This is where he began writing "CHEM : We Hardly Knew Thee" at the age of 17. After riding the rails for more then 10 years he returned to New York at the age 22.Where he resides in Staten Island. He is currently working at Applebees, and occasionally writing.</p>

I am a native son of San Francisco who has lived in the Sunset for 45 years attending Parkside, Hoover and Lincoln Schools, then graduating from City College, University of San Francisco and attending SF State University. I am one of the few current candidates who actually live in the Sunset District and work here as a Public High School Teacher at Abraham Lincoln High School.</p>
<p>My age is 55 years making me the Senior Supervisorial Candidate in this District. My over 35 years of activism in local neighborhood issues and projects has provided me with long term education and experience concerning our people and their issues of concern. But, what really sets me apart from all the other candidates is my written pledge in the San Francisco Voters Pamphlet to not seek any other political elective office after my term in office as a Supervisor. This means that I will only work for you, the constituents of our District and the citizens of San Francisco. David Ferguson owes no allegiance to special interests nor to any future selfish political aspirations!</p>
<p>Our neighborhood needs a committed, sensible and fair leader who will advocate for those of us who work and go to school daily. I am this person! Few local candidates have the diverse long term demonstrated hands on working experience with local projects, issues and action campaigns as I do. I have worked as a SAFE Neighborhood Organizer for crime prevention and community safety organizing, a Community Mental Health Worker/ Counselor for RAMS community mental health services, a SFUSD Teacher, an Event Producer and I am a SFFD trained NERT disaster relier volunteer since 1991.</p>
<p>Here are some of the diverse issues I have addressed through volunteer action: +Stopping UCSF from demolishing good housing on 3rd Avenue +Golden Gate Park Master Plan meetings input over 30 years +Illegal Fireworks on Ocean Beach and neighborhoods +Producing Free recreation and music events/ Le Tour de San Francesco Bicycle Ride and 30th Anniversary Summer of Love Concert +Numerous urban design workshops on SF public projects +Union actions for workers in San Francisco +Property owners rights activities +Under grounding utility wires +Kept garbage rates down at PUC meetings by critical questioning +Youth programs, activities and supporting +Ocean Beach Task Force for sand and beach erosion issues +South Sunset Playground piggy bank campaign to raise money +Westside Neighbors to End Homelessness action and planning +NPC grant award for creating Green space landscaped traffic calming island and community gardens +Committee to rebuild Sunset and West Sunset Playground structures +Community Policing Advocacy +Numerous Ocean Beach clean ups and neighborhood work days +Native Habitat Restoration work days in parks</p>
<p>“Service To The Sunset” is my slogan. The Sunset used to be a great place to live but today garbage and graffiti on every other corner, the merchant corridors are filthy, potholes in our streets,the homeless wander the neighborhood, too few park gardeners, lack of services for youth and seniors alike, play grounds here get “F” ratings from NPC and much more. I will hire staff who know how to read a budget and write grants to assist our hard working city departments and non profit service providers to get the money to work toward solutions for these ills. I can approach corporations to fund needed programs for our youth. I want to build a skateboard park for the Sunset’s youth. I want to hire more gardeners for parks like Stern Grove. If you have a complaint, I will investigate for you to resolve it. I will actually leave City Hall on a regular basis to walk the neighborhoods and talk with you about issues of current concern. I will make the Sunset the most desirable neighborhood to live in. Please vote for my vision of reason, care, sensibility and accountability.</p>

<p>A place like chuck E cheeses except bigger and darker. You can play lazer tag or golf in this place. Only one is located right now in Issaquah Washington. There is a big castle called the magic castle located at the other side of the magicoaster. the magicoaster is a ride that you build your own track, then you sit in a little car with a small TV in it. The TV will show the track as the car does the rest of the work. If you would like to play lazer tag you must sign up at a booth next to lazer tag. To play golf you must ask somebody that works there for some information. In the back of Illusionz, across from the magic castle, there is a place to eat called the magicafe. You can have your birthday party there or in a speacial party room. Visit www.illusionz.com for more details.</p>

<p>Bramptonian Singhdale Society is the name given to a private organization/club that emerged in 1997 in Brampton, Ontario (Canada) and has ever since grown in popularity in the city, gaining notoriety in surrounding cities such as Mississauga and some parts of Oakville and Toronto.</p>
<p>History</p>
<p>The founder is Turner Bagstien, a strongly religious man who was born in Oakville, Ontario to parents Jennifer and Grant Bagstein. Grant was a doctor at Brampton's Peel Memorial Hospital for 24 years, and Jennifer was a stay-at-home mom for most of her life, raising Turner and his brother Fenton. Turner was enrolled in Cub Scouts at a young age, like his father had been, and he found a natural home away from home in the club. He excelled in crafts and outdoor activities with the Scouts for several years. Fenton never joined the Cub Scouts, early evidence of their highly differing personalities and interests.</p>
<p>Turner went to Ryerson Polytechnic and obtained a master's degree in computer science, though it wasn't his true passion. He secured a job as a network administrator at Oracle Software's location in Mississauga, Ontario and remained there for 22 years. However, when he was 45 years old, a life-changing event occured that would leave Turner a different man.</p>
<p>While playing golf at a local club one Sunday, Turner was refused entry due to what he claims to be his association with East Indian members of the community of Brampton. The club, which Turner has never named, would not allow him to renew his dues and continue membership because of his contact and friendships with many of the Sikh faith, a denomination which had gained quite a share of Brampton's population at the time. Turner was so outraged at this, he decided to end his ties to the club and create his own, though it would not be a golf club. His intention was to create a private, secretive club that required membership, one that would attract many top Brampton politicians and business people and allow interaction between various minorities to enhance their understandings of one another, as well as provide opportunities for networking between members. He created the Bramptonian Singhdale Society on November 3rd, 1997.</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>The BSS has come under scrutiny from a select few Brampton and surrounding area residents for being so highly secretive. It has only become public knowledge (and very limited thereof) in recent years due to members telling peers outside of the club that they were members, creating a small word-of-mouth buzz that has elicited reaction from some conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>What truly goes on within the BSS is not yet known, though many have argued that it is a humble front for a national secret society of top business leaders and political figures, meeting regularly to dictate policy and legislation behind closed doors. Recently, in The Brampton Guardian, the BSS took out a small classified ad stating their intent to go public on December 31, 2006. This has attracted the call of conspiracy theorists that it has done this for a sinister purpose intended for the new year.</p>

<p>Four of five times when editing articles (and discussing them) I've wanted to put a link to <a href="../../../i/s/o/Isonomia.html" title="Isonomia">isonomia</a>.</p>
<p><b>But, having been savagely beaten nearly to death on the last article I posted, I'm reluctant to start another!</b></p>
<p><b>What I would like is some views before I start and ideally a stub-article on which to base it with headings etc. (which is what I was looking for when I got here!)</b></p>
<p>Isononomia was a concept similar to "democracy" used by early Greeks to mean "equality of political rights". It is in effect democracy without the elections (or as the Greeks would view it without allotment - but that's another debate).</p>
<p>My problem is that I can't keep mentioning it without giving a proper explanation, but without an article there isn't a place to give a proper explanation. All the article needs to do is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give a translation</li>
<li>Give the history of the word</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>e.g. Cleisthenes called these reforms isonomia ("equality under the law"), rather than democratia.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Quickly explain that "equality of political rights" only referred to citizens (ie not slaves, metics)</li>
<li>Show the relationship between isonomia and democracy</li>
<li>Give a few of the classic quotes such as Herodotus</li>
<li>Refer to articles such as <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democracy.html" title="Democracy">democracy</a> <a href="../../../a/t/h/Athenian_democracy.html" title="Athenian democracy">Athenian democracy</a> <a href="../../../e/g/a/Egalitarianism.html" title="Egalitarianism">Egalitarianism</a> <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleisthenes.html" title="Cleisthenes">Cleisthenes</a></li>

<p>|PLOW| is a Battle For Middle Earth Clan, its members bear the tags of |PLOW|,[PLOW],[PL0W] or PLOW|. |PLOW| was originally [AoA], but its founding members G3RRARD, DanTheDangerous and Pete decided to take a new more serious approach to their clan, in order to achieve success in the clanwars.cc league. Starting out as a clan which used positive attitudes to lure solid players in, El Noobero joined. Although not being a gifted BFME player, his gift of a banner secured him a place on the roster. Soon after, Raider joined, being a skilled FoD player, and a solid clanwar warrior. Next joined GaL4Xy, a solid 1 vs 1 player who specialized with FoL, in particular Gondor.</p>

<p>|PLOW| entered Septembers league with G3RRARD aka Wiz4rD^ and Raider spamming clanwars. GaL4Xy' joined Mid-month, as the trio spammed |PLOW| into the top 3, facing heavy competition from the two larger rosters of TR| and B2P|. Taking the top spot for awhile, competition was getting increasingly harder because of the temporary leave of Wiz4rD^ who could now only play on weekends. |PLOW| dropped to 3rd place for most of the month and 2 Auto-reports on GaL4xy's behalf meant he dropped from rank 3 warrior to 8. An excellent spamming spree on the last day on the month pushed |PLOW| up the league, but finished just 59 points from top. September Finished with |PLOW| taking Silver cup, Wiz4rD^ taking rank 1 warrior and also with Wiz4rD^ and GaL4xY taking Rohan and Gondor champion respectively. <a href="../../../s/e/p/Image%7ESeptember_cwstandings.JPG_2e3f.html" class="image" title="Image:September cwstandings.JPG"><img src="../../../upload/6/65/September_cwstandings.JPG" alt="Image:September cwstandings.JPG" width="1024" height="768" longdesc="../../../s/e/p/Image%7ESeptember_cwstandings.JPG_2e3f.html" /></a></p>

<p>|PLOW| entered October with the same roster as September, but were forewarned of Wiz4rD^s inability to play on weekdays, as a result of the former clan bosses forgetting their passwords, |PLOW| decided to change to [PLOW] with Wiz4rD^ being made the new clan boss, although the former tag is still used. Knowing they needed a fuller roster, they recruited Freedom, a pro Rohan and a well known player. Starting off the month with some 2 vs 2s, GaL4Xy and Wiz4rD^ realised they simply could not compete with their opponent without using Teamspeak, a communcication device. Following Freedom's joining, many other players such as Guardian, Diablo and Phoenix were drafted into the clan. Although enjoying a few well earned wins, their games per week were extremely low, and to compete with the 8 person roster of B2P|, |PLOW| asked them to quit the roster to make room for more spamming oriented players. The players kicked promptly made their own clan LoM^, which has achieve substantial success on the league. Upon this decision, Wiz4rD^ decided to make GaL4xY' the |PLOW| boss, allowing him to kick players at will, although to this day he has not exercised that right unfairly. ThuGz aka LimiT was then recruited, and has enjoyed a succesful time with the clan. Moose and then Sage^God1ike were then added to the growing roster in the empty spaces. October clanwars is currently still going on with |PLOW| in second.</p>

- A very rare disorder (although arguably becoming more common)affecting the face.
</pre>
<p><b>The name:</b> comes from Parry (1825), Henoch and Romberg (1846) who all described the disease.</p>
<p><b>Causes:</b> There are no obvious causes, it appears to occur randomly although there are ideas about links between mild head injuries/forceps deliveries at birth.</p>
<p><b>Rare:</b> Classed as rare disease, meaning it affects less than 200,000 people in the US. Most plastic surgeons see less than a dozen cases in their lifetime (in the US, much lower in other countries). It is slightly more common in females than males, with a ratio of 1.5:1.</p>
<p><b>Symptoms :</b> Although every case is different, the syndrome is characterised by tissue on one side of the face wasting away (this is called <a href="../../../a/t/r/Atrophy.html" title="Atrophy">atrophy</a>). The atrophy is extremely slow, usually lasting from 2 up to 10 years until it enters a stable phase. Symptons vary enormously from only the atrophy to affecting the teeth, gums, hair and causing patches of <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vitiligo.html" title="Vitiligo">vitiligo</a>. In addition to this, some sufferers may also experience neurological abnormalities. These can include: severe headaches, seizures, nausea, facial pain, visual abnormalities...and more</p>
<p>Symptoms of Parry-Romberg syndrome usually become apparent during the first decade of life, or early during the second decade. In rare cases, the disorder is apparent at birth. The majority of individuals with Parry-Romberg syndrome experience symptoms before the age of 20 years.</p>
<p><br />
It needs to be noted that not one 2 cases are the same.</p>
<p><b>Treatment:</b> There are no cures, or treatment that can stop parry-rombergs, but reconstructive surgery is commonly used to replace lost tissues for aesthetic reasons. E.g. Fat graphs</p>

Two Kilos of Funk is Shrewsbury’s self proclaimed “Freshest, Funkiest Party”. With DJ’s playing a heady mix of Funk, Soul, Beats, Breaks and Disco, the emphasis is purely on fun.</p>
<p>Two Kilos started back in September 2005 with a drunken night out. Matt Wedderkopp and 2 friends were on a pub crawl before going to see DJ Yoda play at Planet of the Breaks. After sinking copious amounts of Guinness and spirits Matt and two friends started to walk to the club, on route they decided to pop into Soho bar for a cheeky half. Tim, who Matt had only met that night started berating the staff at Soho bar, telling them “your bar is shit, you need DJ’s and breakbeats”. He then proceeded to hassle the young barmaid for her phone number, continuously interrupting with “.. your bars quiet, no ones here, let Matt play some tunes…”. After drinking up, the lads left, went to see Yoda, got wrecked and forgot about the drunken ramblings in the bar.</p>
<p>A week or so later Matt received a text asking if he’d like to put on an event there. It was decided the first event would be a pre party for the next Planet Breaks event, Grandmaster Flash on the October bank holiday. Starting at 3pm the Sunday afternoon Matt played a mixture of old funk, broken beats and old school Hip Hop. The other DJ to play that night was Recycled Records boss Mark Bishop. Mark still reminds Matt that he fell head first into a plant pot while picking up his first record when taking over the decks. Matt likes a drink.</p>
<p>After a series of Sunday afternoons Matt had the urge to keep pushing the night and his DJ'ing. One thing happened to stop him. Soho bar shut. While Matt was filling out Sunday afternoons, the bar was struggling and changed hands. Matt approached the new owner of the re-named Salopian Bar to carry on his funk fuelled parties. The reply was “We don’t have funky house here, or any house music”. Despite Two Kilos having never been a house night and no house record ever having made it onto the decks the new owner was having none of it. The Salopian bar now sells overpriced beer to posh people. And Matt hates people thinking Two Kilos is a House night.</p>
<p>Two Kilos of Funk lay dormant for a couple of months. In Febuary Matt approached the Vaults to host a monthly party there. The agreement was Two Kilos could take over the first Thursday of the month, if successful it would move to a Saturday.</p>
<p>The first event was packed out and carried on growing over the next few months. In June Matt recruited current right hand man Mark ‘Pinderslap’ Beesley as resident, they pushed the night into an even funkier direction, leaving the drum n bass at the door. The last thing Shrewsbury needed was another drum n bass or funky house night, so Matt stayed loyal to the music he loved… FUNK, SOUL, HIP HOP, BEATS, BREAKS &amp; DISCO.</p>
<p>In August the lads went out to Support Invasion and Planet Breaks in Ibiza, culminating in Matt playing an Absinthe fuelled set at superclub Eden. This helped seal a friendship between the three nights that has led to Two Kilos hosting pre parties and back rooms for both Invasion and Planet Breaks.</p>
<p>The Future.</p>
<p>TWO KILOS IS GROWING. Hitting capacity earlier and earlier the next step will surely be bigger events with big name guests. Rest assured we will never sacrifice the sound we love and we will keep making people smile.</p>
<p>And why’s it called TWO KILOS? You’ll have to ask Matt. When he’s Sober.</p>

<p>Short for interactive voice response, a telephony technology in which someone uses a touch-tone telephone to interact with a database to acquire information from or enter data into the database.</p>
<p>IVR technology does not require human interaction over the telephone as the user's interaction with the database is predetermined by what the IVR system will allow the user access to.</p>
<p>For example, banks and credit card companies use IVR systems so that their customers can receive up-to-date account information instantly and easily without having to speak directly to a person.</p>
<p>IVR technology is also used to gather information, as in the case of telephone surveys in which the user is prompted to answer questions by pushing the numbers on a touch-tone telephone.</p>

<p>In mobile communication networks, it is a part of planning a network rollout. Site acquisition in the network build concept entails identifying, evaluating and procuring the most suitable sites for a telecommunications network.</p>
<p>Site Acquisition depends primarily on the type of service the telecommunications network provides, service coverage and its quality, and on the usual telecommunications network parameters.</p>
<p>Site Acquisition is country-specific and dependent on various local factors, such as the real estate market, land and property owners, local building regulations and environmental regulations. The operation is complex and requires the experience and knowledge of how to engage and manage partners, consultants and contractors who can deliver services in terms of capacity, site portfolio and financial considerations.</p>

David H. Sandler, founder of the Sandler Sales Institute, began sales training and developing the Sandler Selling System in the late '60s and early '70s. He created an extraordinary sales training program for small and mid-sized companies, Fortune 500 corporations, and individual non-selling professionals.</p>
<p>Sandler expanded marketplace impact in 1983 by franchising our proprietary training programs as the Sandler Sales Institute. In 1995, David Sandler died, but his legacy lives on through the entrepreneurial network of approximately 160 Sandler trainers and consultants who continue to deliver exceptional training to the marketplace.</p>

<p>An Umbrella company (in the UK) is a company that contractors can use when their employer needs to pay a limited company for a service rather than a private individual. In such cases the contractor can choose to set up their own limited company or to use an umbrella.</p>
<p>My knowledge is a bit limited on this but I know that umbrella companies have become more prominent since the UK government introduced legislation called "IR35" that makes it less beneficial to start your own company and relatively more attractive to join an umbrella company. It's a fairly large business sector so I was surprised not to find anything on it.</p>

By definition there can be no article - a Wikipedia Ghost is a link to a non-existent article. Like all ghosts, if the article is created it will be destroyed - and therefore creating the article will in itself remove the need for the article!</p>
<p>If however you do not create the article you are effectively creating a wikipedia ghost and therefore therefore you have no choice but to create the article.</p>
<p>Find a way out of that!</p>

<p>On adding to a couple of articles on the Scottish Jury and the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Not_proven.html" title="Not proven">not proven</a> verdict I put in a reference to the <a href="../../../e/a/r/Earl_of_Strathmore_3ef8.html" title="Earl of Strathmore">Earl_of_Strathmore</a>. Having found that there are quite a few I found it was the the 6th earl but I found there was no article for the 6th Earl who died in 1728.</p>
<p>His death is fairly well documented since it resulted in a critical trial in Scots law, but I know nothing about his life. However, if there was an article I would put in what I do know and make the other articles link to it!</p>
<p><i><b>I realised I could just use another Earl of Strathmore as a template and have added a stub article in the same format - I was going to remove this, but have instead put this note in case removing this request would be a problem</b></i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-24_103e.html" title="Edit section: Parsittern (noun); parsitterning (verb).">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Parsittern (noun); parsitterning (verb).</span></h2>
<p>Three aspects - <i>parts</i>, <i>processes</i> and <i>principles</i> - make a <i>pattern</i> of which the world is universally composed. Conceptual maps, metaphors and models, as well as other systems of knowledge, are always comprised of and described using these aspects: the parts <i>within</i>, the processes <i>between</i>, the <i>principles</i> among, and the <i>pattern</i> that runs through and composes them into a whole.</p>
<p><br />
In the 1980's Damian Vraniak, Ph.D., coined the word <i>parsittern</i> using letters from each primary word. Similar in meaning to the words <i>mapping</i>, <i>partitioning</i> and <i>parsing</i>, but more specific and systematic, he named the sequential activity of identifying the elements, operations and organization of any system <i>parsitterning</i>.</p>
<p><br />
Every object or living organism has parts, the matter and material of which it is made. We have many different words for these: <i>pieces</i>, <i>elements</i>, <i>substance</i>, <i>constituents</i>, and ‘<i>essence</i>’ are some of these. Whatever we call them, without the necessary and fundamental parts and without them being assembled in an appropriate structure, there cannot be a whole. If you have tried to start and drive a car that does not have a battery or does not have wheels, you understand that you must have all the parts and they must be assembled properly for the car to go. Without eyes you cannot see, without caring there is no kindness.</p>
<p><br />
If whole, every object or living organism is processed by and processes the world. If there is one of something most likely there is another and a process that might connect the two in relationship. We have words for these, like <i>manner</i> and <i>mode</i>, <i>operations</i> or <i>methods</i>, that describe how food is broken down in the stomach, how oxygen is transferred into the blood, how sperm and egg make a human, how to love well.</p>
<p><br />
We have discovered that certain principles describe the relations among essential parts and processes, structures and functions. ‘Water runs down hill’, ‘hot air rises’, ‘anger begets anger’, ‘do unto others as you would have them do to you’, all represent a myriad of different forms, ways in which various parts and processes might be configured, interrelated and synchronized.</p>
<p><br />
Let us see how this works by <i>parsitterning</i> a few fundamental aspects of our world:</p>
<p><br />
<i>Land</i> is the fundamental structure of reality that is sensed and perceived at the most basic level. It just exists. It is appropriate parts hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon …earth, water, air, and fire … bacteria, fungi, plant and animal, assembled in just the right balance so that there is integrity. The parts comprise a singular whole where each is at its proper place and point of potential contact. There is unity.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Life</i> is the operation, function and flow of relationship that is felt when one singularity connects with another. It engages. It is the movement and transfer of parts internal to one into another … water into root, flesh into stomach, sperm into egg … through processes of harmony that create a unique and terrible intimacy. Two distinct singularities join into one unified movement of that which is offered from within and accepted between. The two become one. There is unity.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Law</i> is the order and form in representation of the relations among land and life. It expresses. It captures for a moment the principles that properly synchronize parts and processes in such a way as to construct a special consensus and identity. Three aspects or layers are apprehended, welcomed and shared amongst. Three create a new whole … water, salt and flour become bread … man, woman and child become family. The three become one. There is unity.</p>
<p><br />
Essentially, Dr. Vraniak’s specification that all and everything is made of three layers and a fourth that integrates them provides each of us with a simple way of perceiving and mapping our world. For instance, in a manufacturing company basic <i>materials</i> are processed in certain <i>operations</i> that form an intended marketplace <i>mission</i> we call a product. If the materials are of high quality and the operations efficient and the product a valued one, then the company will be successful. Poor materials, inefficient operations and/or an unvalued product will not.</p>
<p><br />
In service agencies like schools, clinics or mental health centers, there are <i>participants</i>, teaching or helping <i>processes</i> that are services, and the intended <i>meanings</i> of the particular mission (education, health) of each agency. If the participants are healthy and capable, if the relationships go smoothly and well, and if the principles and purposes are valued and welcomed in the community, then there will be a sustainable organization.</p>
<p><br />
And whether we are manufacturing or educating, the people in these organizations <i>regulate</i> themselves in more or less effective ways, <i>relate</i> to others harshly or in kind and caring ways, and have <i>role</i> and <i>responsibilities</i> that all agree, combine and complement one another or do not. The following Table A outlines this in tabular form.</p>
<p>Table A. Examples of Parts, Processes, Principles and Pattern</p>
<p><br />
Parts .........................Processes ........................ Principles ........................... Pattern</p>
<p><br />
elements (objects) ....operations ........................ organization ...................... order (regularity)</p>
<p>constituents ............. connections ..................... configuration ..................... composition</p>
<p>material ................... methods ........................... mission (meaning) ............. mystery</p>
<p>participants .............. procedures ........................ products ........................... philosophy</p>

<p>In the past three decades <i>parstterning</i> has been used to systematically map conceptual frameworks in biology, psychology, sociology and theology. A recent illustration of its application can be found in the <i>parsitterning</i> of ecology and ecological disturbance in an article by Dr. Vraniak (reference 1).</p>

<p><b>Coran</b> Coran is a fictional character from the series Kaledoria, written by James Mccomb. Coran is the main protoganist in the storyline and is certainly not a cliche character. In the storyline Coran himself has a special backstory which has not been introduced yet. Throughout the series Coran goes through many personal strifes and will have to overcome many hard challenges.</p>
<p><b>Kaledoria</b> In the fictional word Kaledoria, the place where Coran resides,fantasy overcomes reality. The author James Mccomb, commonly referred to as JD, still is in production of the story, currently the chapters reside on a elementalists forum and are being continued as we speak.</p>

<p>Gregg Weaver, born January 9, 1960 in California, was part of San Diego's famed skate scene and one of skateboarding's early superstars. During the resurgence of skateboarding in the mid-to-late 1970s, he was one of the most heavily photographed and accomplished riders. His signature moves in the full-pipe and in skate pools gave him a unique style and earned him the nickname, "The Cadillac Kid."</p>
<p>Gregg, along with Colin Hurst, Craig Chastney, Miguel Munoz, and Mike Weed were sponsored by Hobie. When <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skateboarder_Magazine_75ff.html" title="Skateboarder Magazine">Skateboarder Magazine</a> was re-issued in 1975 (after 10 years of being defunct), Gregg was featured the cover of it's inaugural re-issue. He is one of the most highly photographed riders of famed skate and surf photographer, <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warren_Bolster_551a.html" title="Warren Bolster">Warren Bolster</a>.</p>
<p>Gregg now makes his home in <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huntington_Beach_fc94.html" title="Huntington Beach">Huntington Beach</a>, California.</p>
