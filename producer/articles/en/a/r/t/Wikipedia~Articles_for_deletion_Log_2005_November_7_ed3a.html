<dd>Censorship??? Is Wikipedia to relate every <i>fait divers</i> in the world? Should we copy the content of our morning newspaper into Wikipedia articles? Moreover, the shooting incident in the metro is not even remotely related to the riots in France.</dd>
<dd>There have been some new copycat arsons in Brussels this evening, but as of now nothing to be compared with the wave of riots in France. Arsons, acts of vandalism, clashes between youth gangs with the police etc. happen in any major city; they may be news-worthy, but not encyclopedia-worthy. I might add that a few years ago, there have been <i>real</i> riots involving immigrant youths in Antwerp; similar incidents have also happened in Brussels in the past, though on a much smaller scale and less destructive than in France now. - <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarl_Stas_bfd3.html" title="User:Karl Stas">Karl Stas</a> 22:37, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

You'll occasionally see a porn star like <a href="../../../t/r/a/Traci_Lords_8a29.html" title="Traci Lords">Traci Lords</a> cross over into a more mainstream field. That said, we obviously shouldn't list <i>every</i> porn star under the rationale that they might become the next Traci Lords.

<li>The <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">Apartheid</a> is the former system of segregation in South Africa. However, the international law defines a crime against humanity of apartheid; basically, as any crime against humanity - such as murder, torture, or persecution - committed in the context of a regime of racial oppression. (See, for example, the elements of crimes at the web site of the <a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/about/Official_Journal.html" class="external text" title="http://www.icc-cpi.int/about/Official_Journal.html" rel="nofollow">International Criminal Court</a>.)

Many more media commentators have questioned the intelligence of George Bush or the honesty of John Kerry, but I'd have an issue with an article about either of those based only on the fact that people in the media have said it. If this material is worth keeping (which I'm not yet seeing), I'd rather see it in articles about the things people are comparing Apartheid to. I.e., Israel, Saudia Arabia, Spain, Jim Crow laws. --<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 06:54, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The George W. Bush and John Kerry articles should have information on the fact that media outlets keep asking certain questions about them, yes. Just like an article about apartheid should have information about how the word/concept is currently being used by the media. I am interested in keeping the information no matter what, but I think it's true that the information would fit better into <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> for the valid reason you list. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 20:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons stated by michaelg, in particular the fact that the material is dealt with elsewhere. It strikes me as ironic that Jim Crow is discussed as a form of apartheid, when Jim Crow pre-dated apartheid by many years. Perhaps the main article on apartheid should be re-titled "Jim Crow outside the United States." (I jest. But the point is, Jim Crow was bad enough, and its own article describes it as being bad enough, without adding the irrelevant fact that it is sort of like some other phenomenon on another continent that was just starting as Jim Crow, thankfully, was nearing its end.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 21:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Clean Up</b></s> - I disagree with Michael. Deletion request comes from a claim that the article is "liberal-slant"- pov, irrelevant to whether the article has merit. The article has substantiation in facts, outside of radio and media.
<ul>
<li><b>Merge</b> After reconsidering, I understand Michael's logic. I think the sections of the article are best sent to articles that more clearly explain the issues they raise.<a href="../../../v/v/u/User%7EVvuppala_3dab.html" title="User:Vvuppala">Varun Vuppala</a></li>

<p><b>No Vote</b> I tried looking up a number of strings and found it to be non-verifiable on Google and also on sensis.com.au. I also looked up <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464866/fullcredits" class="external free" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464866/fullcredits" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464866/fullcredits</a> (<i>Ikaw Ang Lahat Sa Akin</i> on IMDb) and found no mention of him. However, I have found some hits with the thread <i><b>Brandon</b> Martinez Kanta na Pag-Ibig</i> on Google (as the page might be a typo), but all the writing with this in appears to be in <a href="../../../t/a/g/Tagalog.html" title="Tagalog">Tagalog</a>/<a href="../../../f/i/l/Filipino_language.html" title="Filipino language">Filipino</a>, which I cannot read. I thought that this might be the reason why the db-bio I put on the page originally disappeared, but since that was removed by the article creator, I am starting to think that the article might be nothing more than vanity and <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bullshit.html" title="Bullshit">male cow faeces</a>. My main doubt as to whether or not the page has grounds for deletion is the Tagalog/Filipino I found, hence my listing here with no vote rather than re-db'ing it.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> If we can't prove the notability despite trying and the author removes the db-bio without giving a clue why the person is notable, then it remains db-bio-able. ➨ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">❝</a><b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">REDVERS</font></a></b><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Redvers_11cc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Redvers">❞</a> 20:21, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The db-bio criterion requires that the article not even <i>claim</i> notability in a plausible way. This article claims the guy is famous as an actor, so it's not a speedy. Non-verifiability is not a speedy criterion: one of the reasons why the AfD process takes so long is that you have to give people time to look for verification. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Poor ability to search a topic does not make it less than notable. Certainly proof would do it justice, but seeing as the actor is from a foreign country and IMDB as well as Google have not the database extensive enough to search every subject, I believe this article provides information on a topic that is not found in those places thus making it quite valuable to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> Big Booger 15:12, 8 November 2005 (UTC)]
<ul>
<li>However, poor ability to search a topic <i>does</i> make it non-verifiable, and it is a <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">fundamental policy</a> that we only include information we are able to verify.

<li><b>Comment</b> there are at least two reasons for voting, even if one is the nominator; first, one may nominate and still remain neutral (this is for example if you are not sure and nominated the article to collect other opinions); this really happens sometimes; I think there are at least one or two such cases in the votes for today; the second reason is that it facilitates the task of the closing administrator in counting the votes.

<li>It's the nominator's job to get the ball rolling on the argument for deletion. I don't see that it matters whether a nomination gets counted as a vote.

<li><b>Comment</b> to clarify. Currently, the disambiguation page is about <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">chud</a>, which redirects to <a href="../../../c/2E/h/C.H.U.D._84fc.html" title="C.H.U.D.">C.H.U.D.</a>, the movie and <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chudes.html" title="Chudes">chudes</a>, the people.

<li><b>What happened.</b> A tangental AfD made me think of this film. I typed in the actual title <i>C.H.U.D</i> and ended up on <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">Chud</a>, with the note "Redirected from <a href="../../../c/h/u/CHUD_dc03.html" title="CHUD">CHUD</a>" and the "Other uses - Chud" tag. The first line of <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">Chud</a> said it was another name for homeless people, and it was never mentioned again in the article. Once that was removed as unsourced, it was a movie under the wrong title, simple. Once that was fixed (moved content back to <a href="../../../c/2E/h/C.H.U.D._84fc.html" title="C.H.U.D.">C.H.U.D.</a>, tidied layout, fixed redirect, etc) the disambiguation made no sense to me. These things do not have the same name, no possibility for confusion exists, unless there is a reasonable possibility that people will type "Chud" when looking for <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chudes.html" title="Chudes">Chudes</a>? - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F">brenneman</font></a><a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(t)</sup></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aaron_Brenneman_1eac.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aaron Brenneman"><font color="#2F4F4F"><sup>(c)</sup></font></a> 23:09, 7 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>; I had never heard of the Chudes before and had never saw the movie. My point is that the article about <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chudes.html" title="Chudes">chudes</a> calls the single person of the group a chud. That one searches chud while looking for the people therefore seems to me a quite likely possibility. It is not even completely clear to me why <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">chud</a> should redirect to <a href="../../../c/2E/h/C.H.U.D._84fc.html" title="C.H.U.D.">C.H.U.D.</a> and not to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chudes.html" title="Chudes">chudes</a>, given that chud is the correct spelling for a single person of the chudes and the wrong spelling for the acronym of the movie.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>In passing, I am not criticizing the nomination -- the original disambiguation page was a reasonable candidate for AfD given that it contained only a real link and a dictdef. I think that the best possible configuration is that: 1. <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">chud</a> is removed; and 2. chud (disambiguation) is moved to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">chud</a>. Or, if you prefer, the content of chud (disambiguation) is moved to <a href="../../../c/h/u/Chud.html" title="Chud">chud</a> (deleting the redirect directive) and the former is removed. This second solution has the advantage that the page to remove is already here on AfD.

<li>That's not being pedantic at all, for any admin to speedy this would be grossly overlooking the rules. A5 states, "<i># Any article that has been discussed at Articles for Deletion (or Miscellany for deletion), where the outcome was to transwiki, and where the transwikification has been properly performed and the author information recorded</i>".

The Shirley Temple gets by on noting that it was named after a child actress. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 05:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</sup>

<li>Agreed, other foods of similar importance have articles so I don't see why this one shouldn't.

<li><b>Keep, but remove recipe.</b> The current precendent is to keep articles about food if they have encyclopedic content, such as that on cultural significance, which this one does.

<li><b>Don't delete</b> Digitaldreamdoor at all. What does a "not notable forum" have to do with anything? A forum is a forum. There's no justification that DDD is "non-notable" either. "Minor website or not", it is a significant tool online and very popular with Google.com. This is the only site that even tackles such lists which alone makes it unique. I guess this isn't a "free where anyone can edit" type of deal. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Wiki is supposed to spread info right? How many rules, etc., can you guys have? It's not like someone's posting garbage or a website that doesn't even exist. It's just one decent page--leave it alone and let it be.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment/Abstain</b>. Because of the infinitely vast scope of the internet, along with the relatively limited space on the Wikipedia servers, it is agreed by many Wikipedia users that only websites with a significant user base or the sumject of mass media attention should be kept. There is an attempt to assemble aguideline at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, which gives a list of criteria a website should meet to be included on Wikipedia. The website fails on two of the three counts in the current incarnation of the proposal; alexa rating of 73,000, and forum membership or roughly 2,000 users over five forums. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 06:43, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> vanity.

<li><b>Comment</b> After reading her website and bit of googling, it appears to me that her 15 minutes of fame was to promote Howard in a bikini during the last election. (Does anyone remember seeing <a href="http://www.gabriellereillyweekly.com/video/mark_latham2wm.wmv" class="external text" title="http://www.gabriellereillyweekly.com/video/mark_latham2wm.wmv" rel="nofollow">this</a> (WMV file) on the tv? It's subtle, huh?) Unsurprisingly the NT Libs lapped her up and apparently one of them nom'ed her for Young Aus of the Year, and wanted to make her an American tourism ambassador or something similar. If this article is to be kept, then this event seems to be the only really significant event. All the info about her website and modelling is definitely extraneous. <a href="../../../p/f/c/User%7EPfctdayelise_e220.html" title="User:Pfctdayelise">pfctdayelise</a> 13:03, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, I don't think it's weird. I couldn't contribute anything to an article about <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calculus.html" title="Calculus">calculus</a>, but I know the topic's important enough to have an entry. I haven't edited the harissa article because I don't know enough about North African/Middle Eastern cooking; however, I do know that harissa is a very important condiment in those cuisines, probably equivalent to <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worcestershire_sauce.html" title="Worcestershire sauce">Worcestershire sauce</a> or <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garam_masala.html" title="Garam masala">garam masala</a> (both of which have entries).

<dd>If Aidan is the copyright owner, then hence he can GPL or anything he likes to it. If it gets published in a magazine, and Aidan states that it has never been published before, then that is a problem, but for Aidan/Magazine, <b>not</b> for wikipedia. Similarly Aidan cannot give the magazine <b>total</b> exclusive copyright, as Aidan would already have GPL'ed the wiki version. Again that is a problem for Aidan, not wiki.

<li><b>Add source-based research references and Keep</b>: The article has not been wikified, needs to be tidied, esp. a space character after punctuation marks. It needs more cross reference to source of information to ensure it is genuine information. If it has these, then it seems reasonable that the page is allowed.</li>

<dd>The current guidelines are: <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html#What_is_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No_original_research#What_is_original_research</a></dd>
<dd>Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>There is dedication: "Dedicated to the memory of the late W.H.(Bill) Lampard" which I am not sure is allowed, maybe in the talk page??</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There is some self promotion: "Aidan Work was born in Wanganui,New Zealand on the 23rd of November 1976.He has been an active numismatist", which could be dropped, but my initial feeling is that the bulk of this article is actually fact. Quoting source document, and source news paper article would help confirm this feeling.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are many other similar articles of "original content" without <b>any</b> kind of reference to and "existing primary and/or secondary source" eg. The town of <a href="../../../g/r/u/Grutness.html" title="Grutness">Grutness</a> in the Shetlands. The only thing that distinguishes Aidan article it that it is longer then normal, any has been contributed without being wikified. It is mostly gathered facts and data.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given that Aidan is a clearly a first time wiki contributor, what say we give him a hand get the data he has gathered into an "source-based research" acceptable form. Lets not shoot him down on his first major contribution.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm with <a href="../../../s/u/m/User%7ESumburgh_970e.html" title="User:Sumburgh">User:Sumburgh</a> on this this. Part of the problem here is that Aidan has self-identified this as 'original research'. That threw me at first. I think he is using <i>research</i> in the sense of 'literature search', and didn't know of the use in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a>. He appears to have built this article from primary sources, which is rare in Wikipedia, and to be encouraged. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 11:00, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I agree. This is a very little-known subject, but is worthy of an article <i>if written properly</i>. It may even be that Aidan Work is the world expert on the subject. However, the article needs to be written in a Wikipedia-0friendly (i.e., encyclopaedic) way (One minor point BTW - the article that Sumburgh mentions did have an external source: a map showing the place mentioned. I have now added a second one - ironically from a page on Sumburgh). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<font color="green"><small><i><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness">wha?</a> 11:19, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</i></small></font></li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. I would prefer the "original research" from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> to get renamed to "original speculation," which seems to me to go to the heart of the matter. Articles on encyclopedic subjects are not disqualified just because their author includes research he got from primary sources.

<li><b>Keep'</b>. Rename as <i>Chatham Island numismatics</i>, rewrite it to good encyclopedic standard, enhance presentation with a couple of pics, and this could be a good entry in Wiki.

<li><b>Keep and move</b> to <i>Chatham Island numismatics</i>, as above.

<li>It has to be kept as 'History of Chatham Islands numismatics',as there are no longer any coins or banknotes being issued for the Chatham Islands.Besides,the name 'Chatham Island' is the name of the largest island,which is where the settlements of Waitangi &amp; Owhenga are. - (Aidan Work 06:12, 9 November 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Typically, we have articles on <i>History of X</i> only if we also have articles on <i>X</i>. The fact that the Chatham Islands are not issuing any other notes is not important here. Note also that the <a href="../../../n/u/m/Numismatics.html" title="Numismatics">numismatics</a> is the study of money; the title <i>history of numismatics</i> therefore means <i>the history of the study of money of the Chatham Islands</i>, while the article is on <i>the history of money of the Chatham Islands</i>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the reasoning of <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a>. Myself, I have always interpreted 'original research' as applying to either either an individual's subjective interpretation of a thing/event or the results of a first-hand experiment that haven't been subject to peer review. This doesn't fit either one. It's pretty much impossible to write a truly encyclopedic article on a subject without citing primary sources, so banning that practice would be self-contradictory (and asinine). -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 17:08, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Otoh, Laszlo Panaflex is also the name of a Euro-beat dance band that had a big hit called "Dance to the Music" in 2002. <a href="http://www.beatport.com/artist/Laszlo+Panaflex" class="external free" title="http://www.beatport.com/artist/Laszlo+Panaflex" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatport.com/artist/Laszlo+Panaflex</a> If that information is added to the page, does it become a <b>Keeper</b>? <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELaszlo_Panaflex_8819.html" title="User:Laszlo Panaflex">Laszlo Panaflex</a> 20:30, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I've edited the page to concentrate on the band, mostly removing the material on the Simpsons character (which is already present in his bullet on the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_from_The_Simpsons_3821.html" title="List of characters from The Simpsons">List of characters from The Simpsons</a>). I'm not sure whether the band in question is notable or not, but as the article in question is now about a completely different thing, it should probably be re-listed. They have a page on Allmusic, and while I can't find evidence of their single charting, it's possible that I'm not looking in the right place. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 16:56, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was asked to provide a reasoning behind my decision, so here goes: 1. If I count&#160;!votes I get roughly 21 dels, 13 keeps, that's a 60% majority for deleting, but really in no man's land between no consensus (ca. 50%) and rough consensus (ca. 67%). 2. The policy on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is very much in flux over whether glossaries are exemptions to the <i>Not a dictionary</i> provision. Unless there is consensus to strike the exemption I prefer to stick with the status quo ante (still reflected in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>), which is that glossaries are acceptable. 3. Most importantly, the content of the article changed significantly in the last days of the debate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Japanese_sex_terms&amp;diff=88041477&amp;oldid=87583928" rel="nofollow">[19]</a> thanks mostly to edits by <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">User:JJay</a>, and this change was reflected in a number of delete→keep changes and late keep&#160;!votes, so the early "delete not sourced"&#160;!votes are no longer on solid factual ground. Taking these three factors into account I did not see that consensus for deletion was established. This is a no consensus closure though so it can be renominated anytime. I recommend waiting three to four weeks for the policy debate to be settled and to see if the article improves, and consider renomination then. But of course I might be wrong, and that's what we have <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:25, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If you are using the definition of encyclopedic as "an alphabetical organization of fields of knowledge" then you are being pedantic. It is not suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, no matter how much it tries to fit a dictionary definition of encyclopedic. It is not a collection of verifiable facts. If you are saying that it is, then I respectfully think you are wrong and agree to disagree.</li>
<li>If you are suggesting that articles, without sources, that are little more than stubs, that have existed in the same state for months, are verifiable, do you mean theoretically? Because, theoretically, <i>anything</i> is verifiable to some people. But it is not verifiable in terms of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> for a very large majority of terms on that list. --<font style="background:black"><a href="../../../e/l/a/User%7EElaragirl_a4a9.html" title="User:Elaragirl"><font color="LightSteelBlue">Shrieking Harpy</font></a> <a href="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/6/68/Gay_flag.svg/17px-Gay_flag.svg.png" alt="" width="17" height="11" longdesc="../../../g/a/y/Image%7EGay_flag.svg_c968.html" /></a></font><sup><a href="../../../e/l/a/User_talk%7EElaragirl_228e.html" title="User talk:Elaragirl">Talk</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup>Count</sup> 18:46, 9 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay, apart from being demonstratably not an inclusionist (I've compared my AfD votes and it's pretty clear I'm a "centrist" on the issue - my keep arguments for articles that are deleted are a percentage of my keep arguments that equal to the percentage of my delete arguments where the article is kept) I'll show what the problem is when you vote to delete an article without first reading it.</dd>
<dd>If an article is appropriate for an encyclopaedia, but not for "the spirit of an encyclopaedia" then voting to delete it clearly fails <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Rather than make value judgements about whether I particularly like a topic or not, I apply <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia, she ain't paper</a> and ask merely "Is it encyclopaedic?" - here even you admit the answer is yes, so I'll move on.</dd>
<dd>I'll ask <i>is it sourced?</i> For this article, the answer is <b>yes</b> - clearly it's important to read the article to determine whether or not it's sourced. Merely guessing can result in the wrong answer. Being sourced (such as this article is) brings the advantage of a vaguely NPOV test of notability - someone else has found it notable enough to document - this is (I believe) a much more NPOV test than <i>Do I personally find this article interesting?</i> <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 14:47, 10 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'd just like to note that people aren't providing reasons for their "keep" votes. It's not enough to say it's encyclopaedic, particularly when so many have argued that it's inherently <i>unencyclopaedic.</i> While items <i>on</i> the list may be verifiable, that still doesn't provide a convincing rationale for keeping the list itself, as mentioned in the original post. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExploding_Boy_5421.html" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> 17:05, 9 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> a precise list of terms on a given specific subject is authorized by policy. Terms such as bukkake, gokkun etc. are extremely well known and verifiable through tons of sources. I don't even understand the objection on that score. The nom seems to be questioning the <i>raison d'etre</i> of this list. Well, for better or worse, Japan and sex have been tightly intertwined in the western imagination since at least the 19th century.

The vast popularity of specific Japanese porn genres in the west is just a later-day manifestation of the previous craze for Japanese erotic prints.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If this list is going to survive, what is listed on it needs to be very closely monitored. The fact so little of this article's definitions are unique to Japan is a big part of the problem with it. Very little of what was listed is unique to Japan - it simply defines a Japanese word for something which goes on all over the world. This is a deeper problem with Wiki wearby numerous topics of little or no note are documented in great depth, but let's not get into that here. So, what is of note out of the article? Just up to H, I'd argue that at least half of what is currently there is not in anyway unique to Japan and merely serves as a DicDef.
<ul>
<li>Bukkake: A Japanese invention - worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Chikan: Not unique to Japan - of little note. However, has a long and meandering article (lifting large sections from Rotton.com as a source) suggesting otherwise...</li>
<li>Ecchi: Links to the article for the English letter H. A foreign slang word for sex - of little note</li>
<li>Enjo kosai: The Japanese term for underage prostitution - at a strech worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Futanari: Japanese for hermaphrodites - of little note</li>
<li>Fuzoku: Defined as meaning "sex culture" in Japanese Doesn't have an article. Of little note.</li>
<li>Gokkun: A genre of Japanese porn. Worthy of inclusion</li>
<li>Hentai: Defined as "pervert." This is a much wider part of sex culture, so worthy of inclusion</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> -- I voted to delete this before, but I've changed my mind, because the article is in different shape now. Wikipedia is not a dictionary, but these are not simply translations of English phrases into Japanese but rather a completely different beast: sociological phenomena of sexuality in Japan, explained, and with articles about (most of) them. This could maybe use a renaming of some kind, but this list is cut down to the essentials and is encyclopedic. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> and you'll see that this kind of list is much like other kinds of lists given there. I can't help but think that many of the people who endorse deletion under the dictionary argument haven't noticed these points, but rather noticed the "list of ... terms" and didn't like the article concept. So like I said, maybe renaming is a good idea, but I'm not sure to what. Still, this goes well beyond mere "terms." <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 19:39, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Am I missing something here? As far as unmaintainable, pointless song lists go, this really has to take the cake. There's been a fair amount of deletions of song lists recently, and many I really had no opinion on, but this one just sort of astounds me. Where to begin? First of all, this is not a list of music videos, but really a list of songs that have music videos. And basically every popular song released in the last 25 years has had some sort of video made for it (and many earlier ones have had videos thrown together from concert footage and the like as well). We used to have a List of songs by name that was poised to try to include every song ever recorded. Saner minds prevailed, and it now lists only songs that have articles. I wouldn't be opposed to treating this the same, but the problem exists that we don't have articles on music videos (that I know of, perhaps there's a few exceptions), we have articles on songs that may have music videos. If anything, the video is mentioned in the song article. Turning this into a list of songs that have articles in which the music videos are described or mentioned seems completely pointless too. I just don't see a sane way of salvaging this. It would be basically "Popular songs since 1981" and would have all the problems List of songs by name used to have. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 06:10, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Traditional places where anti-social people 'hock' loogies are bridges, tall buildings, subway platforms, office urinals, and wilderness trails- places which are symbolically more elevated than the perpetrator."

<li>I took the liberty of adding the Keep, part since the comment was probably meant to be a keep.

<li>I remember having read that there is a general consensus that number are not notable by themselves (the point is what 23skidoo said). However, this is not a number but the name of a number, which makes things slightly different: we have an article on <a href="../../../g/o/o/Googol.html" title="Googol">Googol</a>, for example. In this particular case, google returns <a href="http://www.google.it/search?q=novenonagintennecentupentamillimyrillion" class="external text" title="http://www.google.it/search?q=novenonagintennecentupentamillimyrillion" rel="nofollow">79 hits</a> for the article name, which makes it non-notable. <del>Therefore, <b>Delete</b>, but not because it is a number.

<li>Someone has redirected it, which is the efficient solution but not entirely according to procedure. The AfD notice on the article is quite specific that the article should not be blanked, nor the notice removed, while the AfD is open. Without the notice, interested parties might miss out on the debate.

<p>On 20 Oct 2005 someone uploaded a flurry of supposedly public domain articles from the International Biopharmaceutical Association<a href="http://www.ibpassociation.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ibpassociation.org/" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> website, all "nursing care plans" for a host of medical conditions (66 at last count). The pages are largely redundant with the medical conditions they are linked to, and very little original content can be found on them. <a href="../../../t/h/b/User%7ETHB_9e7b.html" title="User:THB">THB</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/b/User_talk%7ETHB_2123.html" title="User talk:THB">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_THB_23b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/THB">contribs</a>) tried to knock a few into shape and kindly placed them all in Category:Nursing care plans, but agreed that these pages are beyond hope. An RFC<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Maths%2C_natural_science%2C_and_technology&amp;diff=27254421&amp;oldid=26972202" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Maths%2C_natural_science%2C_and_technology&amp;diff=27254421&amp;oldid=26972202" rel="nofollow">[24]</a> on the situation reached the same conclusion, see Category talk:Nursing care plans.</p>

<li>I'm not sure that that makes any difference. Southern Irish people retained the right to vote in the UK, and something similar may well have applied to all Irish peers. British and Irish peerages were never territorial, and peers often had no real connection with the locality from which their title was derived. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 01:22, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Am I right in assuming that "nobility are inherently notable" is a Wiki standard? If so, I'd like it called into debate. Here in France, for example, every tenth person is Comte de This or That. That would mean we need about 10,000,000 entries... I exaggerate of course, but are we really to include every son of every son of a Lord or Baron? As the answer is probably no, then where do we draw the line? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 10:42, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Younger sons are not peers in the UK. There have only ever been a few hundred peers at a time. One is either a peer or not.

<li>I have an issue with the idea that the holder of every noble title is inherently notable. The <i>title</i> may be worthy of an entry, e.g. Graves Baronetcy under which individuals can be listed, but this kind of entry simply justifies a compendium of minor notability for no other reason than the existence of the title itself. Where should the importance be placed? <s><b>Delete</b></s> <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 11:56, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>yes I meant barony, not baronetcy. Also, let me stress in the strongest possible terms that <b>I don't see this in inclusionist/exclusionist terms</b>, since I wholeheartedly agree that the holder of the title has an inherent notability; however, I believe it a sustainable assertion that that same notability accrues as a condition of the title which makes the more encyclopedic subject the title, not the individuals, except, obviously, in those cases where the individual has obtained some degree of notability outside that granted by the title in the first place. Such, for example, would be the case of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Paget_Graves%2C_9th_Baron_Graves" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Paget_Graves%2C_9th_Baron_Graves" rel="nofollow">his successor</a>] who performed the singular feat of getting married ten years before he was born according to his WP entry. Now that is notable! Unless the article can point to something that, <i>sui generis</i>, indicates this fellow deserves a separate article, imo it might be better practice to accumulate such lists of names under the title. After all, sitting in the house of lords was an inherited right, by virtue of ennoblement (although I believe that Irish peers lost this by the 20th century). That as I see it could in itself suggest that the encycopedic importance resides with the title.
<ul>
<li>Whilst I will not vote Delete on this, I feel Dottore So has the right approach: often it is only the title which is noteworthy and not necessarily the holder. In this particular case, the 8th Baron could just be listed on the Graves title page unless he has other claims to fame to warrant a page of his own. Also, re the house of Lords: being a peer no longer entitles one to a seat there. It is now a house of appointed representatives the vast majority of whom are only life-Peers. Though this would not have been the case with this particular Baron, it perhaps needs bearing in mind in future. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 15:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I believe that if a person/company/organization plays a critical role in establishing a new term, then that person/compnay or organization should be credited as a pioneer. It would be wrong for any porn maker to list himself under pornography but in this case - since this is a very new idea - WatchMePaint.com should be credited with being one of the pioneers.

<li>It could be expanded to include names of famous people who have been rusticated, and the types of offenses it is used for. It could also discuss how the universities are allowed in law to restrict the movements of their students. It used to be (don't know whether it still is) that the universities could ban students from traveling to within four miles of the town centers, which would otherwise be regarded as a violation of civil liberties. And finally, it could discuss how being "sent to the country," which is what rusticated means, was regarded as about the worst thing you could do to someone socially. It could be an interesting article with some work. <a href="../../../p/i/n/User%7EPintele_Yid_7fc7.html" title="User:Pintele Yid">Pintele Yid</a> 00:38, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

Wikipedia does not make exceptions for verb form just because the past participle is used more often than the noun. Countless pages use verb and noun forms other than the ones most commonly used for the sake of consistency, because, unlike disputes over which name is correct for a person or place or whatnot, it is easy to be consistent regarding verb form, which makes things much simpler for anyone trying to find these articles. Plus both rustication and rusticated are so small that merging them does no harm, and helps make both less like dictionary-ish. If we had an "expulsion" article that wasn't just a disambiguation page, I'd recommend merging it into that. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 03:23, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

"Rusticated" would be appropriate for an article about "Students who have been rusticated". "Rustication", however, is the standard for the concept itself.

<li>Rephrasing vote, see below. <s><b>Weak keep.</b> Move, merge, wherever; but I do feel <i>strongly</i> that enough dabs and redirects should be created to ensure that anyone, curious about the academic usage, who types in "rusticate" or "rusticated" as the "go" term, will easily find what they seek.</s> I found a boatload—well, several more—literary references, and some British and U.S. notables who were rusticated in their college days. It seems that the term was not limited to England but was also common in nineteenth-century America. I have a preference for keeping it at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rusticated.html" title="Rusticated">rusticated</a>, because, in reference to college suspension, the word is frequently used <i>in that form,</i> whereas "rusticate" and "rustication" seems to be rare. Despite what folks say are naming conventions (I thought "use the most common term" was the überconvention. But whatever. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:56, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That convention applies to choosing between <i>different</i> words, names, and titles, not between different forms of the <i>same</i> word. In other words, the "name article after the most common name" would apply if we were discussing which of two more-or-less-synonymous words to have an article at, with the less-common name being a redirect to the more common one. The rule does <i>not</i> apply to choosing between different forms of a single noun, verb, adjective, etc., however: with that, the policy is quite clear, to have all nouns singular (even though very often the plural is more common) and all verbs in their noun form, rather than in a past participle form like "rusticated". For non-Latin words, "-ing" is typically the noun ending (<a href="../../../r/u/n/Running.html" title="Running">running</a>, <a href="../../../e/a/t/Eating.html" title="Eating">eating</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/e/Bleeding.html" title="Bleeding">bleeding</a>, <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggling.html" title="Juggling">juggling</a>, etc.) whereas Latin words tend to have an "-ion" ending, especially "-ation" (<a href="../../../c/a/n/Cancellation.html" title="Cancellation">cancellation</a>, <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excommunication.html" title="Excommunication">excommunication</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/v/Navigation.html" title="Navigation">navigation</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Masturbation.html" title="Masturbation">masturbation</a>, etc.), and still other words can have the same form as a noun or verb, avoiding the problem altogether (<a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/u/Cough.html" title="Cough">cough</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/e/Sleep.html" title="Sleep">sleep</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/p/Hope.html" title="Hope">hope</a>, etc.). But regardless, only in truly rare and unusual situations is a form like "rusticated" ever used; simply having one form be <i>more common</i> is not good enough. There are many other words that are almost always used in -ed form and yet aren't listed there; being consistent is a good thing, and means we don't have to make tricky judgment calls like "'Vikings' is more common than 'Viking'" or "'obey' is more common than 'obedience'", which are sadly unavoidable with most names, titles, etc. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In discussing merges, moves, and general organization, I think we should consider... is <i>rustication</i> not a synonym for "suspension?" Suspension, at least in the U. S., is the name for an academic disciplinary action, stronger than probation but weaker than expulsion, defined as loss of student status for a specified (limited) period of time. e.g. <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/judicialprocess/penaltycode.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.stanford.edu/dept/vpsa/judicialaffairs/judicialprocess/penaltycode.htm" rel="nofollow">Stanford</a> defines it that way and then goes on: "All rights and privileges of student status are suspended during this time, including but not limited to: the right to attend classes; use library facilities; use any other facilities of the University except those open to the general public; obtain credit for any academic work; engage in any activities, or hold any position on any University committee or student organization, whether appointive or elective; live in student housing; participate in intercollegiate athletics." Loss of the right to "use any other facilities except those open to the general public" sounds essentially the same as "the student may not enter any of the university's buildings or facilities." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:21, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. And, for obvious reasons, suspension gets over 400 times as many hits on Google. <a href="../../../s/u/s/Suspension.html" title="Suspension">Suspension</a> is currently a disambiguation page; if listing noteworthy people who have been rusticated is a worthwhile endeavor, then why not also list noteworthy people who have been suspended? Why not make a page for suspension in an academic context, merge this information to that page, and then simply list at the top of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a>, "<i>This article is about the architectural term. For the academic term, see Suspension (academia)"</i>. Then we could mention both terms, and the differences between them, on that page. Wouldn't that solve <i>all</i> of these problems?</li>
<li>Anyway, regardless of what we do, the current situation is clearly ridiculous: (1) having a disambiguation page for only <i>two</i> pages is absurdly inconvenient and unnecessary, rather than just picking one and having it link to the other; (2) if <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a> is going to redirect to <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a>, why not just make <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a> itself the disambiguation page?! No matter what, <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a> is a bad idea; (3) my original suggestion of merging the two Rustications onto one page was actually, if you like, supposed to be a quasi-disambiguation page, sans the links and with a bit more information on each item, to provide all the information necessary on both terms in a quick and simple manner. I recommended it because there was so little information on each term, with the idea that they might <i>eventually</i> be turned back into separate articles once they'd been expanded enough. But such a solution isn't ideal, so I'm happy now that an ideal one <i>has</i> been found: create an article for suspension and put this there as a <i>type</i> of suspension, and leave the architectural term at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">rustication</a> with a link to suspension/rusticated. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 22:46, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

In this way, the people looking for the other article are no more inconvenienced than they would be by a disambig, and the people looking for this article are much better off! Neutral/win situation. Also, even if we have a disambig page, having it at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Rustication (disambiguation)">Rustication (disambiguation)</a> makes no sense, because Rustication is just a redirect to that page--so why not have the disambiguation page at <a href="../../../r/u/s/Rustication.html" title="Rustication">Rustication</a>? So either way, Rustication (disambiguation) will have to go (and it looks like you agree on that at least, I think, and just didn't notice that Rustication is a <i>redirect</i> to a disambig page, not the disambig itself; correct me if I'm wrong), but for the most convenience and to stick with the standard for most Wikipedia articles, we probably shouldn't really have a disambiguation page at all, as they're usually only for when there are more than two or three articles to choose from, or in especially contentious situations where it's totally impossible to pick one over the other to start from. I don't think we're <i>that</i> stuck in the mud here. But anyway, thanks for clarifying! I only asked because I genuinely wasn't sure what your vote was; while you say "Disambig as usual, of course", you're only the second or third of all the people who have voted or commented here to yet say that we need a disambiguation page at all! (The other one I can think of is Uncle G, who's the person who changed the pages recently by moving the former Rustication page to Rustication (architecture) and having Rustication redirect to Rustication (disambiguation), both of which I think are mistakes—the only page that needs to be moved is "Rusticated", everything else worked more or less fine the way it was before this debate.) So it's not as clear-cut as you think. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 23:51, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ah, I see what you mean. Yes, it's not as clear-cut as I was suggesting. Your suggestion is quite sensible, and I'm sure you can get an admin to do whatever you need to be done. My advice (I've done this): put it on requested moves, wait a couple days to see if you get any votes (you probably won't, I suspect) and then just ask an admin to do it--since nothing with any significant history would be deleted, I'm sure it'll be easy to make happen. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 02:50, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I vote: <b>Keep, and ask <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">User:Silence</a> to do whatever he thinks best after AfD is closed.</b> In more detail: <b>Keep</b> most of the text in the present article, subject to cleanup and normal editing, and ask Silence do whatever moves, redirects, dabs etc. will, in his judgement, serve readers best. After all, whatever he does is just normal editing and anyone can change anything he does anyway. From the Talk page I see don't see anything remotely approaching a consensus to delete--I see at least a 2/3 vote to keep it in some form, in fact--and I don't see any strongly held views or overwhelming majorities on how, exactly to do this. Personally, the only situation I would object to is one where we <i>have</i> information about a topic, but a reader who types something reasonable into the Go box doesn't <i>find</i> it. Really, AfD is for discussing whether a page should be deleted. As long as we're here, if we're keeping it's not unreasonable to discuss <i>how</i> to keep it, but there's no reason to put that burden on the closing sysop. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 20:41, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Heh! Well, I can't really show what my version of the articles looks like because I'm not an Admin; I could change all the article texts, but the history and talk for the page that used to be "Rustication" is currently at "Rustication (architecture)", and I'd need to be able to delete the "Rustication" redirect and move "Rustication (architecture)" there to make the pages functional. If I did it someone else would just have to redo it, in other words. But if anyone doesn't understand an aspect of the page moves I've proposed, I'd be glad to explain, demonstrate, or show examples of similar articles being handled in a similar way.</li>
<li>Also, I kind of wish you hadn't deleted your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRusticated&amp;diff=27754287&amp;oldid=27753279" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FRusticated&amp;diff=27754287&amp;oldid=27753279" rel="nofollow">previous comment</a>, because it's quite a reasonable suggestion, and is the suggestion I'd be endorsing myself if I thought that the topic "rustication in an academic sense" and the current article text we have merited a distinct article at this point, rather than a significant subsection of a larger article on expulsion and/or suspension in general. And, of course, having each article link to the other on the top, rather than wasting readers' time with an extraneous disambiguation page for only two articles, is just common sense.

<li><b><s>Weak Delete</s></b>. The topic is potentially encyclopedic, and I have little objection to seeing alternative theories of gravitation covered in Wikipedia, but as-is this article has serious issues as per nom. It needs a history of the scalar models (more than is in the intro), it needs documentation in the article as to just whose theory is being documented and when and where it was published, and it needs documentation as to the serious problems in has (such as certain inconsistencies with observation). So I am open to seeing this article kept <i>if significant changes are made</i>. Otherwise my vote will not stay weak. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 06:49, 7 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>On futher consideration, I must conclude that this is an amateurish article created by an editor inexperienced in both general relativity theory and Wikipedia. Either that or that it is a hoax. [The article now includes the odd statement that is does not obey the equivalence principle, when in reality any metric theory of gravitation automatically will obey the weak equivalence principle; and then there is the metric signature of (-1, -1, -1, +1) instead of (+1, -1, -1, -1).] I may take a stab at rewriting it, but without a total rewrite, this article needs to go.

<dd>Kjkolb and Isotope23, I wonder if you missed my point. There are certainly well-defined scalar theories of gravity (I mentioned one in my discussion in the talk page), and there are also various scalar fields (but that is something else) discussed in general relativity and in other classical relativistic theories of gravitation, but the author of the article provided no citations in the reputatable research literature for the theory he wishes to discuss, and on the basis of his description, his account does not appear to me to define a theory at all, much less a viable one. So if you searched the <a href="../../../a/r/x/ArXiv_671d.html" title="ArXiv">arXiv</a> for <i>scalar gravity</i> or <i>scalar</i>, I don't doubt that you found hits, but I <i>do</i> question whether you found discussion of the alleged "theory" our anonymous editor is trying to describe in this article. This is why I have nominated it for deletion: it appears to describe as a viable gravitation theory some "theory" which does not appear to be sensical, and for which the author of the article is apparently unable to provide citations to the research literature in physics. In fact, as I explained in the talk page, it appears likely that the only place where this "theory" is discussed is a web page, apparently put up by the very same person who wrote the article. Hence my invocation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. So my question for you two is: are you <i>sure</i> you found independent discussion in the research literature of the precise "theory" that the author is trying to describe? If so, can you please share the citation?---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 02:36, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, I guess I was unclear. My vote was based on the fact that scalar gravity as a subject, exists and is notable, not that this particular theory of scalar gravity is in anyway right or notable. I found no evidence that this theory is right. I did see the website and it appears to be nonsense, though I'm far from an expert. I suggest that the article be entirely rewritten, so that it discusses the scalar gravity theory that Einstein and Feynman were talking about, not this theory. If this is not possible, it should be deleted. What do you think? -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 03:28, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And I mirror Kjkolb's sentiment. The article may be factually inaccurate, but since there IS a theory of Scalar Gravity that is generally accepted to exist, this is a good candidate for a <i>cleanup and keep</i> job, with the text of the article being replaced with a factually accurate document based on the body of research I mentioned above. I'd do it, but I'm not exactly an expert at physics so chances are any article I wrote would be riddled with mistakes. Long story short, I can't vote delete on a notable subject, even if the current article has serious problems.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 03:39, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I think I've finally cleared this up in a separate discussion with Isotope23, but for other readers, just to clarify: the statement that <i>there IS a theory of Scalar Gravity that is generally accepted to exist</i> is misleading. The key points are:
<ol>
<li>There is no theory (not even a failed theory) which is known in the physics literature simply as 'Scalar Gravity', and as far as I can see, the article disucusses an ill-defined 'theory' which is unknown to physics.</li>
<li>There are certainly well-defined <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalar_theories_of_gravitation.html" title="Scalar theories of gravitation">Scalar theories of gravitation</a>, and this topic is noteworthy if for no other reason than to
<ul>
<li>examine some simple theories of gravitation, such as the Watt-Misner theory I mentioned on the <a href="../../../s/c/a/Talk%7EScalar_Gravity_7919.html" title="Talk:Scalar Gravity">talk page</a>, which are of pedagogical interest as theories which can, fairly easily, be shown not to be consistent with solar system observations,</li>
<li>explain some arguments why <i>no</i> pure scalar (or pure vector) theory of gravitation is viable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The text of the article <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalar_Gravity_df4f.html" title="Scalar Gravity">Scalar Gravity</a> contains (as far as I can see) nothing worth keeping; even the title violates Wikipedia capitalization conventions. So anyone writing an article on the topic which we agree is notable, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalar_theories_of_gravitation.html" title="Scalar theories of gravitation">Scalar theories of gravitation</a>, would have to begin by wiping the article and moving the page to a page with the new title. It seems simpler to delete <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalar_Gravity_df4f.html" title="Scalar Gravity">Scalar Gravity</a> and start again with <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scalar_theories_of_gravitation.html" title="Scalar theories of gravitation">Scalar theories of gravitation</a>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>I can suggest two recent articles which would probably be useful to anyone starting to research theories of gravitation which are known in physics:
<ul>
<li>Template:Web reference author</li>
<li>Template:Web reference author A 2005 update can be found <a href="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0510072" class="external text" title="http://www.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0510072" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Unfortunately, because pure scalar theories of gravitation are known to be nonviable, discussions of them are harder to come by, but some examples are:
<ul>

<dd>Isotope23 - I do sympathize with you, but I think that we should either put up to shut up. This article cannot be kept in its current form, and I am not in a position at this time to edit it, being in the middle of a business trip. Hence my weak delete vote. I will happily change in to a keep, but only if the article changes. In the meantime, what is there has "OR" written all over it, and that must be dealt with one way or the other. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 07:43, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article makes it clear that this is a mathematical theory which was considered by Albert Einstein before he came up with General Relativity. Therefore it is quite right to have an article about it. The article also makes it clear that the results of so-called Scalar Gravity do not agree with experiments. Further it makes clear that in order to test the GR concept of curved space you need a flat-space alternative to compare it to. There is no reason not to talk about this theory in case people mistake it as a <b>true</b> picture of reality. The article also has links to research published in physics journals which use scalar gravity.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article does need more background and someone should add to it to supply such a background and why GR finally triumphed as the true theory.</dd>
<dd>I think this article could potentially be very interesting as a history of scalar theories of gravity. Although it does need much work. However I do not believe this is a reason for deletion at this stage.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Some above have argued that this article should be kept because there is a scalar theory of gravity, whatever problems there are with this article. There are in fact many scalar theories of gravity, most of which fail completely to meet general scientific standards, or to actually explain anything about gravity. I remember reading somewhere (sorry for the lack of citation here) that scientific journals receive more unpublishable (i.e., 'crackpot') manuscripts on theories of gravitation than on any subject other than perpetual motion. There are many self-published 'crackpot' theories of gravity out there, so getting many Google hits does not establish the viability of this or any other theory of gravity. In this case, I think the very elaborate formulas which have no explanation of what most the terms mean or why they are used in the formula, forces me to regard this article as nonsense. There might be justification to mention this particular theory, along with many other such theories, in an article on alternative theories of gravitation that are not accepted by the scientific community. As it stands, however, this article does not belong in Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 10:48, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>There are many theories and the notable ones should be mentioned. Just becasue the article is incomplete doesn't make it unencylopedic. It has a good amount of google hits which established notability it may not estabish viability but that doesn't matter. The topic is still notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree with CH in that he claims that the article is about a non-sensical theory since the idea of describing gravity as a scalar field is clearly sensical and was known even to Isaac Newton. The point about the theory being non-scientific also baffles me as it clearly is about a testable theory. The point that this is not the scalar gravity theory that Einstein considered is also not true. Perhaps CH could make a link to the theory that he thinks Einstein did consider? I had a link to an article about how Einstein found General Relativity which would have cleared the matter up but I lost it! Sorry.</li>

<dd>But this is all besides the point. The question is not whether the theory works or not. Otherwise, some might argue, there should not be an article on Communism because it is a 'crackpot' theory.

<dd>62.137.134.120, whoever you are, you seem to think that I said "no scalar theories of gravity are <i>well-defined</i>", but I never said that and it isn't true! In fact I specifically mentioned a scalar theory which <i>is</i> well-defined. What I said was that scalar theories in general are known to be <i>nonviable</i>, I was referring to very well known arguments sketched the very widely read textbook by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (see <a href="../../../g/e/n/General_relativity_resources.html" title="General relativity resources">General relativity resources</a>). Please read this discussion before creating any more articles on gravitation theory in the Wikipedia, since these are elementary and crucial points.</dd>
<dd>You claim your article <i>accurately documents this mathematical theory</i>, but citing a web page is not the same as citing a paper published in a reputable research journal, or a widely-used standard graduate level textbook such as MTW. Indeed, I claim that your "theory" as you described it is not even well-defined, so I claim that it is not a <i>theory</i> at all, as phycisists understand that term, at least not yet. Here's what I suggest:
<ul>
<li>fix the problems I pointed out at your own website or wherever,</li>
<li>concoct a reason why your fixed up theory might be of interest, despite being nonviable (as any scalar theory must be),</li>
<li>submit a paper to a reputable research journal in physics such as Classical and Quantum Gravity or General Relativity and Gravitation,</li>
<li>await papers by other authors building on your work,</li>
<li>if sufficient interest is generated, watch as some third party eventually independently decides to write an article on this (so far entirely hypothetical) body of literature.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>See what I am saying? Science might sometimes seem to work slowly on human scales, but its self-correcting nature is probably the best thing about it, so we need to foster this process of error detection and eradication, even if our own "children" are numbered among its "victims".

<b>Comment</b> If people are going to reject an article as crackpot then they shouldn't give crackpot reasons. From what I've read above it appears as if none of the commenters have a remote understanding of General Relativity or even basic A-level mathematics. I get the feeling that most of those objecting to this are interested amateurs who have read a few articles on the matter. I would suggest that those who strongly object should give references of their authority in the matter. Otherewise I can only assume that most of the abbusive commenters above are 13 year old boys who think they know more than they actually do. I have to say that using the abusive terms of some of the above that a lot of the comments are absolute "drek" whatever that is. Some new schoolboy slang term I expect. But I have to say that if these are the kinds of people who read wikipedia then I'm sure the article has no point being there otherwise it is simply being read by complete morons. So I vote for delete not because the article is wrong but that it is too good to be read by such loonatics. Honestly people like CH should have better things to do than accuse people of <b>killing their children</b> by reading an article on gravitational theories. CH I advise growing up, going to university, and actually learning about what you think you already know but clearly don't. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.137.135.52 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.137.135.52_388f.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.137.135.52">contribs</a>) 16:52, 10 November 2005.</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Since I used the word "crackpot" I think I should reply. I did not call you or your theory "crackpot". I was making the point that there are so many hits for "scalar gravity" on the Internet because there are so many self-published "crackpot" theories out there. If I did give you the impression that I was calling you or your theory "crackpot", I apologize. I do take offense at the tone of your comments about those of us who have expressed opinions against this article. Wikipedia is not a peer-reviewed scientific journal. All members of the Wikipedia community are entitled to express their opinions on articles entered into Wikipedia. If you want your article to be commented on only by qualified physicists, then submit it to a peer-reviewed journal. If it is published in a peer-reviewed journal, then someone can write an Wikipedia article about the theory. Oh, and by the way, I'm 62, and although I was a physics major for only two years, I continue to maintain an active interest in all fields of science, so I guess that makes me an "interested amateur". - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 18:21, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The most abusive writing on this page is that of the anon above! Indeed, I find his accusation that Chris does not know his stuff to not just be rude but also another red flag that there is something very wrong about this anon. That Chris took one look at this article and posted an AfD on it speaks on its being deficient. I am not as capable as Chris, but the more I look at it the more problems that I see, with most of this article being so dense that it is useless as a part of Wikipedia even if it was right. Perhaps the biggest red flag is that this article remains without a References section, and its one referece (a link almost hidden in the introdcution) does not cover the material in this article. I stand by my vote. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:58, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was that there seems to me to be no consensus; therefore, the result is to keep the article. In addition, given that two closings have been reverted already (and discussion of this had alerted me to this AfD), I am very much tempted to protect this AfD page if it happens again. <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">Please don't play silly buggers</a>. <a href="../../../j/d/f/User%7EJdforrester_f39b.html" title="User:Jdforrester">James F.</a> <a href="../../../j/d/f/User_talk%7EJdforrester_2f42.html" title="User talk:Jdforrester">(talk)</a> 17:29, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fraternities(sororities and similar are not usually worthy of separate articles, even though such institutions are a part of student life.

I know people who went there, and supposedly Wooster didn't have nationals for decades because of a bequest from a former student that had been badly hazed that conditioned the money on no frats.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s>. The introduction doesn't establish the <i>point</i> of the article, except that a bunch of things are "mysterious," and it's just a list of fraternities with a few incidents of history thrown in. I would not be opposed to a shorter article that was about history, which cited sources for necessary facts about fraternities instead of listing them all. Honestly, this sort of seems to be a FAQ (or correction of common misconceptions, maybe) about the fraternities at the college, but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indescriminate collection of information</a>.

<li><b>Comment (no vote)</b>. I was the person to nominate this article the first time. I go to this college. I am not a Greek student, but have no problem with Greeks. At the time, the reason why I nominated was because the article was both POV and unverified, and, at the time, it seemed like that wasn't going to change. I had no idea where the author had originally gotten his information. Those two problems were resolved during the first AfD debate. I personally have an appreciation for the article now, though there are still problem areas, but I am not voting; I think my attending the school and my interactions with greeks color my judgment too much. --<a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler">Jacquelyn Marie</a> 03:42, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It's more accurate to think of it as a "senior thesis" than an "independent study" - Wooster uses IS to mean something different than most places. The IS program has vetting comparable to MA theses, including oral examination and a second reader, and the resulting papers are kept by the library, making them reviewable/verifiable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowspinner_8bb3.html" title="User:Snowspinner">Phil Sandifer</a> 17:41, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "No consensus" means an Afd did not reeach a consensuss. When that happens we keep the article, because there was no consensus to delete it. But it does not mean that there was a clear consensus to keep it -- in many cases it means that there were more people who wanted to delete than to keep, but not enough to form a consensus to delete. And the second AfD was closed before the normal 5-day period was up, in a proceduarally unusual and arguably improper (I argued it on <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>) action. I presume that that action was taken because the closer was convinced that a consensus was already clear, and would not change; and that there was no intent to decieve or distort the results. I think it was ill-advised. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:29, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That is utter nonsense. Articles are kept unless there is a consensus to delete. A consensus to keep may be formed, but it's quite irrelevant to the deletion policy, which only cares if there's a consensus to delete. An article does not require and has never required a consensus of editors in order to exist on Wikipedia. More to the point, it can easily be seen that after three AfDs there are few if any good reasons to argue for the deletion of this well researched and compendious article. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 01:49, 8 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Of course not. Any article that merits inclusion in the encyclopedia <i>will</i> have a clear consensus to keep—if an article cannot get that, then it means that there <i>are</i> some problems with it, at least in the opinions of other users. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd">?!?</a>)</sup> 04:36, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>It is quite correct thst a consensus to keep is never required. However, when an article's AfD results in a clear consensus to keep that article would IMO be less subject to a future delete nomination, at least in the short term, and the appeal to the previous afd debate would be far more persusaive if it were nominated. An appeal to a previous AfD with a non consensus result has far less value, IMO, and i think that is the point Friday was making, or should have been making. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:57, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Trivia such as "Symbol: Steal your Face (???)" seems to violate <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> "an indiscriminate collection of information." Labeling information about hazing as "fun facts" seems to violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. For example, while it may possibly be a verifiable fact that "[sorority] pledges had to ... write "Peanut" on the butt ... men would then be instructed ... to 'Slap their peanut,'" for editors to label such "facts" as "fun" betrays a certain POV. And "There is a common misconception that the College dosn't have any national fraternities"? I doubt it's that common to have any conception, let alone misconceptions, about fraternities and sororities at Wooster. While I appreciate R._fiend's optimism that attempts to <b>clean-up, move, wikify and verify</b> could save this article, the only info that seems even remotely encyclopedic is that "In 1999 ... the school received national attention when four Kappa Chi members were arrested for hazing pledges by beating them and urinating on them, leading to the eventual ban of the Fraternity."

<li><b>Comment: a note on verifiability</b>. I can't argue with anyone regarding whether this topic is unnotable or unencyclopedic. Those two are amorphous subjects and everyone has a different view of them. But it troubles me when people say they worry about verifiability. An Independent Study, if you read <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_College_of_Wooster_9877.html" title="The College of Wooster">The College of Wooster</a> article, is not just some final senior paper. It is the second-highest rated senior capstone project after Princeton. As Phil said, it's more like a thesis. I'd like to point out that it's not something a student just writes and hands in and gets a grade. Advisers are involved all the way through; they wouldn't allow unverifiable information to get in. And, as Phil said, it's possible to get your hands on one. I know people would just like to be able to Google this to confirm it, but, as vandals on this site sadly indicate, finding something on the Internet is not a guarantee of its truth. Also, there are plenty of true things that are not on the Internet. And, in conclusion, if you want to help with the verifiability of Wikipedia, go help with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alanis_Morissette_39bf.html" title="Alanis Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>, which literally has no sources (compared to this one, which is well-sourced) and probably gets looked at about 500x as much. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 15:26, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>

The research on the defunct fraternities was done using the Wooster Index yearbooks noted in the article. There is no AfD criterion by which I view this as deletable.

<dd>Thanks for finding an actual reference. However it's not a common term, the strategy is neither a <a href="../../../n/o/o/Noob.html" title="Noob">noob</a> tactic nor ineffective. A further example, if I were to make a wiki on 'pawn to king 4' in a chess game, and claim that people call such players noobs and that that tactic will nearly always lose you the game, that would be comparable to the wiki in question <a href="../../../b/o/r/User%7EBorgs8472_e591.html" title="User:Borgs8472">Borgs8472</a> 01:11, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>1. Factual incorrectness is not a reason to delete a page (fix it instead). 2. The "pawn to king 4" example is irrelevant, as it is not a "tactic" and there is already a page on chess openings. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatmanand_01d3.html" title="User:Batmanand">Batmanand</a> 01:47, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ah, but the term is 'generally' used to refer to new players, it's only saying how the word can be used as well as being used for the name of a tactic. Words have different meanings, they can mean different things when applied to different areas. Further more, if the term is ingrained in the games online culture then surely it has a right to be here? It may not be used all that often but that doesn't mean it isn't used as a derogortory term, or (as the rest of the article clearly states) as a tactic.</dd>

<dd>It seems to me that you seem to be more bothered about the 'Usage' section. The rest of the article simply describes the tactic. As I've said, that's how some people in the game may choose to use it, just like we use words like 'cool' for different meanings. If the tactic is seen to be commonly used by new people then some gamers have formed some sort of cult in rejecting the tactic, and as an online gamer myself I wouldn't find that all that surprising.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I think a deleting this article and retooling the mention in the main article should suffice. The main theory of the one magazine article, that the 25th wasn't passed when it was in reality, is disproved almost immediately afterwards in the Time Skew article, so suggesting that that article makes the article valid is silly, as it is almost immediately set aside in exchange for fancruft theories. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 23:20, 7 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Fancruft is what wikipedia is all about. Or at least, partially about. As Scm notes, discussion of canon in various fictional universes is a common topic in wikipedia.

<li>The notion that cruft justifies more cruft is abhorrent to me; it seems like a very slippery slope.

<ul>
<li>I was being somewhat facetious. I do, though, think it's generally unfair if there's a long-standing section in an article which gets too long, and is split off into its own article, which then gets deleted as fancruft. It is to be added that this issue is far more central, I think, to the constructed universe of <i>The West Wing</i> than, say, the <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor_Holocaust_90d5.html" title="Endor Holocaust">Endor Holocaust</a> is to the Star Wars universe. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:53, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and Clean</b>. The article is of interest to certain readers of Wikipedia, generally <i>West Wing</i> fans, so the material is germane since the show has a large number of related articles. Given the potential size of this article, it should be its own separate entry. It does need to be cleaned up to the point where it appears as its own entry rather than a sub-entry, but that's all that it needs. -<a href="../../../k/e/i/User%7EKeillan_309e.html" title="User:Keillan">Keillan</a> 17:11, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: A potential idea. Perhaps, instead of an article entirely devoted to timeline skew theories, we could create an article on what is known about the fictional alternative history of the show and the ways it deviates from actual history, which would include a discussion of the timeline skew issue. That way the timeline skew issue wouldn't get a whole article devoted to it, but it wouldn't all have to go in the general <i>West Wing</i> article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Kenney_4b6b.html" title="User:John Kenney">john</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohn_Kenney_ebe6.html" title="User talk:John Kenney">k</a> 18:58, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> about the previous comment. "The West Wing" is fiction, and fiction that isn't terribly careful about internal or external consistency on non-central points. For example, in the current West Wing universe, the Secret Service isn't providing (visible) protection for Santos and Vinick. Should I revise the timeline skew article to suggest that RFK wasn't assassinated, or Wallace wasn't shot? Maybe the timeline skew goes back much further -- there is, after all, no country called "Qumar" (or whatever) in the here and now. For it to exist, we pretty much have to go back and change Middle Eastern history in the aftermath of World War I. The whole timeline skew morass rests on a single comment about "2002" in a single episode, and all that the real "evidence" suggests is that an actor had a slip of the tongue, or that a writer made a minor mistake. Where does this sort of babbling stop? (Semi)-scientific speculation about how side effects of a nuclear power plant keeps the characters in the Simpsons from aging? Speculation about the continuity in the comic strip B.C. and how its characters appear to know about contemporary social issues (and how characters in the B.C. period know about events reported on or about 33 A.D.)? What kind of scientific advances have been made in the CSI universe to enable them to conduct DNA analyses in only a few hours, when in the here and now the tests take much longer? In the Disney universe, why has Goofy (a dog) had a pet dog of his own (Pluto)? (And why has ownership of Pluto changed so much, anyway?) Fiction is less consistent than reality, and Wikipedia shouldn't pretend otherwise. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 19:59, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The Secret Service <i>is</i> giving both candidates coverage. That would be why there are all the tall, silent men in black suits in the rest room with Vinick when Frost briefs him, why there are tall, silent men in black suits all standing around at the Al Smith dinner, etc. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStaxringold_44f9.html" title="User:Staxringold">Staxringold</a> 00:33, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>one more <b>Comment</b>. But not consistently enough. Remember in particular the scene where the two candidates meet in an apparently unsecured kitchen at the Al Smith dinner. It's a budget thing; in scenes calling for extras, a few are playing agents. But in other scenes, they're not to be seen. You're right that I wasn't clear enough, though, I should have said (consistent) rather than (visible). <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:44, 9 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, mostly because I'm reluctant to outright delete content that was forked due to article length. This needs a rewrite by someone familiar with the series to correct for structural issues (move the discussion of timeline differences above the theories, etc.), and it could probably use a more intuitive title as well (Irregular Timeline in The West Wing?). -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 17:29, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> When I forked the article, I had trouble coming up with a name for it.

<li><b>Note:</b> I've just rewritten the article entirely from scratch. The previous content was so execrable it could probably have been speedied, but I hope that this will suffice now. <a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbi_b448.html" title="User:Ambi">Ambi</a> 01:40, 8 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly urge to keep.</b> This post is entirely related, especially since its renovation. As a first time user, I prematurely published this article by accident, mistakenly thinking I was within the safe confines of sandbox. Wikimedia surpasses academic edited collections because it can bring the ‘niche’ as well as the ‘general’, this is just as relevant as comments about pages about state politicians in QLD, or young Labor factions. I am not associated with the Union and certainly not paid. I have no reason to believe that anything suggests that this is affiliated with the official website. That comment is completely unfounded, unsubstantiated statement. This page is relevant to the VSU debate. It can be redirected from Australian Student Unions or NUS or UQ.
