<li><b>Comment</b>. The article as it stands has improved marginally although it is still worthy of deletion. The first paragraph referring to fundamentalism and citing Rich Lang, a Seattle pastor who is not notable enough in its own right to make Wikipedia is irrelevant to the rest of the article and any credible attempt to address the topic. I will repeat that a worthwhile article on this topic will address people like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francisco_Franco_4235.html" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a> and Tiso (not Tito). It should address the resistance to fascism and Nazism by Christians such as <a href="../../../d/i/e/Dietrich_Bonhoeffer_0622.html" title="Dietrich Bonhoeffer">Dietrich Bonhoeffer</a> as well in order to avoid being POV. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 03:32, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Terms "Christian fascism", "Christian fascists". Christofascism, etc, seem to be in reasonably common use. A quick google news search shows that the term turns up in <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Review_8dfa.html" title="National Review">National Review</a>, there's an article by a history professor at <a href="../../../t/u/f/Tufts.html" title="Tufts">Tufts</a>, Gary Leupp, who is a self-declared libertarian, published by <a href="../../../c/o/u/Counterpunch.html" title="Counterpunch">Counterpunch</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> this nonsense and create a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/a/s/Fascism_%28epithet%29.html" title="Fascism (epithet)">Fascism (epithet)</a>. There isn't anything legitimate here that isn't covered there. Sorry, the belief by nutcases that the divine will was on their side does not a link between Christianity and fascism make. <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In Black</a> 03:59, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, normally I would vote delete on this but I feel that in order to have some balance on Wikipedia, we either keep both <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_fascism.html" title="Islamic fascism">Islamic fascism</a> or delete both. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:05, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a specious argument. If an argument is clearly nonsense, there's no need to keep it just because we kept the opposite argument.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>, but treading dangerously close to POV. May need some work, but I must reluctantly admit to there being a need for an article on the term, whether or not there is a reality behind it. (As an aside, I think there's more connection between fascism and Christianity than this article wants to let on, but apart from pointing out the obvious connection between the Roman Catholic Church and Mussolini and Franco I don't think such things fit into this article.) <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaikupoet_25ff.html" title="User:Haikupoet">Haikupoet</a> 04:19, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><sup>1) Most people have no clue what a legitimate definition of neofascism really is.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>2) Even among experts there are disagreements over the definition.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>3) Some folks are calling Islamic and Christian and Jewish fundamentalists "fascists" and it really is just a hyperbolic jingoistic epithet.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>4) Some folks are denying there are any strains of neofascism in modern religious movements and act as apologists when there are serious scholars who have raised the issue in a cautious and appropriate way.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>5) At Wikipedia we need to report on the last two points of view (hyperbolic Pro v. apologia Con), and then try to highlight the serious scholarship.</sup></dd>
<dd><sup>Ideally, the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">Islamofascism</a> page and the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_fascism.html" title="Christian fascism">Christian fascism</a> page (which are both pretty badly written and probably pointless to try to fix) would be redirected to the larger discussion at <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>.</sup></dd>

I think keeping the page <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_fascism.html" title="Clerical fascism">Clerical fascism</a> for discussions of the European interwar movements makes more sense than expanding it to include neofascist movements...and we can move the appropriate book cites over.</sup></dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I moved the following argument from my post on the discussion page, with minor changes/updates:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>1) The term gets a huge number of search engine hits (see: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Christian+fascism%22=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Christian+fascism%22=Search" rel="nofollow">link to search for term "Christian Fascists" as an exact match</a>)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) The Christian Right Wing has fascist elements (e.g., the Ku Klux Klan, the Westboro Baptist Church, Jerry Falwell, and Pat Robertson). These are not fascists in the epithet use of the word; one definition of fascist is "a person who is dictatorial or has extreme right-wing views". As fascism is "a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism" and more the point of this discussion, “a political philosophy or movement based on or advocating such a system of government”, and the examples mentioned before are fascists by that definition (as judged by their actions and statements), and all are Christians, the term is legitimate, and not solely an epithet.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) Epithet vs. Legitimate Term: One example of a word that is both legitimate and an epithet: liberal. Conservatives use this word as an epithet to inspire their base. Should we delete the liberal article as well? How about redneck, which is also both a legitimate term (often used by those it describes in a positive way) and an epithet? And let us not forget nigger, which possibly the gravest insult a white person can call a black person…but a word used over and over again in rap music, performed mostly by blacks. It’s both a legitimate term, and an epithet; should we delete that article as well?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>4) If the term is legitimate, and not solely an epithet, the article is legitimate. If the article is legitimate, it should not be deleted. At most, it might be redirected/absorbed into <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofascism_and_religion.html" title="Neofascism and religion">Neofascism and religion</a>, <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Fascism_4c3d.html" title="Neo-Fascism">Neo-Fascism</a> or <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clerical_Fascism_49ea.html" title="Clerical Fascism">Clerical Fascism</a> (or all three), a move I would agree with more than a pure deletion. <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">Weirdoactor</a> 13:50, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So now Weirdo has switching from arguing that this article should stay because he thinks I'm religious to that it should stay because there are insecure people out there to call people like Pat Robertson fascists although, like has been made clear earlier, they are clearly not fascists. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 18:28, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No. Let's be clear and honest, Itake: it is YOU who have switched arguments, from "POV" to "the term is misleading". I've never made the argument that the article should stay because a) I think you are religious (your obvious bias is my issue, not your religion), or b) "insecure people out there to call people like Pat Robertson fascists" (sic) (this is, ironically, a POV, yours to be exact, and it merely proves my point of bias). My argument for keeping the article is very clearly stated above. Should you need assistance understanding my argument, feel free to ask me specific questions regarding the points I've made, or answer those points. And please refrain from freestyle interpretation of my statements to fit your agenda.

<dd>Honesty? I don't think non-religious people like you know the meaning of that term. Did I ever say the sole reason for its deletion was that the term is misleading? No, I didn't think so either. You, you have no points. Its just one long rant on that the article should stay because some people use the term "Christian fascist" to describe people like Pat Robertson. <a href="../../../i/t/a/User%7EItake_90f6.html" title="User:Itake">Itake</a> 19:37, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
