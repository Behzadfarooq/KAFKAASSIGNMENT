<li><b>keep</b>: Wow, what an interesting battle going on here! As a studier of Chinese, I am particularly interested how Chinese has merged into other languages...the three most common being Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese. The names of these countries in their repective languages all come from the Chinese...does that mean that they are not real Vietnamese, Korean, or Japanese words? Of course, the assimilation of Chinese into English is a bit different, being that we deal with romanization. Therefore, the word meaning "energy" that is described in the list would at one time have been known as Ch'i, or Chi, has become Qi in the official <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinyin.html" title="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> system. This word is becoming more common in English usage as more and more people become interested in Asian culture. Other good examples are Qin and Qing, the names of two Chinese dynasties. Perhaps, though, these problems could be solved by naming the article instead, "List of Words in English containing a Q not followed by a U". The current title does lead the reader to believe that the words listed will be of English etymological origin.<a href="../../../i/l/u/User%7EIluvchineselit_4810.html" title="User:Iluvchineselit">Iluvchineselit</a> 18:23, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think renaming would be a bad idea, but I'm not convinced it's strictly necessary either. Nevertheless, there is hardly such a thing as English etymological origin. Almost every word in English ultimately originates from another language, so it's just a question of how recently they migrated. Still, the article has benefitted greatly just from being on VfD, and a lot more people have read it than otherwise would have done, so really it's all good. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 18:33, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Since these words aren't really related at all, except for their spelling, I don't think there's really a point in putting it is Wiktionary either.

<li>I am the author so obviously I will vote <b>keep</b> but let's discuss this reasonably. I think this is more than a dictionary entry, because it attempts to explain how we end up with such words in English when most people believe they do not exist. Admittedly this bit needs expansion but that's exactly what I'm working on at the moment. After Uppland added the transwiki tag, I posted my reasons for keeping it on Wikipedia to the Talk page. Ten days later, neither he nor anyone else had replied, so I assumed that everyone was satisified with my reasoning - apologies if that was not the case, and I'm quite happy to have the transwiki debate again. To address some of the above concerns: they are mostly loan words, but are considered naturalised according to at least one major dictionary (Collins). As a list of words, it is no worse then any of the other articles in the 'Lists of English words' category. As I say, I'm sorry if I caused any confusion by removing the transwiki tag, but this article really doesn't deserve to be deleted. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 20:10, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>You may not have noticed, but <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_words_25b9.html" title="Category:Lists of words">Category:lists of words</a>, which is <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_English_words_c920.html" title="Category:Lists of English words">Category:Lists of English words</a>'s parent has a "move to wiktionary" tag on it. While we can't and wouldn't just transwiki whole category and its contents, the symbolic meaning is that there has been a judgment that <i>whole lot</i> of them don't belong here. Maybe I should list some today. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 20:24, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry for missing your talkpage comment. I just feel that the connection between these words is trivial, basically just the result of certain conventions for transcribing from various other languages. It might be worth <i>mentioning</i> somewhere (in the article on <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_spelling.html" title="English spelling">English spelling</a> or in a general article on loanwords in English, which might exist somewhere under some title) that there are words in English with a Q not followed by a U, that this is a result of borrowing, and proceed to give an example or two from each language with an explanation of why this or that particular phoneme has been represented by a Q in English. I just don't see the need for a comprehensive list. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">Uppland</a> 20:28, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whether a particular list of words are connected in a trivial or non-trivial way is totally a matter of opinion, so if you disagree on that then fair enough. I hadn't noticed that the parent cat is up for transwikiing; thanks for the info. If a judgement has been made that these articles belong on Wiktionary then by all means move them, but I don't think deletion is the answer, and would be disappointed as I have put quite a bit of time into this article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 20:36, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What's wrong with this list? I found it very interesting, so i want to <b>keep</b> it.

<li>I don't understand what is misleading about the title, but I'd be more than willing to listen to suggested improvements - please elaborate.

<li>They are naturalised in English, at least according to the Collins dictionary. In that sense they are as English as any other word lifted directly from other languages, i.e. the vast majority of English words. Being more recent naturalisations may make them not 'true' English words in your eyes, but the dictionary has to be the authority here. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 21:23, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Rule of thumb</b>: <i>If the only reference you need is a dictionary, then its not an encyclopedia article, since <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia is Not a Dictionary</a>. --<a href="../../../d/m/c/User%7EDmcdevit_2064.html" title="User:Dmcdevit">Dmcdevit</a>·<a href="../../../d/m/c/User_talk%7EDmcdevit_b359.html" title="User talk:Dmcdevit">t</a> 21:34, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</i>
<ul>
<li>The dictionary is not the only reference required; the opening paragraphs are clearly encyclopaedic. Nevertheless I don't object to moving the page to Wiktionary, at least in preference to deleting it altogether. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 21:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Mainly because the vast majority of these are loan words. There is much scope for differences in spelling anyway because the Q is only used to approximate a particular letter sound in other languages. In the New Oxford English Dictionary at least, they are nearly all listed differently anyway, without a lone Q (some with K, QU, CH, etc). I also agree that "tranq" should be removed from the list whatever happens because it is just a shortening (the OED spells it "trank" anyway). However, it is an interesting article, hence the "weak" and I might yet change my vote because it would be relatively "harmless" to keep. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobbis_377c.html" title="User:Bobbis">Bobbis</a> 21:12, 25 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My criterion was for them to appear in at least one major dictionary. The NODE is considerably shorter (fewer than half as many words) and less permissive than Collins, so I suppose it is not that surprising that the alternative spellings are not specified in it. Regarding Tranq, it is a shortened form, but it is not an abbreviation; it is written without a dot, just like 'vet' which I think most people would agree is a word in its own right. Glad you found the page interesting though, and I hope I can resolve your issues with it. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgentsoo_cc19.html" title="User:Agentsoo">Agentsoo</a> 21:23, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
