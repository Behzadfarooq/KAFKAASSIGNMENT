<dd>"The various gathering professions are all means to an end, never an end in themselves. A player may take a gathering profession to supplement his crafting profession, or simply to sell the items he gathers, but the products of these professions are never directly beneficial in and of themselves." All that is what I would expect to see in a game guide. It is total junk of no encyclopaedic benfit whatsoever. Wikipedia is not here to tell people what to do to get through the next level. Also, per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>, this piece of trash should be written from a real-world perspective: it clearly isn't.

<dd>That's not a game guide to me, since it merely describes how Professions function within the game. If anything, that introductory paragraph is essential to understanding professions within World of Warcraft, so that you would pick it out as a problem makes me question your definition of a game guide. How is understanding what professions are within the game total junk of no encyclopaedic benefit whatsoever? How does that even tell anyone how to get to the next level? It doesn't even tell you how to advance within levels, or provide advice about the best things to do with a given skill. Nor do I concur with your <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> complaints. This isn't a plot summary, and the article clearly distinguishes between this world and the World of Warcraft. It even provides some context within the game for the perceived value of certain skills. Sorry, but you have failed to show any substantial merit to your complaints. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 14:56, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your "counter-argumentation" is bust. I'm not advocating deletion "just because" anything. This article is fancruft, un-encyclopedic, a game guide AND it's info can be found in a million other (more appropriate) places to boot. This article does indeed explain, in depth, game-play mechanics and is therefore a game guide. Wikipedia is not a free web hosting service for every fanboy's favorite game; It's an encyclopeida.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> I would love for anyone here to give me an example on <i>what</i> in this article actually reads as a game guide.. It doesn't tell you how to play, only what each profession is. If this is a game guide, then we must AfD almost all game/movie and book related articles on Wikipedia, as they also tell you about their subject matter. A most pointless AfD by a user who started by prodding it, which I removed as someone changed the entire article. And now, he AfDs it. I assume good faith, but I'm concerned about the reasoning from the nominator. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Havok_0d4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Havok">e</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 09:25, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Hey there Havok. I'd just like to clarify that my nomination is indeed in good faith. I'm honestly concerned about how the article sits with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. I don't feel that the professions in the game are any more notable than, say, the types of armour or the weapon proficiencies. As best I understand it, a game guide covers the mechanics of a game and an encyclopedia covers what makes a game special and noteworthy.</dd>
<dd>As for <a href="../../../g/a/m/Wikipedia%7EGame_guide_7d71.html" title="Wikipedia:Game guide">Wikipedia:Game guide</a>, when I read the <i>"...certain attacks by the opponent will trigger a visual cue, a vibration of the controller, and a chime. Attacking at that point causes Link to dodge or parry then counter-attack from the rear"</i> it sounds very much like the kind of content that defines a game guide. Yes, it's written in a much better tone, but the information it carries doesn't seem encyclopedic.</dd>
<dd>Clearly though, we disagree on what should be included here and I don't believe that we'll come to quick agreement either way. Still, I wanted to clarify my reasoning for nominating this article. Hopefully we can get some other users to look at this and provide some external perspective. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBradBeattie_1142.html" title="User:BradBeattie">Brad Beattie</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../b/r/a/User_talk%7EBradBeattie_69e6.html" title="User talk:BradBeattie">(talk)</a></small></sup> 10:43, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Really, I think covering the mechanics of a game is part of what makes a good encyclopedia. For example, you make an article about <a href="../../../s/u/p/Super_Mario_Brothers_d04e.html" title="Super Mario Brothers">Super Mario Brothers</a>. It helps to explain how the game is played. Same goes with sports like <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball.html" title="Baseball">Baseball</a> and even <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess.html" title="Chess">Chess</a>. Which if you look at them, contain much the same kind of stuff which you object to. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:52, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> - Forked out of the main article to an article for each profession, then was condensed into one page to remove game guide content. The content here is what would be relavent to the main article without getting into too much gamecruft. It seems to me that there is a group of Wikipedians that want almost zero game content on Wikipedia. For someone playing the game this information is next to useless, but someone wondering WoW is, this basic info is useful. As far as OR goes, well about the only reference that could be used is the game itself, or possibly the manual. <a href="../../../p/p/g/User%7EPPGMD_7152.html" title="User:PPGMD">PPGMD</a> 16:59, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

How is this a game guide? It explains what the professions are, and basic use. If it had a list of what zones had which ores/herbs/etc, then you would have a point.

<li><b>Comment</b> No, actually, it's not. Game play mechanics fall under rules, and is a vital part when describing anything remotely interactive.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I totally understand where confusion could arise from those examples. In the articles covering sports it is vital to descibe these sport's rules in order to differentuate them from others. They easily fall under <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> and the guildline (and it is just a guildline) of <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMMON_9dc8.html" title="WP:COMMON">WP:COMMON</a>. You <i>have to</i> have a basic understanding of the rules of these games so you can understand what makes it "football" or "soccer" or "chess". In addition these are famous and influential sports and games, their influence streches back hundreds of years and their impact is incalcuable. The need to descibe the diffrence between the specific rules and game play mechanics of "World of Warcraft" and "<a href="../../../e/v/e/Everquest.html" title="Everquest">Everquest</a>" don't quite equate. Videogames can be given an encyclopedic overview and all cheats, in depth game mechanics, game play points, etc can and should be covered for interested parties with a few simple lines of external links to the sites that are devoted to that: Game Guide sites. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 08:08, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I still fail to see the relevance of what you are saying. Basically what you are saying is "computer and video games are unimportant". At least that's what it looks like. As you brought up chess in your example, I would say it's equally important to describe the rule set of a video game as it is a board game or sport. The only difference between them is that many people don't see computer and video games as a "notable" hobby so to speak. And I would also think <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> applies to CVG just as much as chess and soccer. Oh, and this article doesn't fail <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in any instance. <strong><a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_a4f2.html" title="User:Havok">Havok</a></strong> <a href="../../../h/a/v/User_talk%7EHavok_0d43.html" title="User talk:Havok">(T</a>/<a href="../../../h/a/v/User%7EHavok_Contributions_37ac.html" title="User:Havok/Contributions">C</a>/<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Havok_0d4d.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Havok">e</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Interiot/Tool2/code.js?username=Havok" rel="nofollow">c</a>) 10:20, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> BTW, you say that those games impacts are incalcuable. Well, maybe. Does that mean we can't decide what articles should or should not be kept on them, or that WOW's 7.5 million players don't matter? Isn't that enough of an impact for a few articles? Football has over a dozen just describing gameplay. Chess even has an article on <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_strategy_and_tactics.html" title="Chess strategy and tactics">strategies and tactics</a>. Not to mention several spin-offs from there. Why does Wikipedia get to be a gameguide for Chess? (And that's not even bringing up the huge <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_chess_players.html" title="List of chess players">list of chess players</a>.) WoW has less than 50 articles. What is wrong with this one? <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:19, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Game play mechanics&#160;!= instruction manual. Saying something exists in the game is fine. Saying how to do something is not. "Engineers turn ore into explosives" is fine because it explains, in general, what Engineers do. "Goblin Engineers with 235 skill can turn 1 Mithril Casing, 1 Goblin Rocket Fuel, 6 Solid Dynamites, and 1 Unstable Trigger into The Big One" is not because it explains how to accomplish something, namely how to make The Big One. -<a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanbomber_10a1.html" title="User:Ryanbomber">Ryanbomber</a> 18:10, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
