<li><b>Delete</b> I think the actress's unusual physical build (for the genre), and faux-martial-arts gimmick give her <i>some</i> notability, enough to tip the scales in her favor if she came close, but not quite up to passing a notability test. And I do believe it is wrong to use the <i>proposed American</i> notability test in judging Japanese subjects. However, unless someone can show evidence to the contrary, this actress appears to be too obscure to come even close to any reasonable notability requirements. Also, the article does not contain much real information that could not be reflected in a resurrected and expanded List of Japanese female porn stars. Delete and <b>move</b> the information to that List in the future. (A title like "Lady Karate Fighter VS Rape Maniacs" a hoax?

<dd>Please, Satori, show where I said someone said this "absolutely <i>was</i> a hoax." What I read was, "I immediately thought hoax." By that comment, I understood that the editor assumed on first glance that a title such as this must be a hoax. From that, I further concluded that he must not have encountered titles like this before. Since titles like this are rife in the Japanese adult entertainment field, I presume the editor has little knowledge and/or interest in said field. I would have spelled all this out in the first comment if I thought it necessary. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:56, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>At first, I did think this article <i>might</i> be a hoax, but only because of the bizarre writing style and complete lack of sources (<i>not</i> because of the video title).

<li><b>Comment</b> - Sure, it may not be accurate to judge a Japanese porn actress based on the American standards in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>, that's why I specifically mentioned that she wouldn't pass a <i>Japanese equivalent</i>, having no similarly notable work or appearances as outlined in <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. Meaning, <i>even in Japan</i>, she has no notable awards, no notable mainstream work, no notable magazine appearances, etc etc. Even if we are to invalidate the use of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> based either on the fact that it uses American standards or that it is only a proposal, this person would definitely fail the official <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 20:14, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>OK, I agree with you here, on this particular actress Hong. You seem to have found an actress who, to my knowledge and ability to track sources, in no way appears to meet notability standards. Obviously she <i>is</i> verifiable, though, and deserves a place on a list. I still say Japanese (or international) and American standards have to different though. The Amazon test for instance, would fail the vast majority of even <i>notable</i> American stars, and shows that even <i>non-notable</i> Japanese porn actresses (such as this one) have a mainstream presence in that country. <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 20:51, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Honestly, I'm actually already giving many of these Japanese porn actresses slack on the notability and verifiability when I mention a Japanese equivalent of <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a>. If we are to strictly use <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, many of them would have an even more difficult time passing. That's why it may not necessarily be to your best advantage to invalidate <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> based on either that it's only a proposal or that it is culturally biased. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:03, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You seem to be trying to say that there are only two possible ways to establish a <i>Japanese</i> adult actress' notability: By ignoring the vast differences between the two countries and the two industries and applying a test of notability designed for <i>American</i> adult actresses on <i>Japanese</i> actresses, or, if <i>that</i> isn't biased enough for you, by subjecting them to a test designed for general world biography. If <i>American</i> adult actors have been deemed worthy of a special set of notability standards, separate from world biography in general, then adult actors from other countries deserve that same specialized treatment. And how, exactly, are you cutting them slack on verifiability when even the least notable of them have a presence on Amazon? Are you actually saying a listing of a DVD on Amazon is not verifiable? Or are you just preparing your argument for deleting another list on grounds of "unverifiabilty?" The list is already being held to a higher standard of verifiability than many other lists I've checked on Wikipedia, and now any source is going to be disqualified, as what? "Commercial," "personal page," or just "icky because it talks about Japanese porn stars?" <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 21:29, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I do keep repeating - these porn actresses that I've nominated have no notable mainstream work, no notable magazine appearance, no notable awards, etc etc. So aside from those, what would determine notability? We've got no criteria here to say, "oh, she's been in 22 DVDs so she's notable." How? Why? Why do 22 Japanese porn DVDs, no awards, no mainstream work, etc etc, make a Japanese porn actress notable, while American porn actresses need a lot more than that to achieve notability? Even <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> is still a proposal, so unfortunately, until the English WP decide to come up with a WP:JAPANESE PORN BIO, we've got no grounds to judge Japanese porn actresses on a different set of criteria. I mean, some of the editors reject <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_BIO_fcd2.html" title="WP:PORN BIO">WP:PORN BIO</a> just based on the fact that it's a proposal. There's no other notability test then, except for <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It's already pretty generous that Japanese porn actresses are to be considered under an imaginary Japanese equivalent of a proposed notability test. I repeat - without that, the only notability test left for them is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. There's no other test. The only thing left is individual editors using arbitrary criteria and personal opinions to judge their notability. That's hardly good enough. <a href="../../../h/o/n/User%7EHongQiGong_55a2.html" title="User:HongQiGong">--- Hong Qi Gong</a> 21:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
