<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> Why is the Extinctioner artical up for deletion? If it is just because of its popularity, then it has already been proven that the Extinctioner comic series already has a large fanbase with numerous fangroups and a distrabution region that spreads over two continents. It may not be as popular as "Spiderman", "X-men", "Daredevil", or "Star Wars", but many underground comics are not widely known. Does the artical provide too much information? In a sense, yes. It focuses too much on the characters themselves than the actual history of the continuity of Extinctioners and the comic's history. If the artical in question is being targeted because of it's assosiation to Furdom, then there is no reason to continue this discussion. Should Extinctioners move to Wikifur? No, I do not believe that it should. If I may, I would like to point out several other comics, such as Shanda the Panda[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda_the_Panda" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanda_the_Panda" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>], Atomic Mouse[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Mouse" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Mouse" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>], Albedo Anthropomorphics[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_Anthropomorphics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo_Anthropomorphics" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>], and Buck O'Hare[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_O%27Hare#Comic_book" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucky_O%27Hare#Comic_book" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>], are not apart of Wikifur despite the fact that they are listed as Furry Comics[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_furry_comics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_furry_comics" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>] right here in Wikipedia. If Extinctioners is truely classified as a Furry Comic here on Wikipedia, and the Administrators seek to move it to Wikifur, then why is it allowed that other Furry Comics remain undistubred? <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKantorock_78e1.html" title="User:Kantorock">Kantorock</a> 17:21, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Weak keep</b>&amp;<b>Transwiki</b> Upon further revision of this article, I've noticed that it does, indeed contain a uselessly large amount of information. It should be cut down to a minimal size, with only a short summary of main characters as a group, and the rest should be transferred to a main article on Wikifur. Though the article has a right to exist on Wikipedia, it does not need more than a simple summary and a link to a more thorough article on a personal site. Dikastis</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>/<b>Transwiki</b> as nonnotable, possible marketing abuse of wikipedia. Same as anthroid and Andorozon afds.

<dd>Well, it says its being published at the moment by <a href="http://www.shandafantasyarts.net" class="external text" title="http://www.shandafantasyarts.net" rel="nofollow">Shanda Fantasy Arts</a>, which is a very small scale publisher, a step above self-publishing. They pay "up to $10" per page - $5 for pin up art.

<dd>RVDDP2501, don't take the afd personally, its not to undervalue your hard work. The concern is that your subject may not be appropriate for an encyclopedia on notability grounds. If you can show <i>verifiable</i> proof that this comic is read and known widely enough, your article would pass the Afd test. I also suggested that the highly commendable project, <b><a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Extinctioners" class="external text" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Extinctioners" rel="nofollow">Wikifur</a></b> may a better home (with a better audience) for your efforts.

I read Extinctioners and know several others who do, some of whom aren't primarily interested in anthropomorphics, but in superhero genre comics.

<li>First, yes, but not my only edit. I was already juggling around the idea of editing for some time and had viewed the aforementioned article long before it came up for deletion. I remember when it was merely a stub. And I have been active on other Wikis before as well. I just thought it better to sign my name to an edit than to merely leave an anonymous IP number as my tag. Besides, now that I have an account, I am happily seeing about correcting a few oversights regarding missing articles for both cartoons and sci-fi shows. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGrowlyGenet_1d87.html" title="User:GrowlyGenet">Growly</a> 22:51, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>SHAWNTAE HOWARD, CREATOR</b> Extinctioners is a quarterly comic not an annual, but due to injuries, graduate studies, and serious family issues over the past 2 years, yes, it has come out with only 2 issues a year, the primary comic and it's annual. However, I do not see why that would cause it for grounds for deletion from wikipedia, nor do I personally consider the comic book 'furry' since it also features a main human cast so I'd say I personally feel a little insulted that the idea that it belongs on wikifur is it's appropriate location. The creator of the page did indeed e-mail me and asked me for permission to create the page, which I consented and gave him information on character bios, which he used in his article (such as the person who created the less detailed wikifur page did). The company that the comic is published by has been in existance for 10 years and still is currently publishing, infact an issue of Extinctioners is available for pre-order right this moment in the current month's Diamond Previews listed under Shanda Fantasy Arts. It's readership spans the globe, with the internet only helping it's notority, with only the limited resources of foreign readers being able to easily aquire an issue. The comic has also spanned a number of yahoo fan groups with memberships in the thousands. I'm not sure who reported that the book was not worthy of a wikipage in the first place, probably out of some sort of spite, but if onther comic related material can have a page I don't see why this one doesn't as well. It's a comic that's been in existance for 10 years now, regardless of it's frequncey of issues per year, there still are issues per year, with the latest currently in production from me (and it's page lenght went from 32, to 48, now down to 40 of which I do all of the work on from writing, penciling, inking, and greytoning, so yes, it takes a one man production crew time to complete when I'm also a working teacher who's taking graduate classes and supporting a family at the same time.) I'm not sure if this is enough proof to maintain the page on wiki, but if no, please feel free to e-mail me at howart@peoplepc.com and I can further answer any inuquires. Additional note, a poster stated that the last publishede issue was March 2005, this is incorrect, the latest issue #15 came out just 2 months ago, the SFA page has not yet been updated by it's webmaster. <a href="http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbitvalley.com/item_6468_1959___Extinctioners-Volume-2-Number-15.html</a> Is proof of its existance and availability.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Proof that extinctioners is 'known and read widely enough' could be derived from the membership lists of the following yahoo groups, which (usually) list user name, real name, age and location.

I have heard of Extinctioners a number of times, though I've yet to read it. It seems to me that the three pages referencing it could easily be merged into one, combining 'anthroid' and 'Andorozon' as subtopics in the Extinctioners page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Charlesdeleroy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Charlesdeleroy_d57c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Charlesdeleroy">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b> as it does have a lengthy publishing history despite gaps in its schedule. Go gently with the arguments, those folks who are opposing deletion. Please remember that this is a place for rational discussion about the merits of the article in question, and the best way to ensure that the article remains on Wikipedia is by assuring the nominators and other participants in the discussion that the topic meets notability requirements. This means providing links to credible sources that indicate the book's existence - and even then, as it is a small-market publication, the article might not quite meet the notability requirements. I would note that the article as it stands, as with the Andorozon page also up for deletion, needs some serious work to be properly <a href="../../../s/t/y/WP%7ESTYLE_9c31.html" title="WP:STYLE">Wikified</a>. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 17:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hardly. Extinctioners is NOT Past its peak. IT is one of the most inventive, sexy, well drawn, Thought out comics that is out there. It still is colorful, well made, and creative even when other comics have lost its luster. The artist and writer have created the most colorful characters. THese characters are so different from each other it's amazing and inspirational. PAST its PEAK BAH! It still keeps going and will never grow old! This comic is a staple for the furry world&#160;:) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.7.html" title="User:64.12.116.7">64.12.116.7</a> (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.12.116.7.html" title="User talk:64.12.116.7">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.12.116.7_d764.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.12.116.7">contribs</a>) .</small> - comment placed at top of page, moved here. <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 20:10, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep/<s>Transwiki</s> Cleanup</b> This would be an excellent article for WikiFur. It does seem to be a bit heavy for the regular WikiPedia.

<dd>Just checked on WikiFur, and they already have an article on Extinctioners. The main characters have their own articles there, which I do not think should be done here. Basically, I think this article just needs to be trimmed down. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVik-Thor_5caa.html" title="User:Vik-Thor">VikÞor</a> [[User talk:Vik-Thor|Talk]] 23:15, 5 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Shawntae Howard: Creator</b> Perhaps it is felt that it belongs on Wikifur is because the main characters happen to be humaniod animals. However, I as it's creator do not consider the comic "Furry" as it is traditionally thought of at all, and while the individual who worked on the page focused on those characters, they were in the process of including the human characters from the comic as well, as he was asking for information about those particular characters as well. Also, I notice that on wikipedia an article for the comic Gold Digger, written by Fred Perry is allowed, a comic that also started out with a strong anthropomorphic cast and features human main characters as well, yet it is not recommended that this article would be an excellent article for Wikifur. I've noted that there is an article on Albedo Anthropomorphics, a sci fi comic with an all anthropomorphic cast on Wikipedia, yet it hasn't been recommended as an article best suited for Wikifur (when it could be argued that that book was a large influence in the creation of many anthro related comic book titles, including the much acclaimed Usagi Yojimbo, who got it's start within the pages of that comic.) May I also note that very short articles on the 'furry' comic titles of Furrlough, Wild Life, and Genus have Wikipedia articles, yet not comments that these would be best suited for Wikifur, when techincally since they do advertise themselves AS furry comics, it would make since that is where they belong. If it's a question of who publishes Extinctioners, would it be more relevent if it were published by Antartic Press, who I am ironically in negotiations to do just that? Evidence of it's continued production can be seen here: <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/" class="external free" title="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99828/</a> ,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/" class="external free" title="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/</a> , and <a href="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/" class="external free" title="http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/" rel="nofollow">http://www.furaffinity.net/full/99819/</a>. These are examples of pages currently in production for the next issue (Apologies for not adding shorting links, I'm not familiar with how to do that on these pages).</p>
<p>It is also stated that the reasons it would be better on Wikifur is because it already has an article done by someone on it, but may I also point out that many of Wikipedia subjects are repeated on Wikifur as well, such as the above stated articles on Antartic Press, Gold Digger, Atomic Mouse (also published by Shanda Fantasy Arts), and Furrlough to just give a brief example. Granted, one source may be more informative than the other depending on the individual who wrote them, however, I haven't seen complaints that one belongs on the other as I have with the Extinctioners article, which may now be on Wikifur, but was not as detailed as the one on wikipedia until the creator of the article just recently moved it there due to this complaint and deletion hearing. And if it is felt it is a bit 'heavy' for wikipedia due to it's amount of informative information about the characters, then I'd like to point out any of your other superhero article such as Justice League or X-Men related characters. The fact that so much information on each character can be found should be a testiment to just how much the individual who created the page has gotten from the comics and online sources. Perhaps if the creator trimmed down the amount of images in the article to just one per character it discusses that would be acceptable, though I'd like to point out these links: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-men</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Frost</a> as an example of an article with multiple images featuring a single character.</p>
<p>Or is the bottem line that because the book is published by an independent company rather than one of the mainstream companies it's validity as a wikipedia article is not as up to standard or is it it's content that makes it so (which again, I'll say again, if its due to the anthropomorphic cast that has been talked about in the article thus far is the issue, there are a number of human ones too, if humans make people less xenophobic). I do not say that Wikifur is a bad place, nor that I'm disturbed that an article on it has appeared there, but I as the creator, do not consider the comic furry anymore than the creator of Gold Digger or Ninja High School would just because they use anthropomorphic characters in their story telling. I hope that's not the case, because if someone decides to do an article on the currently acclaimed small press comic Mouse Guards, I hope it too won't be considered more appropriate to be a wikifur article because it's cast are anthropomorphic mice. 207.69.137.34Shawntae Howard</p>

<dd>Mr. Howard, My comment about this article being a bit heavy for the general WikiPedia has nothing to do with the fact that the article as it currently stands is primarily about the anthro/furry characters. Rather, it is about the sheer number of images, and the level of detail. The weight of the characters, for Ghu's sake? Date of birth in a non-standard year count (when is year 989?)</dd>
<dd>your pointing out Emma Frost as a comparison is partially invalid, as there is more text per picture, and the images are scattered throughout the text. In Extinctioners, once down into the character info, there is almost 50/50 text to image. I have also pointed the main author of the page toward some templates the Comic Project has that I thought might be useful. <a href="../../../v/i/k/User%7EVik-Thor_5caa.html" title="User:Vik-Thor">VikÞor</a> [[User talk:Vik-Thor|Talk]] 03:08, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> I'm a little bit disturbed, actually, that this entry is being contested on the grounds of popularity rather than factual validity or intellectual property. There are no certain stipulations in the Wikipedia policy that outline exactly how popular certain media or certain topics must be in order to justify their existence. I think the reasons for this are clear. Wikipedia would lose a lot of its intellectual appeal if it filtered articles on the grounds of popularity. An infrequently visited article isn't irrelevant, and no one can truly predict when a thread will be popular or unpopular. The other arguments for the removal of the Extinctioners entry seem to imply that the author of the article did not have permission of the creator, which he did (see Mr. Howard's entry) or that the article is being used as a 'marketing tool', an expression just as subjective as 'popularity'. If file space and/or bandwidth are the core issues behind the loosely used expressions I just stated, we can take steps to reduce image file size and streamline the article. However, this is likely not the issue since it was stated that the entry receives little traffic. I don't wish to slander anyone with claims of bias, but I can't help but think that irrational and emotional motives are governing some of the claims to remove this entry. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.174.54.67 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.174.54.67_0dda.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.174.54.67">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p><b>Keep</b>/<b>Clean up</b> The Comic is past it's peak but still very Notable in underground circles. I've seen Extinctioners Full sized Plushes, two video games, Custome Heroclicks, A role playing game, a Soundtrack and there are at least Two Spinoff comics, purhaps more I Havn't located yet. it's been featured by Diamond Preveiws twice, and it has several fanclubs that have dozens of members. It's very underground, and fans aren't totoaly organized but they DO number quite a bit. Shanda Fantasy Arts isn't "Next to Self-Publishing" Either. It's a private publishing group run by comic book insiders. its very small-print but well known in underground comic circles. They've worked with Stan Lee, Dan Decarlo and Stan Sakai in the past. Exticntioners IS well know, just in a diferent way. I say the article should be cleaned up for Wiki standards, IE Drop the extensive profiles and talk a bit more about the actual history of the comic rather than it's fiction. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Joshua the samurai (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Joshua_the_samurai_293a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Joshua the samurai">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<p><b>Keep</b> To Vik-Thor OH, well, that makes more sense then and gives some concrete information of what can be done to prevent the page's deletion. Now the page creator actually has something to go on, because before, one has to admit, the reasonings given for possible deletion were a little on the vague side. I will inform him to reduce the number of images and needless data then. Out of curiosity and personal noisiness, just why was the article nominated for deletion in the first place? What was the inital grounds or complaint in the first place? 207.69.137.13 Shawntae Howard</p>
<dl>
<dd>The first reason for deletion is the one right at the top of the list, under the big red box. Basically, it's a question of <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> as defined by the site guidelines.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 04:59, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><s><b>Keep</b></s>: Then I would assume that since it has been proven contrary to the point that the topic has more notability than originally thought and it has as much notability as other comics that currently have articles on wikipedia, that the issue for deletion, if that is afterall the primary reason for it's possible deletion, has been more than met? Again the latest issue of the comic was released in February 2006, it's next publication is in the current Diamond's Preview for release in August 2006, evidence presented in the form of links show that it has a very active online presence with an active fan base. And that it is considered a comic book first, not pigeon holed as a "furry comic". In addition, Extinctioners has gotten a full page review 3 yearas ago in The Comic Buyer's Guide and received a B rating and it is currently listed among other comics in the 2006 edition of the Overstreet Price Guide, currently available in any national book store such as Barnes and Noble or Borders.207.69.139.9 Shawntae Howard</p>

<dd>For the record, it's common practice to point out new or short-edit-count users in AfD discussions, because often they're being recruited to join the argument on the incorrect consideration that AfD is a vote, which it is <b>not</b>. Taking a poke at someone for doing what's pretty well standard procedure is not a good way to make an impression in an AfD discussion. Second, I'd like to point out that while the notability guidelines are just that, they're also the basis for keeping or deleting about every article of the hundred or so that hit AfD every day. Finally, I'm kind of trying to help *keep* the article, so I'm a bit upset that you'd suggest I'm doing something to not keep it.

<dd>What I'm trying to do is keep this discussion from going to hell, and while I do agree that Bwithh has been actively pointing out new editors and has made a couple of comments I'd rather he hadn't, arguing with him over it is basically counterproductive. As for notability, I'd suggest you take a look through the AfD pages for previous days and survey how many of them use 'NN' or 'non-notable' as an argument. Once again, I'm not against the article - I'm going to give it a rewrite this evening and try my best to save the damn thing.

<dd>As it has been pointed out its pretty standard to note new users and editors with a short history in an afd discussion (for similar reasons, we have the the warning sign template for this kind of situation). This practice doesn't break the good faith guideline. Anyway, I apologize if certain people feel offended at my occasional attempt at humour (I try not to be too serious all the time in the afd process). I'm not opposed to furry fan culture per se. I just feel that the hard work going into the Extinctioners article is more suited to a home on the excellent Wikifur project than in a general encyclopedia, in terms of notability etc. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 21:56, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hello:</p>
<p>My Log in Name is Lordgriffin, and yess I woudl like to talk about Extinctioners. i hope this is within the scope of what is permissible. I am currently a Major in military Inteligence deployed with the U.S. Army in Iraq, and I am a fan of teh comix.</p>
<p>Your service is gowing and known and it was quite extraordinary that you posted on extinctioners, and I admit i am a little distressed that you ight delet it. I do not know much about your administration but if tere is a large concern about content, it woudl seem a better policy, if yoru able, to screen these things BEFORE hand.</p>
<p>I thin what concernes me most is he way our society looks atthese policies, it is actually more accepted to write and draw about torture and murder, then it is to be suggestive about sexuality.</p>
<p>Your site is of course yours, I hope you will find Extinctioners DOES have a place here, but I recognize you will do what you consider best for your site</p>
<p>If allowed a Vote I vote to KEEP Extinctioners</p>

Apparently there is a <a href="http://www.confurence.com/infurnation/ifn9704.html" class="external text" title="http://www.confurence.com/infurnation/ifn9704.html" rel="nofollow">real Norman Fabian who is a furry fan who helped sponsor "Confurence 1997"</a> and there is a real 40-something US Army Major called Norman Fabian who has served with a unit guarding (and I guess, getting intelligence from) prisoners in <a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:6ybfyuQPv0QJ:www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/content/wire/v03/i2/0/TheWire-v3-i20-18Apr03.pdf+%22norman+fabian%22+guantanamo&amp;hl=en&amp;" class="external text" title="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:6ybfyuQPv0QJ:www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/content/wire/v03/i2/0/TheWire-v3-i20-18Apr03.pdf+%22norman+fabian%22+guantanamo&amp;hl=en&amp;" rel="nofollow">Guantanamo Bay</a> and in <a href="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:NVKTDTaBeB0J:www.detnews.com/2003/metro/0303/21/w07-114911.htm+%22norman+fabian%22+major&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us" class="external text" title="http://216.239.51.104/search?q=cache:NVKTDTaBeB0J:www.detnews.com/2003/metro/0303/21/w07-114911.htm+%22norman+fabian%22+major&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us" rel="nofollow">Iraq</a>. I'm willing to believe they're the same person. (I guess public declarations about furry sexiness don't fall under <a href="../../../d/o/n/Don%27t_ask%2C_don%27t_tell.html" title="Don't ask, don't tell">Don't ask, don't tell</a>.) <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:33, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Hokay. I've just taken a sledgehammer to the article to try and pound it into something that's much shorter and provides a general introduction to the comic that, if someone is interested, will lead them to the WikiFur article with much more detail. I hope everyone approves, and this hasn't been an hour of my time gone to waste.... <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Fox_d099.html" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> 01:01, 8 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, I am the guy who originally created the Wikipedia.org Extinctioners page, I am amazed and suprised that my page has not only recieved so much support to keep "alive" but from where and from whom, I am so glad that my page has been so well recieved that various people from nearly every corner of the globe has protested the deletion of the Extinctioners Wikipedia.org page and I would like to thank every one for their support and for those who are saddened by the current state of the Wikipedia.org page can find a somewhat better version at <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Extinctioners" class="external free" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Extinctioners" rel="nofollow">http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Extinctioners</a> which now has individual character pages (make sure you all check th bottom of the page for Extinctioners Characters)and I hope everyone likes it, now back to Lordgriffin, hope you and your friends like the Wikifur.com version and hope you and every one you know makes it out of Iraq in one piece, Good Luck and God speed from RVDDP2501 and from Barbados (home country)<a href="../../../r/v/d/User%7ERVDDP2501_a0bd.html" title="User:RVDDP2501">RVDDP2501</a> 10:22, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
