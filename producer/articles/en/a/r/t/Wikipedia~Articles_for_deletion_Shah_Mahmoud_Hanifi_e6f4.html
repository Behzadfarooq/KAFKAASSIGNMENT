<li><b>Keep</b> Many notable professors are not "full professors." By that comment I assume you to mean a "tenured professor." The academic market being so full of political and economic pressures has limited the number of tenured positions for professors. Also, it should be noted that Shah Hanifi's expertise is on Afghanistan and South Asian history, a subject for which there are only a handfull of American scholars. He was a student of professor <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Cole_474e.html" title="Juan Cole">Juan Cole</a> at the University of Michigan. He serves on the executive board of the American Institute of Afghanistan Studies centered at Duke University. For his ground-breaking work on inter-regional trade and colonial state formation in Afghanistan he won the 2004 E-Gutenberg Prize from the American Historical Association. The award is funded by the <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_W._Mellon_Foundation_0a39.html" title="Andrew W. Mellon Foundation">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Dr. Hanifi is also the Principal Investigator and Project Director for The Afghan Diaspora Remittance Project. Hanifi was selected for this prestigious position by <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Development_Bank_fe11.html" title="Asian Development Bank">Asian Development Bank</a>. The project was developed to estimate the amount and forms of human and material capital infusions from the Afghan diaspora to Afghanistan, and propose mechanisms to more efficiently and effectively attach that capital to development opportunities in Afghanistan. This project is aiding in the development of not only the economic stability of Afghanistan but in reducing the funding of terrorist activities in that state. <a href="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/aias/board.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jhfc.duke.edu/aias/board.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.historians.org/prizes/gutenberg/2004wins.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.historians.org/prizes/gutenberg/2004wins.cfm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> <a href="http://web.jmu.edu/history/index_fachonors.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://web.jmu.edu/history/index_fachonors.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 21:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The Wikiepdia "<a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">professor test</a>" is not directly linked to whether the person is tenured or not. It is part of the general Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">notability</a> policy. It is certainly possible that a case for notability can be made for Shah Mohmoud Hanifi, but you'll need to make it in the article using independent verifiable sources. If you can do this, I'd be happy to change my vote to <b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 22:02, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Gwernol - Check the Honors and Awards section. Instead of immediately deleting a page, perhaps you should check it out on your own time to determine if it is bunk. It is obvious that Dr. Hanifi is important to his academic field as he is virtually the ONLY person who discusses Afghanistan. *Warnerhw</p>

<dd>Ah, I see now. That is a good arguement but I don't feel that the professor is notable for only one connection to his work (the dissertation and the resulting award). His work, both academic and professional, is notable.
<dl>
<dd>I have changed my assertation to <b>merge</b> to reflect the recent changes to the article. I don't believe that the gentleman is notable enough to warrant his own article at this time, but information about him would be good to have in an article related to his area of expertise. The text could also use some more work to bring it towards NPOV, which I would like to help with if it is merged or kept. --<a href="../../../t/a/k/User%7ETakeel_bd6a.html" title="User:Takeel">Takeel</a> 15:47, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Response</b>. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> properly improved the article, resolved the notability question, and asked other editors to comment on whether his efforts were sufficient. This is entirely appropriate, and represents a positive contribution to the project. He should be applauded. You, on the other hand, slapped a deletion tag on article on an article whose main flaw was an imperfect assertion of notability, making no apparent effort to check on the accuracy of your non-notability claim or the verifiability of the assertion of notability. Now you're complaining because he's convinced other editors that you were wrong, and has brought together a consensus on the issue. Why do you think there's something wrong with that? You have, however, convinced me about who I should vote off this island . . . . <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:19, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Thank you Monicasdude for coming to my defense on this issue. I intended no such action of "vote stacking." The article was updated according to the criteria set forth in the discussion and I asked an editor to review their previous decision in light of new developments. No ill intentions were in that action and there nothing improper about it. I do not appreciate subtle personal attacks such as those being perpetrated by Schuminweb. As Monicasdude stated, there was little to no reason to put a deletion tag on this article in the first place. The proper action would have been to attempt to improve the article or request others to do further work on the article before attempting to delete it. I have elaborated on these points and Schuminweb's unwelcoming nature toward users attempting to contribute, in good gaith, to Wikipedia at <a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchuminweb_e3cb.html" title="User talk:Schuminweb">User_talk:Schuminweb</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStrothra_2b11.html" title="User:Strothra">Strothra</a> 03:47, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
