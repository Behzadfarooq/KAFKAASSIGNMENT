<p>Went through a AfD already, having a no consensus result. The article hasn't improved any, and in my opinion, continues to be worthless. I also feel that the previous AfD was too muddled by people's preset perceptions about Pokémon articles, fearing that cutting off one head would make it grow back a thousand-fold. Coolkat's accusations of sockpuppetry didn't help the matter any. With that in mind, I threw this back into AfD so we could reach a consensus, hopefully without wrongful impressions or accusations of sockpuppetry. <a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 23:54, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sarcastic but not really a personal attack.

<li><b>NPA:</b> Kappa has cast a couple of "delete" votes and "merge per (actual policy reference}" votes just in the last week. Not 100 percent "keep", although I suspect there have been months in 2005 where all Kappa's votes were "keep" or "keep or merge somewhere". More bothersome was the way so many were "keep all XXX" or "keep, real YYY" in ways that didn't correspond to WP policies nor precedents.

<li>A similar list (by the same author, to boot), Grudges in the Pokémon anime, was recently deleted, and no swarm of stubs took its place.

<li><b>Keep</b> Pieces of fiction do make cultural references, but the number of cultural references in some of them is staggering enough to warrant their own article, and I believe Pokémon is one of them, after looking through the list. Putting all of them in the <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a> article could make that article unnecessarily large and narrow down it's scope by putting too much focus on one part of the subject. <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 12:14, 23 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I personally frequent a Pokémon fan forum, and many people there who knows a lot about the animé can verify the information. Also, I see that many of the reasons brought up by the pro-deletion camp can be resolved by rewriting and expanding the article, something I'm prepared to do so. There are many other references not mentioned by the author; just go take a look at <a href="http://www.serebii.net/anime/movies/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.serebii.net/anime/movies/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. This shows that the article has potential for expansion. <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 09:07, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Another thing I wish to add: it seems like that Pokémon articles suffer from some sort of prejudice by many Wikipedians around here. Why is it that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> gets such a large, thorough article, with so many accompanying articles (including one article for each episode), while the similar-sized, if not larger <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon.html" title="Pokémon">Pokémon</a> franchise gets a considerably smaller article with less accompanying articles to boot? Also, think about the stubs; why is it that sometimes, there are several, countless stubs taking a place of a deleted Pokémon article? I feel that such a phenomon occurs because some useful articles that require only a cleanup or rewrite gets deleted by overzealous Wikipedians who see Pokémon as something triva. Deleting them is as good as dispersing the information into several different stubs, only to be brought together again, and then to go through another deletion process and the cycle repeats until a culture of fear of deletion surrounding Pokémon articles is created (let me stress that the last bit is my own personal observation). Instead, Pokémon articles which are large enough to warrant their own article, while stubs that have the potential to become one, should be expanded if the subject scope is wide enough, or to be merged with other stubs to form one article if it is not. <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 09:34, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"...who see Pokémon as something triva." This is trivia. NN, OR trivia. Do you see that "cultural references in..." can't not be OR (unless perhaps people have started writing theses about it)? <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarskell_ab5f.html" title="User:Marskell">Marskell</a> 09:51, 27 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then, on the same scale, should <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> be considered "triva" too? I'm also not sure what you are referring to as "triva" - is it Pokémon itself, or is it this article? <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> 10:33, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is a list of loosely associated topics, point #2 under "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information." Granted, it's factually debatable if this list fits that description, but if you absolutely need a policy cite, there you go.<br />
In reply to other comments, the idea of adding information to articles about movies, games, characters, places, etc. to increase their relevance to the real world, including links to pop culture or history, is a great one, and I would love to see (for example) <a href="../../../a/2E/k/User%7EA.K.R._4fbe.html" title="User:A.K.R.">A.K.R.</a> expand the heck out of the Pokémon movie articles; they need it, badly. I welcome any effort to lend greater context to Pokémon (or any other) articles.<br />
That said, <i>this particular list</i> is forever going to be unhelpful to those who want to learn how the Pokémon anime or movies are localized into English, because inherent to lists of trivia is a lack of description or overview. Most of what's here already should instead be an integrated part of the articles/list entries for the characters in question or movies in question, as examples reinforcing description of the subject. (For example, the fact that Ash turns down prune juice is in and of itself a useless fact, even with an explanation of the joke, but it would make a fine example to support a statement in <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a> along the lines of "Much of the humor in the English-language adaptation of the anime is the sort of mild, youth-oriented humor common to childrens' cartoons." (This is a crappy example, but you get my point.)<br />
This list is an example of <i>why</i> lists of trivia, either as standalone articles or as sections of larger articles, are unencyclopedic; they do not help the reader reach an encyclopedic understanding of the subject, but instead simply arm the reader with bits of data.<br />
If someone wants to rewrite <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pok%C3%A9mon_%28anime%29.html" title="Pokémon (anime)">Pokémon (anime)</a>, using examples from this list to explain how the Pokémon anime's English-language localization is Americanized, that would be absolutely fantastic. Barring that, this list is just a list of fannish factoids, un-linked-to, mostly obvious, largely contextless, and almost entirely valueless. The little information of value in this list belongs in (and, by and large, is already in) other articles. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 13:19, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
