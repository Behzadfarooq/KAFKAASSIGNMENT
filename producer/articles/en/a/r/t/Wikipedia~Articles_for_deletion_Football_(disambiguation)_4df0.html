<li>The <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> article itself serves as a better and more comprehensive disambiguation. <b>Weak delete.</b> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacrimosus_fbf6.html" title="User:Lacrimosus">calS</a> <a href="../../../l/a/c/User_talk%7ELacrimosus_a5c6.html" title="User talk:Lacrimosus"><small>!pu kaeps</small></a> 01:29, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> - the football article is a good disambiguation</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>, or else <b>delete</b>--easier by far to redirect, though. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 02:36, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> I have to agree, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> makes a good-enough disambig. --<a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKitch_5ab1.html" title="User:Kitch">Kitch</a> 03:39, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Nobody types in "Football (Disambiguation)"! But we need a football disambiguation page. So delete this current one, then: (1) create a new disamiguation page called <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a>, not <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28disambiguation%29.html" title="Football (disambiguation)">Football (disambiguation)</a>, then (2) Delete the current <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> page and merge its contents into a new page called Football (history and evolution) or something like that, and then (3) list it on the new disambiguation page along with <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football_%28soccer%29.html" title="Football (soccer)">Football (soccer)</a>, <a href="../../../a/m/e/American_football.html" title="American football">American football</a>, <a href="../../../r/u/g/Rugby_football.html" title="Rugby football">Rugby football</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Rules_football_3e0a.html" title="Australian Rules football">Australian Rules football</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/e/Gaelic_football.html" title="Gaelic football">Gaelic football</a>, and <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_football.html" title="Canadian football">Canadian football</a>.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a>. Quite why anyone would want to call a game where people toss an ellipsoid around with their hands "football", instead of a game where people kick a <b>ball</b> with their <b>feet</b>, is beyond me, but who am I to argue with the established convention? <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 06:32, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a></b>.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> - the first paragraph is a disambig. in all but name. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 09:28, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. There seems to be a stubborn misconception among fans of various codes of football that any other kind of "football" is an aberration. It's a generic term, get over it! <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 10:03, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And here was I thinking that football had something to do with feet and balls. Excuse me while I go call pub darts baseball. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 10:05, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The ball is (at least occasionally) kicked in every kind of football. In any case the word originally meant any game played "<i>on foot</i>" rather than on horseback, so kicking has nowt to do with it&#160;;-) <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 12:25, Apr 1, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After reading the argument below I'm changing my vote to <b>redirect</b>, so we can avoid this situation in future.<a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 02:41, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, unnecessary. Football already has an existing dab page. I don't think a redirect is necessary - I can't imagine anyone bothering to type in "Football (disambiguation)" just to find "Football". <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 13:27, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> there are other instances where <i>foo</i> is a disambig page with <i>foo (disambiguation)</i> redirecting there. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:52, 1 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's probably because in those cases (a) the disambiguation article was merged into the top article, and thus has to exist as a redirect to satisfy the GFDL; (b) the disambiguation page was moved (back) to the top article and the resultant redirect simply not deleted; or (c) the other pages use the {{otheruses}} template, which doesn't work with equal weight (type 2) <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguations</a> without such a trick being employed. There are no such requirements here. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:58, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's a pointless disambiguation page that nothing links to (apart from some 2003 talk pages where this idea was mooted and rejected) and that no-one will use. <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> <i>already is</i> the disambiguation. The 2003 talk page arguments on this very subject (<a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_footballers_%28archive_1%29_4832.html" title="Talk:List of footballers (archive 1)">Talk:List of footballers (archive 1)</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_footballers_%28soccer%29_%28archive_2%29_7167.html" title="Talk:List of footballers (soccer) (archive 2)">Talk:List of footballers (soccer) (archive 2)</a>) are worth reading, as is the name change discussion at <a href="../../../f/o/o/Talk%7EFootball_91b5.html" title="Talk:Football">Talk:Football</a>; and the resulting development of <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> over the intervening two years indicates a clear consensus. No merge is required. No redirect is required, except perhaps to stop someone doing this in another 2 years' time, which is unlikely given that the dangling redlinks only exist in archived talk pages, there's plenty of prior talk page discussion on the subject, and a disambiguation structure <i>is already in place</i>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:58, 2005 Apr 1 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This page was only created on March 29 2005, long after the consensus on <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> had been reached, and despite the existing disambiguation page as you outlined; it has been plainly demonstrated that in the absence of anything, a user can create this page despite the existing consensus. Redirects are cheap. One here would stop us having to go through the same discussion in 2 years' time. <a href="../../../q/w/g/User%7EQwghlm_a374.html" title="User:Qwghlm">Qwghlm</a> 02:23, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> disambiguation pages should not actually say "(disambiguation)". <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 01:10, 2005 Apr 3 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes they should. Well, type 3 disambiguations anyway. Please read the info at <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">Wikipedia:disambiguation</a>. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"></a> — <font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 09:22, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, point taken, but having read this info this would only apply in some specific circumstances which do not apply here. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 21:05, 2005 Apr 4 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">Football</a> is too big. Think of the people with modem connections! Fix the disambig page adding all football variants, instead of deletion. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrue_d9a8.html" title="User:Grue">Grue</a> 06:44, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are there any Wikipedia which are significantly slow to d/l? I had a slow modem connection until recently (about 40k) and it didn't greatly impede me writing a significant proportion of the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Football.html" title="Football">football</a> page. Or contributing to even longer articles which have more pictures. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrant65_6b0f.html" title="User:Grant65">Grant65</a> <a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrant65_a485.html" title="User talk:Grant65">(Talk)</a> 10:17, Apr 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>
