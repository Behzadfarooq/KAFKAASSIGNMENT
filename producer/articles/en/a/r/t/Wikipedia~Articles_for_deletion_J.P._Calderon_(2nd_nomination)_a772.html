<p>This is the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_J.P._Calderon_2fa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/J.P. Calderon">second afd</a> for this article. I believe it should be deleted because the person is not notable and for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It fails several parts of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>:
<ol>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>) - <i>Nope</i></li>
<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person - <i>All of the interviews were mandatory Survivor interviews conducted because of his Survivor involvement, not because of his self notability</i></li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ol>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a>, <a href="../../../g/q/_/GQ_8d36.html" title="GQ">GQ</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/ELLE_7ea6.html" title="ELLE">Elle</a>, <a href="../../../f/h/m/FHM_6b72.html" title="FHM">FHM</a> or national newspapers. - <i>The only articles cited are mandatory interviews that come automatically after elimination. Meaning that none of the interviews were conducted because of his notability. And, the Calgary Sun is hardly a national newspaper.</i></li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following - <i>No indication of that</i></li>
<li>An independent biography - <i>Not much of a biography</i></li>
<li>Name recognition - <i>They didn't even tell his last name on Survivor</i></li>
<li>Commercial endorsements - <i>None indicated</i></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>He fails of the criteria listed there, as well, will anyone really find such a page necessary in 100 years. A google search yielded <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22J%2eP%2e+Calderon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22J%2eP%2e+Calderon%22" rel="nofollow">20,200 results</a>, but compare this with Sekou Brunch (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Sekou+Bunch%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Sekou+Bunch%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">20,700 results</a>) and Cecilia Mansilla (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Cecilia+Mansilla%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Cecilia+Mansilla%22" rel="nofollow">32,100</a>) who were both voted out before J.P. and compare this with the people from CI that do have pages: Jonathan Penner (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Penner%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Jonathan+Penner%22" rel="nofollow">73,500</a>) , Ozzy Lusth (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Ozzy+Lusth%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Ozzy+Lusth%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">79,000</a>), Becky Lee (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Becky+Lee%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=WZPA%2CWZPA%3A2006-36%2CWZPA%3Aen&amp;q=%22Becky+Lee%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">54,500</a>) and Yul Kwon (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Yul+Kwon%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=WZPA,WZPA:2006-36,WZPA:en&amp;q=%22Yul+Kwon%22" rel="nofollow">105,000</a>), so how does that make him a stand out?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Precedent has already been set that merely being in Survivor is not enough for a page. See the afds for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Candice_Woodcock_e550.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Candice Woodcock">Candice Woodcock</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Keith_Famie_5b7f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Keith Famie">Keith Famie</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Kathy_Vavrick-O%27Brien_4a6d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien">Kathy Vavrick-O'Brien</a></li>
<li>I looked at that Volleyball article, and very few of them have pages, not even the two players who the article claims were the top ranked in 2005. Precedent has already been established for Survivor articles, and if not even the top ranked AVP players have pages, then the main reason for his page is JDMA, which he hasn't done anything of note in, and by the way, none of the contestants from that article have individual pages, not even JDs page is linked from there.</li>
<li>Most of the articles cited are merely standard interviews that every ex Survivor gives once being voted , meaning that every single Survivor contestant has similar pages, and yet these were admissable in previous afds.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The nominator misunderstands "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person".

<li>The admin responded to the message you left on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:W.marsh#J.P._Calderon" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:W.marsh#J.P._Calderon" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> <i>eleven minutes after the AfD closed</i> by saying "Sure, you can technically re-nominate whenever you want, <b>but it's best to present new evidence/arguments if you nominate again immedietly, not just "go for round two" of AfD and rehash the old discussion.</b> Most people would suggest <b>waiting at least a month</b> for re-nominating if there's no compelling new evidence to present." (emphasis added). Your new nomination is largely a copy and paste from the previous AfD, not new evidence, compelling or otherwise.</li>
<li>The admin also directed you to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a> which says in relevant part "By long tradition, the consensus opinion of the community about an article's disposition is held virtually sacrosanct, and may not be overturned or disregarded lightly. Sometimes, however, users disagree with the consensus opinion arrived at in the AFD quite strongly. What can you do if you disagree with the consensus opinion? First, it is a good idea to try to understand why the community made its decision. You may find that its reasoning was sensible. However, if you remain unsatisfied with the consensus decision, there are a few options open to you.</li>
<li>"If you think that an article was wrongly <i>kept</i> after the AFD, you could wait to see if the article is improved to overcome your objections; if it isn't, you can renominate it for deletion. If and when you do renominate, be careful to say why you think the reasons proffered for keeping the article are poor, and why you think the article must be deleted." Rather than wait to see if the article could be improved to answer your objections, you re-nominated the article just 37 minutes after the first AfD closed.</li>
<li>Your conduct regarding this article has been questionable from the start. You redirected it twice to <a href="../../../c/o/o/Survivor%7E_Cook_Islands_f5fe.html" title="Survivor: Cook Islands">Survivor: Cook Islands</a>. You attempted to orphan it by repeatedly removing the link to it from both that article and <a href="../../../s/u/r/Template%7ESurvivor_contestants_792f.html" title="Template:Survivor contestants">Template:Survivor contestants</a>, including removing it from the template once under the subterfuge of performing other cosmetic maintenance. For whatever reason, you do not have any critical distance from this article. I have asked you repeatedly to take a step back from it. I will ask you to do so again and request that this AfD be closed. I imagine that you will fell compelled to respond to this message by arguing or pointing out some of my actions regarding this article. Do so if you must but I still encourage you to take a step back. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:34, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your conduct regarding this article from the time it was written is very relevant to this nomination. The <i>actual</i> response <i>in context</i> of the administrator you asked about re-nominating this article, whose response you then point to as justification for your campaign, is very relevant to this nomination. Your failure to take that advice to heart by copying and pasting the argument that couldn't win you a deletion the last time without offering any new or compelling evidence in support of the nomination is very relevant to this nomination.

<li>I have questioned your <i>conduct</i>. If you choose to take questioning your <i>conduct</i> as an attack on you personally, that's your unfortunate choice. I have already defended this article repeatedly at the previous AfD. This second nomination has nothing to do with the article itself and everything to do with the motivation of the person who nominated it. You have displayed a strong bias against this article since it was created. This nomination is nothing but a continuation of your attempt to enforce your bias. You may very well be acting within the letter of the rules but your taking refuge within the letter doesn't change the fact that you're acting outside their spirit. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 12:30, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually, your faith <i>is</i> in question here, as indicated by my questioning it and Otto's comment above. So yes, we're questioning whether you are in fact simply biased against the article because you didn't receive the consensus you wanted this week.</dd>
<dd>One more thing - the other afds mentioned regarding other contestents seem to indicate they had a lack of published references.

I agree with others saying that he should not be included just because he was on Survivor, but it seems to me his collection of work merit mention, at least at this time, I say lets revisit this in 6 months to a year to see if this is still the case. <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsRedShirt_0fad.html" title="User:EnsRedShirt">EnsRedShirt</a> 01:28, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm sure WP doesn't want this type of article creep, and even if those that have been editing this for a while don't add them, the existence of the J.P. page will likely embolden newer users to create pages for all the other contestants. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 14:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that Survivor contestent articles should be handled consistently. If other contestents have similar references to this one, they should be treated the same way. Unreferenced articles should be deleted. I don't have a problem, though, with articles that are otherwise referenced by multiple published articles about the subject being kept. I've never watched Survivor, personally, but if that stance means more Survivor contestents have articles, then more power to them. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 17:08, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, the only Survivor contestants that get a lot of post-show recognition (and thus pages with a lot of info) are those that made it to the final 4, and specifically those that also appeared in All-Stars (not mutually exclusive sets). So about 25% of the contestants have pages. This means about 150 more paged will be made, with rather simple statements like "John Q Smith was a contestant on Survivor Alaska. He is from Anytown, USA, and is a part time editor" with otherwise minimal backup. This makes the information pretty much duplicate what is already on the CBS website and fan sites for these contestants. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 00:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To quickly reply, 1) this particular article does not simply say "he was a contestent on Survivor from Anytown USA". It's quite a bit lengthier than that. If a <i>different</i> article about a Survivor contestent appears that is little more than a one or two sentence stub, then that can obviously be safely deleted. That's not the case for this afd though. 2) I don't really see a problem with duplicating information that also happens to appear on another website. In fact, since Wikipedia isn't a primary source, <i>all</i> the material in Wikipedia has already supposedly been published before and is available elsewhere. Thus duplication with a fan site isn't a problem, and in fact would be the norm for all articles about anything in pop culture. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:14, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree that the JP article, in of itself, isn't bad and if it weren't for being a Survivor contestant (like 200+ other people) I'd not have the issue; it's just, again, if a new user that doesn't see this discussion but sees that JP (a early outted player with a few wikifiable and links that could be added), they may try to make similar pages for any other Survivor contestant with even less notability. As a counter-/co-example, <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Jon_Drinkard_98d9.html" title="Bobby Jon Drinkard">Bobby Jon Drinkard</a> is article for another Survivor contestant. This article has no biographical info, and mearly is a restating of the information of the main Survivor season articles he was in. I'd strongly suggest that be up for deletion. Then there's Gregg Carey, where the bulk of the article is based on Survivor season info, and has a tiny tiny bio line as well. That's the murky water I'm concerned about: is that page notable or not? --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasem_8b9e.html" title="User:Masem">Masem</a> 18:45, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If, as you say, you don't consider this article to be too bad and wouldn't have an issue aside from the fact that he was a Survivor contestent, then <i>this</i> article should be kept. If someone else write another article about a different contestent, and <i>that</i> article has no biographical info or lacks references, etc, then <i>that</i> article should be deleted. We have to consider the articles individually in terms of their published references and whether or not the article is simply a stub with little to no information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 19:47, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just a note for those interested, this seems to be the exact same debate that's going on right now over at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stephen_Colbert_Day_f041.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Colbert Day">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stephen Colbert Day</a>. Basically it's an argument as to whether or not having sources automatically makes something/somebody notable enough to warrant an article. The same as how there are dozens of news articles this week about "Stephen Colbert Day" and some people there don't believe that it makes the "holiday" (celebrated only in one small town of Ontario) notable enough for an encyclopedia, people here don't believe that having a few interviews published about you in relation to a reality TV series doesn't make you notable enough for the encyclopedia. Anyway, just an interesting parallel I noticed, it'll also be interesting to see if both AfDs go the same way or not. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 17:25, 31 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Mael, I don't think both have to go the same way as I agree Stephen Colbert Day is about as notable as Bradmas, but I don't think that sources making something notable is at issue here as much as one persons vendetta versus a certain article, and how many people must think of an article notable before it is notable enough to warrant inclusion in the pedia. This person is obviously notable to a certain segment of the population even if he is not notable to you me or scorpion. Why is our non notability of him a reason to delete the article? There are 1.6 million + articles on the pedia now I doubt that I will ever see most of them, does that mean they should be deleted because they are not notable to everyone?? Of course not. <a href="../../../e/n/s/User%7EEnsRedShirt_0fad.html" title="User:EnsRedShirt">EnsRedShirt</a> 19:20, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you're going by recognition, then I'd guess that the millions of people who've watched the Colbert Report in the past week or two would say Stephen Colbert Day is a bit more recognizable than the dozens of people who've heard of Bradmas.&#160;;-) And on the same grounds, I'd bet that a lot more people watch Colbert Report and remember the discussions about SCD than there are that watched Survivor and remember some guy that was only on the show for a couple weeks, didn't do anything apparantly notable or memorable, and then left to go join another reality show with a much smaller fan base. But from what I saw on this and the last AfD, most people weren't judging based on whether or not they recognized or remembered the guy (since everybody has different experiences, that's hard to judge), but they were instead judging on how many references there were to news articles about him. Now, the SCD article is up for AfD on the opposite grounds, that even though there are a lot of news articles about it, it's not innately notable (which is a similar argument that I'd made on the previous AfD here). And if SCD isn't innately notable (when it was mentioned several times on a highly rated nighttime show), then I have trouble seeing JP as innately notable (when he was only on 3 episodes of a highly rated reality series) as well. Just my thoughts... --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 19:49, 31 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If it makes you feel better, Mael, I'd probably recommend keeping the SCD article <i>if</i> it is properly referenced and doesn't comfortably fit within the text of Colbert's main article. I have no problem with well referenced articles about subjects that receive coverge from multiple published sources being kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:25, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S. After reviewing the SCD article, I notice it actually <i>doesn't</i> have good references in the article. So in fact I'd probably recommend only keeping if adequate references could be provided within the article. It needs a good reference clean up to be kept. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, your motivation in nominating this article immediately after its previous AfD closed matters a great deal to this nomination. Bad faith in the nomination process matters a great deal. The history of the nominator in relation to the nominated article matters a great deal.

<li><b>Keep</b> I believe this article should be kept. Sure, he was one of many, many people to be on Survivor, and creating an individual page for each of them <i>would</i> be pointless and waste bandwidth. However, He <i>IS</i> notable for more than just being a minor contestant on Survivor. He was/is featured on more than one reality show (and heavily featured on JDMA), both very popular on their respective networks. His appearance in Instinct magazine, in which he and his sexuality and coming out were the cover story, IS reason for inclusion in Wikipedia, under gender/sexuality issues, not to mention that it is a non self-authored print article included in a nationally circulated publication, which supports inclusion as well. I have a feeling that some of those who oppose Calderon's entry in Wikipedia are doing so due to his sexuality, as per the comment above about "Buy the magazine, go to a bathroom somewhere, and get over your obsession". Please, let's be a little more adult about disgreements. Some people may be arguing for his inclusion because they're "fans", but there are very legitimate claims for keeping this article, and personal dislike of Calderon, for whatever reason, should not not enter into the discussion as long as it is a rational one. <a href="../../../b/o/u/User%7EBounti76_115a.html" title="User:Bounti76">Bounti76</a> 14:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
