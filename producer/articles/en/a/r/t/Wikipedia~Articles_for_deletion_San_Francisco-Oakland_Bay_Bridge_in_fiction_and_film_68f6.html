<li><b>Delete.</b> The set of entries in the article is very weak and does not make a case for this bridge having much importance in film or fiction. Furthermore, none of the entries is sourced, and the article completely fails to meet the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 19:40, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I created this page when working on getting <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_e5fc.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</a> to FA status. The criticism was that the section was not long enough or thorough enough. Frankly, I'm interested in bridges, and not particularly interested in how bridges appear in fiction and film. I knew that this subject was potentially huge, and I really did not want it to clutter up the article about the bridge, nor did I want to research it any further. So I split it off. I don't think this article is harmful, and I would <i>not</i> like to see this information added back to the parent, I'd also hate to see the parent stripped of its FA status because this information was not covered more thoroughly. Therefore, I hope it will be kept. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 06:54, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I do have to agree that you have a lot of good content in this article, but I feel it would be best if it was inserted into <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_e5fc.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</a>. I feel that a landmark's references in fiction is not quite notable enough for its own article, and this article is also short enough to easily fit into that article. Thanks for your consideration. --<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarrison_V_6407.html" title="User:Harrison V">Harrison V</a> 13:27, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is notable, and it does not belong in <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_e5fc.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</a>. That would add too much to the article, and it appears that it was already taken out with good reason during its FA process. --<font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 20:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Merge</b>. I looked at a few other notable structures and nearly all have a "in film" or "in fiction" or "in popular culture" section; seems appropriate for this as well. I note we do have an article <a href="../../../s/k/y/Skyscrapers_in_film.html" title="Skyscrapers in film">Skyscrapers in film</a>, and perhaps moving the content to begin a <a href="../../../b/r/i/Bridges_in_film.html" title="Bridges in film">Bridges in film</a> article wouldn't be a bad idea but we'd have to get a few others to make the article less Bay-Bridge centric. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 23:20, 28 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It should not have been nominated for deletion where a mergeto tag suffices, in my opinion. In any case, I favor moving popular culture references out of major articles in most cases. The main article is 32 kilobytes long. Consider moving the article to San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in culture, a shorter, more inclusive title. <a href="../../../w/s/i/User%7EWsiegmund_987c.html" title="User:Wsiegmund">Walter Siegmund</a> <a href="../../../w/s/i/User_talk%7EWsiegmund_d6d9.html" title="User talk:Wsiegmund">(talk)</a> 20:14, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would be agreeable to this. This is not the only article that was split off of the Bay Bridge article, there is also <a href="../../../e/a/s/Eastern_span_replacement_of_the_San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_730e.html" title="Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge">Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge</a>. Now if anything is to be merged back into the article it should be the eastern span replacement, and NOT the cultural stuff. Deleting <a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco-Oakland_Bay_Bridge_in_fiction_and_film_359a.html" title="San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in fiction and film">San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in fiction and film</a> will not make all the cultural references go away. They will all end up added back to the main article, to the detriment of the main article. You can fight the things that people add to Wikipedia, or find a better place for them. Having all the curtural stuff cluttering up the article puts too much emphasis on the cultural stuff. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuelWantman_9090.html" title="User:SamuelWantman">Samuel Wantman</a> 21:30, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>.
