<p>This article violates the policies of this project on so many levels. It’s a quotations farm and this project <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. Too many quotes and very small amount of discussion is non-encyclopedic and could be a copyright violation even if citations are included. Also, some things implied in the text are not found in the reference cited if you carefully check. Its topic is inherently pov and right now the article is too heavily focused on the Afrocentric pov. It has been singularly edited by <a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">User:Enriquecardova</a> who is more or less intent on proving that Egypt was originally a Black African civilization and that it only later changed its racial makeup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=92948010&amp;oldid=92924068" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=92948010&amp;oldid=92924068" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=93093834&amp;oldid=93093151" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=93093834&amp;oldid=93093151" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. I’m sure other people can come and point to other evidence. If you check out prior versions of this article, you’ll get an entirely different picture. It’s an endless debate and seems inherently pov however you slice it.</p>
<p>I noticed that the article noted the controversy in its title before, so I tried to change it back but he kept edit warring about it, claiming it’s not really a controversy even though the quotes he added to the article are all laced with a controversial tone. How can it not be a controversy, just have a look at the talk page? The article is basically a long polemic that doesn’t add to the encyclopedic value of the project. See “silly debate” comment <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93045708" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=93045708" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> No respectable encyclopedia has an article about the racial controversy of anything. I think the article should be deleted and some of the information merged with <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrocentrism.html" title="Afrocentrism">Afrocentrism</a> and the genuine information can be integrated with general articles.

<li><b>Keep and use other avenues of dispute resolution</b> This article has an established version history before the current dispute:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;oldid=90564004" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Controversy_over_racial_characteristics_of_ancient_Egyptians&amp;oldid=90564004" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The topic does seem to be encyclopedically valid (though of course controversial). I don't see a need to bring the dispute to afd. User:Nebkaneil should try a <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">Request for Comment</a> and perhaps appeal for the involvement of <a href="../../../e/g/y/WP%7EEGYPT_e6e9.html" title="WP:EGYPT">WP:EGYPT</a> members to generate consensus. Another path would be to ask for <a href="../../../p/r/_/WP%7EPR_690c.html" title="WP:PR">Peer Review</a> of the article. <a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">User:Enriquecardova</a> is an enthusiastic and prolific newcomer to Wikipedia who has made many knowledgeable contributions in his limited time so far. The amount of focus and ambition I've noticed that he brings to articles he's interested in is admirable (and also may be inadvertently a little intimidating for other users). Judging by his Amazon.com reviews and political blog comments, he is also quite opinionated. This is of course fine in itself, though perhaps he should take the time to familiarize himself more with Wikipedia guidelines such as <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. While most newcomers aren't that familiar with guidelines at a comparative stage, most newcomers haven't jumped into article editing with so much effort either. Anyway, I don't think this is one for AFD <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:41, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it was agreed that the article should be based on an established version and give only an overview about the history, concepts and the people involved in this controversy, then there should not be an attempt to prove one view or the other... Race is not a scientific concept, therefore it's impossible to prove in an objective way what "race" Egyptians were. Nor should it be a lengthy declaration of quotes about whatever findings/facts/claims some editors believe to have to support their position. I still think that this version should be set up for deletion and the legitimate information should go to Ancient Egypt topics. Nebkaneil 02:38, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Yes keep this article.

This user's writing style is familar to one I have encountered before, and I believe he is hiding behind this one as a front.</b> But regardless of what bogus user names he or she hides under, his or her assorted claims are baseless. He charges:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Too many quotes------- Such quotes are there for a specific reason. Due to the controversial nature of the subject, it is necessary for readers to determine for themselves exactly what scholars in the field say, rather than read endless unsubstantiated arguments and undergo endless edit wars. Indeed thisi s part and parcel of the topic. It is controversial, and as a result, readers need to know exactly who said what, and where it can be verified.</dd>
<dd>Copyright violations------ It would be nice if user "Nebkaneil" or whatever current name is being used would provide some evidence. But of course, none is forthcoming. If there are any of these mysterious violations, they can always be corrected.</dd>
<dd>POV----- This is laughable. In fact the whole article deals with different points of view, and how they stack up against the evidence. We have Afrocentrists, manstream Egyptologists, critics like Mary Leftkowitz, neutrals who want to move away from race in anthropology, and other shades in between. They are discussed in the article.</dd>
<dd>Article different than before--------- lol. gosh... of course itis different than before. Its called Wikipedia.... and its called adding citations and scholarship. Ina ny event about 90% of the original information before the citations were addedis still there, even the King Tut picture, which by the way, sure looks like a "copyright violation." But I notice user "Nebkaneil" has nothing to say about that.</dd>
<dd>User Cardova "out to prove" certain things--- Actually, if their is any bias in the article, it is the opposite of what is charged. The bias toward the mainstream view, which sees Egypt as having a range of types, and which Afrocentrics attack as "racist." Indeed this is precisely why it is important to quote- so users get an idea of what is being said by "mainstream" scholars, rather than the common charge of "conspiracy" or "racism" thrown around by people dealing with this topic. As can be seen by quotes from Leftkowtiz and a mainstream Egyptologist like Yurco, the general consensus is that Egypt had a range of types that should not be pigeonholded. But then again, you would never know this if it were'nt for those "citations." Other have a different take, or a different angle. Other disagree. But that is scholarship.</dd>
<dd>As for redirects------- I requested that the redirector provide substantive reasoning to support the request to redirect rather than blanket statements of "controversy". To date, nothing substantive has been forthcoming, just arbitrary moves.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>----------------- I think user "Nebkaneil" or whatever alias he is currently using is related to one user, who was pushing a more "Aryan" point of view. When challenged to provide his data, he could not, but backed off. This is indeed ironic. One thing the article shows is just how bankrupt such "Aryan" points of view are. Bankrupt of both data and clear thinking, his next step is to go the "administrative" route, rather than conduct a robust debate. Following this will be vandalism, and edit wars. Of course, these will simply be reverted or adjusted as needed, and no doubt an assortment of Afrocentric supporters or even 'Aryans" can be rounded up to pile in. It would be nice if people did not have to resort to such vandalism, or bogus "administrative" requests. It might be necessary to request that the article be locked in view of such tactics, since more detailed information is being added in the weeks to come.<a href="../../../e/n/r/User%7EEnriquecardova_b15b.html" title="User:Enriquecardova">Enriquecardova</a> 01:29, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> but go through RfC and edit mercilessly to correct the POV and to remove any copyvios in the paragraph long quotes, and to cite without all the cut and paste. This reads like an essay from the period a few years ago when Afrocentric educators tried to push the POV that Clepoatra was black as were all the ancient Egyptian Pharoahs, that the Egyptians used electricity, that they flew around in gliders, and a host of other absurdities aimed at instilling racial pride in minority students in the U.S. . The question of their racial characteristics is encyclopedic, and can be addressed based on paintings in tombs and via physical anthropology based on bone structure, and historically based on the writings of ancient observers. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 16:52, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Complete cleanup and overhaul</b>. Make sure the article clearly states that the leading scholarly belief is that the ancient Egyptians were of a multi-racial/Semitic appearance. There's no good reason to believe that the Middle East and North Africa were populated with Black people just a few thousand years ago unless someone can come up with a plausible explanation for what caused such a rapid demographic change. (I called a Black Studies teacher on this one and he couldn't.) As with the <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_of_Jesus_a3f3.html" title="Race of Jesus">Race of Jesus</a>, claims that the ancient Egyptians were of a Northern-European appearance are clearly ridiculous, but claims that they were of a Sub-Saharan-African appearance are *just as ridiculous*.

<p>A nearly unintelligible article on a fictional "creature" that seems be something the creator <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>. The article puts forth no creditable claim of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and, being a amateur construct, has no <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> outside the creator's personal website.

<li><b>Commet:</b> Honeymade, have you read the notability guideline I linked? If you have I don't understand how this can be seen as anything but "something made up one day". You're right, Wikipedia is not a place for obscure porn stars, see <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORN_f7cd.html" title="WP:PORN">WP:PORN</a>. If you see pornstars that are featured here that do not meet that criteria then by all means prod or AfD those articles. Most minor comicbook characters are included in their parent comicbook articles or in a list. Those that don't fail <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. Again, if you see any violations of this feel free to prod or AfD them. Another important feature that distinguishes those aformentioned articles is that they have been <i>published</i>. This, on the other hand, is a pure amateur creation that is being advertised on wikipedia that has no interest to people outside a particular subculture (cruft). The people in that subculture can find this information at other more appropriate places such as the creator's webstie, fansites and dedicated wikis such as WikiFur. Violations of wikipedia policies and those policies' guidelines do not set a precedent for continued violation. I would recommend you review <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoFreak_0f0c.html" title="User:NeoFreak">NeoFreak</a> 03:42, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The existence of fan fiction on this subject demonstrates a 'cult following' though, which is a criteria for notability. I would also challenge you to name another fictional species which has achieved this level of popularity (or greater) or caused the creation of this amount and quality of work (not of creator origin) without being backed by a major publishing house or broadcasting organization. If you cannot, and no one else can, then that makes the species notable all by itself. ANTIcarrot 14:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fan fiction isn't a source, period; at least not in terms of any <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> guideline I've ever read. We're talking published, independent, reliable sources.

<li>The notability guidelines require the topic (chakats) to be the subject of multiple non trivial works (novels and very expensive art) whose sources (people who created the works) are independent of the subject itself (and its creator). The guidelines go on to say that 'published works' is a very broad category not limited to the examples given. If it was limited to those categories then wikipedia itself (being non published) would be a trivial source- which is blatant nonsense. If you wish to exclude all material that is only published online then you still have to deal with the large amount of paper artwork that has been created on this topic. To my knowledge wikipedia offers no guidence for notabilty of artwork, but the shear quantity and quality produced makes it non trivial. ANTIcarrot 14:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b> or <b>slight merge</b>. I've found myself involved with some of these furry AfDs lately (I'm going back to writing mycology taxa articles soon, I swear), not out of any remote personal interest in the concepts, but rather in the AfD process. At times, material that <i>could</i> meet our standards reaches AfD because the articles <i>don't</i>: they are poorly written, in a genre perceived as "crufty", and little effort is made to appropriately reference or verify the content (even by its supporters!). That said ... I cannot find multiple, independent, non-trivial sources here. There are no shortage of trivial mentions: art categories, furcode references, one-line references in FAQs. The term is well-attested in the print-medium fanzine South Fur Lands, but that is not independent of the creator; the self-published and ultra-minor press material likewise. It <i>is</i> discussed in the webzine Anthro (#6), but that's not enough to support an article. Nevertheless, the term seems to have some cultural currency. Perhaps it can be merged as a brief mention in another article, such as a mention in<a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a> that roleplaying charcters—on which a stubby section already exists—might include "anthropormorphic animals (such as rabbits, foxes, or wolves), mythological creatures (centaurs, dragons, and the like), or fan-created species (including the quadrupedal feline aliens called chakats)". <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:56, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</s> -- change in suggestion, see below</li>

<dd>This is a false argument. Pretty much every modern fantasy book on the book shelves contains elements from Lord of the Rings, but that does not make them fanfiction. <i>All writing works that way for all genres.</i> Furry simply tends to be a little more honest about it. The two (story) sources are relevant as they mark the turning point where the chakat setting stopped belonging to its creator and became 'open source'. Information to this effect exists on the chakats den. At that point fanfiction as a term no longer has any relevant meaning. (And point of note, specifying 'furry fanfiction' like that is not needed. Fanfiction is fanfiction. Specifying specific types can sound prejudicial and non-neutral.) ANTIcarrot 23:35, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> OK, I think I'm understanding the deeper issues here, (which really don't involve the notability of Chakats for WP), apparently (correct me if I'm wrong) the mainstream furry fans (the folks who like ordinary furry things such as <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion_King_5b05.html" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a> and <a href="../../../d/o/g/Dogs_Playing_Poker_dce3.html" title="Dogs Playing Poker">Dogs Playing Poker</a>) aren't too hip on hermaphroditic feline centaurs, whilst the more extreme furry-lifestylers and yiffy crowd don't see Chakats as overtly sexual <i>enough</i>, then apparently there's some personal issues between the "owners" of the articles as well. Thus all the protestations about the notability of Chakats in furry fandom, which really isn't pertinent to this AfD (the question here is solely whether the article meets WP guidelines). Anyway, the <a href="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Chakat" class="external text" title="http://furry.wikia.com/wiki/Chakat" rel="nofollow">Chakat article on Wikifur</a> is pretty much the same as the WP one, so the transwiki-ing is a done deal at this point. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 08:14, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

Wikifur is the better place for the in-universe detail, barring notability-standards coverage of the concept at some future time. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 09:01, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Kudos:</b> Wow man. I was about to say that article was on my hit list too but you've done some <i>great</i> work to it. It's a million times better. I'm still not sure that the "Chakat" belongs there because that sets an example for anyone that creates a fictional creature or comic book/fan art to add their creation to wikipedia. Still a violation of the <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> notability guideline even though it does not have its own article.

But as for chakat and the <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> issue... I'm torn. On one hand, as far as fictional creatures go, its certainly not centaur, or even <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drider.html" title="Drider">drider</a>. On the other hand, there are a ton of Google hits (conflated with some foreign language issues, admittedly). The material has seen publication in several fanzines (South Fur Lands, Fur Plus at least), and a serial-format (more or less) self-published book that got reviewed by webzine Anthro <a href="http://www.anthrozine.com/revw/rvw.patten.06.html#transformations" class="external text" title="http://www.anthrozine.com/revw/rvw.patten.06.html#transformations" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

I don't know how happy the furry fanatics are going to be about cutting the article down to one sentence, but that one sentence wraps up about all that is encyclopedic about Chakats, IMO.

<li>My mentioning of verifiability was in direct relation to Shewolff's "proof" about Chakats being used in classrooms being a personal experience involving her son. That instance, even if true, is impossible to verify; therefore unless another source can be found to back up the claim that this is being taught in schools, it is not eligible for use in the article nor is it relevant to this discussion. We've already gone over the notability concerns, please read <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and stop throwing that word around like there isn't a very specific definition of its use here at Wikipedia (as you just did when you claimed there to be a "notable amount of art.") As per why this page has not been deleted yet, AfD debates typically run at least five days (we are on day three now, I believe) at which point an admin will review the arguments to determine if a consensus has been reached. That admin will weigh arguments in terms of their relevance to established guidelines, so it is in your own best interest to familiarize yourself with those guidelines and phrase your arguments with their requirements in mind. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntepenultimate_a059.html" title="User:Antepenultimate">Antepenultimate</a> 03:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Four Footed Furries</i> was a one-shot anthology, not an ongoing series of any sort. Also, referring to the chakat content as the "main feature" is deceptive.

<li>A few notes about problems cited. As I understand it, Wiki policy prefers that potential problems are discussed in talk pages before deletion becomes an issue. That did not happen here. "<a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">made up in school one day</a>" It would have been easily disproved by an examination of the primary source given at the time that this is not the case. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>" This article is not one of the examples given. Wikipedia currently gives no guidelines for as to whether any given story is notable. The article might be a close match for requirement 6 in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">books</a> albeit chakats are a species that features in several stories written by several authors; rather than a single story in and of itself. "<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#SOAPBOX" title="WP:NOT">Advertising</a>" Chakats are not a commercial product, so it is hard to see what is being advertised here. The article was not written as an advert. "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Wikipedia:Fancruft</a>" Not in and of itself a reason for deletion, and not a policy violation. This statement is also disputed, as with the school teacher example, and that the species might be of interest to transhumanists, and scifi writers in general. (See below.). "<a href="../../../a/s/t/Astroturfing.html" title="Astroturfing">Astroturfing</a>" I cannot see how this is possibly relevant to the topic. This and the accusation about hit-count manipulation read as a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_attack.html" title="Personal attack">personal attack</a>. "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Wikipedia%7EManual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29_c9f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)">Does not meet style for fiction criteria</a>" This is an argument for rewriting, not deletion. "<a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>" The big question. Two third-party web-published articles (non-scholarly sources) have been found on the subject. A large amount of third party literature and art has been created. Since this is a <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shared_universe.html" title="Shared universe">shared universe</a> the term <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanfiction.html" title="Fanfiction">fanfiction</a> may or may not be appropiet.

<li>A final note for on the usefulness of the topic (since notability is so heavily defined): We may well have in this discussion a couple of <b>experienced deletionists</b> here. I once again ask them a question which they have so far either not noticed or refused to answer: <i>How many species are there like chakats that have created a comparable amount of interest and participation as evidenced on the Chakats Den and associated site?</i> The deletionists must come across topics like this a lot. So how many can be named? It has been implied that chakats are nothing special. So how many examples of fictional species can you name? Creating such a popular fictional species is neither easy nor simple. chakats weren't even created as such, yet they *became* popular because people showed an interst in them. It might have been word of mouth, or random clicking, and yes, people reading about them in 'cruft' publications. But the fact is that lots of people were interested enough to look it up, stay, and contribute. how often can you say that for a fictional species that hasn't been backed by a major publishing house? <b>For the administrator:</b> I realise that 'being very exceptional' is not a criteria for wikipedia notability, but it is a standard for common language notability. In the latter sense, chakats are very notable, not because of the species itself, but because the exceptional response and interest they have generated is very unusual and has sustained itself over fairly large period of time. I ask the administrator to consider whether this might constitute an <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">occasional exception</a> to the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability guidelines</a> on that basis alone.ANTIcarrot 05:21, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>So how many examples of fictional species can you name?</i> Offhand, dragons, mermaids, centaurs, satyrs and unicorns. All fictional species of long term, wide popular notability, not cult subjects of webcomics with sub-1,000,000 Alexa ratings and books that are so obscure they lack ISBN numbers, which demonstrates exceptional <i>lack</i> of response and <i>lack</i> of interest. Never heard or cared about Chakats until this AfD came up. That sort of goes to the point, WP is supposed to document notable things and persons, not be used to create notability, neither should this AfD used to create notability. The keep argument ran out of gas, like, about the first day, but every argument <b>except</b> actually coming up with verifiable, reliable sources that establish notability has been dragged out and rehashed ad nauseum, just to keep the debate going, it seems. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 06:36, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>PS: Alexa rank of the Chakats Den = 717,353. WP is, by 30,000, the highest ranked site linked to it, without that WP linkspam, the ranking would likely dive to oblivion. Chakats Den exists to promote and sell Mr Doove's work, so does the page, a pretty good argument could be made to speedy delete this article as spam. <a href="../../../t/u/b/User%7ETubezone_6e86.html" title="User:Tubezone">Tubezone</a> 07:37, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think chakats being characters in Apollo 9 makes them notable. But that doesn't make them non-notable either, because non-notable means absence of notability, not presence of a case of non-notability. Not having heard of chakats isn't a valid argument for non-notability, nor are WP:IHATEIT found way above, just as WP:ILIKEIT aren't. I agree though, there are plenty fictional species more known than chakats. However, you don't list any modern creation.

<li>Oakshade, if this is your position, than strip it down to a stub based on referenced material and the AfD debate can continue on the stub article. My may concern is <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Conflict of Interest</a> at this point. I have been working with Barbara on her talk page and I intend to continue to do so to find material that may be relevant.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 07:40, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Despite the fact that I have been working with Barbara on her talk page, due to this process, I have taken some time to look at the reposted article. I removed all references to articles Barb Biggs wrote as that would clearly be Conflict of Interest. Further, I reformmated the 3 provided citations and removed a great deal of uncited statements. That said, I offer this section of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wp%7Ebio.html" title="Wp:bio">wp:bio</a> for contemplation as I think this is the nature of our debate:</li>
</ul>
<p>--- The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</p>
<ul>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries except for the following:
<ul>
<li>Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.</li>
<li>Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>--- The citations we currently have in the article, two of them are interviews and one is an independent article. The interviews, I am interested to read the thoughts of others. Do we consider interview statements made by the subject reliable sources? Barbara is making some rather controversial statements about the barrister, that I have not seen confirmed by anyone but Barbara herself. If we choose to accept the interviews as reliable sources we may be reprinting something that is not a reliable statement. Lastly we have the "Hollingworth in 'journey of discovery'" article from theage.com.au. The Hollingworth article reads as credible as it is not simply an article, but I personally cannot speak for the reliability of the source. Anyone on that subject have a thought? I have not touched on the book citations, I would like to read your thoughts on these 3 first. Thank you for your patience. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:07, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm having trouble understanding your issue, Alan. First of all, she was a sole primary guest of the BBC program <a href="../../../w/o/m/Woman%27s_Hour_70ce.html" title="Woman's Hour">Woman's Hour</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2004_38_tue_02.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2004_38_tue_02.shtml" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> and that's the audio interview (actually, by listening to it, it sound more like a discussion with the host <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/ram/2004_38_tue_02.ram" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/ram/2004_38_tue_02.ram" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>). That she was chosen as the primary guest on a long running popular national radio show is an example of notability in itself. And I would strongly argue that an "inteview" is very different from an "autobiogrpahy". The other two pieces currently in the article certainly aren't "trival coverage" (not just a "mention" or a listing).<a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/24/1164341378905.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/11/24/1164341378905.html" rel="nofollow">[22]</a><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/03/1083436541695.html?from=storyrhs" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/03/1083436541695.html?from=storyrhs" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> She's the "Primary subject". As almost always, when there's a journalistic piece of somebody, they contain quotes from the subject. Correct me if I'm but, but just because they contain those quotes, you seem to be labeling these as autobiographies. They're not at all. And none of these are "self published works" in any way.&#160;; <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Age_3d42.html" title="The Age">The Age</a> articles and the <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_a61d.html" title="BBC">BBC</a> interview are not published by this subject.

<dd>The point I am raising for discussion is the value of sourcing a statement the subject of the biography made in an interview. I think the idea of independent sourcing relates to remarks others have written that support the article about the subject. When you are citing the subject, even if it's in a national interview, the source is not the interviewer, but the subject themself.<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 08:48, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm only dealing with the issue of notability, not exacly verification of the article content. I'm looking at these articles closely and I'm finding a majority of the Nitika Mansingh and Damien Murphy written ones have only a small minority of actual quotes of the subject and are mostly about her rathing than listening to her. I agree that the article content should not be verfied by the actual statements of the sujbect, whether they are from that BBC interview or the written articles, except as written in journalist form that actually cites the subject, ie. "According to Ms. Biggs, when she was 5..." --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 09:05, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b><s>Comment</s> Keep</b> I am not familiar with the radio show in question, but in the U.S., being the primary guest of a tabloid TV show means very little. Some shows even put on fake guests or coach guests into elaborating their stories. The reputation of the show is very much at issue here. That said, <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_Living_Persons_6806.html" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of Living Persons</a> requires that any accusations she has made against still-living persons be independently verified, or else that the accusation itself be sufficiently notorious that it has wide press coverage. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 13:00, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Audio files are always iffy. It's realPlayer. Just for information, there are at least 3 non-interview sources in the article now.

<p>A friend alerted me to this page which I didn't even know existed, although Alan had mentioned there was a debate going on somewhere! - main reason I haven't responded to the debate. First point I'd like to make is that the barrister died in the 1990s. This was first rreported in a fourpage article Good Weekend, one of Australia's most respected liftout magazines in the Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers (Melbourne) in 2003 when my book came out. I will try to find a reference to this, however I find that often older articles are hard to find. The main reason dozens of articles about me haven't come up when I do google searches I presume. I was also interviewed on BBC World Service when In Moral Danger came out in the UK. Once again, if I can't find it on google, I don't know where else to find older references. If anyone knows, please let me know. In one version posted, there were references for the publishers sites listing In Moral Danger in Sweden, Greece and Japan. They are in the languages of those countries, but if you don't allow weblinks in other languages, this isn't necessarily going to be reported, since it isn't considered relevant news, in English publications. If anyone knows where such a source could be found, let me know. As for notability, there are pages of interviews about me on google, including some of the most respected interviewers in Australia - Phillip Adams, Robyn Williams (30 years presenting on ABC radio), George Negus (30 years Oz TV), Australia's top rating Sunrise breakfast news TV program three times. These are not cited but I will try to find them. As for the political career. Unsure why this was deleted since my candidacy was reported in Nitika Mansinghe's article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbbiggs_c3b1.html" title="User:Barbbiggs">Barbbiggs</a> (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarbbiggs_5fe0.html" title="User talk:Barbbiggs">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barbbiggs_389f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barbbiggs">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Please remember to sign your posts with four tildes (~~~~). Thank you for clarifying that the barrister is no longer a living person, which relieves BLP concerns. If the name goes back, a date of death with citation would be nice -- perhaps he has a capsule biography in <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Who_098a.html" title="Who's Who">Who's Who</a> or some equivalent? A Lexis/Nexis search might help as well. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 11:36, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've managed to find many articles and interviews which I've slotted in, but not the crucial Good Weekend one. It's too old I think. The Sydney Morning Herald archives only back back 12 months. Also, I've found a Japanese amazon.jp site and cited that for the Japanese publication (this is in Japanese, but the book, In Moral Danger and my name is written in English on the site) but amazon doesn't have websites in Greece or Sweden. Of course I cited Greek and Swedish sites before, but somebody has deleted them, presumably because they are in a foreign language. I'd certainly like to know how other people verify that their books have been translated into other languages. In any case, see how you go with the sources now cited and keep me posted <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarbbiggs_c3b1.html" title="User:Barbbiggs">Barbbiggs</a></p>

<p>I can't believe the hoo ha, back stabbing, control issues, going on about this article. As a result of, I presume, adding source material and fixing typos to this article myself, I have been blocked from my username and can't log on. This feels more like a grade eight class of school kids fighting over what is basically an innocuous article that should have been a fairly straight forward process. My many 'edits' that I have disobediantly 'added' have been fixing typos, adding an apostrophe and adding sources. If you want ordinary people with something to offer to have a positive experience with WP, I suggest you get over yourselves and spend some of your time fixing up other, appalling and offensive entries (Recovered Memory Therapy, The Courage to Heal, Satanic Ritual Abuse) instead of wasting everybody's time with inoffensive ones like mine.<br />
I have personally spent some 20 hours trying to satisfy your every increasing demands on what is basically a few hundred words about a person who writes books and volunteers much of her time on an issue that most people find a turn off. Do with the article what you will. I resign. 203.36.217.79</p>

POV fork. Another problem is that "Heteroflexible" is pretty neologistic. It's not in the dictionary (AHD4). Having gotten drawn into editing <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_bisexual_people.html" title="List of bisexual people">List of bisexual people</a>, I've found that for many people it <b>possible</b> in <b>many</b> cases to find decent sources that refer to them using the word "bisexual." I've argued (semi-successfully) that the criterion for list inclusion should be the citation of a reliable source that uses the word "bisexual," rather than Wikipedians' editorial judgement of whether some collection of facts adds up to bisexuality. But I don't think there many people for whom you could find a reliable source that describes them using the word "heteroflexible." I notice that a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=heteroflexible&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=heteroflexible&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp" rel="nofollow">Google Books search on "heteroflexible"</a> turns up only four entries, none of which uses the word to describe a specific, named person.

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b> He is notable not for what he did, but for what was done to him. The articles needs serious expansion, which will be easy as every news source has written about it, here and abroad, and will be continuing to until the matter is finally resolved, some years from now. This is already a notable civil liberties case, and not keeping it would be a very serious POV bias.<a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 02:04, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This "planned" lawsuit doesn't move me, but he's received enough publicity that readers may want to know about him. One trouble with merger is that I'm not sure we could keep him listed on the <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asif_Iqbal_94d9.html" title="Asif Iqbal">Asif Iqbal</a> dab page, which would lessen Wikipedia's value in helping to sort out these four people. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 09:37, 15 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The fifth wheel article was added to refute Mr. Athol's technically unfeasible claim -- which has no basis -- and is more like a personal attack. The article clearly has original work -- and to be honest - I did not know you could not include original work/concepts in wikipedia -- for I do it at work all the time in our wikimedia software(a non public version).So I learned something valuable here -- how do I help delete the article, how do I help in the process? <a href="../../../i/h/e/User%7EIhero_b1dc.html" title="User:Ihero">Ihero</a> 12:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or merge to an article about hydrid vehicles. Sounds like a great idea, but is pretty much original research, citing only a blog. Wikipedia is not a site for initial publication of gadgets someone thinks up. Build it, get it in Mechanics Illustrated and Popular Science, with TV coverage on CNN, then come back and re-create the article. The article trivializes concerns about the source of the energy, the size and weight of the batteries, the possible instability of pushing a car with a fifth wheel, quick failure of an overloaded motor, the lack of traction, the lack of acceleration, the need to coordinate the bvraking system with the pushing motor, and safety concerns, and presents an idea as an established concept. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 17:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A comment on that vote: We seem to go around and around on this one. First, someone claims that the press coverage was not sufficient. Then I or others add information showing all the mentions, and put it in the article to prove it does meet WP:WEB. Then everyone agrees that excessive press linking just to prove WP:WEB is no longer needed because the article clearly meets it, and so it is pared down. Then someone nominates for deletion again on the grounds that the articles does not prove that it meets WP:WEB. So, here we go again.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Well it is a great pity you could not have done so when it was deleted on (what?) TWO previous occasions - or is consensus only acceptable when it agrees with your brand of 'politics'? What arrogance - all the other votes were not "informed". Hear that folks? - vote against Werner and you are obviously stupid and should be ignored until you vote for the right result. Sounds familiar... Hilarious.

<li><b>Delete</b> They have little to no impact on the market in which they operate in Western Australia, other than possibly an online presence.

<li><b>Keep</b> Okay, it's my site, so that gives a bit of bias, but I would still like it kept in Wikipedia. I'll admit, it isn't a very large site (and thus, finding sources that mention it is - well, hard to say the least.) We are trying to expand the site though (which will also deal with the cruftyness). As for the article reading a bit spammy - well, I've tried to update it to a neutral POV. <a href="../../../c/o/d/User%7ECodplay_d657.html" title="User:Codplay">Philip P.</a> 1:30, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> This is a well-known term, it's not a neologism.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I've added a link to a radio show named after Captain Obvious. I'd feel a lot happier if some more media references were found, though.

<dd>As should be clear from my previous two comments, I feel as though the fact that the subject is notable trumps your concerns. I agree with you, but what I'm saying is that <i>all of those things are fixable</i>, where as not being notable is not. If the information is available from a variety of websites, and anyone has access both to this information and to the tools required to add it to this encyclopedia, then why do we need to delete it? I don't know how to say it any better than that. Sure, you listed it for deletion and put forth some criteria. Does that mean that all of us are required to address our comments only to you now, or that those are the only criteria that exist? Trying to control the discussion is not going to help get your point across any more clearly. You made your point, and I thought it was a good one. But you are not addressing what I'm saying, either. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 11:44, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fine, suggest away. The fact is that it's presumptuous to assume consensus at this point, when what you're essentially saying is that any article for which sources have not yet been cited or that someone suspects may represent a conflict of interest should be deleted. To address your concerns: Unverifed does not mean unverifiable. "Just read it" is not exactly hard evidence. I've already disputed "no value to wikipedia." And I don't know what "associates subjects of in vivo biographies in a way that may be incorrect" means.

<dd>That was a little out of line, I'm sorry. It is probably autobiography, as I said myself.

<li><b>Further Comment</b> As an initial step, I just axed the entire "fraternity history" paragraph, which was pure advertising/autobiography/unverifiable from start to finish, in my opinion. Now we have more objective material remaining on the page. Much of it is still unsourced. Someone let me know what they think of the website I link to above. If that is usable to establish notability, we can use some of the "internal documents" as sources without a problem. Also tell me if there are any disagreements regarding my removal of that paragraph.

<li>To respond to both of your last two comments, I don't know, maybe it could be moved for a while until it's ready; that's not a suggestion I would immediately reject. However, I still lean toward keep, only because I just don't think this article fits even that paragraph you just cited. The article, to a certain extent, violates some of these policies. However, it is certainly <i>not</i> impossible that an article on this topic can exist without breaching these three policies. Ergo, these policies need not be respected above other opinions. The article currently, in certain places (namely the paragraph I attempted to delete), does violate policy, but an article on this topic need not necessarily do so, as notability is established, the internal documents can be used as sources, and non-neutral tone is fairly easy to fix. Thus, according to the logic of the very paragraph you cited, the article does not demand deletion. A better option is repair. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 09:33, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notability cannot be established because there are no acceptable sources cited.

If you write about yourself saying that you're notable, that's contentious. If Sammy's HQ writes that they have chapters at 50+ colleges across the US and Canada, and if you can find them directory-listed at all 50 colleges, do we need to reference all 50 schools' directories, or can the self-published source stand?

<p><b>Strong keep</b>. Organization meets WP:ORG. No one is debating the credibility of General Electric just because much of the information on the Wikipedia article comes from their own website. Sammy is a nationally known frat that’s quite a bit larger than many other ones which were proposed for deletion and allowed to stand. The article is in poor shape but for no reason should it be deleted. Sammy is an easily verifiable organization and I’m sure some editors are working on adding some other sources already. If you’re worried about some things being notable why don’t you go and AfD some articles on the random flash toons episodes and no name porn stars we have on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyt021_3281.html" title="User:Treyt021">Trey</a> 04:48, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Extremely bad faith nomination and/or unfamiliar nomination from a new editor. According to the nominator's logic, all fraternities, sororities and student organizations are inherently non-notable. A 100+ year old fraternity that is national in scope, part of the National Interfraternity Conference etc., has prominent alumni is notable. I've watched over all the fraternity articles and many of them have bias but to delete for that? You don't delete. You fix it up. The fact that the nominator states" Please comment on my nomination criteria, this is not a vote, but a debate" shows that the the editor is not familiar with AfD processes or Wiki policy because Afd's ARE votes. --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 04:57, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Though <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> and I have had a hefty back and forth over this article, I see no reason to label his actions as bad faith. In addition, an Afd, like most other things here, is not a vote but a search for consensus. The strongest argument wins (for example, a complete copyvio pretty much trumps everything). The problem Alan has is that while most of us would use common sense to conclude that the frat is obviously notable, most of us have not proffered a verifiable, third-party source to definitively prove any assertions of notability. Cfred's arguments go a ways towards alleviating that concern, but I understand Alan's argument. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan">Tractorkingsfan</a> 05:27, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I still believe this is a nomination on poor grounds. I too understand where Alan is coming from but if you've edited Wikipedia long enough, you'll see how much of the articles on here fall for AfD within his scope of reasoning. I've often participated in AfD for nearly two years and the reason why I stated this as bad faith is because of his arguments above and his wanting to start a "New Frat Patrol". Alan may not be one of them, but I've seen many notable student organizations get nominated for AfD by prejudice of an editor instead of a solid argument. AfD is usually reserved for controversial articles. This "debate" should have been on the talk page. At best a cleanup tag or disputed tag should have been placed. You can call it votes, consensus etc, but in the end, when the admin closes the nomination, votes for keep and not to keep are the primary considerations, not "comments" which this nomination is riddled with (myself guilty of this). --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 06:40, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> Needs a little work, but should be improved. Articles of various level exist for all of the members of the North American Interfraternity Council and would be recreated immediately. There are editions of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities which are in the public domain, but the only on Wikisource is from 1879 which is too early. 1920 edition would be ideal (Since SAM was founded in 1909). However using whether they would founded before the last public domain Bairds as a qualification strikes me as really goofy. <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENaraht_ac84.html" title="User:Naraht">Naraht</a> 11:53, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, I cannot agree, as the proposed guideline does not clarify what constitutes a reliable thrid party source. If you read other guidelines relating to verifiability and notability, they consistently require a higher standard for sources that verify notability than any old statement in an article. A reliable third party is not a student newspaper. This article lacks reliable thirdy party sources and that is why I find that notability has not been established using a valid source. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 04:05, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Alan, please stop patronizing your fellow wikipedians. A word of advise, if you see some 20 plus "Keep" comments and only one "Delete", it is time to back down.

<dd>And just to expand a bit on this. What I am trying to say is that when 16 people say "Keep" and only you (the nominator) and one other person say "Delete", it means that your arguments have failed to convince the rest of us and you are not going to achieve a consensus. This is not about voting but about common sense. Repeatedly re-stating your arguments or saying that "this is not a vote" does not make any difference - the consensus is to keep this article. Upon realising this (which you ought to by now), the best course of action is to back down and accept that at this time, the consensus is that such articles stand. You brought your test case, it failed, if you want to bring it or a similar case again at a later time, when the community standards and/or policies may have changed, you are free to do so.

<li>I am repeating the comment every several paragraphs because it amazes me of how few people seem to know what an AfD is about. In fact, through reading, I found that a group has started an AfD patrol to educate people about the guidelines for it. I am more concerned with the lack of understanding of these guidelines than I am about keeping or deleting this particular article. I don't take this AfD personally, I have no interest either way. However, I will be diligent to make certain that famous Canadian politicians will not be associated with this article or fraternity without cited sources. From what I've read, the frat seems to have a positive message, but I have a strong motivitation to protect subjects of living biographies from association with groups of which they may have no association. If we cannot have that, we have a tabloid here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 09:48, 16 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is not as if we are alleging membership of a Nazi party or something, there is nothing inherently negative or positive in being mentioned as a member of a student organization. I do not care enough to get involved though, but I really don't understand why you feel so strongly about this article. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHorsten_cf99.html" title="User:Horsten">TH</a> 13:15, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To some, a Nazi association is positive, not my opinion, but an opinion. The association of being a member of a group is a serious allegation to make. Keep in mind, I have no knowledge of this fraternity, only from this debate do I learn of them. How about tomorrow, the news media releases an article that claims this frat is a group of such and such or a position on a certain political viewpoint. Now, each member, who may or may not be an actual former or current member has their image affected. This is why, many politicians do not wish to be associated with any groups directly. For this reason in part, I believe we should be very thorough when associating subjects of living biographies (in vivo biographies). Not only does this article associate alleged members with the group, but associates them with eachother. As such, this article should meet the minimum standards of wikipedia and include third party, citable sources. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan.ca_23db.html" title="User:Alan.ca">Alan.ca</a> 22:59, 16 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Requiring paper sales or references would greatly handicap the ability to list any web-based medium...even Wikipedia...should we delete that, too? (/sarcasm). But seriously, Baen's Universe, SF.com and several other publications are web-based only. There are a number of other web-based comics listed here, including (forex) Schlock Mercenary. I agree the character backgrounds could be a bit less sales-y, but that's an easy fix. There's no direct marketing, and the strip does have a large international readership.209.43.8.126 02:49, 12 December 2006 (UTC)Michael Z. Williamson</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I think this is a good example of a failing in the WP:WEB current policy. This is a paintball-themed web comic, and is NOTABLE and WELL-KNOWN within the paintball community. The problem that WP:WEB fails to address is that even though 10 million people play paintball every year, the industry has underdeveloped traditional media outlets, so being well-known and notable does not transfer to being published due to a lack of traditional publishing outlets for paintball.

<li>I hate to ask this, but feel I must. The books are clearly posted on the site and have legitimate ISBNs. Fan following is worldwide. References and reprints exist in industry magazines with large readership. Comic is highly ranked on multiple webcomic surveys and award lists.

So the question is, since you make a point of claiming veganism, is this an attempt to delete a comic that just recently had an extended thread extolling the virtues of killing, cooking and eating animals in a vicarious fashion? Why no previous complaints, why only THIS comic at THIS time?209.43.8.126 22:01, 12 December 2006 (UTC)Michael Z. Williamson

<li><b>Comment</b> While I understand that I need to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, I find it hard to understand how you can edit the entry to move/remove the references and outside sources, then make a recommendation to delete the entry based on lack of references/sources.

<li>And then you added the unreferenced tag after moving said references.Nightfalke 18:14, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreeing here - Based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> there has been a citation of sources. This goes back to my original point - these magazines are worldwide distributed, but does not replicate all content online... how does one "prove" the citation other than mailing a copy of the said magazine to the person that tags the article as non-cited?--Nitehawk337 18:28, 13 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The unreferenced tag leads you to <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">Wikipedia:Citing_sources</a> which explains citing sources. The short version is that it's done through standard footnotes (with issue numbers, dates of publication, page numbers, etc).

<p><b>Comment:</b> Why is it important to have the magazine circulation at the <i>top</i> of the article? The main page is hardly so large that data is lost/buried at the very bottom.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the most important information should be at the top. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:48, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply:</b> Important to the article, or important as a reference <i>for</i> the article? As far as the average <i>online</i> reader is concerned, the publication or nonpublication is of lesser relevance than a description of the strip itself. The data is not irrelevant, and clearly satisfies Wikipedia's notability standards, but in regards to the readability and clarity of the article, it probably doesn't necessarily need to be "above the fold". DocsMachine 05:33, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the reason this comic is important is that it has been published in these magazines, then that ought to be mentioned in the introduction. See <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megatokyo.html" title="Megatokyo">Megatokyo</a> -- a featured article on a webcomic -- and note how the intro talks about the reason why it's important (its popularity, its print publication by DC comics, its review by The New York Times, etc.) long before the characters and plots are described. Descriptions of real world impact and historical significance are more important than plot summaries and character descriptions. This has little to do with whether the article ought to be deleted, so let's continue this on the article's talk page if this needs to be continued. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 05:54, 14 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that is the case, looking at the article for <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a>, an obviously notable webcomic, nothing is stated at the top of the article about the notability and importance of the comic that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiteboard_2e57.html" title="The Whiteboard">The Whiteboard</a> doesn't have (Readership statistics, longevity statements, publications, etc). So by that reasoning, either <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a> is not a notable webcomic and fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, or <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Whiteboard_2e57.html" title="The Whiteboard">The Whiteboard</a> IS notable and passes <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<p>This page attempts to cover a hugely broad swathe of history in a tiny space with no detail whatsoever. The Celts were a heterogenous group who really can't be lumped together in this way. It's comparable to having an article entitled "Germanic Warriors" starting with the battle of the Teutoberger Wald and ending with the Redcoats. The few salient points the article raises are all covered in <a href="../../../c/e/l/Celt.html" title="Celt">Celt</a> anyway.

<p>Non-notable Pokemon. It has never actually been written about outside the anime, card game, and video games, and even in those places, it's not very notable at all.

To compare, some relatively non-notable Pokémon articles are <a href="../../../g/a/_/WP%7EGA_8191.html" title="WP:GA">good</a>, and at least two articles are <a href="../../../f/a/_/WP%7EFA_2cf5.html" title="WP:FA">featured</a> (these Pokémon are somewhat more prevalent in the metaseries, though).—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 21:31, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>One might count my opinion as biased, considering I'm mostly here to deal with any issues which involve Bulbapedia on the Wikipedia; however, given that this was brought to my attention, I must note that I fail to see a major, significant difference between Whismur's article, which is being considered for deletion, and Weedle's article, which has good article status - particularly when one notes that Weedle is a first-generation Pokémon and Whismur is a third-generation Pokémon, which inevitably leads to three times the amount of reference material on Weedle as on Whismur. Beyond that, the differences can be whittled down to the <i>In other media</i> section - all Pokémon media, of course - fluff, and polish. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaydeis_edf7.html" title="User:Jaydeis">Jaydeis</a> 00:35, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>What makes it non-notable?

<li>Well, actually, yes, putting Whismur up for deletion does assume exactly that. What you're arguing is whether or not Whismur is notable enough in and of itself to have an article of its own. If there are grounds enough to justify thus far every Pokémon having a separate article, there should be more than enough grounds to justify group articles. So, if Whismur is not notable enough for a single article, then it should be in a group article; but what's the point of a group article if only Whismur and Whismur alone is in it? Why not, in such a case, just have the article for Whismur? Or do you expect everyone to simply pretend Whismur doesn't exist? Or include it as a footnote on the articles for Loudred and Exploud? Deleting one out of 493 serves no purpose except to make an incomplete set. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJaydeis_edf7.html" title="User:Jaydeis">Jaydeis</a> 02:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b>: while I don't have a strong feeling about this article per se, I feel that the nominator and nomination have been treated unfairly by many&#160;!voters. I have recently seen many AfD's where there were complaints because the nominator had created a mass nomination (nominating multiple related articles at the same time). Now, people are complaining because the nominator has <i>not</i> created a mass nomination. This is unfair, and does not reflect the nomination. This nomination is not a call to delete Whismur and keep all other Pokémons, but a call to delete Whismur, full stop. After this AfD, and depending on the comments and the result, every editor can choose to nominate other articles and/or merge them. Another comment is that it is not right to nominate an article for deletion because it only has in-universe references (only references in the show, card game, ...). However, this is a perfect argument for deletion. If no one had ever written anything out-of-universe about <a href="../../../r/h/e/Rhett_Butler_0705.html" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> (a terribly unsourced article for the moment) or <a href="../../../t/i/n/Tintin_and_Snowy_30cc.html" title="Tintin and Snowy">Tintin and Snowy</a> (a much better example), it would be perfectly allright to delete these articles, since the only sources then would be primary sources, making Wikipedia a secondary source, when it has to be a tertiary source. Every article that fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, no matter if it is about something obscure of about a detail of a well-known subject, is a fair candidate for deletion. Now, a good argument to keep this article anyway is to point to the available secondary sources (books, articles <i>about</i> Pokémon: not game manuals and so on though, those are still primary sources), of which there are a few listed. Since I am unable to judge if these books fit the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> criteria (independent? reliable?), I am in no position to decide if this AfD should get a <i>delete</i> or a <i>weak keep</i>, but I still wanted to comment on the many people unjustly targeting the nomination instead of targeting the subkect and its merits and faults, as an AfD discussion should do. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:54, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The article itself is not bad. It is sourced just like any other article on a particular Pokémon species. In fact, it even passes a notability requirement for a singular Pokémon that the nominator believes it has failed, which i had also brought up. It's not feasible to merge any of these articles into lists due to their length, nor does it make sense that a single species' article be deleted when it could be improved upon, or other matters be dealt with. This character will probably not be mentioned in the New York Times, or other notable news media like some others have, but Whismur is alongside probably 300 similar cases. The man who knows nothing about Pokémon is only going to know Pikachu, but that does not certainly mean only that one species gets an article, while all of the other ones are relegated to lists. All Pokémon species are only going to be mentioned in</li>

<li>The Card Game</li>
<li>Official Nintendo publications</li>
<li>Unofficial game guides from third party publishers</li>
<li>and Fansites</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>All of which are listed within each article on each species. There are probably another few sources that I have forgotten to mention, but something like <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotom.html" title="Rotom">Rotom</a> is not going to be spoken about any time soon.—<a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong"><font color="blue">Ryūlóng</font></a> (<a href="../../../r/y/u/User_talk%7ERyulong_923f.html" title="User talk:Ryulong"><font color="gold">竜龍</font></a>) 18:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, but of the six kind of sources you mention, only the fourth and fifth can be considered <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources, with the fourth having the problem that they aren't independent of the subject, and the fifth that they <i>may</i> not be by reliable, fact-checking publishers and authors (but the latter is a possibility I can't judge). So my only question is if the mentions in these sources (especially source number 5) meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. If not, the articles have to go, no matter how many fans Pokémon has (but then a merge may be a solution, if more can be said about larger groups of Pokémon). If, on the other hand, these books are good <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources and e.g. Whismur is discussed in them in more detail than just a passing mention, then these articles have every right to stay. The other sources are only of supplementary value: 1, 2 and 3 are primary sources, and 6 is of no value for Wikipedia (no matter how good such sites may be). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:57, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have used the term Snert in a recent ethnography I carried out, which is currently being peer-reviewed. Apple didn't change their name when they launched the iMac just because they had existed since the 1980s. Snerts are still apparent in online communities, it is still a useful term for describing those who's posts to an online community are dominated by flames. - <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanbishop_6279.html" title="User:Jonathanbishop">Jonathanbishop</a> 12:09, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm an expert in online communities Percy, I have been developing and researching them for nearly a decade now. The term Snert appears in literature on online communities, such as NetLingo, so has every right to be on Wikipedia. In my ethnography I used pre-existing names whereever possible, and Snert was one of the ones I used. If my paper is published I or anyone will have every right to put the terms I came up with and their definitions on Wikipedia, so people can learn about the different types of people that make up online communities, from experts like myself, who have their work peer-reviewed by top academics, and published in well-respected academic journals. People like you Percy seem to just want to destroy knowledge, it is people like you that ruin projects like Wikipedia, by asking for information that people want to be deleted. Read my conference speech about people like yourself making projects like Wikipedia not meet the harmony criterion of social change. <a href="http://www.jonathanbishop.com/Web/News/Speeches/Display.asp?MID=9&amp;NID=23&amp;Item=7" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.jonathanbishop.com/Web/News/Speeches/Display.asp?MID=9&amp;NID=23&amp;Item=7" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> --<a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonathanbishop_6279.html" title="User:Jonathanbishop">Jonathanbishop</a> 14:58, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For the people who understand Dutch (like Luxem): on the page is a link to articles from 'Krant van West-Vlaanderen' that clearly have Jerome the Travelling Gnome as their main subject. Same goes with the broadcast that Belgian Radio2 will air on 21/12/2006.<br /></dd>
<dd>Yes, the gnome paté petition is some sort of a prank, so is the <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travelling_gnome_prank.html" title="Travelling gnome prank">travelling gnome prank</a> or the actions of the <a href="../../../g/n/o/Gnome_Liberation_Front_101e.html" title="Gnome Liberation Front">Gnome Liberation Front</a>. Both of them are listed in Wikipedia without being disputed. I do not understand why Wikipedia should be my next (not following) target if you see that I have corrected several other articles that have nothing to do with pranks or gnomes. While some may question the neutrality of the Johan Deprez article people who actually take the time to read the articles in the 'In the media' section would see that all information in the Wikipedia article is confirmed in said publications/articles/broadcasts.<br />

<dd>For the part of 'How does he come up with it' I don't. For the memberships I can scan my membership cards but that's not what you mean.

<br />
Same goes for my projects. If you check 'Het Staatsblad' (published by the Belgian governement) you will see that I did all I claim to have done at MSKK. It has to be verified by a court before it gets published in 'het Stattasblad', did you know that?

<li><b>Keep</b> (Can I vote?) I created this article. The irony is, the original one, I flagged for speedy deletion. It was deleted. After doing further research on line, I changed my mind, because the gnome I was very aware of. It is the main reason why I keep asking for lawn gnomes for fathers day. The gnome is notable enough. I think we are all in agreement there. Isn't the man behind the gnome behind the gnome equally important?</li>

<li>I would wonder why drivers and other participants dying at a race track is an arbitrary condition to impose. It would seem obvious to me that those are the people most likely to die there, and limiting the list to those people just seems the reasonable thing to do. Still, I don't know that anybody would object to adding other deaths, if you can verify them. Are there even any other deaths at the track? And if you're worried about sources, I've added some. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:20, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>An interesting article created by Zubinhaghi - his only contribution - but not an encyclopaedia piece. Would be well-suited to a Dictionary of Names, which is where I would expect to find it. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 19:08, 3 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Disambig</b> Given the multiple uses of the word, it would make a good disambig page (needs some linking work). <font face="Vivaldi"><font size="large"><a href="../../../s/k/i/User%7ESkierRMH_4ae2.html" title="User:SkierRMH"><font color="green">SkierRMH</font></a>,<font color="purple">08:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</font></font></font></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> , expand and add a disambiguation page. I dissagree with the nom as the subject, a common south Asian name, is very encyclpedic. Many names have articles that discuss the orgin, history, background and current usage, such as well known English names like <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_%28name%29.html" title="John (name)">John (name)</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth.html" title="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_%28name%29.html" title="William (name)">William (name)</a>.

<dd><a href="../../../s/y/s/Systemic_bias.html" title="Systemic bias">Systemic bias</a>? That's a nasty accusation if I understand the article correctly. Please read my nomination again. My point is that this article is better suited to a Dictionary of Names like the one I have on my bookshelf. Same applies to <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_%28name%29.html" title="John (name)">John</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth.html" title="Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> and <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_%28name%29.html" title="William (name)">William</a>.

<dd>I'll remove the systemic bias speculation as you seem to have issues with all articles about names in general (but I am still troubled that you singled this name, which happens to be non-English, out for deletion). On that point, I guess I have a fundamental disagreement. I find the origins, histories and uses of names very encyclopedic and beyond the scope of definitions in dictionaries. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 00:39, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Thank you for that. I didn't, as you say, single out this name (it came up as a random page) because it is non-English. Incidentally, you might notice that my user name is French. I find the origins of names interesting as well, but I still say they belong in a dictionary, not an encyclopaedia, apart from possibly some very important examples that I can't think of. Same goes for surnames. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 12:36, 8 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That is not a fair or in any way correct assessment of the sources, which are from <i>The Age</i>, the <i>Herald-Sun</i>, the <i>Courier-Mail</i>, and the Australian Associated Press. <i>multiple independent sources</i> is the wording, not <i>multiple independent events</i>, which seems to be your reading. One event reported by multiple sources is the only reasonable interpretation of the guideline. In any case, here's more:

<dd>The Poynter Institute is a highly-regarded US journalism foundation. Their digest of news articles may meet a flexible definition of "blog" but it's little different from any other use of a wire service.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.46/aid.50861/column.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.poynter.org/dg.lts/id.46/aid.50861/column.htm" rel="nofollow">Herald-Sun</a> via Poynter (same as [3])</li>

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I am 100% confident that the Herald-Sun and Courier-Mail published articles on Glennon, regardless of your opinion of Poynter as a source. I believe that is sufficient to demonstrate notability. That makes five reliable sources, no matter how you're counting (and I acknowledged above that I made a cut-and-paste error, so yes, two of them are the same article. I'll strike through one so it's perfectly clear I'm not counting it.) I don't know much about the Catholic Church Resource, but it is a <a href="http://www.cathnews.com/aboutus/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cathnews.com/aboutus/index.html" rel="nofollow">charitable trust</a> founded by the <a href="http://www.churchresources.com.au/management.php" class="external text" title="http://www.churchresources.com.au/management.php" rel="nofollow">Australian Catholic Bishops Conference</a>, and again is operating a news digest, not a "blog". They seem a reasonably reliable source of news relating to the Catholic Church in Australia (aside from potential POV/COI issues), all the more so because they report stories like this one. (Obviously, I would prefer if I could reference a newspaper's own website archives for its stories, but they don't always give us that courtesy. In this case, much of the story took place before the web was actually invented. The CathNews site provided links to the Herald Sun, since 404'd, but they were not available at the Internet Archive.) Regardless, you've indicated that these do not count toward your total personal count, which you've stated is three reliable sources. The <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standard is "multiple independent sources", thus the standard is satisfied. It may interest you to note that I have also provided sources in the article, as I improve it:

<dd>Er...what? Not OR in the slightest, it is an attempt to properly codify Rowling's list as a proper article for the benefit of readers who, at present, have to dig through other articles in order to get to the information (and who at present can't even find characters such as Moon or Roper at all).

<li><b>Merge</b> with 'List of characters'. To address the comments about content above. This is actually a documented incident where the author let slip part of her own notes used to create the books. It is factual, not in any way OR. If the entire series of HP articles was scrapped and re-written from the perspective of literary analysis (which I am not advocating, and anyway something which is currently very difficult because essentially we are stil writing about an unfinished work), this piece ought to be included. It gives insight into the way the book was created. I anticipate that this will expand when the books are finally finished and Rowling will be able to talk about the story development... without being hamstrung as she is now by not revealing the ending. MichaelSanders is quite right that this is the kind of (currently relatively rare) information which ought to included in current HP coverage somewhere. These books have been a literary phenomenon and it is absurd to think that they will not become course material in future (I happen to know they are already included in reading lists for people doing teacher training in the UK). People will be sitting in classes analysing how she developed the storylines.</li>

<dd>This information could be merged with 'List of Characters in HP, but that article is already generating an edit warning that it is 37K long, and frankly the logical conclusion from that is that it needs/will need subdividing into separate article. A considerable part of this information is already in 'list of characters', and I would myself prefer to see one article discussing students in the school rather than have this split/repeated in two or more. So I have persuaded myself to argue to merge, but with the possible intent of splitting off a slightly different article in the future. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 17:35, 11 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You say that, "that this is the kind of (currently relatively rare) information which ought to included in current HP coverage somewhere", and I agree with you. The question, however, is not whether it is important information in the context of the HP universe, but whether it merits inclusion in Wikipedia, a general encyclopedia. We are not an encyclopedia of Harry Potter, nor are we an encyclopedia of every detail of every novel--or even every great novel. Our coverage of <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby-Dick_9975.html" title="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>, for example, has a short section detailing important characters, with a separate article for the most important one. Our coverage of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_c961.html" title="The Lord of the Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a> includes links to articles on characters important enough to be mentioned in a plot synopsis. The point here is not that we should have no information on HP, or that HP is not a good book; rather, that the focus of this article is not in line with the focus of the encyclopedia. When it comes to fiction, a general encyclopedia, such as WP, primarily should document the real-world significance of the novel, criticism, some plot summary, some information about the characters.

<dd>Have you even looked at the article? Or are you simply concerned with antagonising anyone who does consider Harry Potter relevant to Wikipedia? After all, Wikipedia is limitless: it isn't paper, there are no restrictions on size. We can include anything if enough people agree that it is relevant. So what is your objection to an article which, if anything, should be preferable to you people, since it aims for an external mode of writing - to document what has happened in terms of revelations and development of the novels, as well as what 'Harry does this and that'. So what is your objection?

<dd>Throughout this discussion, you've taken the view that anyone who disagrees with you hasn't read the article, has no knowledge of HP, and just wants to delete it on the grounds that it's about HP. I don't know how to convince you this is not necessarily the case, but... well, it's not. External with respect to fiction refers to its implications for the "real world", not the idea that the information in the article should come from the real world. That is, our fictional articles should focus on "the impact of HP on contemporary society" not "contemporary society's impact on HP". Again, it's a wonderful analysis of the origins of the HP universe, but it's too detailed for a general encyclopedia, having very little at all to do with the real world outside of HP canon. —<a href="../../../s/e/q/User%7ESeqsea_4341.html" title="User:Seqsea">Seqsea</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/q/User_talk%7ESeqsea_914c.html" title="User talk:Seqsea">talk</a>) 21:18, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you think that, then clearly you haven't read anything of the above discussion either. Sandpiper, Duane543, fbv65edel, [deathphoenix]: none of these support my desire to keep the article. I have not accused them of not reading the article, nor have I taken offence at their differing stance. Do you know why? It is because they have actually earned my respect in the Harry Potter project. You have not. I take it as a given that they have read the article, the arguments here, and understood them. I take it as understood that we believe in the same basic purposes for wikipedia. We don't always agree, but we know what we're talking about, and we care about making wikipedia the best resource available for all readers - in this particular case, Harry Potter. They have, one way or another, earned my respect, and I hope that I have earned some small modicum of theirs. But you, and those of who displaying an intolerant attitude of "Fiction? NIMBY!", you have not earned my respect at all. You have my deepest contempt. Those of you who have expressed their opinion of the article so disparagingly and ignorantly("fancruft", "OR", "unencyclopedic"), who have taken a high-handed and arrogant attitude (claiming that I am 'advertising' this debate - should editors involved in Harry Potter <i>not</i> be informed?; "only the most devoted fans are interested"; "this article doesn't have any hope of becoming encyclopedic"), who clearly feel that various hard-to-find or paranoid "Hermione is Lily in another dimension" rubbish sites should serve as the main Harry Potter source of information, and that wikipedia should not sully itself with such topics (despite it being a paperless, limitless, encyclopedia for EVERYONE - that includes Harry Potter readers, you know) - you have given me no reason to respect you. If this discussion were taking place amongst only people who are interested in preserving the integrity of the HP articles: I would fight for the article (I feel that it is important) but I would automatically accept that the editors knew what they were talking about, and had the best interests of the project at heart. You give me no such assurance - this deletionist crowd has made its blatant snobbery towards this project clear, has insulted the work we do for wikipedia, and as such is deserving of no respect. You are welcome to prove otherwise, of course, but at the moment I see no reason to view of those contributors here who are not Potter-related as contributing anything other than an obvious distaste and terror of creeping fiction articles. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 22:09, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think perhaps things are becoming a little too heated and personal here for the objective of coming to an acceptable decision. But I would address the arguments above that HP articles have become too detailed. I'm afraid I don't buy this (at least in general), and I don't think others should either. Wiki is not paper. There is no point wasting cyberspace including false information, but the fact that it is not paper means we should not worry about including additional information. If editors feel that a disproportionate amount of our limitless space is being spent on fiction, then perhaps those editors should consider ways to increase the content of articles which they feel are proportionately too small, rather than reducing those they feel are too large. The size of HP articles directly reflects the interest aroused by the books. Topicality is an issue which any encyclopedia must take into account when choosing content. But particularly in our case, topicality means that many more people are intereted in writing those articles, and consequently they will be much better developed than others which might in the grand scheme be more important, but are regrettably of no interest to most. In this instance, the content ought to remain on wiki. The issue for me and some of the others I have read above, is where it ought to be placed. This is not necessarily a simple decision, as Hp is a large set of interrelated articles, and I am not certain the suggestion to consolidate into 'List of characters' will be my final word on this, but it seems the best suggestion at present.</dd>
<dd>Also for the record, HP has already surpassed just being a book, and has become a phenomenon. We will not know until it is finished how well it has been written: it is a puzzle piece littered with loose ends, and its genius will be measured by how well the story is concluded. It has been disparaged by a number of professionals, who have already had to eat their words, and I can see how they came to carelessly dismiss it. But it has already changed the literary scene.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 00:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>First off: there are plenty of articles which effectively quote other sources verbatim (the Hogwarts Layout recently added in an intro which I think was taken straight from the Lexicon) (this may be irrelevant: looking back, I may have misinterpreted your reference to target article). Second of all: standard procedure is to tag an article as suitable for merging. And then the issue is discussed on the relevant discussion pages between the relevant editors, until a decision is reached. Had that happened, I would have willingly discussed it with all the relevant editors. I might - might - have conceded the issue, provided I could be sure that the relevant information regarding the release of the list and the names on it was preserved and easy to find. But that did not happen. Instead, this pack of fools, who have no interest or understanding or respect for what we do, high-handedly said they should delete it. And considered it appalling that I should want relevant editors involved. It is <i>very</i> hard to think well of them. As for the article itself, I would - reluctantly - agree to merging: providing the information regarding the names, changes, corollary ramifications, and the general circumstances of the release of the list were all preserved and easy to find and read (there are no suitably well-organised articles at present). But only if.</dd>

<dd>To your first point: yes, I think you interpreted my reference correctly after looking back.&#160;:-) Second point, yes, tagging an article for merging is an appropriate action; however, the person who nominated this for AfD genuinely (and in good faith) believed that this article was too trivial, and therefore needed to be deleted. Plenty of trivial articles get nominated for deletion, but the ones that should be merged usually end up getting merged. The one beef I really have with articles that get AfDed are those that clearly should be kept, but needed to be cleaned up instead, but that's not the case here. To your third point, it's not whether you want to be acknowledged or not, but that <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> attribution requirements specifically state this.&#160;:-) --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Deathphoenix</a> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>ʕ</b></a> 01:21, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b>. This article is not about the students actually named in the books so far. The article is about the somewhat more extensive list the author made available, possibly not realizing the names could be deciphered. This is a notable series of books, of course, and the main characters are I think notable. This is about the author's composition of the books. It takes a very notable author indeed to justify a separate article on that.

<dd>I'm not interested in Harry Potter wikis, or in posting fan rubbish. I'm interested in making Wikipedia as thorough, useful, easily-accessible, readable, and organised as possible. Which is why I am trying to create this article, in order to get the information in a thorough and clear, easy to find and use manner. I understand that we are coming from rather different directions here - I value the Harry Potter series and am trying to ensure that its articles are of the best standard, whereas most of the contributors here clearly have no respect for it and obviously have no desire to actually give any thought to the matter. As to why I am comparing the article to a list of Peers or Presidents: those are relevant to you. This article is relevant to those interested in Harry Potter. You may not like that, but you have to accept it. From an absolute perspective, <i>of course</i> the birthday list is not as important as a list of historical presidents. But relatively, it is important enough to the Harry Potter project to merit retention. <a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelsanders_fc38.html" title="User:Michaelsanders">Michaelsanders</a> 20:34, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<p>Original research. Was at one time PROD'ed after a lengthy discussion with the original author, with the author finally endorsing the PROD and then even replacing it with a speedy-deletion request, but the latter was removed by somebody else (the PROD would otherwise probably have led to deletion back then). A second speedy request was made today, but CSD doesn't apply. - Note that the OR problem does not apply so much to the facts reported as correct (those are well sourced, in fact), but to the claims about what are "wide-spread" misconceptions. No problem about stating that Texas has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico. But what's the source for claiming that people commonly believe it hasn't? No problem stating that cotton is among Texas' traditional industries. But what's the justification for implying that people typically aren't aware of that? To forestall one possible keep argument: The case of <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a> is <i>not</i> a suitable keep precedent, for exactly that reason: In the case of AIDS, the issue of what are and what aren't common misconceptions is the object of a well-documented public discourse and doubtless numerous scientific studies. <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 19:04, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

Although individual points are fairly well sourced, the whole point of the article is that this is a well-recognized list of widely-held misperceptions, and that point isn't supported by any sources at all.

<p>Here we have an article on an individual whose notability is - questionable at best. Those sources which do exist appear often to be fallout from the rather bitter fight over <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_rapid_transit.html" title="Personal rapid transit">personal rapid transit</a> in Minnesota. The number of Google hits for "J. Edward Anderson" is small, under 200 off Wikipedia. The article was startewd by one side in the dispute, and is now being edited by the other, but what we have here is still dominated by that dispute, which in fairness is probably of very little significance to Anderson in his overall career. As an academic, he should be judged by <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>, and I see a serious shortage of evidence that he meets that test. Do we need a battleground on Wikipedia with a living individual in the middle of it? I'd say not. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 19:21, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm sorry you feel that way. The truth is I felt it was important to create a Wikipedia page for J. Edward Anderson because he was cited so much in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_Rapid_Transit_8fa1.html" title="Personal Rapid Transit">Personal Rapid Transit</a> Wikipedia article. I also thought Anderson deserved his own page given the number of times he has appeared in the major media in the past.

<li><b>Through the Wikiglass</b> The idea of judging merit -- especially by appeals to academic standards -- within a circus that deliberately rejects any hierarchy of competence is ... um ... <b>ironic.</b> <a href="../../../k/n/a/User%7EKnappster_417a.html" title="User:Knappster">Knappster</a> 03:26, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I've put some thought and research into this, and regardless of whether the article creator was acting in good faith, I believe Anderson is notable. He has been at the forefront of PRT research for decades, and is responsible for much (though not all) of the current state of PRT research. He and his invention (Taxi2000) are the subject of several non-trivial news articles (<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62421094.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62421094.html" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>,<a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB5DA8AB6F03BF5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PD&amp;s_site=twincities&amp;p_multi=SP&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB5DA8AB6F03BF5&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" rel="nofollow">[66]</a>,<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-99929949.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-99929949.html" rel="nofollow">[67]</a>,<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115771023.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-115771023.html" rel="nofollow">[68]</a>,<a href="http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/the_big_idea/2004/11/19/new_taxi/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/the_big_idea/2004/11/19/new_taxi/index.html" rel="nofollow">[69]</a>,<a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NT&amp;s_site=duluthsuperior&amp;p_multi=DU&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=108A03176ECEE49B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" class="external autonumber" title="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NT&amp;s_site=duluthsuperior&amp;p_multi=DU&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=108A03176ECEE49B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM" rel="nofollow">[70]</a>) and are mentioned in several others (<a href="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-132506261.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-132506261.html" rel="nofollow">[71]</a>,<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926562-2,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926562-2,00.html" rel="nofollow">Time Magazine</a>). I don't think there's a question as to his notability. The article certainly needs to be cleaned up (and this needs to be done with care given the history of this dispute) but I don't see any reason why it should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EATren_6e1d.html" title="User:ATren">ATren</a> 19:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - From what I have seen, in the field of PRT, Anderson is a giant. I disagree entirely with using <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_juice.html" title="Google juice">Google juice</a> as a notability yardstick. I also disagree that Anderson's article should be judged solely according to <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a>. That is not where he is most notable. I agree that the article was created in bad faith by someone with an axe to grind. But, now that it is here, and the axe grinder visits only rarely to wreak havoc on anything related to PRT, I suggest the article is maintainable in a neutral tone that the one for PRT could never be. --<a href="../../../j/j/l/User%7EJJLatWiki_82f4.html" title="User:JJLatWiki">JJLatWiki</a> 20:16, 12 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am not interested about the history of the nomination but only in the question about the notability of JEA. He's more of an engineer than a scientist, and practical achievements are worth as much as published articles; this is an interesting instance of a prominent figure with major public proposals, but which were never adopted, and is clearly less notable than if they had been. But they've been important in the (non)development of late 20th century public transit, and this is at least as much a political as a technical issue. He has been featured in news articles, the information is verifiable, and that's quite enough. I sometimes try to improve articles if I think they're likely to pass &amp; be worth the effort, and I just did a first round on the very inflated article. I removed the considerable part of the article which was about his friends and supporters; if relevant anywhere, that would be in the article for his project. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04:23, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There is no need for a rush to judgment. The general topic is an absolute mess of arguments over undefined (or individually defined) terms. [Race] is a "myth" (or, to be more PC, it is a social construct), but racism is a reality. What is at issue in the case of a racist attack is not the reality or accuracy of categorization, but the fact that the attribution of status is made and that real world consequences flow from those attributions. One of the side-effects of this racist attack is that the groups targeted can buy into the systems of categorization used by their oppressors, and that acceptance of a social construct can have both good and bad results in individual cases. If the "Black is beautiful" movement is in the ascendant, then the social construct can have at least a transient good effect. If the negative values implicit in the social constructs are internalized by the victims of these social constructs, then the effects can be strongly negative. Either way, we need to understand the intricate structure of the dominant social constructs, and for that reason it would be inappropriate and even hurtful to stuff off reports and analyses pertinent to these fabrications. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrick0Moran_feff.html" title="User:Patrick0Moran">P0M</a> 00:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's real ok, you'll find it mentioned in some issues of Miscellany in the early 80s. It was (is?) a student drinking club.</p>
<p>There's a reference to it in the tunnels under house 43. "Society of St. Michael - 1987". I wasn't sure what it was referring to, but I guess this is it.</p>
<p>It has definitely been in existence for the past three years, since I started College, although beyond that I can't be sure. My flatmate in first year was asked to join. The part about many prmoinent people in student societies, etc being members might be a tad exaggerated but apart from that it seems fine. Michael Carroll</p>
<p>No documentary sources whatsoever. Delete.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep'</b> per Joestella and others. University clubs have never been held be inherently non-notable; a student union for large universities like UNSW should definitely be notable, especially given the fact that the author has chosen to merge them all into one article following the merger rather than write three underwritten articles on the old unions. As the equivalent Student Union at Sydney University (<a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Sydney_Union_912c.html" title="University of Sydney Union">University of Sydney Union</a>), Sydney's other large university, has an equivalent article that is not under threat from deletion, this one should definitely stay. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 03:31, 15 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Nothing about this school -- including the two notable alumni listed, and the 2002 local menigococcus outbreak leading the government to vaccinate its students -- indicates that there would be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">non-trivial external sources</a> that we could use to write a good article about it.

Looking <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">here</a>, I see that most recent high school article AFD's resulted in no consensus.

<li>Thanks, that's an interesting link. I believe that all normal New Zealand secondary schools are worthy of articles. I can't say that for all secondary schools around the world, because educational systems differ. I've added the word "normal" without being able to say exactly what I mean by it. However, a proposed school would not usually be worthy of an article. My reasoning stems partly from a back-of-the-envelope calculation: a school of 500 students must have an intake of at least 100 per year (probably more, because a large proportion don't stay a full five years), and when it's existed for 80 years, that's 8000 students (assuming a constant roll, which is not a very safe assumption). There are also quite a number of staff who will have worked there over the years. Many parents will also have had significant interactions with the school. Any place which has affected so many people on a daily basis seems notable. Another part of my reasoning is that school articles are often a place where Wikipedians start editing, and they then move on to more diverse articles. I've seen a number of New Zealand editors get started through their secondary school article. I realise that many editors also get started by editing articles on garage bands and that this is not a reason to keep the garage band articles, but schools invariably have official listings and websites, providing some verifiability, they are regularly reported on in local newspapers, and the articles are not (mostly) driven by vanity. It's not at all unusual for a long-standing secondary school such as this one to have a book written about their history. Such books won't be widely available outside the town that they're in, but they can be ordered through interlibrary services within the country.-<a href="../../../g/a/d/User_talk%7EGadfium_49fb.html" title="User talk:Gadfium"><font face="cursive" color="#808080">gadfium</font></a> 23:36, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>You make some thoughtful points. The question of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> remains though -- are there external sources about this school that we could use to write a good article about it? To speculate that there may be books out there, somewhere, is not enough -- someone has to actually find those.

<li>Thanks, the article looks much better now. The question of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> remains -- I could write an equally detailed article (with pictures!) on many local businesses, using their websites as sources. But these are not good candidtates to be Wikipedia articles -- to show notability the sources have to be external. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:06, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Given the opportunity in the next couple of days to get to the local public library, I'll add considerable external sources. Not all sources exist online, you know. There are a considerable number of books that I know of dealing with the area, many of which have more information on the school which - as I said earlier - is one of the most prominent schools in the region. (And before you ask, no, I'm not an ex-pupil of there: quite the opposite, SOHS were my alma mater's biggest rivals!) <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:13, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your effort is to be commended, and I notice the improvement to the article. However you didn't list the publisher of the reference you added. I guess it's self-published? If so it would not indicate notability. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 14:11, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>On the contrary, I would think the chances of sources would be low given that this is a local high school -- most local high schools aren't the subjects of non-trivial external sources, and nothing indicates that this one is an exception. (Many high schools have famous alumni -- why would famous alumni induce external publishers to publish articles featuring the school? And the disease outbreak was really something that happened in the town, not the school.) But anyway, what's the point of talking about the <i>chances</i> that there's good coverage out there? To show <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> someone has to actually find the sources. I looked and found none.

<ul>
<li>(1) "Per precedent" is not a valid reason to keep or delete any article. (2) Even if precedent were a valid reason in general, it makes no sense for high school articles, as most AFD's on those result in <a href="../../../w/a/t/Wikipedia%7EWatch_schoolwatch_Schools_for_deletion_archive_a17f.html" title="Wikipedia:Watch/schoolwatch/Schools for deletion archive">no consensus</a>, and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Collier_High_School_1975.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Collier High School">a recent one even resulted in delete</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 21:36, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, the majority of high schools brought to AfD in the last few months have been kept, in some cases speedily. Most of the no consensuses shown at the link you give are for middle schools or lower, though i do admit there are some high schools revceiving that decision. the one deletion you mention was a special case that actually ended up being redirected and smerged into the company which ran that particular private school. I make the tally 16 keeps, 9 no consensus and two deletes in the last month and a half once middle schools and the like are removed from the count, with one of those deletes being for a nineteen-word stub. To claim that this is a case of "mostly no consensus and even deletion" is misleading, to say the least. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Granted, but my first point stands -- citing outcomes of past AFD's doesn't give a valid reason to keep or delete anything. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, it's more a case of "all high schools with notable alumni are notable". <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 05:32, 12 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>To say that notable alumni (or anything else about the school) automatically confer notability on the school doesn't make any sense -- at least given what notability means on Wikipedia: see <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Notability means that the topic is the subject of multiple non-trivial outside sources. If having notable alumni induces external publishers to publish non-trivial things about the school, then that would show that the school is notable. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:52, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The New Zealand Herald shows a dozen stories about the outbreak, plus a few about other, potentialy "notable," topics. I can't read more than the intros online, but locals can look them up in the library, using an aparently reliable source, and can polish up a reasonably good article, I think. "Verifiable" doesn't mean that it has to be available to us online for free. Because of its size and age, this high school has inevitably been the subject of non-trivial third-party coverage, in addition to the dozens of government reports that show up in the first few pages of a seach. There is no reason to think that it can't be expanded and improved. --<a href="../../../h/j/a/User%7EHjal_95ba.html" title="User:Hjal">Hjal</a> 07:24, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>The publication of government reports has nothing to do with notability, and their content is nothing we can use to fill up an encyclopedia article.

<p>Nonencyclopedic article providing no sources whatsoever. I would make it a speedy but since I am from Slovenia I find it more neutral to nominate the article here. --<b><a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETone_f843.html" title="User:Tone">Tone</a></b> 22:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I see no reason to delete this article, it could have encyclopedic value as does <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Serbia_0728.html" title="Greater Serbia">Greater Serbia</a> or <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Germany_f1f0.html" title="Greater Germany">Greater Germany</a>. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 23:24, 10 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

It's also apparently part of the ideology of the <a href="../../../s/l/o/Slovene_National_Party_301a.html" title="Slovene National Party">Slovene National Party</a>, although I don't know quite where to pull up their flag or statements on their site for language-barrier reasons.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> "the authorship remains dubious" simply means that this book has been long out of print, and that when I created this article, I personally did not know who wrote it or how to find out. I created this article because the summary of the ideas presented in this book were overtaking the article on Agartha. If this article is deleted, it will not solve the larger problem, which is that most of the information in the Agartha article is from this book and no has bothered to find out who wrote it, least of all the person who added it. I suggest that someone find out more about this this book, because it is the most important part of the Agartha page and the information on it could not be removed without destroying the article. <a href="../../../m/r/w/User%7EMrwuggs_cc16.html" title="User:Mrwuggs">Mrwuggs</a> 00:09, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><a href="http://assassin.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/The_MIT_Assassins%E2%80%99_Guild" class="external text" title="http://assassin.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/The_MIT_Assassins%E2%80%99_Guild" rel="nofollow">According to the MIT thesis</a> linked to in the article's own external links section (this thesis was written by past Secretary of the MIT Assassins Guild<a href="http://www.mit.edu/~assassin/pasthigh.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mit.edu/~assassin/pasthigh.html" rel="nofollow">[76]</a> and is hosted on the Guild's own webspace), the MIT guild was officially recognized as a MIT student activity in 1982 and notes that at the time, there were many other such groups at other colleges (but which did not enjoy official recognition). The Guild is described in the thesis as originating as a group playing a game known as "Killer"</p>
<p><a href="http://assassin.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Game_of_Assassin" class="external text" title="http://assassin.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/The_Game_of_Assassin" rel="nofollow">In another part of the same thesis</a>, it is asserted that, aside from an earlier game with some similar characteristics known as "Circle of Death" that was popular on campuses, the most significant event in popularizing Assassin was the commercial publication in 1981 of a booklet of rules for the game "Killer" by the influential gamemaker <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jackson_%28US%29_c787.html" title="Steve Jackson (US)">Steve Jackson (US)</a>. In addition, the booklet is said by the thesis to have an afterword which states that the campus game is 15 years older than 1981, and may be traced as an idea as far back as the 1950s or even the 19th century.</p>
<p>The MIT thesis might be regarded as a reliable source for the article (but there may be <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues given its author). However,its account of the importance of the MIT Guild to the popularization of the Assassin/Killer game seems to be clearly at odds with the key claims to society notability in the Guild and History of LARP articles. It does not verify these claims - rather it seems more to discredit these claims</p>

<dd>Why not <b>merge</b> with <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassins_%28game%29.html" title="Assassins (game)">Assassins (game)</a>?

<dd>I would say that clubs of this type can be found at most large US and UK universities. It is not especially uncommon. But Wikipedia is not a campus info booth, student activities bulletin board or a link directory. Merging or starting subsections on the history/current activities of all these student societies to that article would still be unencyclopedic unless each society can make their own special,verifiable claim to encyclopedic notability. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 00:19, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Not a vote. The above long explanation confuses two concepts: Assassin-style games and larps. The MIT Assassins' Guild began as a group playing the former, and it is claimed that it significantly influenced the latter. It is now a LARP group, not an Assassin-style game group. <a href="../../../m/o/i/User%7EMoink_dc9f.html" title="User:Moink">moink</a> 03:22, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for the clarification, though the Guild article does make a point of saying that the group "popularized the assassin game" whilst the history article seems to associate the guild's influencec with "Assassination style LARPs". Anyway, the claim of influence on LARPs would need to be properly sourced too <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:41, 11 December 2006 (UTC)
