There are no sources, no reviews, no media attention. The only source for this article is the publisher's site. Author is notable; this pamphlet is not. Book is already mentioned on the author's page; nothing verifiable to merge. Also please note the article is being used as a soapbox: the "summary" is a mini-version of the book. The book purports to disprove the bestselling book <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">The God Delusion</a>; the "summary" section in this article for the <i>Is religion evil?</i> section, for example, is 5979 characters (for a book with no reviews at all) compared to <i>The God Delusion</i> summary of 530 characters for the corresponding section in that article. As such this article is also a POV fork of <i>The God Delusion</i>, as it is being used to soapbox against the controversial content of that book. <a href="../../../k/i/l/User%7EKillerChihuahua_cd2c.html" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a><sup><a href="../../../k/i/l/User_talk%7EKillerChihuahua_5bb4.html" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a></sup> 13:04, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comments</b> a 75pp book by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_McGrath_3c9d.html" title="Alister McGrath">a major author</a> is not a "pamphlet"; the source for the summary is the book itself (obviously - just as it is in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Delusion_dce2.html" title="The God Delusion">TGD</a>), it was published last week so reviews and British Library catalogue will follow shortly. The length of the section complained of has almost halved (and could be shorter were it not for complaints about OR!) but seems irrelevant to whether the article should be deleted - there is no policy which says delete long articles but not short ones! Disagreeing with the content of a book is not a reason for deletion. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 02:44, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, and they seem to have very different POVs. Anyway, I guess the only conclusion is that Dawkins is right in his response. *ducks* --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 14:12, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>FWIW there are now 3 more books by <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_McGrath_3c9d.html" title="Alister McGrath">McGrath</a> with articles - more help strongly welcomed. Only 2<s>/18</s> of his books have Dawkins in the title, <s>the same fraction of</s> Dawkins's books with "God" in the title (and another 1/9 has "The Devil"). Dawkins is right in his response in this sense: having no intellectual argument to counter McGrath's criticisms, he responds with a rhetorical attack that will seem witty to his admirers. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 00:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Sorry that's way out! McGrath has authored over 100 books so less that 2% of them have "Dawkins" in the title, compared to over 22% of Dawkins's that have God or the Devil. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 06:43, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>And 0% with "McGrath" in the title...&#160;;) Still, I agree with you on McGrath's notability, and I was just being a bit sarcastic about the coverage on Wikipedia. You have done well to answer this by starting articles on McGrath's <a href="../../../a/_/s/A_Scientific_Theology_8897.html" title="A Scientific Theology">scientific theology</a>; the additional numbers aren't impressive (see Snalwibma's comment below).

<li><b>Comment</b>. Interesting ... If McGrath has indeed "authored" (whatever that means) over 100 books before his 55th birthday, that is perhaps very telling. Assuming he didn't start until he was (say) 20, that's a rate of three a year. Which (IMHO) suggests that on the whole a book by McGrath is not notable, and probably not worth a WP article. Just a thought. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 09:21, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>weak keep</b> for the moment. It's a bit early to delete it. I think the book/pamphlet hasn't yet come out in the USA, and maybe we should wait until it has, and see if it gets reviewed, before getting rid of the article (it is on amazon.co.uk, BTW). But it needs to be kept down to a <b>reasonable length</b>, and not used as the basis for bloggish soapboxery about how Dawkins is evil and incompetent (even if that is what McGrath says in the book - and as far as I can gather from a quick skim, that's about all of any substance that he does say). I share Merzul's concern that only these two books by McGrath are deemed worthy of WP articles. If he is such a notable theological thinker, why are none of his other books worthy of note in their own right? In summary - leave it a month, and then <b>delete</b> if it doesn't meet the criteria. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:07, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> It's notable primarily because McGrath is notable. From the look of it, it's only been published in the U.K. thus far, but, once it's landed on the other side of the Pacific, I'm sure it will generate a lot more publicity. It's also less than a month old, so, a lot of reviewers simply might not have gotten around to it yet. I'm taking an eventualist approach to this article; let's reduce the book summary to a <b>reasonable length</b>, as KillerChihuahua suggested, primarily cutting down on the current polemic, essay-like tone. If it doesn't meet notability, size, NPOV, BLP, etc. standards after a month or two, then renominate for AfD. -<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevera_1173.html" title="User:Severa">Severa</a> (<a href="../../../s/e/v/User_talk%7ESevera_b631.html" title="User talk:Severa">!!!</a>) 15:41, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Delete</b> per nom.

<li><b>Keep</b> About 20 editors have worked on this article (which is surely strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence of notability!), there are 23 references and 16 books are cited in the summary (out of the c 48 that are cited in the book). It has only just been published in the UK so it's understandably not on amazon.com but the pubisher <a href="../../../s/p/c/SPCK_4c41.html" title="SPCK">SPCK</a> his highly reputable and the 3rd oldest in England apparently. I agree with <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> re notability criteria 5, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alister_McGrath_3c9d.html" title="Alister McGrath">McGrath</a> is one of the world's leading authors on theology - his textbook on Christian Theology is into its 4th Edition since 2001. It would be good if people could work on articles about his other books, but with Dawkins (alas) so topical you can understand the problem. I should add that his book has endorsements from <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Collins_483f.html" title="Francis Collins">Francis Collins</a> (on the book cover so admittedly a <a href="../../../b/l/u/Blurb.html" title="Blurb">Blurb</a>) but also <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Ruse_06f9.html" title="Michael Ruse">Michael Ruse</a> and <a href="../../../o/w/e/Owen_Gingerich_096e.html" title="Owen Gingerich">Owen Gingerich</a> which is prima facie additional evidence for notability. (PS I didn't start the article, I was the 6th Editor to work on it, though I have worked quite hard on it). If people don't like the arguments McGrath makes they should deal with this in other way than trying to supress them.

<li>There are no problems with including McGrath's arguments; the question is here about the notability of the book. I know it hurts when people delete material, but keeping a cool head when responding will be more helpful. It might be that this article is a bit ahead of its time; maybe it might be good idea to move this article to user space for now and put it back once the notability issues are resolved. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerzul_467c.html" title="User:Merzul">Merzul</a> 16:38, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If the book has only just been published, there seems not to have been any time for things to be written <i>about the book itself</i>. An encyclopaedia article by this title is about the book itself. McGrath's arguments <i>from the book</i> should be presented in articles on the topics that McGrath is arguing about, giving them weight in proportion to their acceptance by the world at large. In other words: That the book is a <i>source</i> does not automatically mean that it warrants an article.

<li><b>Keep</b> book is being discussed widely. Just because it's not out in the U.S. doesn't mean it should go. I wasn't aware this encyclopedia was solely for the U.S. And no doubt it will reach you soon enough. The book has contemporary relevance due to Dawkin's book and the contoversy around it (due to Dawkin's media savvyness.) And McGrath is well-known too.

<dd>Google hits is not a source. I followed a ton of GHits; all were blogs discussing <i>The God Delusion</i>, not the McGrath book - even when put in quotes.

<li><b>keep</b> because the book will almost certainly become N, because of the popular desire to read this viewpoint.The length is absurd, however, and indicates that the article was not written from an objective POV. Once the article is down to the appropriate 2 or 3 paragraph size, a suitably sized section --not a 5% size paragraph--can then be added of quotation of the views of this author's opponents, as they appear, which they surely will, and then there will be a NPOV. Whether or not the book is intrinsically trivial is not a question for WP to decide.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> The <i>book</i> has a strong POV and since the summary is a summary of the book, this POV is made clear. But I think the summary always uses terms like "suggests..." for anything remotely controversial and takes no position on whether the suggestions are valid. I don't think that extensive quotations, thus sanitised, make it a POV article. And to be fair to McGrath, the proportion of his books that have "Dawkins" in the title is exactly the same as the proprtion of Dawkins's books that have "God" in the title (2/18 vs 1/9). <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 16:43, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Definite Keep</b>. It's got pages and text, so it's definitly a book, and it's directly related to a world-famous bestseller that is already here. So it's definitly notable.

<li><b>keep</b> I don't see any sensible reasons not to keep the article based upon the above discussion. Arguments based on multiplicity, notability, in practical terms are excuses to exclude the content of this article which is citable and categorically very relevant to the God Delusion article.
