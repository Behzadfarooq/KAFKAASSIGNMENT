<p><b>Comment</b> There is alot of information about the business on the site now and if you ask most people in the north west about the Great Kathmandu they will tell you of its importance. The detail contained with in is no different to most of the establishments listed on wikipedia and I for one have not heard of some of them either and feel they have less importance then this artical. if you check google the Great Kathmandu has over 900 hits and is one of the first to come up when you type nepalese and Didsbury. The fact that people have logged on just to comment about this deletion shows that they care enough about this artical. I have informed people at the AGM of the Yeti Assoc. The Yeti Assoc is a organisation that tries to promote Nepalese culture in the UK and the world. Expect to see more information added to the artical by its members and suporters. More Nepalese related articals will follow. <a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarbourcoat_56a4.html" title="User:Harbourcoat">Harbourcoat</a> 11:43, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hi, I understand your concern. May I just clear one thing up, though, Dumbass Productions is <b>not</b> a jackass copycat group of people, if anything it's the antithesis of it. Real films are made by these guys and have been released, admittedly in small numbers, in <a href="../../../c/o/2E/Co._Leitrim_f98c.html" title="Co. Leitrim">Co. Leitrim</a>. I really understand your concern and I hope we can find some sort of middleground. Wikipedia is a huge resource of information and I think we can find something we both agree on. <a href="../../../j/i/e/User%7EJiei_ad62.html" title="User:Jiei">Jiei</a> 01:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also! I know for a fact that the company is undergoing a name change to dispel the very associations which are the basis for you wanting to delete it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/i/e/User%7EJiei_ad62.html" title="User:Jiei">Jiei</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/e/User_talk%7EJiei_d1e0.html" title="User talk:Jiei">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jiei_7904.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jiei">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li>Perhaps it would be wise if you read <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> so we're both on the same level about what is and isn't acceptable Wikipedia content.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The reason for deletion is no "Jackass copyism," but rather that the company and its products and staff are not notable enough for Wikipedia at this time.

<li>Who is to judge what is notable enough? There are very loose definitions and it's impossible to say! I can understand why some of what you say <b>may</b> breach various policies and guidelines but at the same time I feel it's far more notable than some stuff listed on Wikipedia. I shan't argue the deletion of Alan Farrey and Dumbass: The Movie but I request that Dumbass: Productions remains. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jiel (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jiel_eaa9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jiel">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd><b>Delete</b> all. I seriously doubt any of them will remain, Jiel. You give us no reason to care about the subject of the articles or say to ourselves, "Yes, this is worthy of an encyclopedia article."

<p>1. The reason for deletion of the original article is biased because of the connotations of the name, as shown by references to its ambiguity and the quality of similarly named "sites".</p>
<p>2. You do not need to care about it. This article is not relevant to you. I mean "random website" proves it - it's the biggest national Irish teen website. It is worthy of an encyclopedia article because Wikipedia is universal, international site and the article is relevant to a lot of people. This is the problem.

<li>I hate the fact that one prejudiced guy can dispute this, and others can simply agree and that's that. Delete away with Farry and the movie, I really shouldn't have uploaded them, but deleting the company would be wrong. Aside from that, your dismissal of SpunOut is really hurtful! I hate that mentality. It's a huge website. What, it's not american?&#160;:|
<ul>
<li>I'm sure SpunOut is as popular as you say, but if we start giving out articles to everyone who wins a monthly award from the myriads of teen websites on the internet, Wikimedia is going to run out of disk space.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, the first half of the article is just a list of characters and their symbols, I've added their names to Image:SSBM-SelectScreen.png. The second part is game guide'ish explaining the characters attacks/special powers etc/moves how to do them etc - <i>". Falco's Up+B and Forward+B attacks aren't as long-ranged as Fox's"</i>. Suppose it's also fan-cruft.

<li>Poker being a game with a strong element of luck , one reasonably strong performance, based almost entirely, it would appear on luck does not mean she is more succesful than thousands of players. Hers is as far as i know the only poker entrance in this encyclopedia based on only one performance that didnt involve victory. The precedent here is if she merits an inclusion then clearly every one from this and next years WSOP Main Event 1-15 should be included, which is farcical.Further, those who finished 4th ,6th 7th and 8th in the same competition don't have their own entry.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">Cardigan3000</a> 07:05, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment: Please note that skill is not a requirement for someone to have an article. Whether Williamson is a good player or a bad one should not affect the decision on whether the article exists or not. Furthermore, the TV highlights that showed her in a poor light only represent a fraction of the total hands played, and it would therefore be inaccurate to base her entire playing ability on that appearance, particularly as she has coped admirably in other TV events she has appeared in. <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssexmutant_5c5a.html" title="User:Essexmutant">Essexmutant</a> 07:17, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Skill may or not be required by to confirm notability, however the only notable thing about her is her performance in a competitive pursuit. There are several sites that explain in detail her poor play, in fact several unfathomably bad plays which may have removed her from the tournament before her relatively unremarkable 15th place. The only other reference to her poker play is a 1st place in a 6 player table of speed poker (heat1, she finished last in the semi final) , which is about as low grade of a victory as you can have, her profit from the tournament was 500 pounds. So there are no TV events according to the Hendon Mob database apart from this. The only thing notable about her is her result in one competition, and that is a 15th place.<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardigan3000_e325.html" title="User:Cardigan3000">Cardigan3000</a> 09:10, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Now, let's make this clear: I'm a <i>huge</i> poker fan. We're talking hardcore. We're talking playing in biweekly games and watching it on TV whenever possible. With that said, Williamson is- in my opinion- <i>barely</i> notable enough for WP. As stated above, she came in 15th (and was also the highest finishing woman), but that really doesn't confirm notability. Yes, the competition had 5,619 players, so coming in 15th is amazing, but it's not as if she was top three. So I was going to argue deletion until I thought of the criteria for sportspeople, one of which is playing at the highest professional level of one's sport. Even if it was only for a week, and Williamson never does anything spectacular in poker ever again (which, after watching the WSOP many times, wouldn't shock me), she still played at the absolute highest level of poker. As a result, I've decided that the article is worth keeping, but only by a hair. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 11:31, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Vanity page about an academic, full of stuff like "Cohen describes herself as "math prof / mathematician / poet / writer / classical pianist /thrift-shopper / mother / grandmother / scrabbler extraordinaire". Sure, a sucessfull career as an academic, but unless having a job euqals notability, there's not much of substance here. Sometimes I'd speedy stuff like this, but there's already been some talk page discussion so I figure it's best to give this one some discussion in case there's disagreement."</p>

<dd>I can see pretty clearly that her books definitely exist, but other than that, I see one possible non-trivial independent review, and no notable awards.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't believe the article yet evidences multiple independent reviews of the sort that are meant. The MentalHelp.net one is a solid independent review. The Temple University Press one looks like it is - but on closer inspection they are the publisher of the book in question, so the review can't be called independent. Whe WISSP and Greenwood things don't muster up to being reviews in my eyes. 05:04, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

To be a notable musician, one has to accomplish more than simply play with someone who's famous. I mean, if he recorded a solo project, or was featured in a reputable magazine of some kind, maybe. As it stands, I don't see how he can be determined notable to warrant his own article. By the way, an IMDB page isn't reason enough to keep his article. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJustinmeister_cfe3.html" title="User:Justinmeister">Justinmeister</a> 01:32, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh, Jesus, another one of <i>these</i> deletion discussions: "I had no idea you actually had rules about what gets kept and what doesn't, and I resent it very much that you actually try to enforce them." Plus the homophobia angle (which is ridiculous, as <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_Wikipedians_be72.html" title="Category:LGBT Wikipedians">these people</a> can attest).<br />
Read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. According to Alexa (<a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOG_53bf.html#Bias_in_the_Alexa_test" title="WP:GOOG">which does have its limitations as a measure of popularity, we're aware</a>), you're not even in the top 100,000 sites. I know the page says that's not reliable, but let's face it if you were really a high-traffic site you'd probably be here already.<br />
Now, within the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#Criteria_for_web_content" title="WP:WEB">criteria</a> , and considering that Wikipedia already has <a href="../../../l/g/b/Category%7ELGBT_websites_2be9.html" title="Category:LGBT websites">a few articles on gay websites</a>, can you tell us and show sources to prove that your site is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>?

<p>I don't think we can win this one....though justin's idea IS worth a shot but perhaps the good folk of wikipedia should be more understanding and less rude to people who are simply trying to make an article<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Kshoaf (<a href="../../../k/s/h/User_talk%7EKshoaf_fa5a.html" title="User talk:Kshoaf">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kshoaf_a213.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kshoaf">contribs</a>) .</small></p>
<p>Also regarding the idea of creating the article every time it is deleted won't work because pages can be proetect against recreation if you try that. Its not going to work and if a page was a simple recration it would be speedy deleted much faster than this. Also for a bit of advice accusing people who are deleting an article that viloates Wikipedia rules of being rude will not help you case. --Edgelord 05:53, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Wikipedia is a simple reflection of the sources available in these cases. People in the world at large simply don't write about Bregans. Whereas they write <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulbasaur.html#Notes_and_references" title="Bulbasaur">reams and reams</a> about Pokémon characters. If you think that this is unbalanced, then campaign for people in the world at large to stop writing about Pokémon characters and start writing about Latin textbook characters. Persuade the world to <i>make more source material</i> on the latter. Wikipedia is not the tool for fixing any perceived disproportionate skews of the corpus of human knowledge.

<dd>Consider that many of these, particularly this one, are related to campaigns. A few weeks after November they will effectively be dead. In a year they will no longer be encyclopedic, particularly if the candidate loses. Any news generated by the blog can thus effectively be dealt with in the article about the official supported. We considered that sort of thing when <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> was created. Blogs need to be lasting to be notable. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Daily_Kos_6f8f.html" title="The Daily Kos">The Daily Kos</a> is perhaps the acme of a notable political blog. This is a long way from that.<br />
As for their novelty, consider that in a few years they will be standard, perhaps meriting their own section in articles about political campaigning and such and an external link but not a separate article, IMO, no more than the individual classrooms in a school building would. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 01:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Include</b> The page has been completely changed and the issues that you have talked about are taken out. But im going to disagree. Alexa is a widely used tool on the net and a creditable reference. There are many pages on wikipedia that list alexa. in addition you are referring to googles backlinks but not taking into account that they update on a whim when they want and how they want.... pagerank has not updated in almost 4 months so that is a completely unfair bias. Did you check msn or yahoo? Surch's traffic is far beyond most sites so the suggestion that it’s unknown is simply not true. I understand the issues with the first article but they have been changed.
<p>In addition, surch's alexa rating of 73K is a 3 MONTH average... todays total was 32K and our page views per user was higher than googles. So while we are new and our userbase is not that of the big3 it is growing and our users are consistent.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. --Surch 08:15, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Though the article does look somewhat better than it did when I first nominated it, it's still lacking sources. While I can appreciate that Surch might be a useful tool, unless there are <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> out there that review the site, or something else that makes the article meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, the article cannot be included at this time. Additionally, I believe the editors above that refer to crystal-balling mean that a lot of the reasoning for inclusion of the article is based not on what the website/company has accomplished, but what it expects to -- in other words, that Surch isn't yet well-known, but will be. Let me state that although I still feel the article should be deleted at this time, I have no prejudice against recreation in the future if Surch turns out to be wildly successful and then meets criteria for inclusion (and I wish Surch well in this respect). --<a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbsolutDan_8213.html" title="User:AbsolutDan">AbsolutDan</a> <a href="../../../a/b/s/User_talk%7EAbsolutDan_d238.html" title="User talk:AbsolutDan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 14:28, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Surch has not made in that page any reference to what it expects to do rather what it IS doing. I would suggest a site that gets well over a million uniques a day to be VERY well known. You make suggestion to "wildly successful" show me any site that is other than fortune 500's and then why dont you delete all the rest..that would leave wikipedia with say maybe a few thousand sites. --Surch 21:46, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. I suppose you are, to a point, correct. I will repost when surch meets the standards of Wikipedia. Although Wooty, its funny that you only reference google. I think someone once said... "We are all nothing but a flock of sheep, a button collar starched and bleached." In addition...Who was it, the macintosh boys that were turned down for VC by some no-name banker? Hrm. Funny that. I suppose at this point I will ask that surch be deleted.</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> What makes Agnes Broun notable is the enormity of Burns' place in Scottish culture. She's not just the mother of any old poet. Burns is the poet of a nation. Agnes Broun may not be on the level of John Shakespeare, but from a reseacher's and literary scholar's point of view, her story is a valuable side-note, a fact confirmed by the archival interest in her life. For the record, I am not related to Agnes Broun. Finally, because of Burns' demi-god status, Agnes Broun has become a folk figure.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 06:50, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A "paragraph or two" on the main Burns article would be digressive and, frankly, disruptive of the narrative of the poet's life.

<dd>One cannot be too surprised not to find any academic paper on Agnes Broun, esp. of those listed on Google scholar search. She will always be a minor figure of literary history and folklore, not the sort of person on which academic careers are built. Still, those academics and lay-scholars wanting to learn more about Burns will find joy and interest in learning more about his mother. If not on Wiki, where else? It's a little hard to grasp why one would want to suppress such information, tho I am totally new to Wiki, so I probably am misunderstanding some aspect of protocol.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 05:44, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps the best place to put information on her is into an article on her son at the moment. There are other examples of historical figures with peripherally interesting family members having their biographies expanded with information on the family member. That way the information itself remains "unsuppressed". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:12, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I hear you, but I respectfully disagree. Some of the info would certainly work in Robbie's article, but much of it just doesn't fit. There is a great spectrum of notability, and Agnes is on the lighter side, but Burns' scholars and enthustiasts will take interest nonetheless in these small gems. Anyway, I don't want to repeat myself and wear out my welcome -- I think I've said all I can in this debate. I appreciate people's interest in Burns and his family.--<a href="../../../w/b/r/User%7EWbroun_9d2a.html" title="User:Wbroun">Wbroun</a> 08:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this is a hoax. It was added by a user with essentially no other contributions. I can't find any hits on Google or Google Books that are not derived from Wikipedia. The source cited are 12 volumes of a book from 1892. I know a fair amount about Anglo-Scandinavian history of the period and I think I would have heard about someone who saved Canute's life twice. There was an <i>Ulfcytel</i> who fought at the Battle of Ashingdon - but he was on Edmund's side and he was killed in the battle. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 08:40, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - difficult one as I suspect you may be right in that he didn't exist. Nevertheless, it may be that there is some myth that has been reported as fact in the Yorkshire Inquisitions. Should we just delete because we personally can't check the records? I've come down for delete on the basis that there aren't multiple sources, and the source cited can't be a primary source as it isn't contemporaneous.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm no expert but reading the articles, Ulfkeitel Couplande saved Cnut's life in 1015 and as a reward was granted land in Cumbria.

<dd>Indeed. <i>Ulfkeitel</i> is presumably intended as a version of Ulfkell/Úlfkell/Ulfketill/Úlfketill/Ulfcytel/Ulfcetel etc. though it isn't one I've seen before. <i>Couplande</i> is more difficult; it would presumably be an Anglicization of something like *<i>Kaupland</i> though I'm not familiar with that as a byname. Thus we might have something like "Ulfkell af Kauplandi" but that doesn't help me at all in finding anything about this purported person. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur</a> 09:24, 1 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Changed to <b>Keep</b> - I apologise if I unfairly characterized your actions.

Considering almost every other country has their own page, there's no reason why this shouldn't be split off as well (though obviously the South Africa section on the main article needs cutting back in that case).

<dd><b>Comment</b>; I've been through most of the citations from Jamie (thanks for the detailed list).

<p>Mr. Christie - thanks for doing a great job editing. But since you've looked at the contribution I've continued to add to it and feel that it actually does comply with <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> which states that:</p>
<p>The criteria for companies and corporations requires that the company or corporation has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself. This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations.</p>
<p>As you can see there are considerably more than just the third party article you noted. I just hadn't the time to finish adding everything - the contribution is only a few hours old. These are comparable to other companies that have been used for their justification. Here's a list:</p>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is a book about the SCG's area; can't tell from Amazon what level of coverage there is. Jamie, could you give some information about the contents? Does it treat SCG specifically as a subject, e.g. by devoting a chapter to SCG? Or does it mention them as a background name, by saying for example that someone mentioned in the book works for them? If this book directly treats SCG as a primary subject, it would be strong evidence for notability. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Christie_b29a.html" title="User:Mike Christie">Mike Christie</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMike_Christie_887a.html" title="User talk:Mike Christie">(talk)</a> 22:11, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This qualifies -- it's an article about the business of security, and it starts with a few seconds of interview with Jamie Smith, who had a bullet in his arm.

<dl>
<dd>This is hard to assess without knowing more about the interview. It sounds as though the topic was the kidnapping, and Jamie is being interviewed in his capacity as an expert. I don't think this contributes much to SCG's own notability. The intention of the notability clause in <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> is that the writer took the business in question as their subject.

<dd>This is an interview with Jamie Smith, the CEO of SCG (and also apparently the creator of this Wikipedia article). He was interviewed in his capacity as an erstwhile instructor of air marshals; the interviewer ends by saying that he is now CEO of SCG International, but there is no other mention of the company.

<p>I'm sure there's something wrong with this. Firstly, the page is very small, and secondly, there is not any piece of useful info there. " Birds on stamps is a very common theme in philately. Every country has produced some bird stamps. Often these are masterpieces of stamp design." - even a philatelist or an ornithologist wouldn't find anything of use here.

<dd>In that case, perhaps <i>all</i> the parts of the war should go, particularly if they aren't all equally notable. Another alternative would be to subsume all the constituent parts into one article (such as this one), so that everything can be in the one place rather than risking deletion for non-notability or other reasons when it's split off into separate articles. A third alternative, particularly if there's some overarching need to have this particular article here, would be to add more sources to this one. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 07:06, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That article isn't and shouldn't be simply about multiculturalism or people getting along with each other.

<p>Other articles similar to this one, such as Westies, should also be deleted. Slang terms to represent petty class, ethnic and political differences in Sydney do not need articles dedicated to them. Such an article will be based on biased sources (the primary source at the moment is from an online opinion column) and will also be succeptible to easy manipulation by those who want to discredit other groups. Article neutrality can't be claimed when the sources are opinionated.</p>
<p>I don't want to think about how poor an article on parochialism in my home city would be. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBeneaththelandslide_8597.html" title="User:Beneaththelandslide">michael</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBeneaththelandslide_de8f.html" title="User talk:Beneaththelandslide">talk</a></sup> 04:52, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'm still not sold on this "well documented" idea. The links provided on the article mention the general <i>concept</i> of parochialism in Sydney (so we know it exists, but nothing more). Failing that, the ones which actually identify more about the phenomenon are blogs and the like, which are questionable sources. It might be my Historian Hat talking here, but for something to be "well documented", there really should be more neutral sources talking about how the different parts of the city are viewed or perceived. This is the sort of thing I'd imagine a sociologist would have written something on, for example. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 12:15, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Your sources are by no means reputable or "well documented".

<p>This article reads as a thinly veiled ad for what is currently an insignificant product on the Mac. Not every application needs or deserves a WP page. <a href="../../../p/b/o/User%7EPbones_e705.html" title="User:Pbones">pbones</a> 18:53, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> – The article does read like an advertisement, but after a rewrite I should be kept. AppZapper was reviewed by Macworld <a href="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macgems/2006/06/appzapper/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macgems/2006/06/appzapper/index.php" rel="nofollow">[37]</a> a while ago and did get some coverage on other Mac related websites. I don't see why every app shouldn't deserve a page on Wikipedia, I mean, there articles on virtually every little detail, non-notable to some, in the Star Wars movies. A lot of small applications are covered in this encyclopedia, from open source commandline ones to commercial applications, and I think that's a good thing, in regard to completeness, as long as the articles don't read like an advertisement. <strong><a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaester_mensch_68e0.html" title="User:Maester mensch">mensch</a></strong> • <strong><small><a href="../../../m/a/e/User_talk%7EMaester_mensch_7c13.html" title="User talk:Maester mensch">t</a></small></strong> 21:14, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Delete</b> - Star Wars is viewed and loved by tens of millions of fans. Random Mac applications are not. As for why every application -shouldn't- have a page, my answer would be that VersionTracker and MacUpdate handle this just fine, it's outside of WP's domain for all but the most notable applications (Photoshop, Office, etc.). <a href="../../../p/b/o/User%7EPbones_e705.html" title="User:Pbones">pbones</a> 06:02, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Thus, <b>speedy keep</b> as a nomination made by a banned user. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 18:58, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</s></li>

I don't think redirecting to <a href="../../../n/a/m/Names_of_large_numbers.html" title="Names of large numbers">names of large numbers</a> is right, as most links to <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trillion.html" title="Trillion">trillion</a> want information about the actual number, not the name of it.

<p>Another minor royal personage connected to the British and Romanian royal families. Article was prod'd, prod removed. The subject is approx 85th in line for the British throne and may or may not be in line for the Romanian throne were the monarchy ever to be restored there (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Angelica_Kreuger_2239.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angelica Kreuger">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Angelica Kreuger</a> for discussion of hypothetical Romanian succession.) Beyond 85th in line and being a granddaughter of ex-King Michael (but not of a reigning monarch as she was born after Michael was exiled) the article makes no claims to notability. It is, inevitably, unreferenced. Google hits are the usual WP and echoes plus royalty sites, none of which constitute <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

The dying of a tumor in his rectum is also suspicious. It appears that there is someone in the present day who had the same name, which may be the person being attacked.

<p>Unused disambiguation page (no article links to it). Also an unlikely search term, although one editor has claimed to have searched on it before.

<li><b>Keep</b> as useful onward direction. I am the user who has searched on the term. I have also nominated articles to be merged there rather than standalone, ie combine Secularisation of Christams and Spring Holiday into one article. It might not be a good example of a disambiguation page. It is however, a useful redirect page to two articles on related topics without producing unnecessary forking and/or repetition. It is highly unlikely looking at the current state of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Spring_Holiday_2114.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Spring Holiday">AfD on Spring Holiday</a>, that that article will be deleted. A redirect to the more specific article will still be useful. I don't think people would guess wihtougt this linking article that one would find information about an aspect of the secularisation of Easter under the title "Spring Holiday". I disagree that it is POV to suggest that "Spring Holiday" is evidence of secularisation of Easter. That is what that article is about and current references 1, 2, &amp; 9 support that assertion, particularly the reference to <i>Bridenbaugh v. O'Bannon</i>, where the US Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals cited, in part, that referring to Good Friday as "Spring Holiday" was evidence of a secular purpose and therefore not unconstitutional. To my mind this is quite adequate and neutral evidence that "Spring Holiday" is one aspect of secularization of Christian holidays.--<a href="../../../a/y/a/User%7EAYArktos_139f.html" title="User:AYArktos">Arktos</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/a/User_talk%7EAYArktos_b1bb.html" title="User talk:AYArktos">talk</a></sup> 10:50, 27 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I strongly disagree that <i>Bridenbaugh</i> is evidence for the "secularization of Easter". All it means is that giving people Good Friday off is ok if it's called something else. The POV that that constitutes "secularization" is not neutral. I continue to maintain that the phenomenon of "Spring Holiday" has nothing to do with any supposed "secularization" of Easter. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> <sup><small><small><a href="../../../l/t/p/User_talk%7ELtPowers_d522.html" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a></small></small></sup> 14:34, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> I believe this article should stay on Wikipedia for the following reasons: 1. This is not a vanity or promotional page for the band. 2. This article provides information about the first virtual/concept band in the Philippines and their achievements. 3. It focuses on a band that is pioneering a new genre in the Philippine music scene. 4. <a href="../../../m/i/s/Mistula.html" title="Mistula">Mistula</a> gives a glimpse of the current innovations that impact the Philippine rock scene. 5. This supports the Wikipedia article <a href="../../../v/i/r/Virtual_band.html" title="Virtual band">virtual band</a>, where Mistula was used as an example. --Webmessiah 18:09, 26 August 2006 (UTC)Webmessiah</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> As Webmessiah stated, Mistula is the first virtual band in the Philippines, and they are indeed pioneering a new genre in the local music scene.

<p>This page has created a redundancy in the Smallville episode pages. <a href="../../../s/m/a/Template%7ESmallville_4a7a.html" title="Template:Smallville">Seasonal</a> pages have already been in place for almost a year, while this page has just been created. This page is in poor quality and contains incorrect information. Though it may be a more common practice to list episodes this way, it isn't a mandatory practice. The Seasonal pages have been around longer, and have managed to condense the information into what is important, instead of creating individual episode pages that just draw out the plot details. Seasonal pages are an improvement on "episode lists". They don't create excess pages for needless plot details, keep "trivia" to what is important and noteable, keep "guest stars" to major roles and not "the milk man standing in the background barely in focus". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 17:51, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Guidelines are not concrete, and Smallville Season pages are an improvement on the "list of episode" type pages. There are not enough "allusions" per episode to provide support for an entire episode page, but, there are so many in a season that it's good to have a page to list them all. Smallville is unique to most television shows, because it has multiple mediums to allude to for the same character. What is proposed for Smallville is having 6 or so seasonal pages, as opposed to having 130+ episode pages that, for no other reason than to expand a plot into scene for scene description, doesn't have enough info to support a page. Writers and Directors can be listed with the short plot description on the seasonal page. True trivia can be noted under that, because true trivia doesn't occur in every single episode. Quotes are reserved for Wikiquote. Seasonal pages list important guest stars, not every Joe Blow in the show. Also, you should note that all episodes in the Season pages are linked to WikiCities <a href="http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external free" title="http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page</a>, where that type of information (expanded plot, goofs, all guest stars [even ones that are not prominant in the episode], and other less than encyclopedic information) is more appropriate. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 18:52, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Arguments against Deletion</b> The content and quality of the seasonal pages will be preserved and moved to new articles for each episode. Having an article for each episode allows more information about each episode to be preserved in an appropriate location. The seasonal summary pages and List of Smallville allusions have to exclude otherwise appropriate information to avoid becoming large and cluttered.</p>
<p>The page was only recently created; that is not finished is no reason to delete it. A tag at the top of the page appropriately notes this fact. It is not linked to from the main <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_Series%29_095a.html" title="Smallville (TV Series)">Smallville</a> article, not will it be until it is ready.</p>
<p>The format proposed follows the guidelines set forth in <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a>. List of Smallville allusions is strong evidence that there is "enough independently verifiable information included about individual episodes" to warrant individual episode pages.</p>
<p><b>Debate History</b> The debate grew out of a discussion of what merited inclusion in List of Smallville allusions (Talk). I (<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony">Anþony</a>) proposed that the Allusions page be eventually removed in favor of a Trivia or References section in individual episode pages yet to be created. Upon learning of the plan to create pages for each episode, the discussion spilled over into <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_Smallville_episodes_62b1.html" title="Talk:List of Smallville episodes">Talk:List of Smallville episodes</a>, where <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> immediately suggested deleting the page in favor of the current per-season format.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per reasons stated above. -<a href="../../../a/n/%C3%BE/User%7EAn%C3%BEony_a6df.html" title="User:Anþony">Anþony</a> 18:43, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Why should it be a work in progress to begin with? Individual pages contain information that is highly unencyclopedic to begin with, and better suited for Wikia (where all the episodes are already linked to in the Season pages). Why should a creation even begin if pages that are already in place, and doing quite well in editorship, need a little fixing up themselves? Deviations are sometimes needed with guidelines, especially ones that create needless pages. Oh, and as for the "Allusions" page, that is better suited in Wikia also. By principle it's trivia, and trivia is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 18:52, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What information about TV shows should be included in an online encyclopedia is definitely controversial. What's encyclopedic to one person may be unencyclopedic to another. It's a matter of opinion. I've been working on these kind of pages for a while and my guestimate is that it's about 40/60 or 50/50 for delete/keep. Without a consensus for deletion these pages usually stay. Also, being on wikia not does not mean it shouldn't be on wikipedia. We're trying to create a one-stop shop. As for the "allusions" page, it has been nominated for deletion several times and survived. It will probably be nominated again, most likely with the same results. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 00:07, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Wikipedia has a nice definition of what is usually considered encyclopedic, and unless justifiable you can assume that it isn't. Trivia is always considered unencyclopedic, because it usually involves fanboy information. Special guest stars are trivia, because they are "special guests" and not "recurring guests". Goofs fall under trivia. Quotes have their own Wiki site. Featured music is also trivia, because there is nothing special about it, it changes each episode. Just because you want to note it as a fan doesn't make it any less unencyclopedic, which is where Wikia comes in. Visit some of the episode pages, you'll find that many have the information you are trying to put in a Wikipedia page. There is no such thing as a "one stop shop". If you are linking to another Wikipedia page then that's the same as linking to a Wikia page. You aren't putting all this information into one page, you are creating 130 pages, which is hardly a "one stop shop". Keep it where it belongs. Oh, and the fact that "Allusions" has been nominated and never deleted doesn't change the fact that it's in the wrong place. It is relevant, because the allusions are so relevant to the show, just not this site. They are still unencyclopedic, and should be at Wikia. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 05:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. This discussion has happened with many list of episode pages and the result has been to keep them. Instead of trying to get rid of just this page you might put your effort into creating consensus to remove all lists like this. You could start <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_talk%7EWikiProject_List_of_Television_Episodes_2c95.html" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject List of Television Episodes">here</a>. If the general rule becomes that pages like this don't belong on wikipedia then I would support deletion. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 06:41, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Just because a bunch of fans get together to overrule policy doesn't make it correct. Policy is not guideline. Everything you wish to add to a single episode is fancruft, and by doing so a violation of policy about this encyclopedia. Just because currently other shows are getting away with it does not make it "standard". Not everyone can monitor everything, and you usually have fans creating/editing things of that nature. Also, by creating this page, and the 130 other pages of episodes you will be deleting information that already exists. Everyone of the episodes have already been created on Wikia (in their proper place), all you have to do is click their titles. YOU are creating the redundancy, because they already exist. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></dd>

It stipulates that you do a Show Page (i.e. <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_%28TV_series%29_b037.html" title="Smallville (TV series)">Smallville (TV series)</a>), then you do a Season page (i.e. <a href="../../../s/m/a/Smallville_season_5.html" title="Smallville season 5">Smallville season 5</a>) (you'll note it says "logical division" and an entire list of episodes altogether is not a division), then you do episode pages. Also, note that this page is part of the <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_915c.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion</a> page, which is about discussing changes to Wikipedia Policy, where <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_List_of_Television_Episodes_2334.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject List of Television Episodes">Wikipedia:WikiProject List of Television Episodes</a> was created by a user bypassing Wiki's policy change page. Even the WikiProject page lists the CD page as policy, in it's "additional guidelines" section. The question now is not about who is right, because technically, both the season page and the list page is a format for creating the TV show, but the question is which has the right of way. Preference for one style or the other is an opinion, and we know what opinions are here at Wikipedia. If the List page had been created first I would yield, but the Season pages were created months before this page and they are in better working order (minus some changes that need to be made to the summaries and a coulpe other fixer-ups, but much better than the List page). This isn't about what editors prefer, but about which was used first. The Season pages have seniority over the List page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a standard, conventional list of episodes. Not being a <i>Smallville</i> fan, I don't understand all this talk of "allusions". At the moment the page looks hideous and is in need of a massive cleanup. Summaries need rewriting to be more encyclopaedic. The images are superfluous: they are mainly there for decoration, don't add anything to the content, and are thus, against fair use policy. The problem with this type of show is that it attracts early teen fanboys to add unproffessional elements. I'd rather see it deleted than be kept in it's current awful state. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_JPS_fb9e.html" title="User:The JPS"><font color="purple">The <b>JP</b>S</font></a><sup><a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_JPS_6a61.html" title="User talk:The JPS"><b><font color="purple"><b>talk</b> to me</font></b></a></sup> 19:13, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Per request for review of my vote (see <a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html#List_of_Smallville_episodes" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">User_talk:Armedblowfish#List_of_Smallville_episodes</a>), I've noticed that there seems to be two issues being discussed here: a) should individual episode articles be created and b) should the episodes be listed all on one page, or by season.</li>
<li>For the first issue, as I stated above, I have no problem with individual episode as long as the season articles are first well referenced, episode by episode. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=aL6&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=Smallville+episodes&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=aL6&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=Smallville+episodes&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">a google search for Smallville episodes</a> reveals a large number of hits, suggesting that this shouldn't be a problem. You should, of course, also use the episodes themselves (primary sources) as references, see {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_visual_0bd6.html" title="Template:Cite visual">cite visual</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_episode_0190.html" title="Template:Cite episode">cite episode</a>}}. However, please be aware of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html#Primary_and_secondary_sources" title="WP:OR">WP:OR#Primary_and_secondary_sources</a>, which explains acceptable uses of primary sources. In addition, while a number of the google hits may not meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for factual information about the episodes, citing them for their opinions and analysis (with attribution) shouldn't be a problem.</li>
<li>As for the second issue, it was initially my understanding that season articles would be preferred if there were no individual episode articles, and a list would be preferred if there were individual episode articles. However, if I was wrong about this, and individual episode articles are created, but season articles are kept instead of one big list, consider creating a category for Smallville episodes as a compromise. The category could be organized by season/episode number instead of alphabetically, see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Category%7EStargate_SG-1_episodes_4be7.html" title="Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes">Category:Stargate SG-1 episodes</a> for an example. — <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 21:32, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that the pages need to be well referenced. I think this is best done on each episodes own page so I have included a references section on each (<a href="../../../p/i/l/Pilot_%28Smallville_episode%29_af88.html" title="Pilot (Smallville episode)">see here</a>). Currently it just lists where the featured music info comes from but it can be expanded easily. This will allow for different references for each episode as needed. The season pages weren't well referenced and hopefully this will move us in the right direction. - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeregrinefisher_9f3a.html" title="User:Peregrinefisher">Peregrinefisher</a> 21:55, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not exactly sure how referencing each episode individually would be easier on the individual pages. Wouldn't it be better to start by providing minimal per-episode references on the season pages, and expand to individual episode pages when you have enough references to draw material from to justify doing so? If it's a matter of organization, see <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cite/Cite.php" class="extiw" title="m:Cite/Cite.php">m:Cite/Cite.php</a>. (Of course, as one of the editors ultimately writing the articles, how you go about referencing them is up to you. Consider this advice. Having well-referenced episode articles will make them less likely to be deleted as non-notable fancruft.) <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 22:27, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, to use inline references (Cite.php), you basically enclose the citation in &lt;ref&gt; and &lt;/ref&gt; tags after the piece of text you are referencing, and put &lt;references /&gt; on the bottom of the page in a section entitled "References" (or possibly "Citations"). See {{<a href="../../../i/m/d/Template%7EImdb_b0cc.html" title="Template:Imdb">imdb</a>}} for citing the IMDB. For example, &lt;ref name="IMDBlamo"&gt;{{imdb name|id=2238804|name=Adrian Lamo}}&lt;/ref&gt; produces:<sup id="_ref-IMDBlamo_0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDBlamo" title="">[1]</a></sup> (Click on the little number to see the reference at the bottom of this AfD). By using the name attribute,<sup id="_ref-IMDBlamo_1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDBlamo" title="">[1]</a></sup> I can use a reference multiple times,<sup id="_ref-IMDBlamo_2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDBlamo" title="">[1]</a></sup> while only having to type out the whole thing once, and only having it appear once on the bottom of the page.<sup id="_ref-IMDBlamo_3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-IMDBlamo" title="">[1]</a></sup> For citation after the first one, I simply type &lt;ref name="IMDBlamo" /&gt;. Wikia does not actually meet <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, being not only another wiki, <s>but part of our very own Wikimedia foundation</s>, thus constituting a self-reference. (You can of course link to Wikia, just not as a reference.)</dd>
<dd>Other templates you can use in between the ref tags (or outside them) are {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_visual_0bd6.html" title="Template:Cite visual">cite visual</a>}}<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[2]</a></sup>, {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_episode_0190.html" title="Template:Cite episode">cite episode</a>}},<sup id="_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#_note-1" title="">[3]</a></sup> and {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}<sup id="_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#_note-2" title="">[4]</a></sup>. (Also see <a href="../../../c/i/t/Category%7ECitation_templates_53be.html" title="Category:Citation templates">Category:Citation templates</a>.) You can, of course, construct your own citations by hand.<sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#_note-3" title="">[5]</a></sup> (If you want to see the text for the later examples, just look at the wiki source for this page.)

Basically, it thought everything in the article after the initial opening &lt;ref&gt; tag was part of the reference. (An easy mistake to make.) Also see <a href="../../../e/x/t/Category%7EExternal_link_templates_fe2b.html" title="Category:External link templates">Category:External link templates</a>, which among other things lists different IMDB templates for different URL formats. However, apparently {{<a href="../../../i/m/d/Template%7EImdb_title_0e33.html" title="Template:Imdb title">imdb title</a>}} adds a closing slash that causes the particular URL you want to link to to break. So I substed it (note that substing does not work withing &lt;ref&gt; tags) and fixed the URL manually. I also appended the date I retreived the URL on, which is standard for {{<a href="../../../c/i/t/Template%7ECite_web_57d4.html" title="Template:Cite web">cite web</a>}}, and a good idea for web references (in case the page changes or disappears). <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 01:47, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

In addition, having had a look at them, the "season" pages are also in need of having the "magazine teaser" style summaries re-written.

<li><b>Keep</b> Currently this page looks pretty ugly to me, clean it up and sumarise the episodes. Keep long info on the ep. page it's self. Also be more careful when chosing stills for episodes and make show they offer criticaal commentery for the episode in question and that the imagery info being conveyed is also conveyed in the summary. <font face="Tahoma"><b>thanks</b>/MatthewFenton (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MatthewFenton_0db4.html" title="Special:Contributions/MatthewFenton">contribs</a>)</font> 14:45, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - If someone knows an episode's title and doesn't know what season it's in, this is a much more convenient way to find it. The page should, of course, be cleaned up properly and should list all the episodes with a link to the individual episode's page (even if the episode doesn't have its own page yet). There can be a small summary of the episode as well, but I don't think that's necessary. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvtheheaven_f64a.html" title="User:Luvtheheaven">Emily</a> <sup><font color="red">(<a href="../../../l/u/v/User_talk%7ELuvtheheaven_b19c.html" title="User talk:Luvtheheaven">Funtrivia Freak</a>)</font></sup> 19:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're ignoring Policy that I provided regarding TV episode pages and their associated pages. It doesn't matter what opinion is, not every episode deserves a page. Also, the votes were not for deleting the Season pages, please realize that your opinion is not 100% carried through the group. I think that a List of the Episodes 1-whatever is fine, but you are carrying information that is redundant fromm other articles. The DVD list is in the main page, which makes it irrelevant to the List page. You are not respecting the policy of TV pages (which is what it is, as per the Centralized Discussion which determines policy change). I think the List will be fine if it's just a list with the basics, and a link to the season pages for details on the Episodes. It does state explicitly in the CD that expanded plots are not for the episode pages. I have no problem with expanding the information in general per episode on the Seasonal pages. We can make both pages work to our benefit, but I think (and since the idea that most episode pages can't support themselves is clear in the CD) creating 100+ episode pages is unnecessary unless relevant. With a nice, condensed, clean plot summary (slightly smaller than what's on the season page) we can create enough space to include "relevant" trivia (as per <a href="../../../t/r/i/Wikipedia%7ETrivia_16ca.html" title="Wikipedia:Trivia">Wikipedia:Trivia</a> suggests) that manage to keep what everyone wants. It's clear that everyone wants to keep the List page, but it's clear that atleast 3 of the votes are not for deleting the Season pages. I think a nice compromise can be reach with regard to both articles, can you can be rest assured that votes for deletion on the season pages will go about the same as this one. Most people that edit those pages don't know of this page, as I didn't know of it until just recently (and I've been editing Smallville since I joined). <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the Season pages are deleted but their content preserved, the edit histories should be preserved somewhere for GFDL reasons. You could either a) copy the edit histories to the talk page of the episode list or b) make them redirects to the episode list. I would reccomend the latter, as it preserves the most information. <a href="../../../a/r/m/User%7EArmedblowfish_0e51.html" title="User:Armedblowfish">Armedblowfish</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/m/User_talk%7EArmedblowfish_5587.html" title="User talk:Armedblowfish">talk</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Armedblowfish_d1c9.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Armedblowfish">mail</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Armedblowfish_14be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Armedblowfish">contribs</a>) 22:33, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Currently, Peregrinefisher and I are discussing how we can make both pages their best, while preserving them (seeing as that is what most people want, and how it will turn out if a "merger" is proposed on the season pages ((i know those editors, they'll fight hard)). If anyone is curious about the details of the discussion see Peregrinefisher's talk page, and mine for the back and forth of it all. It's a little much to put here without bogging the page. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBignole_566d.html" title="User:Bignole">Bignole</a> 01:54, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This dispute does not seem to be about "This" article, but rather the concept of individual episode articles. The way I've seen it done on many articles is that you have a <i>List of episodes</i> article, then when that gets big you trim the list down to brief summaries, then link to something that goes into more detail about each episode (such as an episode article, season article, or story arc article). <a href="../../../l/i/s/WP%7ELISTS_2571.html" title="WP:LISTS">WP:LISTS</a> states that lists can be articles in list format or navigation aids, or a little of both. Allowing the reader to view all the titles and air dates on one list is very much a navigational aid, and it can be an article in that not every reader wants to dive into that much detail just to identify an episode. I suggest not creating episode articles yet, instead change the links on the <i>List of episodes</i> article to point to article sections on the season articles. -- <a href="../../../n/e/d/User%7ENed_Scott_33cb.html" title="User:Ned Scott">Ned Scott</a> 02:03, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The term is important and necessary. The term canist (carnism) is separate and distinct from carnivore and omnivore; it points to the ideology involved when once chooses to consume meat. No other word fits this unique description.Cyberrd 22:55, 26 August 2006 (UTC)Dina Aronson <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Cyberrd (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyberrd_0a41.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyberrd">contribs</a>) has made little or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></li>

<li><b>"Do Not Delete"</b> Despite the assertions of the initial poster, "carnism" is becoming increasingly widely used throughout the vegetarian community. Google includes citations from Seventh Day Adventist sites, as well as more mainstream vegan ones. Carnism also appears in the literature of several languages. And, finally, carnism is also an accepted term in the psychological literature. As for bias, Dr. Joy is entirely right in pointing out that carnism is biased in exactly the same way that all all ideological descriptors are biased. If the editors wouldn't delete "communism" or any other "-ism" for being biased, then how do they differentiate "carnism?"

I don't have any strong feelings either way about the "political" nature of the term -- the criteria should be whether or not it's notable enough for an entry.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> As a sometimes carnist, what I read in the re-edit by the original author showed neither “an incredible bias” nor an “unbalanced viewpoint”. The “see also” section is evidence of this in that the links range from diet, ideologies and different types of consumption for comparison and contrast that relate to carnism to offer more expansive comprehension. With regard to the statement that “Widipedia is not a soapbox”, the article does not appear to be delivering any sort of speech, appeal or political tirade favoring either vegetarianism, carnism or the lifestyle choice of breatharians. It is simply clarifying a dominant belief system with regard to human consumption. There is no evidence of advocacy, self-promotion or advertising. Though carnism may not be widely known, it is discussed in the recently published book Vegetarians and Vegans in America Today. --Lexnay 20:13, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do not Delete:</b> As a Universtiy Lecturer, I think this entry be left on wikipedia. I also think it should be refined to include more details of its definition and application. I will be teaching about this ideology in a course in the Fall - to a class of 300 students. There are significant mentions of carnism in acadmic literature (some are referenced above) and the coining of the term has had sinficiant impacts for discourse surrounding dominant ideologies and their unmarked nature. I have made reference to this in my own writings and will soon be presenting on carnism at an international conference. I would consider the limited number of search engine hits as relating to the the term be a recent creation and the number will increase rapidly in coming times. I strongly recommend this article not be deleted - i will help my student specifically, and i think it needs to be discussed mroe broadly. Deletion of this article will reinforce its necessity to be exposed as an unmarked ideology - as it will further illustrate its pervasiveness.

<li><b>"Do Not Delete"</b> I'm not too hip to editing Wikipedia, and only just (finally) registered to make this opinion more "official," but I do often use the site as a first point of reference when researching a new phrase or concept. I suppose now that I've finally registered, I will be more actively involved in contributing to the site, so I wouldn't consider this a single-purpose account. As someone who relies on Wikipedia frequently, I think it would be a shame if those who do come across the term "carnist" cannot look it up at Wikipedia due to some sort of bias against words that are not as commonly used by the media as, say, "flexitarian." As the voice behind <a href="http://www.ananimalfriendlylife.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.ananimalfriendlylife.com/" rel="nofollow">An Animal-Friendly Life</a>, a website with an international readership -- and the composer of an above-linked blog entry using the term -- I have found the word invaluable in describing a mindset that has otherwise not previously been sufficiently described. Is the purpose of Wikipedia to validate the "gatekeepers" or to inform the public? Removing this term from Wikipedia will make it less accurate, not more so.

<li>This doesn't make any sense. The word carnism was coined specifically to describe an ideology. The evidence is all around that people choose to consume meat, and to defend that practice, even though they don't need to eat it. To choose to eat meat (carnism) is as ideological as the choice not to (vegetarianism or veganism), so how can you say that there is no evidence that carnism is not an ideology? That's the whole point of the word. There has not been an effective term 'til now that describes the doctrine of eating meat, and carnivore doesn't make that cut because it describes the dietary needs of an animal, rather than one's actual choices.<a href="../../../e/p/s/User%7EEpskionline_cabd.html" title="User:Epskionline">Epskionline</a> 04:11, 1 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment In reference to the IP address used (I am the 'University Lecturer') above as indicative of my 'first time' editing, i am currently on holiday and using a friends machine. I have been active in Open Source/GPL activities for many years. I have followed the rise of Wikipedia, and made (only a handful) of contributions over a long period of time (this is not a sinlge purpose account as charged). To actually address the issue at hand - which i think any discussion of this should focus on on - it embodies whether this term is useful, insightful and encyclopedic. It is a relativley new term which is directly reflected in its limited 'visible' usage. This is also sigificantly restrictetd to academia. These are not in any way valid reasons for its deletion. Most new concepts that have substantial merit come from the 'margins' of social engagement in acedmic discourse well before they began to have influence and be adtoped more broadly. Need i provide multitude examples of this? Marxism is just one - how many people no wear (albeit significantly misconstrued) a Che Guevara print T-shirt? When social critique pertans to the status quo or what is considered 'normal' in dominant discourse, the responses here are expected. They further illustrate the tenacity of such critiques. The recent comments by 'I eat meat' very clearly illustrate this. Further to this, not all academic papers are either published (i.e. conference proceedings, dissertations, etc. This is where most new concepts receive significant attention) or published in readily available sources outside academia. These again indicate how many positions for deletion included above are not consistent. Carnism is an ideology, if unmarked, just like sexism (and many others) is. At a time sixism was considered 'normal' and thus an ideology. I think i have made some clear points and hope people address the issue at hand with a reflexive critical awareness and not in a similar vein to some of those above. This issue is worthy of such critical consideration and, as such, very worthy of being included in Wikipedia.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> You, a supporter of keeping the term on Wikipedia, have actually just given the strongest reason to delete so far. "It is a relatively new term which is directly reflected in its limited 'visible' usage. This is also sigificantly restrictetd to academia." According to our guideline on Neologisms (<a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>), a neologism of that sort is precisely the kind of word that does not deserve an article on Wikipedia. People wear a Che Guevara print T-shirt. That has entered the social zeitgeist. Assuming that you're actually correct about this term being encyclopedic, come back in ten years when it's reached that level of popularity. Come back when it has achieved substantial "critical consideration" that you think it deserves.

<p>I removed the prod tag because I feel that, at the very least, the subject is sufficiently notable that he may meet the threshold. I have doubts about its deletion and feel that this should be brought to the community for discussion. He's been exhibited in high-profile galleries and the like. I'm currently leaning towards keep, as it's a fairly well-written article and I feel it should be given the benefit of the doubt. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 18:08, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

However, at the moment there are no outstanding achievements cited, apart from artist in residence at Millersville University for 2005-2006.

<li>I will personally delete the article. I think it's unfortunate that certain people on Wikipedia feel the need to bully others' articles. I notice you have a few articles proposed for deletion, and I can't say I agree with any of your decisions. I have written a good deal for Wikipedia, and I don't think I will continue to do so. The "wiki" spirit of the whole thing is really overthrown when people create profiles displaying their contributions and, to make things worse, feel they can singlehandedly (and arbitrarily) decide whether something is worthy of inclusion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.136.17.123 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.136.17.123_d7c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.136.17.123">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li>You can't delete it unless you are an admin. Please refrain from <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> (you can get blocked). Nobody is bullying anything. If you're talking to me, I only have one other article proposed for deletion. Well, it's commonly accepted practice here for user pages to display contributions. There is no single-handed and arbitrary deletion here: this is a debate which is open to all users, yourself included to have a mature evaluation. The article does not cite anything particularly significant about this person, so why should we include an article on them? If there are sigificant things which are verifiable, you are welcome to add them to the article, and to let us know that you have done so. Otherwise, you can say here what merits this person being in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 07:01, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is an engineer with a history of contributing to the work of successful bands, and who has a particular reputation within the music community in Liverpool. I understand that the google search that Djibrianuk did yielded very little ("Matthew Edge" Engineer brings back a bit more, but if you actually look at the links for that search, you'll see that his credits with the bands mentioned are indeed verifiable. This guy has worked with most of the important current bands from Liverpool- and worked with in this contextdoesn't just mean putting on the kettle in this context, it means actually sitting at the mixing desk and making sure the products come up to scratch. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 22:49, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not a notable person. No assertions are made about importance, and some exploratory research indicates that there are none to make. To give a general idea: google hits for <i>"gustavo moya"</i>: 571, many of which appear to be about different people. Hits for <i>gumoz</i> (an alias given in the article): 479, many of which are forum pages. Hits for <i>ixaya gustavo</i> (Ixaya is the open source community mentioned in the article): 13. I understand that Google isn't the last word on notability, but I think it's a reasonably admissible metric for gauging the notability of someone who is reportedly heavily involved in technology. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../m/o/e/User%7EMoe_Aboulkheir_cc7f.html" title="User:Moe Aboulkheir">Moe Aboulkheir</a> 19:48, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> this article is a borderline blog. Basically, the only encyclopedic feature of the article is that it states there is a "movement" to save the series. Little sources that would analyse and quantify the "movement", though, aside of having links to some random forum threads and having a few links to sites that kind of sprung up last week, just to show that this nebulous "movement" does exist. And on top of that, links to articles in chronological format... ouch! This does warrant a mention in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stargate_SG-1_3423.html" title="Stargate SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a>, but there's little that <i>can</i> be merged from this article.

<li>On reconsidering, looking at what's already at the Stargate SG-1 article, and the further votes, I've decided to go ahead and speedy end this. You're right, there's really nothing that needs merging. I'm sure any show has fans trying to stop it from being cancelled, and that's the only fact not already at the target page. There is little enough content to speedy delete, but I'm going to make it a redirect to hopefully avoid recreation, and on the off chance anyone does want the history extant to merge something. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 18:46, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's good that Wikipedia judges collections by the merits of the poets and authors they contain instead of the other way around. And <i>Van Gogh's Ear</i> does have more importance than some of the other poetry anthologies already approved on Wikipedia.

This information should be where it belongs - on the article of the season or seasons that he took part in.

<li><b>Comment/Question</b> - For those who suggest Delete/Redirect/Merge and that the information should go on the "page for the show". This is an unique case where the individual appears in 2 seasons as a contestant, so would you duplicate the information on both the Season 6 and the Season 7 pages?

<li>I would set this page as a redirect to the article of the first series the guy appeared in, then put a note or something in his section of that article saying he was also in Big Brother 7: All-Stars, and link it to that article. <b><sub><a href="../../../j/_/d/User_talk%7EJ_Di_c943.html" title="User talk:J Di">talk to</a></sub> <a href="../../../j/_/d/User%7EJ_Di_b918.html" title="User:J Di">JD</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_J_Di_0b1c.html" title="Special:Emailuser/J Di">wants e-mail</a></sup></b> 17:42, 31 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But then what would you put in his article? If it's in the Big Brother series page, it surely should contain information about his actions in the house. If it's only going in one page though, it would be really wierd to see information about Big Brother 7 on the Big Brother 6 page or vice-versa. Since he's appeared on two different seasons of a popular show, I think it's important for him to have his own article. --<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenjaminx_7477.html" title="User:Benjaminx">Benjaminx</a> 23:25, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have my doubts that koumpounophobia is an established term for button phobia, but the phenomenon itself seems to exist, per various news sources. (see talk page).

<li><b>Keep</b> But seriously trim down some of the info. Either that, or trim off much of RuneScape mini-games#Castle Wars and link it to here.

<p><b>Comment</b> The Castle Wars section of RuneScape mini-games -is- this page, with a different opener and the POVcruftGameGuide part of this article removed. When I took the rest of the information over to mini-games, I literally copied and pasted everything beneath the opener and above the 'player types' section, including the tool list. The tool list was collapsed into a few sentences of prose and placed accordingly, the rest was tweaked and slightly reworded to remove NN/guide text. There is little else to be said about the subject whilst remaining this side of relevance, anything additional will fit onto the mini-games article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 00:37, 3 September 2006 (UTC)</p>
