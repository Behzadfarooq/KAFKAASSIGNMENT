<p>Robert L. Howard U.S. Army Special Forces, served five tours in Vietnam and is the only soldier to be nominated for the Medal of Honor three times for three separate actions within a thirteen month period.</p>
<p>He received a direct appointment from Master Sergeant to 1st Lieutenant in 1969, and was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Richard M. Nixon at the White House in 1971. His other awards for valor include the Distinguished Service Cross - our nation's second highest award, the Silver Star - the third highest award, and numerous lesser decorations including eight Purple Hearts. He received his decorations for valor for actions while serving as an NCO (Sergeant First Class). He retired from active duty as a full Colonel on September 29, 1992 after 36 years service.</p>
<p>Robert L. Howard grew up in Opelika, Alabama and enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1956 at age seventeen. During Vietnam, he served in the U.S. Army Special Forces and spent most of his five tours in the MACV-SOG (Military Assistance Command Vietnam Studies and Observations Group) also known as Special Operations Group, which ran classified cross-border operations into Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam. The understrength sixty-man recon company at Kontum in which he served was the Vietnam War's most highly decorated unit of its size with five Medals of Honor. It was for his actions while serving on a rescue mission for another soldier in Cambodia, that he was submitted for the Medal of Honor the third time for his extraordinary heroism.</p>

<p>PacWest Racing was a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Champ_Car_ed74.html" title="Champ Car">Champ Car</a> racing team owned by Bruce McCaw in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1993.html" title="1993">1993</a>.The team's first full time season was the next year, with drivers Dominic Dobson and future <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indy_Racing_League_8574.html" title="Indy Racing League">Indy Racing League</a> co-champion Scott Sharp. In <a href="../../../1/9/9/1995.html" title="1995">1995</a>, the team switched to former <a href="../../../f/o/r/Formula_1.html" title="Formula 1">Formula 1</a> driver <a href="../../../m/a/u/Mauricio_Gugelmin_81c5.html" title="Mauricio Gugelmin">Mauricio Gugelmin</a> and a fading Danny Sullivan, who would be replaced late in the season by Juan Fangio II. In 1996, Mark Blundell took over Fangio's seat. 1997 became PacWest's breakout year, with the team taking four wins, including Gugelmin's solo CART victory. The team was since considered a major team, and was figured to be in contention. The next three years turned out to be a disssapointment. 2001 saw Blundell, who retired after the previous season's end, replaced with 2000 Indy Lights Champion <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Dixon_bfb6.html" title="Scott Dixon">Scott Dixon</a>, who earned PacWest's final victory at Nazareth, in which Dixon's teammate Gugelmin failed to qualify. 2002 Was PacWest's final year, in which the troubled team could only obtain associate sponsorship from NTN. The team started four races with Dixon and Oriol Servia. After the third race, Dixon was swept up by Target Chip Ganassi Racing, and Servia started one more race before McCaw closed the organization. Today, the remnants of PacWest Racing exist resurected as <a href="../../../p/k/v/PKV_Racing_0031.html" title="PKV Racing">PKV Racing</a>, which, ironically enough signed Servia full time for the 2006 season alongside Kathrine Legge.</p>

<p>Rejected By Society is a Rock/Pop/Punk band from Crosby in Liverpool, they were formed in early October 2005 so they could enter the local battle of the band competition. Even though they had only been together for four weeks, they placed joint first alongside a band that the members had been friends with for years. This other band was SSR and had been together for almost a year. So all in all they did well. But overall SSR were chosen as the winners after a debate amongst judges. So from then on, Rejected By Society has gone from strength to strength, practising, writing songs, organising gigs, and recording.<br />

<p>Cingen, the Duke of Cambria, is the son of Dyfnwal who is the grandson of Kamber (Camber). The Kamber I refer to is the following: "Kamber (or Camber) was a legendary king of Cambria, according to the account of Geoffrey of Monmouth.</p>
<p>Kamber was the son of Brutus of Britain, and a descendant of Aeneas of Troy. Upon his father's death he was given the region named after himself, Cambria. This area corresponds roughly to present-day Wales, and the name Cambria is still sometimes used in Welsh tourist literature and journalism (see, for example, Cambria Magazine).</p>
<p>He aided his brother, Locrinus, in the defeat of Humber, King of the Huns, which was in revenge for Humber's murder of Albanactus, their younger brother."</p>

<p>Originally from Thunder Bay Ontario, The Ryde is a four piece Rock band residing in Toronto Ontario. The four members moved to Toronto in the summer of 2004 to further their music career. With many different influences, they have created a unique sound that they can call their own. Tim Shaw (Lead Vocals/Rhythm Guitar) and Dustin Palko (Lead Guitar) grew up listening to bands such as Oasis, U2, The Verve, Rolling Stones and Our Lady Peace. Boris Novak (Bass/Backup Vocals) and Jeff Johnson (Drums) also listened to those bands but both have an ear for harder rock such as Metallica, Led Zeppelin, Godsmack, Guns and Roses, Nirvana, Creed and Tool. Some other bands that influenced The Ryde are Incubus, Aerosmith, Finger Eleven and Thornley. The Ryde started in 1995 and has gone through some band member changes. After losing the bassist in 2003, Johnson and Shaw asked long time friend Boris Novak if he would like to try out for the band because they knew that he has played bass in a few other local bands. Novak accepted the offer and after only one year, the band decided that they were ready to move south of their hometown of Thunder Bay. The Ryde won a Band Battle in 2003 and was offered an opening spot on the Molson Rocks House Party with Theory of a Deadman, Kazzer and High Holy Days which they accepted and blew the crowd away with their live performance. Since then they have played at most of Toronto’s best Rock venues including the legendary Horseshoe Tavern, Opera House, Lee’s Palace, Club 279, Edge 102.1 Station, The Reverb and The El Mocambo. With around 20 original songs of their own, they have recorded discs for their fans. The Ryde takes music very seriously and will keep writing and performing as long as it takes to get them to the top. Enjoy The Ryde!</p>

<p>The slide trumpet, also known as the soprano trombone, is technically a member of the trombone family, as it is a slide instrument. It is called a slide trumpet because it has the same bell dimensions, <a href="../../../m/o/u/Mouthpiece.html#Musical_instruments" title="Mouthpiece">mouthpiece#Musical_instruments</a> size/shape, range and transposition as a normal Bb <a href="../../../t/r/u/Trumpet.html" title="Trumpet">trumpet</a>, and is usually played by trumpet players, just as the <a href="../../../b/a/s/Bass_trumpet.html" title="Bass trumpet">bass trumpet</a> is usually played by <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trombone.html" title="Trombone">trombone</a> players.</p>
<p>The slide trumpet has seven positions, as a normal trombone does, and as one adds the length of each position (1-7), it matches with the chromatically descending valve series on any other three-valved brass instrument: 1st pos. = open, 2nd pos. = 2nd valve, 3rd position = 1st valve, 4th pos. = 1st &amp; 2nd valves, 5th pos. = 2nd and 3rd valves, 6th pos. = 1st and 3rd valves, and 7th pos. = 1st, 2nd and 3rd valves depressed at once.</p>
<p>There are a few pieces of literature for which soprano trombone has been legitimately written, namely three Bach cantatas (Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh' darein [BWV 2], Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis [BWV 21] and Aus tiefer Not schrei' ich zu dir [BWV 38]). These exist due to <a href="../../../j/2E/s/J.S._Bach_33f3.html" title="J.S. Bach">J.S. Bach</a> writing for a four-part trombone choir, originally written in the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clef.html" title="Clef">clefs</a> that correspond to the names of the trombones: soprano, alto, tenor and bass.</p>
<p>The slide trumpet exists today as little more than a novelty item, whereas if a player is proficient on it, he may play it in a <a href="../../../j/a/z/Jazz.html" title="Jazz">jazz</a> band reading a normal Bb trumpet part to add some flair to the ensemble, but it is generally not used in a serious concert setting.</p>

<p>This is the official motto of Lancaster Universities most elite group of gin worshippers. The Gin Society, formed through being highly vexed at the amount of totally uneccesary societies springing forth from the arse of Lancaster University, we decided to make a stand. Founded in January 2006, The Gin Society strives to give it's dedicated members an introduction (and more) into the wonderful world of drinking gin, and supported by other such intoxicating beverages.</p>
<p>GIN SOC EXECUTIVE COMMITEE;</p>
<p>PRESIDENT- Debbie Stewart. VICE-PRESIDENT- Mike Carey. SECRETARY- Jon Baum. TREASURER- Mina Gallagher. EQUAL OPPS- Mandy Finch.</p>
<p>Our members so far include the wonderous Gareth Hogg, and John Kenwright (also known as Kenny)</p>
<p>We do have other members, it's just that Mike has (and I quote) "forgotten them at this particular moment in time."</p>
<p>Currently an underground society, as we aren't actually allowed an alcohol appreciation club (apparently) we have recently changed the name to a more mainstream G-Soc. This could stand for Gerbil.</p>
<p>If you are a member of Lancaster University, and you enjoy drinking in Bowland Bar, then do get in contact... I won't tell you how... but get in touch.</p>

<p>The Cathedral of the Holy Cross is the mother church of the Archdiocese of Boston. In 1860, Bishop Fitzpatrick recognized that the church in Boston had outgrown the old Cathedral on Franklin St. However, the Civil War interrupted the plans for the new Cathedral. Bishop Fitzpatrick died in 1866 and Bishop Williams took over planning for the Cathedral project. Ground was broken for the new Cathedral on April 29, 1866. The rites of dedication were performed on December 8, 1875 by Archbishop John J.Williams, Boston's first archbishop.</p>
<p>The Cathedral of the Holy Cross is a cruciform neo-Gothic edifice. The total length of the Cathedral is 364 ft.; the width at the transepts 170 ft., the width of nave and aisles 90 ft., and the height to the ridgepole 120 ft. When it was built, the cathedral could hold close to 4,000 parishoners, but due to the expansion of the altar area and the fact that people are no longer comfortable to be squished like sardines into a church, is now permitted to hold over 2,000 people. The entire interior is clear space, broken only by two rows of columns extending along the nave and supporting the central roof.</p>
<p>The cathedral is located at 1400 Washington Street, Boston MA. 02118</p>

<p>Cleveland Wheeler. Radio entertainer and innovator. His career began in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1964 at the age of 14. Cleveland was a member of the Chattanooga Civil Air patrol Squadron. As a cadet m/sgt, he was also the squadron's cadet communications officer, coordinating mock and real search and rescue missions between the air and ground. His intention was to gain the sponsrship of a senior officer to OCS, where he would study to become an Air Force lawyer.</p>
<p>After a long childhood romance with everything radio, Cleveland received a call from an engineer/dee jay at the popular local Top 40 station, WMOC, asking him to come to the lobby of the radio station Saturday morning with an audition tape. The dee jay told him to be ready for his first break in radio.</p>
<p>The dee jay and the manager could be heard in the lobby quite clearly having an exchange of strong words. The door to the manager's office opened and the manager was heard shouting, "where I am supposed to get a replacement on such short notice?" The dee jay pointed to Cleveland. A life dedicated to radio was born at 14.</p>
<p>Cleveland Wheeler's career has taken him from one coast to another and in between. Early on, his talent caught the attention of Program Director Dan Chandler at WQAM in Miami. Cleveland was, at that time, the Program Director for WMFJ in Daytona Beach. His was still using the nomdeplume, Dave Randall at that time. He was almost 19.</p>
<p>Cleveland was hired to do the high-powered night show at Miami's number one radio station, at that time, in a fierce battle with rival WFUN.</p>
<p>Among the stations on which Cleveland Wheeler performed as an air personality are:</p>
<p>WMOC-Chattanooga WFLI-Chattanooga WGOW-Chattanooga WMAK-Nashville WAYS-Charlotte WMFJ-Daytona Beach WDAT-Daytona Beach WQAM-Miami WAPE-Jacksonville WRBQ-Tampa WQYK-Tampa WYUU-Tampa KKBQ-Houston KUPD-Phoenix KTLK-Denver KROY-Sacramento XM Satellite Radio-Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Cleveland Wheeler is most noted for having co-created a national concept for morning radio shows called, THE <b>Q-ZOO</b> with his then, radio partner, Scott Shannon. Wheeler took three years copyrighting the show although it was widely imitated for years without enforcement.</p>
<p>Cleveland's radio style changed rapidly over the years to purposely stay ahead of the trend. He became an engaging and provaocative show host in the early 80s when he teamed with Scott Shannon on Tampa's Q-ZOO. The show was aired on WRBQ.</p>
<p>On the air, Wheeler confronted listeners, community, and politicians with issues. He wrapped himself in animal and enviromnmental causes and gained signifiant noteriety when blasting the University of South Florida for purchasing lost dogs for experimental and vivesection purposes from the taxpayer supported, Hillsborough Animal Control. His reputation as a champion of townspeople swelled in the 80s. When his partner, Shannon, left in 84, Cleveland carried ratings to extraordinary higher highs until format competitors undermined the confidence of Q105 programming managers and ownership. The station underwent a format and audience redirection and was subsequently sold to Clear Channel for a fraction of it's once 100 million dollar value. In 1991, Cleveland did his last show on Q105 and moved to Houston to replace John Lander at KKBQ.</p>
<p>During the 80s, the <b>Tampa Q-ZOO</b> show became one of the highest rated morning shows in a large U.S. market. When Shannon left Wheeler continued to anchor the show and added a daily tv simulcast counterpart called ZOOTUBE.</p>
<p>The ZOOTUBE was the brainchild of Wheeler, Jones Intercable Manager, Bill Schricker, and WRBQ engineer, Ralph Beaver. It was the first daily TV simulcast of a radio show in America.</p>
<p>Cleveland Wheeler is the receipient of many radio honors, advertising federation awards, and received Billboard Magazine's Large Market Personality of the Year in 1989.</p>
<p>After leaving radio in 1998, frustrated by the negative corporate forces of broadcast deregulation, Wheeler did not renew his last contract with WYUU. He became a Real Estate agent and sold Gulf Beach Real Estate until....</p>
<p>In 2000, he received a call from a friend in Chicago who mentioned XM Radio. Cleveland had been removed from radio for two years and wasn't familiar with XM. His friend put the Vice President of Programming in touch with Cleveland.</p>
<p>Just three weeks later, Cleveland Wheeler went from being a broker on the beaches to building broadcast architecture for America's first nationwide satellite Radio service in Washington,D.C.</p>
<p>He designed an all original channel that played only 60s pop music called "The 60s on 6". That was XM's channel 6. It turned out to be one of XM's most popular channels on the system.</p>
<p>In 2004, Wheeler left XM and returnned to Florida, where he now lives with his wife, his two birds, two dogs, and a cat named boo. He has a son, Geoffrey Darin who lives in Nashville and is one of the world's most gifted artists and animators.</p>
<p>"Creativity abounds but there are fewer places, but file drawers, to display it. Wall Street has ruined the imagination business. Save your mind. You'll need it to entertain you one day." Cleveland Wheeler</p>

<p>The song Think of Me from the Phantom of the Opera is an aria from the fictional opera Hannibal in the first act of the show. Initially, it is sung by Carlotta Giudicelli, the Opera Populaire's prima donna, but it is as the diva is practicing this song that The Phantom chooses to show his dislike for her. As she is singing, The Phantom drops a backdrop on her. Although unharmed, Carlotta is sufficiently annoyed, and she walks off in a huff, leaving the production without its star. It is then that Christine Daae, a member of the corps de ballet who has been taking singing lessons from an unknown teacher, is pushed forward into the spotlight. As she is singing, her audition and the gala performance that night meld, and Christine "enjoys a great success." It is during the performance that Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny and a childhood friend of Christine's, recognized her and thusly is the triangle revealed - Christine, Raoul, and Erik (The Phantom).</p>
