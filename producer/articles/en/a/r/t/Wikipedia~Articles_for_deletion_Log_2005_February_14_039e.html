<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> --AndyL 22:25, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>After the required five days of discussion the VfD consensus was to delete the article. However, as the article has new block-compressed revisions which are not supported by the new selective undelete feature and could result in data loss if deletion and undeletion happened the article cannot be deleted for "a month or two" until the software is updated. Accordingly, the article has been marked for deletion and protected until the software problem is fixed. --AndyL 22:25, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a personal essay (and a rather good one) based on individual research by a user who cannot accept the neutrality policy no matter how many times it is explained to him (see the talk page). There appears to be no prospect of him allowing it to become npov. He is of the opinion that his idiosyncratic views are fact because he has read many books and fully referenced his article. I think he needs to find another outlet for his views, as Wikipedia is not suited to his purpose. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 01:17, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b> This isn't an encyclopedia article, it's a research paper. It's too long and the primary author expects readers to follow footnotes to read other sources. I shouldn't have to read other sources to understand an encyclopedia article. Hedgeman 05:41, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was rather worried about Wheeler's sanity when reading the discussion pages on this; a long walk or a cold bath might help him calm down a bit. It is clearly a well written and researched piece but as various people have said - it is original research. <a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrookie_1d9f.html" title="User:Brookie">Brookie</a> 16:50, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, trivial, pedantic original research about nominal linguistic shift in the usage of the word <i>republic</i>, not well-written, fuzzy-headed and rantish too. Does that about sum it up? <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 21:36, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b> This is not Original Research; it cannot be since all the information it contains appears to come from the public domain. It may be an "Original Compilation" but then, so are all the articles that I write. Extracting information from text books and other published resources is not Research.

<li>This <i>is</i> Original Research. It may make use of published sources, but it uses them in a very idisyncratic way, to attempt to prove a particular thesis. Basically it assumes that when classical or other authors use the terms <i>res publica</i> in Latin, <i>politeia</i> in Greek, or <i>commonwealth</i> in English they are all referring to a particular constitutional form of mixed government, which in many cases is pretty evidently not the case. <b>Delete</b> (or possibly re-work under a title such as <i>Constitutional theory of mixed government</i> so as not to hijack the term "Republic").<a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 07:44, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps, but the main author wouldn't permit it and there are plenty of articles on related issues which can be worked on more constructively. The whole slant of this article is too idiosyncratic for it to be worth anyone's effort to try to turn it into something else, and no one is likely to want to deal with the hysterical reaction that would be the likely response of the main writer. Thus there is no realistic prospect of it ever becoming npov. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Wincoote</a> 09:34, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

While there are some paragraphs that are <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> and the article seems to have been written to present the author's somewhat idiosyncratic POV about republican or "mixed" government, I don't think it suffers from this more than a great many other articles, and there is a considerable amount of useful fact. The <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a> aspects can be cleaned up, although the attitude of the author on the Talk page suggests that this might be a bit of a battle.

<p>I do acknowledge that some material is original. I am defining it in all its parameters. I will delete the article except for one sentence about it being "mixed" That is unrefutable.

I think that this is the best course available at this time. Without a "Classical Republic" it will be hard to understand the Republic of Venice, the American Constitution, the English Constitutionalists like John Aylmer and Geoffrey Elton and others. In a couple of years, when this gets thrown around some; it can be put back on its original page.</p>

As George Santayana has said, "Those who refuse to learn from history are condemned to repeat it." Sad. I can go thru the classics, and see Hitler throughout them--already portrayed. One must read, the classics, theology, philosophy, literary criticism, history, etc. and to have a "real experience" of the world, to really know the world and make sense of it.

<dd>Look at this definition. "A republic, in its basic sense, is a state in which sovereignty derives ultimately from the people". What is the difference between this and a democracy? This is what a democracy is. Again, the principle of identity. Why say the word republic if it is the same as democracy? Again, why say "democratic republic" when republic is the same word as democratic? All this is illogical. Does Republic and Democracy mean the same thing? If so, why seperate articles?

<dd>So on the one hand you're saying that sovereignty deriving from the people equates to Hitlerism, on the other that it equates to democracy - you can hardly have it both ways! Actually of course there's a great deal of difference between the notion of th e"sovereign people" as in the French and American revolutions, and the quasi-mystical Nazi concept of the "Volk". I do wonder however whether the "Republic" article might better be defined in terms of "citizens" rather than the "people". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 08:01, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In current usage a republic is a <i>type</i> of democracy, is all, usually characterized by intermediate layers of elected representation and some sort of executive branch. No scandal there, no <i>lost in space</i>. No surprise there's been some natural linguistic shift over the past 2500 years. What's interesting to me is how <i>intact</i> the word has remained compared to others. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 19:37, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think a republic is most commonly defined in what it is not. The French republic, the republican constitution of various American states, and archetypically the Roman republic, were all so defined specifically in opposition to hereditary monarchy, especially of course monarchies that were perceived to be oppressive. The concept of a republic seems to have originated with the Romans, looking back from the days of the empire to the republican arrangements that had preceded it, which in turn were defined in opposition to the monarchy of the Tarquins. The Greeks, with a different history, and a more analytical approach, classified states as monarchies, oligarchies, or democracies, or indeed some mixture of all three, but aarguably did not have need of the precise concept of a "republic". Indeed one could argue that the Greeks didn't, and don't, have a word for it: the word politeia fundamentally means "the government", "the body politic", and so on in general terms, rather than what we would call a republic (so of course does the Latin res publica in most contexts), and the current Greek state, the "Hellenic Republic", is called in Greek "Elliniki Dhimokratia", so for the Greeks at least democracy and republic are synonymous. In practice, if you were to read beyond the opening sentence of the current "Republic" article, you will see that a distinction can be made: not all republics are democratic, not all democracies are republics. The United Kingdom has democratic institutions, and a mixed form of government, but is not referred to a "republic". Those who campaign for Australia and other countries of the British Commonwealth to become republics are not asking for their countries to have a more "mixed" form of Government, but for their head of state to be an elected official rather than the Queen or her representative. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 20:49, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Republics don't have monarchies, which is the usual explanation for why the UK isn't called one. The Roman republics ceased with the first emperors, as noted at the time. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 21:12, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sparta is a Republic with a King. Cicero called Sparta a republic. Machiavelli called Sparta a Republic. John Aylmer called Sparta a republic. John Hooker was enthused with Spartan and Roman republicanism. Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist papers which were originally newspaper articles that was widely read by the general population called Sparta a republic. John Aylmer saw that Tudor England was a republic. Sparta is a republic.<a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:33, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, Sparta was a state with two kings (a most unusual form of constitution). As to Cicero calling it a republic, if you're referring to your quotation "res publica lacedaemoniorum" (I quote from memory) this is more likely just to have meant "the Spartan state", rather than implying that it was a "republic". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:50, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Where in God's green earth do you get that a republic is the same as democracy. Neither Plato nor Aristotle confuse the terms. Have you people read the Athenian Constitution by Aristotle? I'm I taliking to a brick wall? Don't you understand plain english? The word has been <b>bastardized</b>. Only in the last two centuries has the word changed in meaning. For 2300 years republic WAS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH DEMOCRACY. Never. <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWHEELER_588f.html" title="User:WHEELER">WHEELER</a> 21:38, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

Yes, it's been bastardized, that's normal linguistic shift, happens all the time, nothing to see here, move along, yes I understand plain English, I think the article (which has apparently been deleted now), and the arguments you provide for it, are hysterical in both tone and motive. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 06:47, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you're fundamentally mistaken in applying the term "republic" to what Plato or Aristotle may have said about Athens. It's not a question of whether either place was a democracy, it's more that the concept of "republic" is really an anachronism as applied to this period, and really has nothing to do with the concept of a "mixed" constitution which admittedly was discussed at that time. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:50, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I should have added that no-one is saying that republic is the same as democracy (except that the same word for both is used in modern Greek). The current wording of the "Republic" article makes it clear that not all republics are democratic, and not all democracies are republics. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERoss_Burgess_d0d4.html" title="User:Ross Burgess">rossb</a> 21:52, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>They have put a deletion on my Classical definition of republic. I will not even vote. I ask that you don't either. Let it be deleted.WHEELER 18:35, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a laugh. It is the only article with over 70 footnotes with a huge bibliography and they want to delete it. Good. This is all a joke. Gravitas is a virtue sadly missing today.WHEELER 18:48, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Free content. My Ass. This is a Marxist controled encyclopaedia. What doesn't fit Marxist scholarship and assent gets deleted. I have now three major articles deleted; National Socialism, Cultural imprinting on politics, and now Classical definition of republic. Yes, this is a "Controlled" encyclopaedia. Information will be scrubbed. We are the Borg. Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated into the Herd. You will comply. We are the Borg.WHEELER 19:35, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>And they deleted the only articles that have references to them. See, what counts for "academic scholarship" these days. This is sad commentary on them. See, what real research unveils and what crappy research is in America today. That information has to be Marxized before it gets accepted.WHEELER 19:38, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>What the hell did I make a Bibliography for if this is original research? I must be stupid.WHEELER 19:45, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><i>Comment</i>: Mr WHEELER, I think, has missed two important points. First, WP offers free content (no charge) and editing by consensus, which simply means one can edit as one pleases, but if it doesn't conform to a consensus it won't remain. Second, he doesn't seem to understand what original research is. One can include 1000 references to the literature, peer-reviewed, widely published, everything... but if the article's thesis is an original synthesis, it's not encyclopedic. For example (broadly put for clarity), if WP had existed 100 years ago, and a young Swiss patent official named Albert Einstein had posted his work to WP in an article entitled "Special Theory of Relativity", it would likely have been deleted as original research. Wheeler may still argue that WP is Marxist (I'm certainly not), that his arguments are correct and so on, but the consensus is that his ideas are original, and with their additional, underlying politcal agenda, they also fall under the "WP is not a soapbox" guideline. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 18:54, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm a little new to Wikipedia so I am unclear why you wouldn't keep an article like this...

<li>Well, nobody was killed or even very seriously injured. Not to undermine its obvious importance to those who were there, but it's basically a case of some guy going postal and unloading a weapon in a public place. If we say this deserves an article, then why not the hundreds of thousands of murders and non-fatal acts of violence that happen all over the world every year? If this happened on the street in the inner city instead of in a mall, it would just be another footnote in the police blotter. Wrong? Right?

<li>This is a separate concept from homosexuality; bakla refers to people who see themselves more as women trapped in men's bodies, rather than actual men.

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 11 clear "delete" votes, 13 "keep" votes (though 6 were discounted - 4 anon, one very new user and one troll), 5 "transwiki" votes and one unclear. Many of the delete votes came before the rewrite. Most of the transwiki votes came after the rewrite.</p>
<p>While there is a plurality of votes for deletion, there is not the overwhelming majority necessary for straight deletion. At the same time, the sum of the delete and transwiki votes indicate a reasonably clear concensus that this is not an <i>encyclopedia</i> article. Noting that <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/transwiki" class="extiw" title="m:transwiki">transwiki</a> does not destroy history and therefore does not require the overwhelming concensus that deletion does, I am going to <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_bold_6b7b.html" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">be bold</a> and add this to the Transwiki queue. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 04:02, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hey <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a>, that is indeed a pretty serious allegation! Are you 100% positive it was me? I harbor no ill will towards you. What would I have to gain?

Meanwhile the page history of my talk page clearly shows that after reading the above, you went back and deleted your personal attack. Now you deny having made it. Readers are invited to visit my talk page and see your trail for themselves, drawing their own conclusions. <s>I'll assume this was all due to the inexperience of a new WP user who may have misunderstood both the role and function of VfD and the Speedy Delete process, misinterpreted my posts and over-reacted emotionally.</s> <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:01, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Many are dicdefs that simply haven't been VfD'd (yet). In principle, an article should be an article, with encyclopedic content.

Creating an article space for its German equivalent is even less so, which is why I voted to delete it. The <i>get lost</i> commentary is only an echo of exasperation over the apparent glee some users (often new ones) seem to derive from typing colourful and provocative content for its own sake into WP, and shouldn't be taken too seriously. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 01:24, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have further cleaned up the article. The word shyster is derived from the word and was developed on the Australian goldfields. It then spread around the world losing its obscene meaning - for example Groucho and Chico Marx had a NBC radio program called <i>Beagle, Shyster &amp; Beagle</i> which became <i>Flywheel, Shyster &amp; Flywheel</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. You surprise me. The <i>OED</i> makes it clear that the word <i>shyster</i> developed independently (i) in the US to mean something like a crooked lawyer (whence the Marx brothers' use) and (ii) in Australia, from <i>Scheisser</i>. If this is so, the German word had no influence on the Marxist use. But even if it had influenced it, so what? Should W'pedia have articles on German words that were adapted into English words? I hadn't thought that it was an English-language dictionary, let alone a German-English dictionary, but maybe I've missed something. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 13:11, 2005 Feb 15 (UTC)

<li>I have added further to the article explaining further the derivation of shyster. I based my statement earlier that the word shyster had originated in Australia from the German word based on prior knowledge as an Australian and the American Heritage derivation (cited as a reference in the article). Further research based on Hoary's concerns led me to work done by professor Gerald Cohen that the word had originated in the New York prison system in the 1840's and was based on "scheiße". The first citation of the word was in 1843 in a publication called <i>The Subterreanean</i> by Mike Walsh based on a conversation with Cornelius Terhune, a lawyer in New York who told Walsh that the word derived from the German for shit. There are alternative derivations for the word shyster including <a href="../../../s/h/y/Shylock.html" title="Shylock">Shylock</a>, a Gaelic word <i>siostair</i> meaning barrator or person who pursues litigation groundlessly and Scheuster who was supposedly a lawyer practising at the time. The lawyer version was the most common derivation. However, Professor Cohen has been through the law lists of New York and can find no record of such a lawyer practising at that time meaning shyster is now the most likely derivation. I have mentioned the alternative derivations in the article but I consider that this dispute indicates that it is worthwhile keeping the word. No change in vote. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 17:40, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have had a look at the OED citations.

<li><s><b>Delete</b> or possibly merge as <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> suggests. Right now, the technique described is probably still patented by the company that makes these devices, so it's probably not a generic device right now.

<li><b>Keep</b> as rewritten by Kappa. I disagree that there are any subjects that cannot have unbiased articles. If we can manage to have NPOV articles about the Iraq war, abortion, gay rights, gun control, and other genuinely controversial topics, surely we can manage to write about a fondue server without it turning out to be an ad! Chocolate fountains are definitely made by more than one company, I'm 100% sure of that, so it's no more an ad than an article about cars, computers, phones, or any other product. Besides, even if it was made by one company, big deal... there are lots of specific-product articles on WP, such as dozens of cel-phone models. Furthermore, I disagree that these are particularly trivial: a search for <i>"Chocolate fountain" OR "chocolate fountains"</i> brings <b>134,000 Google matches</b> <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 22:57, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Maybe so, but there are tons of now-defunct webcomics, because it's so easy to start one at Keenspot. "The author of the comic is believed to have lost interest and has ceased updating the comic.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Defunct webcomic that was never notable. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a general knowledgebase of human activity.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This was not of individual interest even when it was running, so wouldn't deserve an article now. Indeed, it isn't even worth mentioning in an article on webcomics themselves. As part of a statistical analysis on the mayfly level of lifespan of the average webcomic it may qualify as one point on a data set, but that's pretty much it.

<li>Unfortunately, this article is a victim of bad timing -- the brainchild of this organization is a zine called Hedgehog, which I was going to add an entry for, but the database maitenance went online at that moment. At least wait for the other article before making a decision. Besides, who says everything in an enyclopedia has to be interesting? Try hitting random page a few times; see what comes up. EDIT: The article for Hedgehog is now available. It's very rough, as I did this at 1 AM local, but I intend to improve on it later. <a href="../../../t/s/u/User%7ETsuyoshikentsu_7d94.html" title="User:Tsuyoshikentsu">Tsuyoshikentsu</a> 09:13, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>A literature search that finds appropriate references would render your objections invalid. I'm _still_ wondering why you consider the article unacceptable in the first place, but have no problems with other articles about similar structures with less backing material. Care to give a more detailed answer on this?--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 03:36, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no evidence this structure exists, the idea for it got started in SciFi fiction (not theoretical physics), the article is misleading, the topic is trivial cruft and it reads like a joke, for starters. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 08:55, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>The idea for a rotating ring habitat was proposed by <a href="../../../w/e/r/Wernher_von_Braun_52ea.html" title="Wernher von Braun">Wernher von Braun</a> in 1952, and revisited in the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> thought experiment funded by <a href="../../../n/a/s/NASA_1f99.html" title="NASA">NASA</a>. While the name "Bishop Ring" appears to have been an invention of the Orion's Arm group, calling the <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> version of the article (as opposed to <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_ring.html" title="Bishop ring">bishop ring</a>) "trivial cruft" about a "nonexistent" idea is, frankly, incorrect enough to make me wonder if you so much as _skimmed_ literature on space station concepts before deciding this article was a waste of space. I can accept redirection to "Stanford Torus" as an interim measure, though the Torus was proposed as a much smaller structure. I'll create a new article about feasible megastructure-scale ring colonies once I have a few peer-reviewed paper citations to quiet most of the objections voiced here. I agree that "Bishop Ring" probably isn't a good name for the article, but it continues to disturb me that most of the people posting here prefer to delete an article out of hand rather than change it to something they like, or merge the few bits they feel have merit with other more appropriate articles. Deletion is for articles that are <i>completely</i> inappropriate or meritless. Heck, if any of you had proposed blanking the article and making it a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>, I probably wouldn't even have blinked. I am always open to constructive suggestions for alteration; however, the only one offered to date was JoaoRicardo's stub tag change. The rest has been nothing but aggressive confrontation (with varying degrees of politeness, which I do recognize and respect).--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 05:20, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>My wording was only an artifact of the heavily qualified language I use on these VfDs, and was meant to separate the article topic from reality. From an encyclopedic perspective, IMO the topic is trivial cruft. From a SciFi perspective, it might work has a "hard science fiction" plot device. I'm not aware that WP is an "encyclopedia of science fiction". <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 13:31, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I question your placement of the dividing line between "science fiction" and "hypothetical engineering project that nobody's built". Why do you not object to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_elevator.html" title="Space elevator">space elevator</a> or any of the various <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_fountain.html" title="Space fountain">space fountain</a> proposals? I can certainly see you objecting to the _term_ "Bishop Ring", but there is ample literature (mostly cited from the pages linked from <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>) about ring-shaped space colonies. Thus, I challenge your assertion that there is nothing of technical merit in the version of <a href="../../../b/i/s/Bishop_Ring_0949.html" title="Bishop Ring">Bishop Ring</a> I posted. The distinction between science and science fiction is that science fiction either a) makes propositions that irreconcilably violate known physical laws or b) has no reflection in publications by the scientific community. Neither applies to the article I wrote (though I can, as mentioned earlier, see arguments for folding it into other <a href="../../../s/p/a/Space_habitat.html" title="Space habitat">space habitat</a> articles).--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 20:58, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If those articles showed up on VfD I might vote to delete them too, but at the moment we're talking about this one. I disagree with your opinion on the difference between science and science fiction, but even that's not related to this VfD. Further, I never said "there is nothing of technical merit" in the article you posted. I said it was fiction, not science. Fancruft can be wonderful, but it's usually not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 20:45, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you believe that there _is_ content in my version of the article that _does_ have technical merit, then why didn't you suggest that it be merged with a more suitable parent article, rather than deleting it? Or that any non-redundant fancruft components be merged into the <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion%27s_Arm_d364.html" title="Orion's Arm">Orion's Arm</a> article? I asked this several paragraphs ago, and still didn't get an answer from you.

<dd>Neither did I say I thought it <i>did</i> have technical merit. I said it was fiction. Another problem I have with the article is it doesn't make that clear at all, which will mislead some readers. I also noticed the article's author has muddled the contraction <i>it's</i> with the possessive <i>its</i>&#160;:) As for any merge, I don't see much point in that but please keep in mind I don't assert myself as any final authority, only one vote.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Christopher, in deciding where to redirect, I believe it is important to think what someone who typed or followed a link to this article would like to know about. (This is my opinion, not Wikipedia policy.) If the expression "bishop ring" is only found in one specific science fiction work, or in one specific series of works (eg. Asimov's Foundation series, Star Trek series etc.) then it probably should redirect to that work or series, where there should be a discussion of the space habitat as it applies to that work. There we could include a link to other article that discuss the same concept in real life. If however this is used in many works of sci-fi and/or in academic papers as well, than we should redirect to a more "real-life" article, like <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> as you suggested. The current article doesn't establish either position. Could you clarify this for us? <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> 05:32, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>It's looking like a redirect to <a href="../../../o/r/i/Orion%27s_Arm_d364.html" title="Orion's Arm">Orion's Arm</a> would probably be the most approriate, as they appear to be the only place that actually used the term <i>Bishop Ring</i> to refer to this type of structure. I'm thinking about adding a "types of megastructure featured in this work" section to the OA page. The material about real life limits to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a>-like structures can be shelved until I have refereed literature references for it. I know where to look (late 70s, early 80s, when the structures were in vogue and whisker fibers were fashionable), but don't have them on-hand, so such an article would just be VFDd as either primary source or sci-fi, depending on who's VFDing it. Link to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_torus.html" title="Stanford torus">Stanford torus</a> can go into the OA page, as a part of my intended edit.--<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 06:01, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As appointed by Wyss, that is jargon for something in which only hardcore fans would be interested. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Simpsons_c2a9.html" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a> is a worthy article, but an article on, for instance, an expression Bart used in episode 34 of the 6th season is fancruft. Only hardocre Simpsons fans would be interested in something so specific. <a href="../../../r/i/n/Ringworld.html" title="Ringworld">Ringworld</a> is an article on an apparently notable sci-fi novel, and therefore is not restricted to fans. However <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_Orbital_3fe5.html" title="Culture Orbital">Culture Orbital</a> does seem to me to be fancruft.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a genuine professional sports team (ice hockey in this case), affiliated to a real league, selling real numbers of tickets (new 6000 seat stadium to open next year indicates support from fans, community). This is also affiliated to an AHL and an NHL team, so is clearly a feeder team for them. Five other teams in the league also have articles, to consider if people feel that this is genuinely not of interest. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 13:41, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. With professional sports teams, it seems to make sense to decide for most of them on the basis of the league the team is in. If a professional league is notable then it makes sense just to have articles on all teams in the league, even the new ones, assuming there is enough information about them. I suppose you could have a notable team in an otherwise unnotable league, but that would have to be an exceptional case. I don't know if minor league professional hockey is notable, but since we already have articles on more than a few other teams in the same league, the question seems to have been decided. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:03, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Sounds like articles on other Harvard dorms might be helpful then. I lived in two dorms while in college. One was definitely not encyclopedic, the other was a soul-crushing, monolithic high rise monster, encyclopedic perhaps as a campus eyesore, a sad example of mid-twentieth-century modernist idealism mis-understood and gone horribly wrong, a barren, isolated warren of human suffering but I digress&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/y/s/User%7EWyss_39cc.html" title="User:Wyss">Wyss</a> 11:56, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The dorm seems notable enough, especially with its notable former inhabitants, but the article could still use some copyediting to remove some POV praise. <b>Keep</b>, but I'll tell you know, that this can only be a precedent if you define major universities, keeping in mind stuff outside the US. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:53, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. This type of thing has already been discussed on VfD. Someone proposed the deletion of an article about a dorm at CalTech. During that discussion, I pointed to the article on <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunster_House_222e.html" title="Dunster House">Dunster House</a>, another of the Harvard undergraduate houses. The consensus seemed to be that the <a href="../../../d/u/n/Dunster_House_222e.html" title="Dunster House">Dunster House</a> article was acceptable because of the detail of the article and the notability of its former residents, traditions, etc; but that the Caltech dorm was just a dorm, and not sufficiently notable for an article. I can't say that this was particularly consistent, but I don't think you are going to get a precedent out of this vote, and, anyway, VfD doesn't seem to be a decision-making body that is terribly influenced by precedents or consistency. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:46, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. It provides useful information to people who are interested in aspects of Harvard life. As to above comment that "If it is determined that this article is encyclopedic, then all the Harvard Houses should have articles" there is no reason that all the Harvard Houses should not have articles. But it is not the responsibility of the author of the Kirkland House article to make all of those articles. Sarahpillows, 02:05, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Several of the Harvard houses do have articles. The "House System" at Harvard was initiated in the 1920's, in an effort to transplant some aspects of the college system at Oxford and Cambridge to Harvard. The same philanthropist who provided the funding for this also helped create a similar system at Yale around the same time. The result is a set of "colleges within the college" at both Harvard and Yale, and the houses are a central aspect of undergraduate life from the sophomore year onwards. Each house has its own resident Master, who is generally a distinguished professor, Tutors (some resident), a library, and special courses available only to members of the house. After a few decades, it has worked out that they are more dorm-like than college-like at both universities, but they do have distinctive features that may make them encyclopedically notable in a way that a typical college dorm is not. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:02, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The page for Kirkland House should generate interest in creating pages for the other Harvard houses, since each has its own unique and notable history. The fact that Kirkland House is the first (or among the first) of Harvard houses to be added is certainly not a good enough justification to delete it.--skells 08:14, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The houses at Harvard are so distinct and interesting that I don't deny that they may all deserve to be listed. I think that all houses <i>should</i> be able to be listed if they want to be and I am very happy that Kirkland is listed. There are numerous speakers who come especially to Kirkland House and there are many great traditions that have been upheld in the houses for years. The house is historical place that is continue to grow and create more history. It is more than just a part of Harvard, so I don't feel that it should be made only a link off the Harvard site. I see no reason not to list houses. This is a great article about a one-of-a-kind place that deserves to be noted.--AKirklander 05:38, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>according to the edit history, comment actually left by user:140.247.173.30 whose only edit so far has been this comment</i></li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think one additional distiction, which has already been hinted at, is that we can recognize differences between a residential community (such as the one here), and a building that has little substance beyond its use as a dorm. This is a good discussion to have, as it seems related to the larger question of how important does a thing/concept/etc. have to be in order to find a place in the Wikipedia?</li>

<p><s>Logical fallacy that allegedly proves there is no free will. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 14:05, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)</s> Withdrawn. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:45, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>First: That something is a logical fallacy does not make it a candidate for deletion. Many encyclopaedia entries deal with the illogical positions of many groups of people. Second: This is not a logical fallacy, because it <i>doesn't</i> prove what you state. It proves that omniscience and free will are logically incompatible, quite a different thing altogether. This is a widely discussed philosophical and theological topic, that a quick Google Web search would have turned up many instances of (such as <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/" class="external autonumber" title="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>), since it is even listed by its common name. What this article needed was {{wikify}}{{reli-stub}}{{philo-stub}}{{CatNeeded}}, not {{subst:vfd}}.

<p>This article is POV by nature. "Modern anti-Semitism" or "New anti-Semitism" is the Zionist concept that, in the olden days, there was crude anti-Semitism like gas chambers, and that we nowadays are confronted with sneakier anti-Semitism involving such heinous acts as criticising Israeli government policy.</p>
<dl>
<dd>I have <i>never</i> heard of a Jewish group which holds that criticism of the State of Israel is anti-Semitism. In fact such a claim is a classic strawman attack. People should not make claims up about the Jews, when the Jews in fact have no such beliefs. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:37, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There are Jews who believe that. She references in the article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 15:45, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the article were simply about anti-Semitism in modern times, then it would be great. However, it is about something the article itself admits is a neologism ("The term <b>The New anti-Semitism</b> was coined at the outset of the 21st century"). The article does not even pose the question of whether this non-existent phenomenon is reality or not: it simply explains how bad it is, subdividing it into varities etc. The entire article pushes the POV that such a thing exists.</p>
<dl>
<dd>Again, this is untrue. The article was never solely about what is called "the new anti-Semitism". From the very beginning this article was about anti-Semitism since the end of World War II. You are attacking something that isn't there. <a href="../../../r/k/_/User%7ERK_21a9.html" title="User:RK">RK</a> 23:37, Feb 14, 2005 (UTC)

</dl>
<p>If there were an article called New anti-Americanism that said "The new anti-Americans are those people who attack our democratically-elected President and show themselves up as unpatriotic by failing to support our army in its liberation of other countries" we would quickly zap it, salvaging any sensible content for merging into <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-American_sentiment_f3d8.html" title="Anti-American sentiment">Anti-American sentiment</a> or some such article.</p>
<p>We must do the same with articles such as this, which push a Zionist POV. There are several pieces of notable information in it, and these should be salvaged for the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>. That is where they belong, along with the (notable, though false) claim that some special, new form of anti-Semitism (which, incidentally, is a bad thing) exists. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 15:06, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I initially just turned it into a redirect, but then thought that someone might revert that change, so a VfD entry is probably necessary. NB: I'm not asking for any article deletion or censoring, just making it a redirect and merging any NPOV content into <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> and/or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a>. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 15:11, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We do not snip of controversial bits of articles and put them in separate ones. It is well known that this leads to the separate article being a POV playground. For this reason, we try to avoid articles such as criticism of CNN, and just put the criticism in the main article. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 16:37, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Merging the New Anti-Semitism article into the anti-Semitism article is a bad idea for two reasons. First, the information was removed from the anti-Semitism article 9 months ago because it was more controversial than the rest of the article, and therefore it was hoped it would bring some semblance of peace to the main article by moving it elsewhere. Second, this article is already 44K in size, and adding it back will make it closer to 60K, thus requiring an inevitable hiving-off of a sub-article anyway, as has been done with many other sections. The article itself should be improved by bringing published and cited views from both sides of the debate; VfDs should not be used to solve NPOV issues. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:26, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"<i>The article does not even pose the question of whether this non-existent phenomenon is reality or not ...

So it does exists.</li>
<li><i>"Modern anti-Semitism" or "New anti-Semitism" is the Zionist concept that, in the olden days, there was crude anti-Semitism like gas chambers, and that we nowadays are confronted with sneakier anti-Semitism involving such heinous acts as criticising Israeli government policy."</i> See the section "straw man antisemitism". I hardly see our burning a synagouge in France by radical Muslims is criticising the Israeli government policy.</li>
<li>Since the new or modern antisemitism is what you call an "ongoing event" and still contraversial, it is good to seperate it as a sub-topic from the "antisemitsm" article, which deals with the past (which is much more static than the present).</li>

<dd><i>That</i> is a straw-man argument. Perhaps I should have waited until Jayjg renamed it <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_anti-Semitism_dc04.html" title="New anti-Semitism">New anti-Semitism</a> so that the issue would be clear. Nobody is saying there is no longer any anti-Semitism in the world. I even recently wrote a little about modern neo-nazis in the anti-Semitism article. The point is that this article is not about anti-Semitism in recent times (I would not be against such an article), but rather it is explicitly about something called "New anti-Semitism", which is a way of saying that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitic. We would not accept this on another topic, so why accept it here? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChamaeleon_1199.html" title="User:Chamaeleon"><i>Chamaeleon</i></a> 17:27, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Straw man. Nobody is saying there is no anti-Semitism in modern times, but in that case the article should be called Anti-Semitism since 1950 or some other date.

<dd>If you agree with Jayjg, then you don't think it needs NPOV. He is the one responsible for the current state of it, and fully defends it. All you people who are saying "keep", what do you actually mean by that? Turn it into an article on recent anti-Semitism? That would entail deleting all the text and moving information from <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> into it. Turning it into an NPOV discussion of the "new anti-Semitism" slur, making it like <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>?

<li><b>Comment</b>. At the moment, the article strikes me as a very poor one. However, VfD is not generally about content but about whether the topic is encyclopedic and (in conjunction with other articles) is a reasonable way of dividing up a larger topic. What distinguishes "New" anti-Semitism from "Old" anti-Semitism? If the anti-Semitism article had simply grown so large that the decision was made to split out recent contemporary manifestations of anti-Semitism into a separate article, then it seems to me the title of that article should have been something like "Anti-Semitism since (some date)", and that "New anti-Semitism" is a confusing title. If the concept of "New anti-Semitism" is a new one that has been put forward in articles, books, etc, and those represent a notable development in thinking about anti-Semitism, then the article should present the argumentation of those books in an NPOV manner, with citation of sources. I would want to see some evidence that "New" anti-Semitism is a concept that exists outside the mind of the editor who started this article because in the latter case, it is original research. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 20:24, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. "New anti-Semitism" seems to exist as a claim made by some authors that criticism of Zionism and Israel (sometimes) represents a new form of anti-Semitism. Unfortunately, this article is not only about those claims, but despite the title seems to be also about "Modern Anti-Semitism". Indeed that is the title of an article which has been redirected here. This blending of so-called "new" and "contemporary/modern" anti-Semitism makes the article a bit of a mish-mash. Regarding "new anti-Semitism", criticism of Zionism and Israel are quite common, but I don't know how widespread is the claim that this criticism represents anti-Semitism. It seems to me that most prominent Jews are at pains to deny that they equate criticism of Zionism and Israel with anti-Semitism. (Indeed, the article cites <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Dershowitz_e083.html" title="Alan Dershowitz">Alan Dershowitz</a> making precisely this point, and claiming otherwise is described as setting up a "straw man" and itself anti-Semitic. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 21:44, 14 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article needs to find more scholarly sources, but it seems clear there is a new type of anti-Semitism on the rise, with anti-Zionism used (by some, not all) as an excuse — as the article says, as a Trojan horse — to attack Jews, and as such it has given a cover of respectability to anti-Semitism, to the point where, in Europe certainly, the views of leftwing activists and the far right seem to converge. This <i>is</i> a new phenomenon.

<li><b>Keep</b> The concept of "New Anti-semitism" has some prominent proponents as well as some prominent critics. Thus it is worthy of a article but the article has seriouse NPOV issues as it stands. The article should probebly adhare to the following structure if it is to be NPOV:</li>
<li>In the opening paragraph the article should make it clear that the concept of "new anti-semitism" is one being pushed by some Zionists and summerize how they define it. The opening paragraph should also make it clear that the definition and even in some cases the very validity of the concept/term is controversial.</li>
<li>It should then present the views those who support the concept and as to how they define it.</li>
<li>It should present the views of Israeli critics who disagree with the who concept of "New anti-semitism".</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-controversial areas of modern anti-semitism (i.e. anything not directly relating to controversial anti-zionist views or critisms of Israel) should probebly be addressed under the original anti-semitism artlicle. -<a href="../../../c/a/b/User%7ECab88_fc4f.html" title="User:Cab88">Cab88</a> 11:24, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>LOL Ken Livingstone an anti-Semite -- even the people who have started this campaign against him say clearly that they don't think he's an anti-Semite. Livingstone has in fact been campaigning against racism all his life, and he has become a target for the right-wing press precisely because he opposes the current racist wave against Muslims and because he favours dialogue with the Muslim community and their leaders. He has made it abundantly clear that he compared the reporter to a concentration camp guard because both adhere to the same amoral attitude towards their work i.e. "I'm just following the rules and I'm doing it because I get paid for it". The New anti-Semitism has at about the same level as this comment by Capitalistroadster: just don't let facts get in the way.</li>

<p>I would delete it. It's all POV. See for example the beginning: "Zionism, a political movement of Jewish self-determination". But things are not so simple. Zionism is not just a political movement of Jewish self-determination. Zionism is a doctrine which affirms that Jews have to return to Israel, a land that most of them have left centuries ago, and that they have to found a state there that has to be a Jewish State, which is a little bit as to say that Italy would have to be a Catholic state. The best Israelian, as Abraham Yehoshua, thinks that Israel has to become a ordinary State, not a Jewish state. Israel has repetly violated international law and UN resolutions. Of course its existence is now a state of fact and it's not in question, but I don't think that it has born in the good way, and I don't think to be antisemitic in saying this. One could oppose Zionism and be antisemitic, but could even oppose Zionism and not be at all antisemitic. Jews are not Israel, and who claims the contrary is not doing them a good service! We could talk of modern forms of antisemitism in the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> or question if some forms of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Zionism_3913.html" title="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionism</a> are antisemitic.

The fact that the coverage of Swedish music in the English Wikipedia is bad is in itself not an argument <i>against</i> Uppström, but unless I have missed something significant (which is possible), he is very far from being in the same league as the other ones listed here. Does the sum of his accomplishments as composer, performer and writer still bring him above the bar?

<li>Ok, but <i>"Why does X have an article but Y doesn't?"</i> has never been a very valid argument. There are many thousands, even millions, of valid article subjects that don't have articles yet. It doesn't mean anyone else is necessarily any less accomplished or notworthy than ol' Uppström here, it just means someone got to him first. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 23:17, Feb 15, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I already anticipated that, didn't I? I don't really care if Uppström is retained, but unless somebody can say something about his importance I still wonder <i>why</i> he should be in. If somebody would point out that "he hasn't composed many pieces but his <i>Second Trio for Pyrophone, Banjo and Viola</i> has been of monumental significance for the introduction of the pyrophone into modern chamber music" or something like that, I would understand why the article is here. Or is every published composer notable enough to be included? What are the criteria? / <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 07:56, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

I'm sure I could write a page or two about my local bus stop, however at no point would it even begin to be worthy of inclusion into an encyclopedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. If this article <i>is</i> kept and expanded, of course it will not be an article on the northern dialect of Irish; there's enough information on that at <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish language</a> and <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_dialects.html" title="Irish dialects">Irish dialects</a>. (After all, the predominant locus of the northern dialect isn't in Northern Ireland at all, but in County Donegal in the Republic.) Rather, the article will be on nonlinguistic issues: the legal status of Irish in Northern Ireland, and the sociopolitical ramifications of teaching and using a language that for most people is inextricably linked with Catholic/Republican identity in N.I. If all that is to be said on that subject fits into three or four paragraphs, then IMO it should be as a section of <a href="../../../i/r/i/Irish_language.html" title="Irish language">Irish language</a>. If, on the other hand, a good encyclopedic article can come from this subject, then of course it should be an independent page. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 23:50, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurdettekevin_d739.html" title="User:Burdettekevin">Burdettekevin</a>, if you're around I'd like to ask you one thing: If wikipedia already had articles on everyone at your level and above, would you say they should be deleted up to the level you consider genuinely notable? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 23:04, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good question. I'm inclined to say in that case they should not be deleted. As you may have guessed, one reason I voted "delete" was because I feel uncomfortable having an entry while knowing that there are others more notable without an entry. Furthermore, were I pushed, I could not specify where I would draw the "notable" line. BTW: <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a>: glad you liked the easter eggs! <a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurdettekevin_d739.html" title="User:Burdettekevin">Burdettekevin</a>

<li>For me it's like this: if I went to an opera with a major company, I'd hope to be able to look up the leading performers in WP, even if they aren't <a href="../../../k/i/r/Kiri_Te_Kanawa_5668.html" title="Kiri Te Kanawa">Kiri Te Kanawa</a>.

<p>Vanity. Contributing to German Wikipedia does not make one notable. Can someone who speaks the language please confirm the claim, with references, that he identified and labeled a species of turtle? I only turn up links which appear to originate from his German Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Userfy</b>, he's an editor on Wikipedia. There are about two dozen Google hits in German on his research but there is probably not enough at the moment to make him notable in his own right. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 04:27, 15 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nonnotable. I do wonder why there's an accuracy dispute tag on the article when there's no talk page for it. AFAIK his publications consist of two books: <i>Europäische Landschildkröten</i> ("European tortoises") and <i>Das Buch der immergrünen Laubbäume und Sträucher</i> ("The book of evergreen deciduous trees and shrubs"), photos of both of which are shown at <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Mayer_Richard" class="external text" title="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benutzer:Mayer_Richard" rel="nofollow">his de: user talk page</a>. I tried looking at amazon.de for more books of his, but Richard Mayer is a common enough name in German to make it difficult to be sure if any other books are his. Anyway, I think "several German-language books on tortoises" is an overstatement. He's also got a <a href="http://www.mayer-richard.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.mayer-richard.de/" rel="nofollow">website</a> which seems to consist entirely of photos of buildings and landscapes with big clay heads photoshopped into them, and tortoises. I found some pages citing "Mayer 1992" as the source for the identification of his subspecies of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marginated_tortoise.html" title="Marginated tortoise">marginated tortoise</a>, but unfortunately none of them included a reference list to tell us what "Mayer 1992" is. Maybe <i>Europäische Landschildkröten</i>? Unfortunately Amazon doesn't know the year that book was published, and the <a href="http://www.ava-verlag.de/" class="external text" title="http://www.ava-verlag.de/" rel="nofollow">publisher's website</a> has no record of it. --<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr">Angr</a> 08:44, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
