<ul>
<li><b>Hindutva propaganda:</b> I submit this article for consideration for deletion given that this flies in the face of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a>,<a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>,<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The highly prerogative title of the page makes it obvious that page is primarily meant to be an attack page. <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> is described by its proponents to be a Hindu revivalist movement, it is has been often derided by its opponents to be an extreme right wing ideology. Whatever may be one's opinion about Hindutva, i believe terms like Hindutva propaganda are personal opinions and the title hardly conforms to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Much of the article consists of cherry picked quotes from two Papers by <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Witzel_2199.html" title="Michael Witzel">Michael Witzel</a> and Nanda &amp; Sokal. Witzel is a Sanskrit scholar, which hardly makes him an authoritarian voice to pass judgements on Indian political ideologies. Mr.Witzel is also considered to be controversial for his supposed anti-Indian/anti-Hindu bias <a href="http://www.india-forum.com/articles/55/1/Harvard-professor-launches-anti-Hindu-Crusade" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.india-forum.com/articles/55/1/Harvard-professor-launches-anti-Hindu-Crusade" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. It is basically like writing an article on Republican ideology sourced from Noam Chomsky artciles. Undue weightage is given to Witzel and Nanda's opinions on Hindutva.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whats more, on the lines of Hindutva propaganda we donot have Redneck propaganda,Islamist propaganda,Christian propaganda,Marxist propaganda. Also the article ends up making wild allegations like: <i>during the 1930s, the Hindutva movement was influenced by Nazi mysticism, and pseudoscientific theories of racial supremacism. Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader M. S. Golwalkar in 1939 he wrote that "Germany has shocked the world by purging the country of the semitic race of the Jews, a good lesson for us in Hindusthan to learn and profit by".[2].</i></p>
<p>This serious allegation against a major Indian ideology is based on untracable reference (# ^ Ruthven (2007:10ff.) ) by an obscure Scholar whose interest/expertise is unclear. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva_propaganda#History" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindutva_propaganda#History" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Also the main contributor to this artilce <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> had added a statement (since revised):</p>
<p><i>Following the assassination of Gandhi by a member of the RSS in 1948, Hindu extremism was discredited in Indian society for some decades.</i></p>
<p>Its should be noted that <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathuram_Godse_b92c.html" title="Nathuram Godse">Nathuram Godse</a> (Gandhi's assasin) was NOT a member of RSS at the time and RSS was absolved by the <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Court_of_India_8593.html" title="Supreme Court of India">Supreme Court of India</a> of any hand in Gandhi's assasination. Addition of content like this by Users like <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> is shocking. RSS in past has not hesitated to sue anybody accusing it of hand in Gandhi assasination. Such irresponsible behaviour puts Wikipedia in a position where it can be sued.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that admin <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">User:Dbachmann</a> who has created this article, has also sprotected it. Isnt this unfair use of admin powers uncalled for, especially when there has been no obivous trolling on the article... Given the condescending tone of this article towards its subject, this article falls squarely in the 'attack page' category. <b><font color="saffron"><a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAMbroodEY_dc79.html" title="User:AMbroodEY">Amey Aryan DaBrood</a></font></b><sup><b><a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAMbroodEY_458b.html" title="User talk:AMbroodEY"><font color="red">©</font></a></b></sup> 20:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

However, I fail to see how this article is anything but a collection of quotes and opinions from a bunch of authors. As a reader, this article sounds too judgmental and opinionated, consisting less of facts and more as an expose or a research paper. Nor do I think Wikipedia is a place to do "expositions." <a href="../../../r/a/m/User%7ERama%27s_Arrow_544a.html" title="User:Rama's Arrow"><font color="green"><b>Rama's arrow</b></font></a> 21:39, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>any article will rely on a "bunch of authors". The point is, these are authors published in mainstream studies on nationalism and pseudoarchaeology. As always, if you can find similar publications that <i>object</i> to the opinions presented so far, you can <i>add them</i>. The problem is that the case is really too obvious to contest, no scholar in their right mind would deny that fringe science is used for political propaganda here. Find us a criticism of the allegations by a neutral third party, preferably peer-reviewed and not published by the Theosophical Society, and we'll be able to document a controversy. So far, for lack of scholarly objection, we are just documenting a straightforward case. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 10:11, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Unless you can document that the BJP has been using the Indus script as a tool to get votes, there is absolutely no connection. Rather the synthesis of various unrel,ated thing, Theosophy, Vivekananda, various Indian authors, and conflating them to the BJP/VHP/RSS is obvious original research and implausible. Hindutva "propaganda" is more along the lines of "Muslims will be a majority in India in 3000C.E." or something like that, not the Indus script is Vedic post-Classical Sanskrit.<b><a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman"><font color="purple">Baka</font></a><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman"><font color="red">man</font></a></b> 16:25, 31 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I raise an objection on the talk page to the name of the article, indicating that I would prefer it to be at Hindutva and Pseudoscience or some such title. The subject itself seems to be notable; note that your objection here is merely that the article is not sweeping <i>enough</i>.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. There should be a article to outline every mix of rightwing (twisting of) religion and politics. Their use of propaganda to try to capture peoples minds, from the (pseudo) christian politics of George W. Bush to lure in evangelical christians, to the extreme in other situations, such as the luring of indians of <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindu.html" title="Hindu">hindu</a> faith into anti-minority movements. Hindutva or christutva or whateverva are serious subjects that deserve their own articles as they are real and organized movements that need to be noted.

Again, have a look at the RfArb records for a good laugh. Note also this user's tendency towards useless argumentation; any discussion, even an AfD battle, is reduced to a personality or cultural clash.

I pointed out that for this user to pretend to be a Wikipedian in excellent standing was a little odd, as he's noted for his tendency to get into brawls of this sort. (4) I don't attack people for their votes!

<dd>this is the <b>3rd</b> Afd in three weeks. Granted, the first one was closed out of process because it had been submitted by a sock (which in itself is telling).

<p>Muck that a small group of people throw at each other cannot be used to paint entire populations with the brush dipped in the same muck. For all the hell that is being raised on wikipedia, the fact remains that 99.99%(I daresay) of practicing Hindus(that includes priests and sanskrit scholars) dont even know that a controversy of this nature <i>even exists</i> and are as oblivious to such names as Witzel and Sokal or whoever as they are about Frawley and Kak. 99.99% of them are even unaware that something called AIT was <i>even proposed</i> and the same can be said of their awareness of <i>OIT</i>. So in the absence of an audience willing to listen, branding a POV as 'propaganda' is far fetched. This issue if anything, is purely one that exists and is known only to people 'in the know' and should only be presented as such.</p>
<p>Just because all groups involved in this issue accuse each other of 'propaganda' doesnt mean we should have articles on their insinuations and counter insinuations. This is an article on such a POV and reads(as it was designed) as a POV fork. Just as having an article on, say, "Witzel's propaganda" is not right, having one on what Witzel characterises as "Hindu/tva's" propaganda is just not right. It is one thing to write articles by citing Witzel's(or Sokal's) <a href="../../../s/c/h/Scholarship.html" title="Scholarship">scholarship</a> and entirely another to write one by citing his gripe/angst/grievance/lamentations. In other words, to advance something like</p>
<p><i>any traditional Hindu idea or practice, however obscure and irrational it might have been through its history, gets the honoric of "science" if it bears any resemblance at all, however remote, to an idea that is valued (even for the wrong reasons) in the West.[2]</i></p>
<p>I hope that, Sokal in his book, has</p>
<p>a) Established with notable and verifiable sources that there is indeed such a practice on the Hindu/tvavadi's parts to [....however obscure and irrational it might have been through its history, gets the honoric of "science"....] b) That this kind of claiming scientific sanction for their rituals etc., is not an isolated case and that it is more often than not, the rule and not the exception. c) That this pattern is found in an overwhelming percentage of Hindu/tvavadis.</p>
<p>If on the other hand, Sokal has only studied the habits of a handful of his adversaries(like say, Kak) for his 'sample size', then it is fair to say that his results are falsifiable. One of the reasons is also because he is supposing his sample size to be the true representatives of Hindu/tvavadis. Truth to say, there is no single person anywhere in the world who can claim that. Arya Samaj for all the currency it holds in these matters, is virtually a non entity in entire southern India and in several parts of the rest of India. Vivekananda fame stems not because of his opposition of AIT but simply as an 'elightened being'/saint and as Sri Ramakrishna's student. Infact, I daresay, even adherents of the handful of Vivekananda missions across India are not aware that he even had something to say about AIT. It will be news to them as will AIT/AMT/OIT itself.</p>
<p>Propaganda is what Hitler did during World War II. His theories, that covered the entire gamut of p-p-p and much more was certainly propaganda, in that, it was concocted for consumption of a public that would readily and happily gulp it down and ask for more. Propaganda was what <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periyar.html" title="Periyar">periyar</a> did with his visceral hate campaign against brahmins. In other words, there is an active propagandiser and a proactive propagand<i>ee</i>.

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> I haven't read the article yet, but I certainly have read some benighted trash produced by Hindutva luminaries, among them Subhash Kak, B. B. Lal (once a great archaeologist, who alas, in his late retirement, parted company with rigor), and N. S. Rajaram. There is a latter-day cottage industry out there producing unmitigated cultural grandiosity in the name science. Readers need to be warned of that. Perhaps the name of the article could be changed to "Hindutva Pseudoscience" or something similar, but its usefulness is not in doubt. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 04:47, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The only useful point that this article makes is that mainstream scholarship dismisses the claims made by Frawley, Kak et al. This point has already been made on several related articles <i>ad nauseum</i>.</dd>
<dd>Simply stating 'matter of factly' and dispassionately that 'mainstream scholarship' dismisses that of Kak et al., is 'warning enough'. This article, apart from making the said point, goes ahead and includes quotes by Witzel, Sokal etc., in a bid to underline and emphasise the contempt that that 'mainstream scholars' have not just for the opponent's 'scholarship' but <i>also</i> for the <u><i>opponent</i></u>. This, it does by cherry picking and quoting verbatim what is simply <i>ad hominem</i> cruft. As a student of the subject, I am only interested in the subject and not the <i>ad hominem</i> exchange of fire that takes place between people. An encyclopedia is simply not the place for such cruft.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Simply make the point of what the issue is, who holds what view of the issue and whose view has 'scholarly sanction' and whose does NOT and leave it at that. Readers are intelligent enough to read everything and make up their mind. We are here only to present the facts and not to engineer opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also once all views have been stated, there is no need to keep updating these articles with the latest scores everytime Witzel and Rajaram exchange fire. Newspapers and magazines and books and blogs will keep those scores for us.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And most importantly, characterising the views of a Kak and Rajaram as being the views of 'Hindutva/vadis' is a fantastic case of generalising to suit conveniences. Hindutva/vadi itself is a term that has no definition in black and white. It was coined by somebody who himself is not seen as representative of anything or anybody, leave alone Hindus. If Hindutva is defined simply as 'being Hindu' then I am a 'hindutvavadi'(sic). Needless to say, I dont see Kak or Savarkar or anybody as representatives of my faith. Not by any stretch of imagination. Nor do an overwhelming majority of hundreds of millions of other Hindus. Hindus have no high command like the pope or the catholic church. So ascribing to all Hindus, a view of someone that not even 1% of Hindus have even heard about, is simply nonsense.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Coz, truth be told, for all the zillion hours of editing and cpediting and 'POV fighting' that editors of these articles have put in, all these articles read as confused pieces with hardly any value for the dispassionate reader. Many of these articles have derailed so badly that it makes almost no sense to somebody who has no clue of the history of edit warring that has gone in to put the article together. In other words, believe me, these articles make no sense to anybody except the dabs and the Bakas. The very purpose of wikipedia as an encyclopedia is being defeated and compromised by both parties insisting on adding every ad hominem exchange of fire that takes place.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I think its high time we all get together at the village pump and hammer out a policy to explicitly deal with 'controversial' articles. The policy in a nutshell should read something like <b>"Keep the facts in, keep the commentary(also read as <i>'ad hominem' cruft</i>) out".</b> <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 05:44, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't disagree with some of the things you say. However, "Hindutva" is not the same thing as "being Hindu." Nor is it "Hindu nationalism." Although the word has supposedly been around since the 1920s, it is political word, linked very much to the resurgence of the BJP in India in the 1990s. In the 1960s if you had asked someone what the word meant, you would have likely elicited derisive laughter, not because of the political implications of the word which no one knew then, but because the word 'Hindutva" is a portmanteau of a Persian/Urdu word "Hindu" and the Sanskrit "tatva," which only a shabby scholar (like Savarkar) could have put together. Hindutva scholarship has not only continued this tradition of combining implausibles, and created fantastic nonsense (like the Vedic Aryans solving quadratic equations in 5000 BCE), but has also aggressively insinuated itself into school curricula and so forth. This last issue is worrisome. I think we need an article that keeps tabs on the mischief Savarkar's intellectual descendants are wreaking upon us. I am sure the article can say at the outset (if it doesn't already) that "Hindutva" is a political word and is not the same thing as "Hindu" etc. <a href="../../../f/o/w/User%7EFowler%26fowler_e6e1.html" title="User:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#B8860B">Fowler&amp;fowler</font></a><a href="../../../f/o/w/User_talk%7EFowler%26fowler_5ef0.html" title="User talk:Fowler&amp;fowler"><font color="#708090">«Talk»</font></a> 08:14, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>....which only a shabby scholar (like Savarkar)...</i> - here lies the problem. It shouldnt be of any concern to the editor or the reader of an encyclopedia whether somebody is a 'shabby' scholar or a 'great' scholar. All that <i>should</i> matter is the facts. Leave the commentary out. Also if 'Hindutva' itself has no fixed meaning and depends heavily on the context and/or whose mouth it is coming from, how can terms like 'Hindutva propaganda', 'Hindutva p-p-p' or derivatives like 'Hindutvavadi' etc., have any meaning?</dd>
<dd><i>...Hindutva scholarship has not only continued this tradition of combining implausibles, and created fantastic nonsense (like the Vedic Aryans solving quadratic equations in 5000 BCE)...</i></dd>
<dd>'Hindutva <i>scholarship</i> now! Even if we were to assume that Savarkar was the high priest of Hindutva, how did you conclude that Kak and Frawley, for example, are carrying on from where Savarkar left off? It is not like say, Karunanidhi carrying on Periyar's work(that is a case where Periyar was the high priest and annadurai, karunanidhi et al form the unbroken <i>shishya parampara</i>). Kak and Frawley for heaven's sake were not even born when Savarkar was around! If Kak says something, ascribe it to Kak and nobody else. If Frawley says something, ascribe it to Frawley and no one else. If supporters of Kak's views want space for it on wikipedia, start an article for say, each of Kak's books where he has presented his views and present them <i>there</i>. Same holds for Frawley. Same holds for Rajaram. And in the AIT article, put all these articles in the ==See also== and also a SS prose under ==Criticism of AIT==. Now if you ask why Kak, who in your view is a quack should be given space in any of these articles, it is simply because he is a 'notable' critic of the AIT and associated theories. And how did I accord the status of a 'notable critic' to Kak, you may ask. I accorded the status because 'scholars' like Witzel have 'dignified' what <i>you</i> dismiss as drivel with responses. Witzel and co have unwittingly given Kak and co the 'notability' required for a wikipedia mention by choosing to respond! every bum has an opinion but then not every bum's opinion gets the audience and critical analysis of experts! go figure.</dd>
<dd>And btw, why should any claim that vedic aryans or their chinese or egyptian contemporaries or anyone for that matter solve quadratic equations be <i>fantastic nonsense</i>? If <i>homo sapiens</i> of modern day can solve quadratic equations, I dont see any reason why <i>homo sapiens</i> of 5000 years ago could not have. The science of logic and probability tells me not to dismiss the <i>possibility</i> as <i>fantastic nonsense</i> or even nonsense. Yes at the same time, do I <i>believe</i> that they did? <b>No</b>. Not until I see some proof. Do I believe that it might/could have been possible? <b>Yes</b>(I dont see any reason why <i>not</i>). So, for purposes of an encyclopedia we would have to leave commentary like <i>fantastic nonsense</i> out of the picture and simply state the facts. The facts in this case should read something like - "A claim has been made by so and so... that homo sapiens of 5000 years ago could solve quadratic equations. However, in the absence of any proof to support the claim (or because the proof provided in support of the claim do not measure up to scientific rigor), the claim has been dismissed by the scientific community at large." <a href="../../../s/a/r/User_talk%7ESarvagnya_de49.html" title="User talk:Sarvagnya">Sarvagnya</a> 10:58, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is fantastic nonsense because the notion of negative numbers (a <i>sine qua non</i> for a general solution of a quadratic) didn't exist anywhere until the first millennium CE, and because special cases of quadratics like: <span class="texhtml"><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> − 9 = 0</span> are not called "quadratics," but simply "square roots."

</ul>
<ol>
<li>The title <i>Hindutva propaganda</i> almost implies the entire Hindutva movement in based on propaganda. Regardless of whether it is or not, I ask those who voted keep to consider a more neutral title at least such as <i>Propaganda/Pseudoscience in Hindutva</i> Just like with every ideaology, there are moderates and extremes. Saying propaganda is central to a former ruling party in India is quite harsh, no matter who you are.</li>
<li>If this article is kept, it will allow the creation of other "XYZ propaganda" articles. Possible which may be created is Indophobic propaganda, [[Islamofascist in opposition to this one. And here is something interesting. What does everyone here think of the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_propaganda.html" title="Nazi propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> article? Does it suffer the same problems of <a href="../../../u/n/d/WP%7EUNDUE_5fa0.html" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>?

<dd>A appreciate the concern over wanton "XYZ propaganda" articles. But the precedent is already in place anyway, with articles like <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_propaganda.html" title="Nazi propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_propaganda.html" title="Soviet propaganda">Soviet propaganda</a>. This is similar to "persecution of XYZ" or "criticism of XYZ": A certain amount of vigilantism is required to prevent the creation of unwarranted articles. One example would be <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Jews_75db.html" title="Historical persecution by Jews">Historical persecution by Jews</a>, which, it was argued, was "not pov" because we have <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Persecution_by_Christians_3cbe.html" title="Historical Persecution by Christians">Historical Persecution by Christians</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_persecution_by_Muslims_d2ab.html" title="Historical persecution by Muslims">Historical persecution by Muslims</a>. But, it simply turned out that there was practically no material that fit the article title. Thus, deletion of "persecution by X" or "Y propaganda" must have a case by case basis. The article under discussion here presents plenty of academic sources that document the rise of "Hindutva pseudoarchaeology" since the 1990s, so that there can be no doubt that this article is valid. Other creations like anti-Hindu propaganda would need to meet similar standards of an academic basis. Surely, such an article cannot be justified by citing the propaganda/counter-propaganda machine itself. But if the phenomenon is substantiated by Cambridge, Rutgers, and Routledge publications, there can simply be no debate over article validity. Before we harp on the question of titling too much, note that I have moved the article and was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;diff=119300979&amp;oldid=119272017" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hindutva_propaganda&amp;diff=119300979&amp;oldid=119272017" rel="nofollow">reverted</a> by AMbroodEY for taking away his pretext for calling for deletion. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 13:03, 2 April 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Nazi &amp; Soviet propogandas were not religious one.So, comparision is just not proper.See yourself that there is no article named Christian Propoganda or Muslim Propoganda on WP. Hindutva is IA term meaning "being Hindu" or Hinduness in English. And, to tell that `being Hindu' or Hinduness is propoganda&#160;; is blatant lie for the world's oldest religion or spiritual force.</p>
<p>One should remember that it was `being Christian' feeling that got united to draw Islam out of Europe. Or it was `being Muslim' feeling that made all religious conversions out of Arabia. So, would you say that as Chritianness or Islamness Propoganda&#160;? One can see that the creator &amp; main writer is trying to do propoganda to denigrate Hinduism. First he should write Christian Propoganda article ( one who is not allowing traditional presentation of <a href="../../../r/i/g/RigVeda_f045.html" title="RigVeda">RigVeda</a> and names section as `Vedantic and Hindu reformist views'. It misrepresents traditional Hindu views about Rig-Veda. And, telling traditional Hindu views as reformist is also misrepresenting the fact. If RigVeda is just ritual based text then Hindus would not have revered it as a seed of all Indian wisdom, be it spiritual or other sciences. Veda itself means knowledge in Sanskrit. So, I strongly object mis-undestanding &amp; hence mis-representation of Hindu texts by materialistic goggles wearing western eyes. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWIN_8a28.html" title="User:WIN">WIN</a> 05:29, 7 April 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Nazi propaganda and Soviet propaganda are not valid analogies here. Both 'Nazi' and 'Soviet' are well defined entities. And there, the propaganda stemmed from the establishment. That it was propaganda is also well attested. Not just esoteric academic journals but every single newspaper and magazine and tabloid and TV channel has called it 'propaganda'. That said, an article about it in an encyclopedia should be balanced and present both/all sides.</dd>

<dd>otoh, here, neither is 'Hindutva' itself unambiguously defined nor has it been established or demonstrated beyond doubt that it is propaganda. And I cant imagine that it ever will be.

As far as the merge discussion concerned, I don't think that AfDs are healthy environnements to discuss it, and should be handled in the talk pages of article concerned. However, if things come to a standstill then AfD can rule on a merge (I am assuming that is the case here). I am not against a <b>merge</b> since the article seems to confuse criticism of Hindutva with Hindutva propaganda - the only true "propaganda exposé" I could make out was the last section (about education). In that context, it can be renamed or merged - it just depends on if the editors will be able distingiush criticism (which belongs in the main article) with "propaganda" (act of proliferating the ideology and the tactics used to achieve that end).. It would be better if the regular editors could iron it out between themselves - however a delete seems unnecessary. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 03:30, 3 April 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> The article was initially a redirect page that I nominated. Before any decision was made, it was converted from a redirect to an article. The 1st AfD was by a known sock-puppeteer and was speedy closed. The second time, the article was moved. This caused confusion and no decision was taken anyway<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scheibenzahl#Re:_Hindutva_pseudoscience_redirect" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Scheibenzahl#Re:_Hindutva_pseudoscience_redirect" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. The article at the time of 3rd, so-called "finally correct", nomination was a bunch of quotes from unknown papers by Witzel and Nanda I couldn't find, and filled with POV/weasel words like, "the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indigenous_Aryans_ff63.html" title="Indigenous Aryans">Indigenous Aryans</a> ideology insisting on fantastic antiquity of an <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_race.html" title="Aryan race">Aryan race</a> in the Indian subcontinent". Gross accusations without a citation, disputed to be in violation of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The article was in such bad shape as if created by someone who just found about a wiki. Kind of hard to expect from an admin. While still up for AfD, the article was moved and moved back. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">User:Rudrasharman</a> and <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">User:Hornplease</a> didn't have a problem then, now they are blabbering about "article being edited after AfD by &lt;insert POV defamatory terms here&gt;", "bad faith nomination" etc. I edited it and removed such POV words. Wikified it as much as I could understand, and got tired in the middle of the article because of lack of citations. My request for paper has not been answered yet, instead people are calling me a part of "Hindutva brigade", "zeolot" etc for no reason except <a href="../../../f/e/a/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt.html" title="Fear, uncertainty and doubt">FUD</a>. Then I was edit warred for "bad english". It is clear there is a cabal calling every one "Hindutvadi", "Nazi" etc. for no reason other than discrediting those who say "Delete". I personally see absolutely no reason to keep an article about a term which is not even used anywhere. Yes, NO WHERE. People here, in the disguise of having <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, are trying to create a counter propaganda article, by coining a new term. I suggest delete for the violation of <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.

<p><b>Reply to Scheibenzahl's Comment</b>: Well, it may be that "Hindutva propaganda" is a term that is not widely used, but the subject of the article could still be noteworthy. Here is what I mean: the so-called Out-of-India or Indigenous Aryan perspective is to be found expressed (or at least attempted) on a number of Wikipedia pages. However, if you scour mainstream academic literature (peer-review internationally-recognized journals or internationally-known academic/university publishers) this perspective is conspicuous by its absence. None of the other tertiary sources (Britannica, Encarta, World Book Encyclopedia, Columbia Encyclopedia) say a word about Indigenous Aryans. Why is this the case? One could of course dream up conspiracy theories, that "Euro-centric" academia is anti-Indian etc., but from what little I know about the academic scene in the West, the competition for jobs, tenure, and the 15 minutes of fame is so great that if there were a realistic chance of the Aryans being indigenous, people would be lining up to write papers about them, regardless of the prevailing orthodoxy in the field. The alternate view is that the movement to claim the Aryans as indigenous to India is a partisan one, with more belief than hard facts on their side. That is what pseudoscience is. I quote from a paper of Sudeshna Guha that I just finished reading,<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
