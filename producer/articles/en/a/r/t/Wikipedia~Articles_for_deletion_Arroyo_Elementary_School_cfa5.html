There are about 125,000 schools in the United States, so stating that "a majority" of schools receive this award is incorrect. As for it not meeting <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, the solution for articles that don't meet <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> is to merge (which I'd be fine with), not delete. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 16:52, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Blue Ribbon winner or not, they're still elementary schools, and being two of the 3,000 best elementary schools is still not sufficiently notable. And considering that being a Blue Ribbon School and California Distinguished School is the <i>only</i> info that matters in either article (Kids are let out early on Wednesdays? No way! They have a new parking lot and a lot of teachers? I don't believe it! &lt;/sarcasm&gt;), a merge makes perfect sense. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 20:04, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

As specified by <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a>, the nomination made an entirely false claim regarding the notabilty of the award, and the nominators comments still make it clear that we have here is a failure to communicate. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 03:29, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pointless comment. Your link contradicts your statement. Most recent AfD's for primary/elementary schools (since September) resulted in <i>no consensus</i> or <i>merge</i>. But even if precedent were unanimously on the <i>keep</i> side, the nom wouldn't be pointless, as the fact that <i>no one can say why this school is (or most schools at Afd are) <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a></i> would suggest that precedent has to be revisited. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 16:50, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, but it HAS been adequately explained by the vote-flood of my friends at schoolwatch above. And in the event of no consensus on an AFD, the keep side wins, so I say yes, this is a pointless nomination. --<a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbiddenWord_6468.html" title="User:ForbiddenWord">ForbiddenWord</a> 19:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
