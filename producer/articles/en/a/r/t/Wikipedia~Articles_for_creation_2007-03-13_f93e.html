<p>Ballynahinch Rugby Football Club; Ulster Rugby Union Club located at Ballymacarn Park on the Grove Road just outside of Ballynahinch, Co. Down. Members of AIB All Ireland League Division 3. 7 senior teams, 4 youth teams and mini rugby programme.</p>
<p>Club History</p>
<p>The present club was formed at a meeting in the Ballynahinch Royal British Legion Hall in April of 1954. The initiative and enthusiasm to form the club came mainly from the first honorary secretary, Mr. W. Steele, who came to the town as a cashier in the Ulster Bank, having played rugby for Coleraine R.F.C. before the war. About a dozen people attended the meeting and they agreed that a club should be formed and application be made to enter the Junior League in the season 1954 / 55. The application was duly made, and accepted by The Ulster Branch, and the Club played their first match in September of 1954.</p>
<p>The Club membership quickly grew, with players travelling from all parts of County Down and from the South side of Belfast. Credit must be given to all those players who participated so well at those early stages as the Club was promoted from the lowest end of the Junior league to highest section of the Junior League in the minimum number of seasons possible.</p>
<p>A suitable pitch had been acquired at Ballykine, rented from Mr. McGurnaghan, and excellent changing rooms and showers were available in Mr. A. Shaw's back yard. In reality, these changing facilities were in Drew Shaw's garage, and on many occasions his car had to be manhandles out of the way so that access could be gained. Christmas in Shaw's yard was always an interesting experience as the scene in the yard was rather Dickensian when the turkey plucking was in full flow - just think of what the Chaps! from Belfast thought of that - you can just picture the scene.</p>
<p>In the early 1960's, the Hinch was a vibrant, throbbing community; rugby was not just a game, it was a way of life. There were many characters playing at that time, many of whom are still actively involved in the Club today. Names such as, Joe Carlisle or (Wee Joe) as he is much better known, Brian Kirkpatrick, Cecil and George McFadden, Dem Finney, Arthur Gibson, Murray Lee, Neville Johnston, Harry Snodden, Willie Vance, Trevor Finney and John Orr to name but a few. It is sad to note that a few of those illustrious names are no longer with us</p>
<p>During this period, the 1st XV won the Ulster Towns Cup when they defeated Bangor by one try and one-drop goal and one penalty goal to nil. It was a victory as decisive as the scoreline suggests and one that was never really in doubt from early in the game. The same team of players went on to win the Junior Cup in consecutive seasons first beating Dungannon 1965 /66 then Kings Scholars 1966/67.</p>
<p><br />
First Minute - 2nd April 1954 Andy Ward in action Bective Rangers in one of his last games as a Hinch player. Jan-2005 The 1964 Ulster Towns Cup winners who defeated Bangor by one try and one-drop goal and one penalty goal to nil.</p>
<p>This success helped promote the game within the locality and the Club continued to grow and it wasn't long until the members realised that they needed to find their own ground and construct their own Clubhouse. In August of 1970 a search ensued for the appropriate property which resulted in the purchase of Mr. Whitford's farm of approximately 16 acres and a house situated near Spa Golf Club on the outskirts of the town, the cost - £6,500. When the sale was completed, the Club Council sold the house and a few acres for £3,000.</p>
<p>The Drumlins were levelled under the supervision of Don Lee, who opportunely hired earth-moving equipment that was idly waiting in Randlestown for orders to begin construction of the M2. Work continued at pace amid much fundraising by all the members and finally the grounds and new Clubhouse were ready for action, officially opening with an invitation match against a Stewart McKinney International XV on Tuesday 30th March 1976.</p>
<p>The Clubhouse Today. Situated at the top of the Grove Road just outside the town the grounds have four playing pitches two of which have flood lights. The surrounding drumlin countryside and the view of the Mournes and Dromara hills add to this picturesue background.</p>
<p>The Club continued to grow and a new generation of Ist XV stars took to the newly named Ballymacarn Park. Names such as Jim Kirk, Sam Robinson, Raymond Gourley, Ed Tormey, Jimmy Hilland, James Napier, David Donnan, Lesley McGaughey and Ted Magowan to name but a few.</p>
<p>The Evergreens took to the field and played their first match on 7th April 1979 when they took on the Lisburn side - 'Last of The Summer Wine'. The Evergreens aim is to extend the playing careers of those who had served the Club faithfully in the past, and also to inculcate the best traditions of the game into the younger members of the Club. Today the Evergreens are still going strong forming the 7th XV and fighting hard as always at the top of their league.</p>
<p>In 1984, the Club toured Canada under the captaincy of Sam Robinson, it was a tour that was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone and helped to build the foundation for the successful years to follow. In 1984, the Hinch side had young blood injected into it; Mark Napier and Colin Magowan at halfback were to prove to be an outstanding partnership. Philip Gregg at full-back had a fantastic accurate boot, Raymie McCavery, Peter Magowan, Lesley McGaughy and Trevor Scott had great pace and lots of skill in the back division.</p>
<p>Up front Crosby Cleland had joined the Club from Ards and provided much guile and strength at Number 8, David Rea had returned to the Hinch from CIYMS and partnered Alan Reid in what proved to be an outstanding backrow unit. David Donnan and Alan Montgomery provide the backbone to the pack with an enormous amount of experience and technical ability. David Workman had joined the Club after marrying local girl Flora Wallace. Having played a bit of rugby in the front row of a Ballymena pack which included Willie John McBride and Sid Millar, he managed to talk his way into the number 2 shirt. Along side him came John Dickson at loose head, John, like David Rea had returned home to the Hinch from CIYMS. The pack was securely anchored at tight head by David Dodd, who, although small in stature was very strong and a very awkward opponent.</p>
<p>The Hinch 1stXV from 1984 - 1990 that won 3 Ulster Towns Cups, 2 Ulster Junior Cups and 3 Nutty Krust Cups Thus evolved the nucleus of the side which would go on to dominate Junior Rugby for the next ten years. In this period the aforementioned names played in five Ravenhill finals - winning all five. First was the epic final of the 1986 Towns Cup, when the Hinch beat a much-fancied Enniskillen side. The following year they won the double, the first club side to achieve that distinction since Ballymena in 1911. In the Towns Cup final, they defeated Banbridge and in the Junior Cup Final, they beat Ards. At the time these two victories, although just another successful conclusion to a cup campaign, were really quite an achievement, one that both the Club and players involved can justly feel proud of. The 1989/90 season saw the 1st XV return to Ravenhill for their third Towns Cup final, this time their opponents were Ballymena and as the history show, it was the Braid men that left the big smoke without the famous trophy. The last big Ravenhill final of that era was in 1991/92, when again Ballymena provided the opposition. The result was clear from the outset and the Junior Cup went back to the trophy cabinet at Ballymacarn Park.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that during this period the same side had considerable success in winning the Knutty Krust - Portadown RFC Floodlit Tournament. Those cold Tuesday evenings at Portadown provided much craic and banter as we lifted the Trophy on three occasions, 1985, 1986 and 1990.</p>
<p>It is now the early 90's and change was afoot, change that was long overdue. The Stevenson Report recommended that promotion and relegation from Junior to Senior status should be implemented over a three year period, with the promotion winners in that third year gaining qualification as a Senior Club and entry into the new All Ireland League Structure.</p>
<p>This was a goal that the Club had fought for over many years, and Club Council set the structures in place to help achieve this goal. During the previous ten years the 1st XV had many annual fixtures with Senior Ulster Clubs, these were known as Senior Friendly matches. More often than not, the Ballynahinch side would win such an encounter so the Club Council knew we had the ability to survive at that level.</p>
<p>New blood was sought to help strengthen the fold, and new stars were emerged such as, Roy Wilson at hooker, Ian Moore and Colin Montgomery in the second row, Michael Rodges and Brian Wilson in the back row and Ronnie Steele at loose head in the front row. Old hands in the form of David Dodd and David Donnan were retained in the pack to give a bit of advice here and there. In the backs Jonathan Peake at full back, Paul Koscielny Clem Bassett and Barry Crawford in the centre, Terry Hilland and George Clements on the wings gave excellent support to the more experienced older men such and Gregg, Napier Magowan and McCavery.</p>
<p>One other vital ingredient was about to be added to the mix - one Andrew James Ward, a rather shy, yet polite Kiwi who could fit in somewhere amongst the backrow. This latter individual is of course Andy Ward, who managed to instil that New Zealand zest for the game into the Hinch set-up. So much so, that before we said goodbye to Junior Rugby the 1994/1995 side, in the Club's 40th Anniversary year, did what many thought they would never see achieved again, they won the Towns Cup and Junior Cup double at Ravenhill for the second time in the Club's history.</p>
<p>Andy impressed everyone so much he was made Club Captain for the next season, a season in which it was more important to win the League and leave the cup success for the history books to record. Ronnie Tucker the Junior Ulster coach joined the Ballymavcarn set up as Coach. With winning the qualifying League the clear objective Andy Ward and Ronnie Tucker set about reaching this target, which was achieved in emphatic style, as Ballynahinch Rugby Football Club now entered a new phase in its history, after 41 years of playing rugby football, Ballynahinch had gained senior status.</p>
<p>The next season 1996/1997 saw the success continue as new players joined the club. Richard Hedley played at full back, James Kirk Jnr. and Steven Seymour the wingers, Darryl Callaghan and Roger Erwin the new half-backs. Brian Reid, Chris Armstrong and Lewis Johnston formed a new front row trio, with Johnny Wilson pushing for a second row shirt. Stephen Kelly was a name to remember as he made several appearances at flanker.</p>
<p>Under the captaincy of Brian Wilson these new players fitted into the squad extremely well, as the AIL Division 4 became a two horse race between ourselves and Suttonians, a Club like ourselves newly promoted from Junior rugby in Leinster. The title went down to the last match with the Hinch travelling to Suttonians only to lose narrowly in a very close encounter. However, as we finished in second place in the League we gained promotion to Division 3.</p>
<p>The1997/1998 season started without the services of Andy Ward who had come to the attention of the Ulster Selectors, but despite this set back at Club level, the players performed well, and maintained their run of excellent results. Again, the league developed into a two horse race between Portadown, and ourselves, with Portadown winning outright promotion and the Hinch finishing second. Further honour was bestowed upon the Club when Andy Ward was called up for his and the Club's first full international cap when he played against France in Paris. A number of his team mates travelled to Paris to be there on that historic occasion, the rest of us packed the Clubhouse to watch history being made, as we viewed the match on two specially erected TV screens. Andy had a great debut in Paris and went on to play against England at Twickenham and against Wales at Lansdowne Road, a match in which he scored his first Irish try.</p>
<p>Back on the domestic front, the battle for promotion and relegation had moved off the rugby pitch and into the courtroom, as Wanderers and Malone argued with the IRFU. The outcome was somewhat confusing, which resulted in Malone and Wanderers remaining in Division 2, being joined by Portadown and Ballynahinch.</p>
<p>Now in Division 2 the 1998/1999 season was not great, in fact it was awful. Injuries to a number of essential players and the bad rub of the green meant that we were relegated back into Division 3 only winning one AIL game, against Old Wesley. However, Ulster Rugby reigned supreme, as the European Cup was brought back to Belfast in what was an unforgettable few months of Rugby. Again, the Club was well represented by Andy Ward, who played a major role in the success of the Ulster Side.</p>
<p>Lewis Johnston took over the captaincy the next season, and together with the new Club Coach, the Ex Ireland and Ulster centre Mark McCall, attracted some useful talent to the squad. be The knock back down to Division 3 proved to be a motivational point as the players wanted to prove they were worthy of Division 2 rugby. They stuck to their task extremely well and won the Division 3 title on the very last game of the season, when they defeated Ballina at Ballymacarn Park. This was a tremendous effort, and one that reflects much credit on the players and their coach.</p>
<p>Mark McCall stayed as coach for the 00-01 season and consolidated the Hinch position in Division 2. Allen Clarke took over the rains from McCall who became Alan Solomon’s number 2 with Ulster. Again the results were encouraging with the club competing well to finish in mid-table. The club also played in their first Senior Cup final losing to Dungannon in the final.</p>
<p>Andy Ward became the club coach during the 02-03 season while being appointed as the Ulster captain by Alan Solomons. It was a tough ear for Ulster, which was more or less over by the end of January, which meant that Wardy was able to become player coach in the final months of the season. His influence was rewarded with the club finishing sixth – the highest position gained in the AIL to date.</p>
<p>Brian McLaughlin took over as coach during the 03-04 season and molded the exciting young side that exists today. That first season in charge saw the club finish mid table and Senior Cup final appearance losing 11-3 to Ballymena. Last season with the introduction of a few young players McLaughlin’s stormed into a great start to the AIL campaign, winning 5 from 5. The side developed well but lacked a number of players in a few key positions. By the end of the season the league title and play-offs for Division 1 had disappeared. A closely fought semi-final in the Ulster Senior Cup saw the Hinch lose in the final minute of extra time to Ballymena, it was a bitter pill to swallow as the county Down men were by far the better side.</p>
<p>Brian McLaughlin has since been appointed to the coaching staff of the national squad and the to take over at Ballymacarn Park for this season is non other that Willie Anderson. Willie will bring a wealth of experience to the Hinch set up and with the addition of a number of new players to the squad the future looks very exciting indeed, Division 1 being the goal at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Ballynahinch has proved to be a great testing ground for coaches to progress to great things, but on the playing front there a number of notable players. Paul Marshall at scrum half is a real gem and Mark Scott is another young star who overcame early season injury to impress every time he played. As a centre he is a strong man in defence and is devastating in attack and another young man who has a very bright rugby future in front of him. Irish and Ulster Un21 Stewart Megaw has joined the club from Queens and will form a partnership in the midfield with Scott. Ulster, Irish Schools and Royal School Armagh flanker William Faloon and second row Johnny Graham have been added to the pack. The club also has a very strong youth section under the coaching of Latimer Adair playing at Un20, Un18, Un16 and Un14 levels and this year seventeen young players will graduate into the adult club. Four of these young men will certainly feature in the senior squad, prop forward Nigel Newell, number 8 Richard Robinson, centre Thomas McClements and flanker Robert Greer. Ballynahinch 1stXV 2004:2005</p>
<p>The 2006-2007 season started with real optimism, Breezmount Transport were once again out main sponsors for the season and Irish and Ulster legend Willie Anderson joined the club as head coach. However, early Ulster League form did not indicate a successful assault on the Division 2 league was going to be achieved.</p>
<p>Ards and Ballymena inflicted early defeats before the Hinch steadied the ship with a convincing home victory over Banbridge. Harlequins proved too strong at Deramore albeit with the help of uncontested scrums. The following Wednesday, City of Derry came down to Ballymacarn Park for a mid-week fixture and made the Hinch boys fight all the way for a much needed victory. Stevenson Park was next with the Division 1 men in top form they handed out a lesson on how to score tries sending the Hinch men home to County Down with their tails between their legs. Instonians travelled to Ballymacarn and returned to the city with a share of the points having secured a 3-3 draw, but this was followed a week later with a narrow defeat at Gibson Park at the hands of Malone.</p>
<p>The AIL was once again sponsored by the AIB and it kicked-off on the 15th October with the visit of Terenure to Ballynahinch. The Dubliners proved to be a strong and will organised side and returned south with four points in the bag. Greystones was the next location a week later and the seaside town on the Wicklow coast held no joy for the County Down men who returned north having been well beaten on the day. Limerick side Old Crescent travelled north and met a Hinch side that seemed to just click on the day to record a vital home win and get themselves off the bottom of the league. One week later the side travelled to Cork to play Midleton and played some excellent rugby to defeat the home side with quality tries. Paul Marshall and Kyle Corrigan both impressed but more importantly it took the AIL tally to played 4 won 2 and lost 2.</p>
<p>UCC travelled north in early December and took all the points back to Cork following a display of entertaining running rugby. 2005 was to end with no joy in Dublin when Bective defeated the Hinch boys at Donnybrook. Having held the Dubliners to within 3 points, the home side broke free from deep in their 22 in the final minute and ran the length of the pitch to score a try, preventing the Hinch from gaining a vital bonus point.</p>
<p>The league by this stage had split in two with the Hinch now clearly in a battle to avoid relegation. Young Munster travelled to County Down in the first week in January and went home with 2 points having earned an 18 all draw. Musgrave Park in Cork promised much when the Hinch had taken a much deserved 19-7 lead over Dolphin by half-time, but the Ulster side failed to show up for the second half and Dolphin went on to win easily when the totally dominated the remaining 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Waterpark had been propping up the bottom of the league all season and they came to Ballynahinch in the third week in January in less than confident mood. The Hinch took full advantage and totally dominated scoring six tries and gaining a vital bonus point. Liam Fitzgerald Park Limerick was the venue for the next big match and once again the Hinch had their chances to win, however, the sending off of loose head Chris Stevenson in the final quarter ended any chance of gaining any points from this one. It was interesting to note that at the subsequent IRFU Disciplinary hearing the Hinch player was found to have no case to answer.</p>
<p>Relegation was looming large by the time De La Salle travelled to Ballynahinch at the end of February, but a bit home performance from the Hinch side claimed the points and set up a do or die tie against Malone at the end of March. First there was another trip to Cork to meet Highfield and once again the Hinch men failed to meet the standard loosing to what was a poor side in a game dominated by a howling wind.</p>
<p>The Malone fixture was a game the neither club wanted, each knew that defeat meant almost certain relegation into Division 3. The entire Gibson Park club travelled to Ballynahinch that day and give the Belfast men a tremendous level of support. Their team lifted themselves to the challenge and ran out worthy winners on the day.</p>
<p>Old Belvedere were the last lifeline the Hinch had, it was the last home game of the AIL season and the Dublin 4 side were well and truly defeated, Hinch scoring 5 tries and gaining another vital bonus point.</p>
<p>It was now all or nothing in the final match of the season. Barnhall was the venue and is either side were to lose it would spell relegation to Division 3 next season. In what turned out to be an incredible game at Parsonstown, both sides gave 100 percent, and when the Hinch took the lead with a Paul Marshall a drop goal kicked with his left foot in the final minute of injury time the season seemed to have been saved, when suddenly Eoin Burke dropped a goal almost from the restart to give Barnhall victory 16-14 and send Ballynahinch into Division 3.</p>
<p>Apart from the 1stXV the rest of the club enjoyed mixed success. The team of the year was the 3rdXV led by Raymie McCavery. They won the Junior League section 1 undefeated, and collected both the Crawford Cup and the Harden Cup in what was a highly successful and enjoyable season for them all.</p>
<p>The youth section of the club continued to flourish under the leadership of Latimer Adair and Ronnie McCavery. The highlight of the season being a trip to Ravenhill for the U18 cup final. Unfortunately the Hinch boys lost out to a very strong Malone side,</p>
<p>The mini-rugby section continues to grow from strength to strength and sight of some 150-180 children on the pitches on a Saturday morning is something to behold. The teams have a chance to visit and play against other clubs during the year and they won the Lindsay Cars Trophy at Banbridge at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Fundraising is always vital part of the club year and the Ladies Committee worked very hard once again with a Mazda car draw the highlight of the season. The Christmas Draw, Golf Day and Sportsman’s Dinner three other notable occasions when the club manage to raise vital sponsorship to help maintain the club and facilities.</p>
<p>We now look forward to the 2006-2207 season. We say goodbye to two young players of note, first Paul Marshall’s performances in the Hinch jersey over the past two seasons has been recognised with him being given a full contract with Ulster Rugby. As part of that contract Paul has to play his club rugby with a Division 1 side and as such he has joined Harlequins under the watch-full eye of Andy Ward. Mark Scott has moved to Dungannon where he hopes to make an impression and feature in Jeremy Davidson’s Division 1 side. We wish both players every success with the year ahead and assure them they will be very welcome at Ballymacarn Park at anytime in the future.</p>
<p>It was vital that our young 1stXV side would stick together and we were delighted that this proved to be the case. Derek Suffern and Daniel Soper are the new club coaches. Suff is a former player while Daniel spent a number of years as a player coach at Banbridge where he earned emends respect. There have also been a number of new recruits and a full list will be added to this section when the full information is available. Information about players in the squad can be obtained under the “Senior Players” section.</p>
<p>This is a very short synopsis of the club history to date, the 2006-2007 season and the newly re-structured All Ireland League and new All Ireland Cup is now upon us. Exciting times lie ahead and Ballynahinch Rugby Football Club are looking forward to the challenge this season with much anticipation as we go forward with the Club motto in mind - Virtus Vires Velocitas The translation of which is - Courage Strength Speed.</p>

The Curious Savage, written by John Patrick, is a comedic play about Ethel P. Savage, a woman whose husband recently died and left her approximately ten million dollars. Ethel's three stepchildren, Titus, Lily Belle, and Samuel Savage, are shocked to find out that their mother plans to set up a memorial fund with the money to fund the ridiculous dreams of people. They arrange to have her put into a sanitorium where she meets several inmates,none of whom are completely insane, each having only one minor problem. She becomes friends with them and gains new insight into life during the play. Meanwhile, her children visit several times, flustered over the fact that she took all the money and hid it in a bundle of half-million dollar negotiable bonds. She deceives them and sends them on a wild goose chase, and they return only to meet up with the inmates and have the bonds stolen from right under their noses. Primarily a comedy, the play sets up a contrast between the inmates and Mrs. Savage's stepchildren. By the end of the play, the viewer wonders who the crazy ones really are.</p>

<p>In Unreal tournament 2003 few European Clans have become known as all round clans. Clan, [x] created in 2003 the [x] clan did not become well known till 2004 founded by [x]Megaman and co-founder [x]Zero the clan fist started recruiting in 2004. Their first recruit was none other than the legendary Deathead (a.k.a KYo). This is when their fortuned turned and the clan started recruiting better players. They recruited Freddy who later became co-leader of the clan and was host of the famous “[x] Clan Sever.” After Freddy many came because the clan with four people was starting to dominate some of the well-known clans. After many months of recruiting the clan had some of the best players seen from Europe, they were: [x]Megaman, [x]Freddy, [x]Zero, [x]Kyo(rated number defensive/offensive player of the game), [x]Fish, [x]Rush, [x]Vash, [x]Drifty, [x]Titan Kid(best defensive euro player representing the clan) [x].|Equilibrium (best offensive player representing [x]) [x]Mand, [x]Psilocybe, [x]Ludricious, [x]Dogman,[x]-M-Devil. The clan went onto having the best European record and the second best overall record in the game second only to the 4 Emperors. Having some impressive competition from the time, some of the best clans played during what is now known as the “[x] era” clans like [DTK], .|(divinity), RoD, -=DoF=-, and the clan that almost made them lose the title cN| with players like Komar, Nino, Nico, Padre who lost only by three kills from an outburst from Kyo.</p>

<p>Lumbar fusion surgery is <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spinal_fusion.html" title="Spinal fusion">spinal fusion</a> for the lumbar portion of the spine. Lumbar fusion is often performed for lower back pain. Other indications include instability, tumors, or infections. Surgery often involves bone grafting as well as fixation with pedicle screw instrumentation. Interbody fusion is often used. Interbody fusion includes removal of the disk between vertabrae and placement of a spacer.</p>

<p><b>Bold text</b> Leonard Pearl (born February 23, 1968) is an award-winning filmmaker, director and producer.</p>
<p>He was born in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p>Leonard obtained his Bachelor of Laws from Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto Canada and practiced entertainment and corporate law at a mid-size downtown Toronto firm. He left the practice of law and returned to school, where he studied film at Ryerson Polytechnic University. Leonard was also an adjunct professor of law for two semesters at the University of New Brunswick law school. Leonard's first produced and directed documentary, birthright israel, was broadcast on Canadian television and has been screened worldwide and at international film festivals. Some of his recent credits include Dawgs Playing Poker (producer), Garbage Man (producer), Choose Your Voice: Antisemitism in Canada (Executive Producer, Director). Choose your voice is an award winning educational documentary produced on behalf of the FAST organization, and has been distributed to over 300,000 school children worldwide. He has also produced and directed various award winning fundraising videos for various Jewish organizations. Leonard is currently producing and directing various films, documentaries and MOWs.</p>
<p>Leonard is the son of Marvin &amp; Mary Pearl. Leonard's father, Marvin, is a Toronto basketball icon, whom has been inducted into the Ontario basketball hall of fame. Leonard is a child of a Holocaust survivor - his mother, Mary, lost most if not all of her family during the war. He is married to Rachel Alexander, a well-respected pediatric nephrologist, and they have two children. He is also a board member of Yad Vashem Canada. Leonard and Rachel have established the Leonard &amp; Rachel Pearl Family Fund with a Toronto non-profit organization. The fund will be used to help send young adults on the Birthright israel program and help provide food for Holocaust survivors living in Toronto. Both Leonard and Rachel feel very strongly about these two causes, connecting young adults to their Jewish roots and helping Holocaust survivors.</p>

<p>In March 1995 the US-South Africa Binational Commission (BNC) was launched. This BNC developed out of the US-South Africa Business Development Committee, established in 1994. The BNC was a result of meetings held between #REDIRECT <a href="../../../n/e/l/Nelson_Mandela_1695.html" title="Nelson Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> and #REDIRECT <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Clinton_75aa.html" title="Bill Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> during Mandela's first visit to the #REDIRECT <a href="../../../u/s/_/US_7516.html" title="US">US</a>. Here they discussed the possibility of a high-level #REDIRECT <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bilateral.html" title="Bilateral">bilateral</a> forum through which the US and #REDIRECT <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> might normalise relations and expand areas of cooperation in the post-#REDIRECT <a href="../../../a/p/a/Apartheid.html" title="Apartheid">apartheid</a> period. The Commission meets twice a year at alternating venues in either the US or South Africa and is co-chaired at the vice and deputy president level. It consists of various working committees that carry out projects, which are approved at the executive level.</p>

<p>The Wayne State University Press, also known as WSU Press, is the largest publisher in the city of Detroit. It is the publishing arm of Wayne State University and publishes a wide variety of academic titles in several different subject areas, including Great Lakes and Michigan, Africana studies, Children’s studies, Fairy Tales and Folklore studies, Film and Television studies, Jewish Studies, and Speech and Language Pathology. Wayne State University Press also publishes six academic journals, including Marvels and Tales, and a several trade publications, including American City: Detroit Architecture, 1845-2005.</p>
<p>The Press building, designed by famed architect Albert Kahn, is located on the Wayne State University’s main campus in the heart of Midtown Detroit, one block south of Warren Ave. and two blocks south of the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Detroit Public Library.</p>
<p>The Wayne State University Press was founded in 1941 when faculty members of then Wayne University volunteered to establish a publishing entity to “assist the University in the encouragement and dissemination of scholarly learning.” Officially called Wayne University Press, the initial effort was for years only a sporadic activity run by an English professor. It was not until 1954 that the Press developed into a full-fledged publisher destined to have a national and international role in the creation of scholarly books and journals.</p>
<p>Today Wayne State University Press is an established mid-sized press that publishes approximately forty new books and six academic journals each year. Since 1955 it has been a member of the American Association of University Presses, and is now a prominent publisher in several subject areas and a dominant one in others, notably Judaica and books about the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>Officially, the Press is an auxiliary unit of the university, and receives an annual subvention that partially covers the cost of its operation. For the most part, the Press relies on revenue generated through the sale of its publications to meet its operating expenses.</p>
<p>The imprint of the Wayne State University Press is controlled by the University Press Editorial Board, a group of scholars nominated from throughout the university and appointed by the president to serve three-year terms. The board meets regularly throughout the academic year to consider proposals and manuscripts presented to it by the Press’s acquisitions department. The Press also has a fundraising group, the Board of Visitors, dedicated to raising funds for the Press to support the publication of specific titles.</p>
<p>The Press staff of just under twenty copyedits, designs, typesets, markets, and fulfills orders. Composition, printing, and book manufacturing are done under contract with vendors outside the university.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-13_f93e.html" title="Edit section: TIPSA- Teenagers Involved in Protecting Selves around Alcohol">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">TIPSA- Teenagers Involved in Protecting Selves around Alcohol</span></h2>
<p><b>TIPSA (Teenagers Involved in Protecting Selves around Alcohol)</b> is an <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol.html" title="Alcohol">alcohol</a> and other drugs education project based in Northern Ireland. It operates in the <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookstown.html" title="Cookstown">Cookstown</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magherafelt.html" title="Magherafelt">Magherafelt</a> District Council areas and works primarily with teenagers, parents, teachers, community and youth workers and other individuals and professionals who engage with young people on health issues. TIPSA was established in 2003 following a public consultation on underage drinking. From its' creation until May 2005 the main focus off the project's work was with teenagers and alcohol. It then merged with the Cookstown District Drugs and Alcohol Forum and this resulted in an enlargement of the original remit. The project uses a wide range of methodologies to provide alcohol and other drug education. This includes Personal Development,Peer Education, Drama, Art, Groupwork and One to One Work. TIPSA uses these approaches to design and deliver teenagers awareness programmes, parents programmes ("Talk to Them"), schools programmes, one off information events and training for teachers, youth workers and other professionals. TIPSA is funded by the Northern Health and Social Services Board through the Northern Drugs and Alcohol Coordination Team, under the New Strategic Direction (NSD) for Drugs and Alcohol (2006-2011) drawn up by the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Ireland_a52b.html" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> <a href="../../../d/e/p/Department_of_Health%2C_Social_Services_and_Public_Safety_0bad.html" title="Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety">Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety</a> in <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormont.html" title="Stormont">Stormont</a>, lead at that time by Shaun Woodward MP and now currently overseen by Paul Goggins MP. This strategy is based on a Four Tier model based on the Five Pillars - prevention and early intervention; treatment and support; law and criminal justice; harm reduction and monitoring; evaluation and research. Since TIPSA is a funded project it does not charge for it's services. The TIPSA office is currently located in Gortalowry House, a community owned and funded building in <a href="../../../c/o/o/Cookstown.html" title="Cookstown">Cookstown</a>. At present the project is run on a day to day basis by two project co-ordinators and an administrative assistant. As well as delivering drugs education, the project staff maintain a website which is used as a sign posting service to other helping agencies. This is in keeping with important aspects of the NSD which calls for more multi-agency, multi-component forms of intervention to deal with alcohol and drugs issues at a community level.</p>

<p>We all know the girls that I am talking about They are time bombs and they are ticking And the only question’s when they’ll blow up And they’ll blow up we know that without a doubt Cuz they’re those girls, yah, you know those girls That let their emotions get the best of them, GO!</p>
<p>And I’ve contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man: Let’s get emotion girls to all wear mood rings So we’ll be tipped off to when they’re ticked off Cuz we’ll know just what they’re thinkin’, what they’re thinkin’</p>
<p>She’s so pretty but she doesn’t always act that way Her moods are swinging on the swing set almost everyday She said to me that she’s so happy it’s depressing And all I said was “someone get that girl a mood ring”</p>
<p>If it’s drama you want then look no further They’re like the Real World meets Boy Meets World, meets Day of our Lives And it just kills me how they get away with murder They’ll anger you then bat their eyes Those pretty eyes that watch you sympathize, GO!</p>
<p>And I’ve contrived some sort of a plan To help my fellow man: Let’s get emotion girls to all wear mood rings So we’ll be tipped off to when they’re ticked off Cuz we’ll know just what they’re thinkin’, what they’re thinkin’</p>
<p>She’s so pretty but she doesn’t always act that way Her moods are swinging on the swing set almost everyday She said to me that she’s so stressed out that it’s soothing And all I said was someone get that girl a mood ring</p>
<p>Cuz when it’s black means watch your back because you’re probably The last person in the world right now she wants to see And when it’s blue it means that you should call her up and meet with Lee And ask her out because she’ll most likely agree And when it’s green it simply means that she is really stressed And when its clear it means she’s completely emotionless And that’s alright I must confess</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
We all know the girls that I am talking about She likes you Wednesday but now it’s Friday And she has to wash her hair And it just figures that we’ll never figure them out First she’s Jekyll and then she’s Hyde At least she makes a lovely pair</p>
<p>Mood ring, oh mood ring Oh tell me will you bring the key to unlock this mystery Of girls and their emotions play it back in slow motion So I may understand the complex infrastructure known as the female mind azlyrics.com</p>

<p>Shirley Novak is wild about poppies. She loves to paint them, to grow them and to share them with her fellow gardeners. Poppies and the other beautiful flowers she grows in her extensive gardens provide both inspiration and pleasure. An avid gardener since childhood, she says, "My love of flowers and color are the passions that drove me to become a painter." Born and raised in California, Shirley feels her inner voice has called to her to paint for as long as she can remember. Her childhood passions were growing, drawing and painting flowers. She majored in art and took many workshops and classes over the years, eventually turning her attention to painting full-time under the tutelage of her mentor, Len Chmiel. Shirley paints in oils using a wet-on-wet technique. She paints "en plein air" whenever possible either in her garden or on location when she travels. "What I try to do with paint is recreate the joy I experience in my subjects - the flowers I grow and the wildflowers in the mountain meadows", says Shirley. When not out of doors, she paints in her Colorado studio overlooking the San Juan Mountains or in her summer studio, aptly named "Poppy Cottage." Shirley shares a passion for painting with her husband, landscape and wildlife artist Ralph Oberg. Her works are exhibited at many fine galleries.</p>

<p>Radio Roo was a childrens comedy series which originally aired on CBBC on BBC1 for 3 series and 31 episodes between 25th February 1991 and 29 March 1993.</p>
<p>The Show revolved around a radio station Radio Roo which was run by Dennis and his Kangaroo sidekick Clive. Each episode would feature the two characters getting into various situations(one of the more memorable being an unexploded bomb) and generally causing mayhem. Also featured was their friend Margaret who was the person who would normally help them out of their sticky situations.</p>
<p>The show was very popular although it is often overlooked when compared to similar shows such as Bodger and Badger --&gt;</p>

<p>Denis Jones signed to the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_record_label.html" title="Independent record label">independent record label</a> <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humble_Soul_eb78.html" title="Humble Soul">Humble Soul</a> in 2006.</p>
<p>'humdrum virtue' is Denis Jones's debut <a href="../../../a/l/b/Album.html" title="Album">album</a>, due for release in April 2007. It is the culmination of a journey that has taken Denis from his North West roots to London, Sweden, Berlin and back to <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester.html" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>, playing alongside such diverse acts as Coco Rosie, Ella Guru, Steve Tilston, Bent, Bone Box, Okkervil River, The Boats, Merz, Jack Rose and Chris Corsano. During this time he has forged a truly unique style, informed by an eclectic breadth of artists ranging from traditional songwriters like Nick Drake and Tim Buckley, via Bjork and Radiohead to experimental luminaries Herbert and Four Tet, a style that has been described as "One World era John Martyn mixed with Tunng and re-assembled through a basic channel filter".</p>
<p>'humdrum virtue' covers the range of Denis's output from the intimate acoustic beauty of "Four Water" to the multi-layered loops of "One Loop" and "Beginning", via the Waits-like blues monster track "£10 of Electricity", which features the powerhouse rhythm section of Jon Thorne, Luke Flowers and Paddy Steer. The album perfectly captures precious snapshots from an artist who has already proved his credentials as a live performer, with looped acoustic complexity straying from the chaotic to the sublime, always hypnotic and completely engaging. At a time when the loop pedal has become almost ubiquitous, Denis Jones effortlessly rewrites the rules and then breaks them again, bemusing and beguiling the audience, weaving a complex spell of beatboxed rhythms, samples and staccato guitars, over which his plaintive vocal glides with complex and heartfelt emotion. And what might be missed in the heat of one of these utterly compelling live performances becomes unavoidably evident on the album: a lyrical depth that is the equal of the instrumental wizardry, delivering storytelling in the grand folk tradition with a twist of Northern irony.</p>
<p>Teaming up with <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humble_Soul_eb78.html" title="Humble Soul">Humble Soul</a> was the final piece in the jigsaw for Denis: at last he had found a label that shared his vision of pushing the boundaries, both with the music itself and with the packaging. Denis's self-designed and assembled industrial CD case uses carefully selected materials and processes which perfectly and intriguingly mirror the arrangements of the eight tracks on the CD; when you've finally recovered from falling in love with the packaging, put on the CD and prepare to be seduced all over again...</p>
<p>Track listing: 1. one loop 2. two slumber 3. third song 4. four water 5. five papers 6. £10 of electricity 7. 17 8. beginning.</p>

<p><b>Stack an Arachnid.</b> The new craze thats sweeping the nation. Most people don't know about this underground sport, or what its all about. This game is very complex, and was originated from 2002-2003. It consists of these main ideas, <i>Build an arachnid, battle an arachnid, and stack an arachnid.</i> The catch phrase for this, for example when a battle starts, you say, "Build an arachnid, battle an arachnid, stack an arachnid!" Then the battle begins.</p>
<p>There are 4 main age types for the arachnids you build. Baby, Teenage, Adult, and Elderly Arachnid. They all can go into battle against each other, but all have their weaknesses.</p>
<p>When the arachnid battle starts, things can tend to go a little out of hand. Some of the arachnids are very blood thirsty and can hurt another arachnid badly. They can also use weapons, like morachas, if they have hands (which you will have built).</p>
<p>When battling arachnids, there must be paramedic supervision and there must be the utmost care and attention to what is going on in the arachnid battle arena. The loosing arachnids will be stacked ontop of each other, and the winner will prevail and will be able to keep the other defeated stacked arachnids.</p>
<p>Here is an example of some arachnids:</p>

<p>The history of Egalitarianism in New Zealand was brought about by the Great Britain class system of the 1800's. Many people migrated from Britain to New Zealand because they saw it as a way to escape from the British class system. Poor people didn't have to be long to the lower class, there would be no more middle class; everyone would be equal.</p>

<p>Maria Patiño (María José Martínez Patiño) is a Spanish athlete and notable hurdler. Her notoriety came about when she failed a sex test in 1985 which showed her genetic sex was in actual fact male. While Spansih athletics officials told Maria to fake injury, she refused and European press soon got hold of the story. Within months, she was stripped of her past titles and barred from further competition. Her boyfriend deserted her, she was evicted from the national athletic residence, her scholarship was revoked and struggled to make living.</p>
<p>The result of Patiño's test was unexpected by everyone including herself and Patiño spent thousands of dollars consulting doctors. It was later revealed that she indeed had a pair of testes concealed within her labia, and lacked a uterus and ovaries. She was diagnosed with androgen insensitivity. While she was genetically male,the testosterone produced in her testes were never detected by her body and at puberty, and when her testes started producing estrogen, she began to develop characteristics female traits.</p>
<p>The case of Patiño challenged many of the boundaries of men and women athletes. Patiño was eventually reinstated by the International Amateur Athletic Foundation (IAAF) and by 1993, she had rejoined the Spanish Athletics team. However, the extrodinary facts of her case raise many questions and debates about the polar nature of male and female gender.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-03-13_f93e.html" title="Edit section: History">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">History</span></h3>
<p>In 1878, a merger of two companies namely the Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Company formed Eastern Extension. The company eventually formed part of Imperial and International Communications, Ltd. which became Cable &amp; Wireless of England.</p>
<p>In 1880, Eastern Extension laid down the Philippines' very first link to the rest of the world: a 535-nautical mile submarine cable connecting Bolinao, Pangasinan and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In 1897, Eastern Extension linked Manila to Visayas, thereby providing the country's first inter-island communications through a submarine cable system.</p>
<p>In March 1925, a mining company under the name "Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc." was incorporated.</p>
<p>In 1969, Eastern Extension maneuvered another technology coup when the Philippines-Taiwan tropospheric scatter link was inaugurated.</p>
<p>In 1974, Eastern Extension became Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (ETPI), a private company owned 60% by Filipinos and 40% by Cable &amp; Wireless.</p>
<p>In 1977, ETPI established the Okinawa-Luzon-Hong Kong (OLUHO) submarine cable system. The Curimao Cable Landing station was also built in the northern province of Ilocos Norte.</p>
<p>During meetings held on June 22 and July 25, 2001, the Board of Directors and stockholders of Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc. approved a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between Itogon-Suyoc Mines and PhilWeb Corporation (PhilWeb). Under the terms of the MOA, PhilWeb shall manage the transformation of Itogon-Suyoc Mines from a mining company to a company engaged in information technology, multimedia, telecommunications, and other similar industries, including the identification and negotiation with potential investors who will infuse the necessary capital or assets for projects in such industries. Any project identified by PhilWeb shall be subject to the approval of the Board of Directors and stockholders of Itogon-Suyoc Mines.</p>
<p>Also in 2001, Connectivity Unlimited Resources Enterprise (CURE), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, was granted a franchise to construct, install, establish, operate, and maintain telecommunications systems throughout the Philippines. CURE is reportedly owned by the owners of PhilWeb and consequently, Itogon-Suyoc Mines.</p>
<p>On June 7, 2002, the SEC approved the change in corporate name from "Itogon-Suyoc Mines, Inc." to "ISM Communications Corporation" (ISMCC); and the change in the primary purpose from a company engaged in the business of mining to a company engaged in the business of telecommunications, multimedia and information technology. Since then, ISMCC was able to acquire 57.7% of the shares of ETPI.</p>
<p>In 2005, CURE submitted an application to the National Telecommunications Commission for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to install, operate, and maintain a nationwide third generation (3G) telecommunications network in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In 2006, the National Telecommunications Commission granted CURE a provisional authority to do so, along with 10MHz of paired spectrum (1955-1965MHz/2145-2155MHz).</p>
<p>CURE went ‘on the air’ in December 2006, ahead of the National Telecommunications Commission license requirements to begin installation and construction of network facilities by January 2007 and to start commercial operation by June 2008. CURE’s 3G coverage and rollout plans also far exceed the minimum requirements of the National Telecommunications Commission with regard to both extent of coverage and rollout rate.</p>
<p>The CURE mobile network is now currently on a testing phase with ETPI and CURE employees (and employee referrals) as its initial set of subscribers.</p>
