<p>This seems non-encyclopaedic. An unsuccessful election candidate who is not even currently a PPC. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 22:07, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Spare</b> as the article states, he might become a candidate again soon enough. I bet that the timing of Matthew Platts to suggest the deletion of this article is politically motivated. It has been here months, and the General Election were in May. Why does he react now? Coincidence?--213.243.155.245 22:25, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Note vote above cast by non-logged in user.</b></li>
<li>The English Wikipedia alone has <a href="../../../s/t/a/Special%7EStatistics_969e.html" title="Special:Statistics">673,035 pages at the last count</a>. A lot of VFD pages survive for months on end before people notice them and bring them to attention here. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 22:30, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Um. I think you'll find that I've nominated several non-notable Conservatives (eg. Greg Smith (politician), Annesley Abercorn for VfD too. I am a supporter of liberalism generally. But I am a passionate believer in keeping wikipedia from being a political amen corner. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 22:42, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And why is it that you woke up NOW to delete this particular article? There are tens orperhaps even hundreds of articles about unsuccessful election candidate, but you woke up to suggest the deletion of this particular one just NOW, when the seat where he stood and might stood again was vacated. I know that can't be a coinsidence. You know, that if he will be selected as a candidate, this article could be justifiably recreated even in the case it would now be deleted, thus your motives to suggest that it should be deleted NOW look rather suspicious.
<ul>
<li>If it means that much to you, if he's selected I will personally go out and leaflet for him. But honestly - nobody is going to vote for him because they've seen him on wikipedia. It is of no significance anywhere outside wikipedia. I'm not framing him for murder, I'm nominating him for VfD. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 22:53, 7 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You would? A promise? The poimt isn't whether somebody will vote for him or not becaus he is in Wikipedia, but there is no rational reason to spare this article till now, and delete it NOW when it is topical again. Well, how about these two articles, maybe you aren't willing to delete them because these people don't have the chance to become candidates soon enough; Jody Dunn, Peter Hirst.

Firstly that there is nothing <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cabal" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cabal" rel="nofollow">peculiar, subversive, or conspiratorial</a> going on here. Secondly that you are not going to gain anything by trying to call my bluff, as I don't <i>have</i> one. Oh, and do you not think it may be civil to sign your posts? Anonymity isn't prohibited but it doesn't add to your credibility. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatthew_Platts_cbce.html" title="User:Matthew Platts">Matthew Platts</a> 17:09, 8 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have my reasons to remain anomymous, and I'm not going to tell you, what they are. And you didn't illustrate anything. These are all Liberal Democrat PPCs, maybe it isn't a problem to you to VfD any of the Lib Dem articles. Maybe it would be different, if it was a Labour or a Conservative PPC.
<ul>
<li>If you don't sign in then how can we know all edits are coming from the same person? And care to cite a series of non-notable Conservative or Labour PPCs and there will be a race by everyone on this page to nominate them for VFD. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 18:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Why should you know all edits are coming from the same person? I don't want to register. Only which I could find for now was Maggie Jones.

<li>You must be <i>notable</i> to get listed? I thought that ifan article could interest or benefit people, like in this case voters in Livinston who are searching information about the potential candidates, that would be a reason good enough.
<ul>
<li>Please read our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. People who are searching for knowledge about this person (note that an encyclopaedia contains knowledge, not information) will not find it. The article contains nothing apart from election result statistics and unsourced speculation that for all we know was simply made up by the anonymous editor writing the article. All bar one of the external links are autobiographies (in fact the <i>same</i> autobiography), and therefore are as suspect as all autobiographies are. And the one that isn't an autobiography, but is a biography given by a third-party source, is empty. There is nothing for an encyclopaedia article about this person to contain. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:02:58, 2005-08-17 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> non-notable non candidate. <b>If</b> he does run in the by-election then he should probably be mentioned in an article on that, as it is bound to attract significant media attention. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_wub_6388.html" title="User:The wub">the wub</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_wub_1807.html" title="User talk:The wub"><font color="green">"?/!"</font></a> 10:27, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, they are not. The size of the party is irrelevant.

Politicians who have never won elections have to satisfy those criteria on the grounds of being widely infamous (such as being widely infamous for losing repeatedly and with flair, for example).

A politician has to either be elected or be significantly newsworthy in xyr field. This person is neither. Also note that there are no sources of information about this person other than his own autobiography, which is as suspect as all autobiographies are. The third-party biography, listed last in the external links section, is <i>empty</i>. A Google Search turns up more repetitions of the same autobiography and other people named <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Dundas_0abd.html" title="Charles Dundas">Charles Dundas</a>.
