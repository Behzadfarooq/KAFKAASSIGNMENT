<dd>It is not connections with other WP articles that is primarily needed, though that is desirable. What is primarily needed is references from <i>third-party independent published sources</i> discussing the work of the organization. For articles like this, relevant professional magazines, online or print , do nicely, as do statements in official university or government sources--but not from the U. of the Aegean, and not blogs. Your fourth external link is a good one, from <a href="http://www.chiosnews.com" class="external free" title="http://www.chiosnews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiosnews.com</a>, a local news source. (and since it is in Greek, it will help readers evaluate it if you translate a key phrase or two.)<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:57, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>OK, thanx a lot for your details, I think I am getting somehow on the idea... I will try to translate some references on the above article... And I will try to put some more info... Well most of our references are from local media, usually newspapers, but since it was not in English, I thought it wouldn't be good to mention it. Is is good to submit references on specific efforts and/or events that we have done and they have been published as a reference on several news papers? As an example, we have taken some interviews from several people, that we have also sent on local media to re-publish as well, or use it as they want. On the other hand, there are some newspapers that have no web presence, or send their issues by mail in PDF format. Can I upload a specific page, of reference, or screenshots of them? Thank you again and I'm looking forward for a responce! Yannisap 03:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hello again friends. With all my due respect too, I must notice that is not an "intranet" article. I don't know how to express it as the culture here in Greece may somehow differ; our effort/initiative, has been a scheme that refers to the University, but its open way on contributing (anyone has the ability to register on it as a member) has given the opportunity on hight school students to learn more about student life on the Uni, to find some info about the classes, as well as we have started to develop ways on inter-action between other student communities around Greece, to achieve a huger network of people, that would be able to inform about the live and activities on Greek academic life... There are people from all around Greece (and alumni students from Aegean Uni, from around the world) that visit and participate. This idea hasn't been achieved in Greece in any other form, and the "connection" idea is even unique, not for University of the Aegean only but in general here. I don't know if I have helped in some way to express the feeling of this effort. People here are not very used to (student) communities and with our effort we try also to do our best, specially by motivating people that are less interested or less experienced in web and computer stuff! (unfortunately, there are many that are not interested or they're even against computers, as they can't find their way or understand the opportunities...)

<li>Dear friend RGTraynor, I am sorry for being such a "pain in the ass", but I assume that you haven't got the base idea for this effort. I understand why you say this is an intranet system, but I believe if you could read Greek and surf on it for a while, you could immediately understand that myAegean is <b>not only</b> this. It's <b>not even</b> this, as there are bulleting boards on the departments, based on Email posts mainingly, and the central one on: <a href="http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.aegean.gr/aegean/greek/events/default.htm</a>. Almost every uni has one of these information systems, but, in fact, in Greece, this is <b>not</b> a default service/condition. So "my" is not a part of all these. And in addition, in myAegean, we are focusing on a community that drives a form of evolution, and tries, using the IT to develop actions, to inform, to bring ways and ideas into action and, in fact, bring a new situation here, as some things are not so known or "by default". Especially on Greek countryside... Sorry again for my flooding... Yours faithfully. 195.251.152.18 21:05, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, we will try to do our best even the article stays in Wikipedia or not. I promise you dear friend Pavel Vozenilek, with all my respect, that what I say is not "big words" or "generic phrases". Even if the article goes for deletion, we will not stop our efforts, because we have a vision and some principles that we are to defend. Maybe it's not the time so good now, because we are still on the beginning. If it wasn't a true effort, we wouldn't mind to be in Wikipedia. But we feel that we have a place here. I can't persuade you and I know it, because the matter is typical. We need references, but references that are somehow difficult to achieve, because it needs some hard work and time, specially time. I hope some day we will return here and have them all. Because our effort is not "big words", but big actions. I know this because we have worked hard without any great help from others. And we all feel an enthusiasm for all this. Thank you all in advance, I will not write again so much. I will stop here and just leave it to the evolution. I am just sad. Thank you all, all you that gave some of your precious time to take notice on this. Greetings from Greece! You are all welcome here any time! (and maybe we can show you more on what we do)</li>

<ul>
<li>OK, so the text needs more development.. I understood that there is 1 major thing we need: references from outside the Uni, and references that shows sth worthy to mention. In addition, if there would be a part of a paper/essay, that refers to myAegean, this would also be good. Am I right on this? I am looking forward to get some more info and to submit it here too. There are also people that work on their diplomas on "Social Networks", that refer to "myAegean", I think. Well, thank you again and if there is sth that I didn't understand well, please let me know! Yours faithfully and hope to go on! 62.1.144.83 19:35, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
