<p>As a native speaker of <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a>, I feel this is not notable enough to warrant a separate article. In the local culture, use of expletives in formal documents or before elders is considered indecent, though most people use it during their teens and a few years after that and also occasionally later when they are in a verbal fight. Also, the <a href="../../../e/n/g/English_language.html" title="English language">English</a> <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transliteration.html" title="Transliteration">transliteration</a> seems to be incorrect.</p>
<p>If Wikipedians feel it should be present, I would suggest the following version:</p>
<p><b>Othaa</b> is a <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tamil_language.html" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expletive.html" title="Expletive">expletive</a>. In the local culture, use of expletives in formal documents or before elders is considered indecent, though used by younger people in casual conversations and by some of the older people when they are quareling or fighting.</p>
<p>The word corresponds roughly to <i>fucker</i>. The root of the word is believed to be <i>Ol</i>, which means to "fuck".</p>

<p>Ok, I hope I'm doing this right&#160;:)</p>
<p>The current page for 'Darwinia' is a disambiguation page. However, the first set of links points to <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinia_%28plant%29.html" title="Darwinia (plant)">Darwinia (plant)</a> and scent myrtle, of which neither page exsists in Wikipedia. Therefore, I say the current Darwinia page be deleted, and the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwinia_%28computer_game%29.html" title="Darwinia (computer game)">Darwinia (computer game)</a> page be moved to the Darwinia page. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 00:29, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Erm...</b>- Darwinia (Game) should become Darwinia. Darwinia (Plant) should stay as Darwinia (Plant). Not sure who agrees though...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Disagree strongly. The plant is far more important; it has been named for well over 100 years, and will still be around for hundreds of years after the game is forgotten. I'd be surprised if the game is still around in 5 years. <a href="../../../m/p/f/User%7EMPF_e17a.html" title="User:MPF">MPF</a> 18:36, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>The Darwinia Plant link was added on the 16th November 2004. For two months the page has not been added. What hope does that bring for the page to be added in the future?</i> <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 00:56, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Added. It should probably also be noted that the game hasn't actually been released. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetaholmes_6f6f.html" title="User:Petaholmes">nixie</a> 01:10, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While the game is not released to the public, its in its RC stage of Beta testing. Possibly a compromise, such as the linking to <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>'s disambiguation page would be better? As an example of the populartiy of Darwinia as a computer game, a google search shows it at #1, so why shouldn't it be the first page to be indicated by the wikipeida article? <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoThermic_6d72.html" title="User:NeoThermic">NeoThermic</a> 02:08, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hmmm. I don't think these three articles should be lumped together like this...ErrorWear and SysWear, while pretty well known in geek circles (umm...not that I would know anything about that&#160;:P), may be too small in the grand scheme of things, but Thinkgeek is definitely notable enough to warrant its own article -- <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFerkelparade_2c87.html" title="User talk:Ferkelparade">Ï</a> 13:02, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hm I may have worded badly. The articles are too advertish, but ThinkGeek should definitely have its own article. I know of its notability. Agree with that sentiment. <a href="../../../i/n/t/User%7EInter_454c.html" title="User:Inter">Inter</a> 13:41, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>ThinkGeek is a keep. I haven't heard of the other two, so I'm not aware of any notability and wouldn't notice their deletion (so <b>delete</b> unless someone makes a good neutral article on them by the end of the VfD period), but ThinkGeek is well-known enough that it's possible to write a non-advertising neutral article about it. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:26, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Listings of multiples likethis generally result in a confusing mish-mash of comments for the person who closes the discussion and makes the final decisions to sort through, so out of respect to the task that they do I suggest listing separately in future. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 15:16, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFerkelparade_da80.html" title="User:Ferkelparade">Ferkelparade</a>; lumping these together into a single VfD was sub-optimal. ThinkGeek is definitely a <b>keep</b>er for the reasons stated by others. I'm inclined to think the others should be a <b>week delete</b>, because I've never heard of them, but that's probably a pretty poor criteria for what makes something notable. We don't (IMHO) need an article on every on-line retailer that caters to geeks, but Think Geek is well known enough that I think they stand out as notable. I would say that the others deserve a mention on the Think Geek article. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 16:04, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I'm not sure about that. Sometimes it makes sense, like the case of that huge group of buildings all from the same university that someone listed last week.

<li>Tjalang would also be the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indonesian_language.html" title="Indonesian language">Indonesian language</a> spelling used before the early-1970s spelling reform, and is possibly still used locally; lots of old spellings for place names are still used, especially informally.

<li>Comment: I'm not opposed to this action, it seems commonsense to me, but a little curious... is there any policy supporting it? If not, do we need one perhaps? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 17:13, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: I don't know whether its policy or not, now you mention it. If it isn't then I would certainly vote for one. I should probably have added that if the above VfD results in a keep vote, then this article should be (imho) left as a redirect to it. I don't see the point in a separate VfD for a duplicate artcile.

<li>I don't really think we need a policy. Anyone can make a redirect, and this certainly is a case where a redirect is needed. If the target page gets deleted, it only makes sense that redirects to that page are deleted. -<a href="../../../r/h/o/User%7ERholton_b2db.html" title="User:Rholton">Rholton</a> 17:34, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Comment: No. It may seem obvious but it's not that simple at all. The complication is that redirects often have significant history. In this case it doesn't, but it's not safe to assume that just because an article is deleted, all redirects to it will or should be deleted as well. See <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">redirects for deletion</a>, there's quite a lot there and there are sound reasons for not bypassing this procedure. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewa_c818.html" title="User:Andrewa">Andrewa</a> 19:01, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thanks, Andrewa. You are exactly correct, and I over-stated in my comment.

The result of the debate was ambiguous. Votes to delete and to keep (in various forms) were about even. The decision defaults to keep.</p>
<p>Reviewing the votes and the current content, I concluded that the solution recommended late in the discussion (merge into <a href="../../../f/u/t/Futurology.html" title="Futurology">Futurology</a>) made the most sense for now.
