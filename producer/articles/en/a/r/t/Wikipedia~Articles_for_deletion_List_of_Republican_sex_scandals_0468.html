<dd>The simple answer to that is yes. But I don't think that its that simple. What distrubs me about the article is that its a copy/paste from another wiki, which as a political bias and agenda.

<dd>I linked the article up, its parent is a list article itself, and has the correct context for this article to follow from it. The fact that this focuses on one party does not automatically violate NPOV. NPOV would be violated if the scandals were not portrayed from a neutral point of view. There is nothing stopping someone creating a similar article for democratic party scandals, it would have its own place on wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 23:27, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Schizombie. Yeah, I know <i>he</i> voted keep. I'm going to be a bit nuanced, so it's kind of hard to put something in bold up front, but I will explain this discrepancy. As it stands, this article is an egregious example of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and I suspect it was put here in the interests of making a couple of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINTs</a> in the light of the debate on the <i>other</i> article. Also, I'm pretty sure that the people calling this list encyclopedic didn't read very far down. This article is a mismash of fact, allegation, innuendo, and just plain insanity. Some of the entries are bona-fide sex scandals, but the rest is simply junk: several of the entries are just assertions that some person got divorced, or has had out-of-wedlock children. One more notable example is Rush Limbaugh; this article simply asserts he has been divorced three times. All well and good, but how on earth is this a <i>sex scandal</i>? One also notes with some amusement that this article insinuates that George W. Bush raped a woman and later had her killed. Somehow, I didn't hear about that on the news...&#160;:-) Seriously, guys, this is a perfect article for dKosopedia. And, hey, look <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Republican_Sex_Scandals" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Republican_Sex_Scandals" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Moral_Values" class="external text" title="http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Moral_Values" rel="nofollow">here</a>! What a coincidence. Tying this all together, I would say that what needs to happen to this article is that about 85% of the stuff in here needs to go (as we come up with an objective standard of what "sex scandal" is in the first place), it needs to be renamed to a NPOV name, and then all of the analogous Democratic and other non-right-wing stuff needs to be added here as well. In short, I am advocating exactly what&#160;??????? said. But the cleanest way to do that, I think, is to just destroy this article and start over. One notes that since a copy of all of this information exists at dKosipedia, then any of these entries can be copied from over there. One also notes that exactly zero people did zero work on this article, as it is a straight cut-and-paste from another site, so we're losing no labor by deleting it. --<a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 20:07, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I have done work on the article to remove entries that I could not personally substantiate, and to remove POV. The article right now is not anymore a direct copy, so deleting would lose the work done so far to wikify it and remove unsubstantiated claims.

<dd>Deleting the article would destroy what information is around now. Is the information that flooded with unrecoverable bias that it doesn't deserve to be transformed? I wouldn't mind a result which moved the article to a title as you say. Wikipedia may be able to justify having articles on the people listed here just because of this page. It is self-defeating to say that because if the persons article was created after this lists deletion then it could be removed as it wasn't able to be linked into wikipedia due to the lack of this list, and lack of recreatability of the list due to the deletion review process. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_ca11.html" title="User:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#009000;">e</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/s/User_talk%7EAnsell_90fe.html" title="User talk:Ansell"><span style="color:#0000FF;">ll</span></a> 23:32, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> - a sewer of unverified charges, conspiracy-mongering, and POV-pushing weighted down with a huge number of non-notable sheriff's deputies and preachers.
