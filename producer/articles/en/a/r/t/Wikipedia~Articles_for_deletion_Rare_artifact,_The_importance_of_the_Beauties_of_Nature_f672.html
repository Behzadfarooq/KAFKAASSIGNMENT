<p>The result was <b>no consensus</b> - there is no such thing as precedent on Wikipedia, but nonetheless, the issue of whether to have an article on every episode of a TV series is mainly a question of whether it falls under '<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate information</a>'.

<dd>You don't need secondary sources to say that, for example, Naruto's head disappears at time index 17:51. The primary source should be more than sufficient. The same goes for referencing the plot.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The original research is a new synthesis - the article is picking out of the episode what is important and what isn't. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhirazo_76a5.html" title="User:Phirazo">Phirazo</a> 04:40, 16 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Deciding what warrants mention is a critical part of the editing process. You, yourself, are making a call about what warrants mention on Wikipedia by raising this AfD. This is by no means "original research". The alternative, in this case, would be to copy someone else's summary, which I'm sure violates a copyright law or two. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 05:01, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
<dd>Hmm... Upon some research, I believe I see what you're getting at. After reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>, specifically this section,

<dd>You seem to have went off on a bit of a tangent. Pay close attention to the final sentence. The set of Naruto episodes are supplementary to the core topic of <a href="../../../n/a/r/Naruto.html" title="Naruto">Naruto</a> and cannot stand by themselves.

The fact that they could not easily be merged into larger articles is irrelevant: Wikipedia is <b>not a repository of plot summaries</b>, and we do <b>not</b> need to describe the plot of such a long work with this level of detail. The fact that these synopses are too long to merge into single articles is not a sign that they need to be placed in individual articles: it is a sign that they should be made shorter.

<dd>Actually, if you look at the Television Episode guidelines, the list of works following these guidelines shows that this format and level of detail is perfectly common.

<dd>Where the WP:NOT policy says <i>"Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain [...] not solely a summary of that work's plot"</i>, the work of fiction in question here is actually the whole of Naruto, not this single episode. The episode summaries are merely a small part of the 'article set' of this work of fiction (i.e. this work's article set is not solely plot summaries). So as required, they are an aspect of that larger topic. It's not unreasonable to split these into individual articles as per the <a href="../../../t/v/e/WP%7ETVE_878f.html" title="WP:TVE">WP:TVE</a> guidelines.<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashwinder_0bc6.html" title="User:Crashwinder">Crashwinder</a> 12:59, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry about using the term 'guideline', it's just that I assumed that was the right term from the list at <a href="../../../t/v/e/WP%7ETVE_878f.html" title="WP:TVE">WP:TVE</a> titled <i>"TV shows currently using these guidelines"</i>. Obviously to describe each scene in detail is pointless, but if the level of detail in this article (600 words) is too much, then there is an enormous amount of material listed under WP:TVE that needs cutting. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECrashwinder_0bc6.html" title="User:Crashwinder">Crashwinder</a> 08:40, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> What are these precedents? The AfD for all Naruto episodes isn't precedent; quite a few of the objections were about the scope of the nomination, not the articles themselves.

<li><b>Comment</b> An article <i>should</i> be able to stand on its own. There simply is not enough about the episode as it stands to merit an individual article. If an article cannot stand on its own, then it should be merged (perhaps into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Naruto_episodes_cbd5.html" title="List of Naruto episodes">List of Naruto episodes</a>). --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhirazo_76a5.html" title="User:Phirazo">Phirazo</a> 18:56, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You don't make an argument against sub-articles in general, do you? As an article grows in size, it is a natural and encouraged part of its development to fork off into smaller subjects which may or may not have significance outside the context of its parent article. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a> 00:09, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</i></dd>
