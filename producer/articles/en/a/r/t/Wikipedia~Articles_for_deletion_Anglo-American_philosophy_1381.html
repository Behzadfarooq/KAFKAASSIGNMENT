<dd><b>Comment</b>: To be fair, "Anglo-American philosophy" is a term in use, but of course it doesn't refer to the language in which the philosophy is done, but the location (Britain and America). It can indeed have the connotation of "analytic" philosophy - but all this reinforces the point that even a correct account of the meaning can only be a dictionary definition with links to the main articles on Philosophy or Analytic Philosophy. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 21:23, 25 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: But this is precisely the misconception from which the article starts - "anglo" in that phrase does not mean "anglophone". It just means English (although I would concede stretching it to British). So the article can only be a dictionary definition which redirects to articles dealing with British and American philosophy. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 15:10, 26 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: I would not stretch it to British, Britain includes Wales and there are also Anglo-Welsh relations. Not sure if there is a article on "American Philosophy". The word Anglo-American can mean governmental relations between the U.S. and the U.K. or their cultural commonality, but it can also include Welsh-American and also Jamaicans who live in the Americas and speak English. It depends on the context. I hazzard a guess that no one here knows what it means and that is why no one has been able to replace the bare two sentences on it given in the article and instead just say delete! --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <sup><span style="font-style:italic"><a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">Talk</a></span></sup> 15:24, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I don't think it's a question of what you or I would stretch it to: as the term is actually used, no-one makes a pointed distinction between Scottish or Welsh and English philosophers. <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 15:16, 29 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, POV fork rather than proper academic article.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a very strange request for deletion: are people denying the existence of Anglo-American Philosophy? If not then go and edit the article (all three lines of it) to your satisfaction. If you do deny it then maybe you should say the term is defunct or something like that.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As far as I've seen no one has tried to correct anything in the article and there have been no reverts. If it does not connote Analytic philosophy then go and clarify this fact in the article before others make the same mistake, it would only take two seconds to change the wording. Nor is there anything strange about geographic designations in philosophy, it does not mean the philosophy there is any worse or any different in a bad way, it is just a way of referring to it.</dd>

<dd>Judging by the number of delete supports above I'd say the article will get deleted, strange, 'cos there is such a thing as Anglo-American Philosophy, there is probabaly even Franco-American philosophy though I've not read any of it.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>:It seems we are caught between two poles, most editors here disavow talk of a distinction between Anglophone philosophy and Continental, more than they would disavow one between Analytic and Continental. Now we see proposed a distinction based on the geography of Anglo-American (which is really also cultural not just geographic) to ensure a method is not compared with a geographic distinction. The problem is that somehow both coincide, geography and method coincide in Anglophone (English-speaking countries but also those who partake of it in non-English speaking countries).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As to method, Analytic pretends to a method but you find all kinds of things there (trascendental arguments, ontological relativity, a denial of meaning to the word Analytic itself!, Wittgenstein II, ordinary language, new metaphysics, etc.), perhaps as many varieties as you find in Continental which may also be given as method, though not as clearly maintained as the original Analytic one, and with many changes in its history. One might say the method was initially a clearly articulated phenomenology, then existentialism, then structuralism and then deconstructive or post-structural. The three: Analytic, Anglo-American and Anglophone have also passed through such varieties in method. The heightened distinctions here between these three is inveitable when you are close up to them, but from the level of talking about Continental as one thing, these three also blur, and can be named as one, we just haggle over the name.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It seems the distinction we try to make here can be geographic, methodological, language-based, and/or cultural. So you cannot be faulted for mixing categories (eg, comparing method and geography) because in reality they are mixed and that is perhaps why there is such an issue as the schism in the first place.</dd>

<dd>Just to add, based on the re-direct suggestion, it should also re-direct to pragmatism.

<dl>
<dd>If the first question was directed to me, then I didn't mention anything about a definition; I just said "make redirect" (note, though, that "Wikipedia isn't a dictionary" isn't a policy, but a guideline, and that such an approach would be possible as a meaty dab page). As to the second question: at least one of the links that I gave explicitly distinguishes between pragmatism, continental philosophy, and Anglo-American philosophy. I don't think that anyone uses "Anglo-American philosophy" to mean "pragmatism", though many people use "analytic philosophy" to mean "Anglo-American philosophy". But there is no wholly satisfactory approach that doesn't involve rewriting <a href="../../../a/n/a/Analytic_philosophy.html" title="Analytic philosophy">Analytic philosophy</a> to some extent.</dd>
<dd>To be honest, if proper discussion were possible on these articles, which at the moment it isn't, the place to settle this would be at <a href="../../../a/n/g/Talk%7EAnglo-American_philosophy_eff5.html" title="Talk:Anglo-American philosophy">Talk:Anglo-American philosophy</a>. A case could be made for an article that explained clearly what the term means (that it includes analytic philosophy properly construed but is much broader than that, that it's misleading in that it isn't limited by geography or by language, etc.), and how it's distinguished from other philosophical traditions, including Continental philosophy. Failing that (and I hold out no hope for such a course), a redirect is the best of the bad options. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 16:42, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>At the same time, easy to find references to Rorty as Anglo-American and also as a pragmatist.

<dd>May I draw attention again to the fact that analytic philosophy occurs outside of the UK/US; and that therefore equating it with with anglo-american philosophy introduces a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias_28de.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Countering systemic bias">systemic bias</a>. <a href="../../../b/a/n/User%7EBanno_733d.html" title="User:Banno">Banno</a> 19:55, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Seems to a matter of Wiki policy or style rather than any factual dispute. "Anglo-American" is a phrase unquestionably used <i>as if</i> synonmous with analytic. Banno is obviously right that, strictly speaking, it's wrongly so used. Should Wiki follow common usage or strict facts? Note that this is not entirely trivial, because we have exactly the same problem with "continental". <a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD Tries Again</a> 20:05, 26 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../k/d/_/User%7EKD_Tries_Again_8f08.html" title="User:KD Tries Again">KD</a></dd>

</dd>
<dd>I don't think there's anything <i>systemic</i> about this, nor do I think a redirect has to "equate" two topics (indeed, as I said above, it would be best for the existing article to explain when "Anglo-American" might be used instead of "analytic"). At most this is a slightly inaccurate redirect, and that's still the best possible option under the current circumstances (circumstances which have already rendered many quite bad philosophy articles effectively uneditable). If the redirect is really unpalatable to a significant number of Wikipedians, I'll change my vote to a simple delete. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 20:08, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I agree it is not systematic, the world does not happen to work that way. Am I no longer allowed to call Budweiser an American beer when it is made in Nigeria? The point is not that Analytic is done outside of the Anglo-countries, but that, institutionally, it has the stamp of U.S/UK origin. Almost all philosophy in its subject matter has a global appeal, and rarely is it strictly local (you'll find Eastern/Continental/Analytic all taught globally). We use the word to help us trace its origins that is all. But since Anglo-American philosophy was not always Analytic it might be an idea to explain this in the article. What I mean is to answer the question why many phil.depts. in the U.K. switched to Analytic and coincidently many of the U.S. ones did too. These U.S. phil. depts did not choose French or German philosophy and perhaps this is down to language, imitiation, vestiges of colonialism, or the "special-relationship" <span style="font-style:italic">-- <a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucaas_e349.html" title="User:Lucaas">Lucas</a> <a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucaas_1582.html" title="User talk:Lucaas">(Talk)</a></span> 02:51, 28 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
