<p>Delete This site has a small amount of members.Don't let the member count fool you.A lot of the members are inactive.Also,most of the members live in the same area.It's like the early eBaum's world,when it was just for Eric Bauman and a few of his friends from School.This site is hardly deserving of a wikipedia article. <a href="../../../7/7/b/User%7E77boy84.html" title="User:77boy84">77boy84</a> 00:25, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Hello all this is 77boy88 he will be included in our history section and I think if you check your logs you will see he has allready screwed with this page. He has a thing against us as he is one out of three members we have ever banned. You have reviewed us once for deletion and made a desision so please do not allow this resentful child his game. Our statistics speak for ourselves with our post count well above fifty thousand and our member count 6 away from 300. ~Steven Burkeland</p>
<p><br />
I have nothing against the site.The posts may be above 50,000,but does that mean you get a load of posts a day?Also,6 from 300 means nothing,when half of them aren't active members,and when almost all of them are from the same school.If I remember correctly,a few days ago,several Half-Life 2 mods were considered for Deletion.If a Modification,wich takes a lot more effort to make than a site,isn't worthy of a Wikipedia article,neither is a small site on the internet.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
77boy84 has been banned from the site in the article before for causeing trouble and breaking several rules. I consider this an attack on the site. As a member I am very distraught over this. Thank you. ~Enzeru</p>
<p><br />
77boy is an idiot who just wants to get our wiki page deleted as a personal vendetta against the site. If you allow him to have his way with this, than you might as well let the general public have thier way with the "Religion" entry and see how that goes. He's just trying to get back at us like the petty little kid he is. Please, don't delete our article just because he says. At least take a good look at it, and if you say to do it then, then go ahead, but don't let him screw with it just because he's a bitter little boy. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 00:59, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I'm an idiot? You guys accuse me of making attacks on the site(wich I haven't)and then make attacks on me.Wonderful.I'm not trying to get back at anyone.I'm trying to make sure Wikipedia isn't filled with useless junk like articles about websites,such as the RP site.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
Oh, so blanking an article we had to fight to get on here, replacing it with insults and shit like that, and then demanding it be deleted isn't an attack? Oh, and I'm sure the fact that we've had to ban you four times is just coincidence. You're doing this for the good of Wikipedia, not to get off on a little power rush because you could inconvenience us. I suppose then that you're upset about the HL2 mods' articles being deleted because you honestly think that those being here is important, not because your a little fanboy.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:21, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
How about we stop talking to each other and let a wiki admin decide? They can visit the site and decide for themselves. After all, we know the truth. ~Enzeru</p>
<p><br />
Guys let craer handle this if he needs to otherwise lets just step out and wait for an offical statement instead of making ourselves look like fools. Because when you fight a fool its hard not to sink down to their level. Steven Burkeland</p>
<p><br />
I never replaced it with insults,where are you getting that from? I don't want a power rush,like you're trying to make it look like. Oh,and the HL2 nods weren't deleted,just put up for deletion.I'm suprised you,of all people,would call me a fanboy Craer.~77boy84</p>

Does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_RP_Site_%28role-playing_forum%29&amp;diff=35215896&amp;oldid=35189131" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_RP_Site_%28role-playing_forum%29&amp;diff=35215896&amp;oldid=35189131" rel="nofollow">this</a> look familiar to you? Mayhaps you've forgotten? You've been rather busy, as shortly after that, you blanked it. Wiki records the history on these things, you think you could get away with it and claim to have not done it? --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:38, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
Oh,so showing a few things you don't want people knowing about is considered "replacing it with insults"?:D I didn't replace anything,I just added something.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
We prefer a factual history. Like how you lacked to mention the fact that after banning you we had an anonomus poll on craer about should he stay an admin and he won by a far margin? But I grow tired of your lies allow us to let this sit for now and see the ruling before commenting further. I do however doubt that it will be ruled against as this happend once before and it seemed they ruled for it to stay. ~Steven Burkeland</p>
<p>Oh, so saying that most of the site is illiterate isn't insults? So giving your own bias as hell views on the staff's actions is just "adding something"? Oh, alright then. If bias is justifiable, I might have to be a bit more creative with my description of the site history, won't I? Oh, and blanking it so many times was also really mature of you. Way to go. That certainly showed us who was the clever one. That certainly helped out the Wikipedia community as a whole. Bravo.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:48, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I only blanked it once.Of course,egon.I should have added that,even though I was IP banned,wich stopped me from seeing anything on the site.I should add more information the next time I put something in a wikipedia article.Bias?They weren't bias.I made that information as un-biased as I could. But if you want a biased article on the site,then I'm sure I could do something.~77boy84</p>
<p>Seeing as you can't actually SEE the site, I'm sure that that makes you very much qualified to make some comments. Go ahead. Do what you want. I only hope that what you put is as bias and insulting as what you had before, so the Wikipedia staff can see that what you're doing is petty revenge on us.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 01:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh,it is as biased before.Trust me.~77boy84</p>
<p>You made some "Misspellings" that I thought I ought to "correct" for the "good of Wikipedia" and the article as a whole. --<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:11, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Good,wikipedia articles should not have misspellings,even if the articles don't have a place on wikipedia.But smith was a good RP'er. I think it was because everyone said he godmodded.But seeing as the strongest characters at that moment in time were a bunch of squirrels,it's no suprise people called him a godmoder.~77boy84</p>
<p>I'll admit, there were worse RPers than him, and a lot of the members we've had over the years, especially said squirrel, (who egon breifly made staff and I had to FORCE him to remove him) Were a bit out there. But you blame the staff far too much. This site is a great community. It deserves an article. Egonboy got himself in a major article, we got a ton of members, and I don't think that us getting put up for deletion just because you have it out for us is fair.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:19, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>You may have near 300 members,as a member count,but how many are active members? I doubt the other invisionfree roleplay sites with twice as many members have wikipedia articles.300 may seem like a lot,but on the internet,it's very miniscule.~77boy84</p>
<p>However, this site has a lot of unique things. It's a roleplaying site that has its own webcomic. It has a frappr that shows it's membership spans three continents. Of the 300, plenty are active. We get over 100 new posts each day. And like I said, Egonboy was featured on CBS GameCore. The site has a lot of unique things about it, like the "server" system, which, as far as any of us know, is entirely unique to the RP site out of all of the Invisionfree Forums. As well, it is a much more open Community than the typical RP forum, which generally are a lot more xenophobic than we are. This site deserves an article, as it has many unique features that not many other Invisionfree sites have.--<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraer_294e.html" title="User:Craer">The Inept Ninja</a> 02:30, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The wikipedia article mentions none of these "unique" features. Maybe if the article actually highlighted these features and actually explained in detail what it is,then the article would have a place on wikipedia.He's featured on a site,do you want us to worship him or something?I don't really see how that makes him special.~77boy84</p>
<p><br />
We mentioned in the discussion prior to this one that the article was not finished. Here is a list of reasons why the article should stay:</p>
<p>1. It was already decided by Wiki Staff to stay. 2. Our members span 3 continents. 3. The owner and Site was mentioned by CBS, and many other websites that get over 50k hits a day. 4. We have approximately 300 members. 5. We're actually fighting to keep this up. 6. We have a frappr and a webcomic.</p>
<p><br />
Now about 77boy84:</p>
<p>He has spammed (multiple) forums, and tries to torment us on the daily. He's a 12 year old, immature little boy as he can't except the fact that he is ever wrong, and quite frankly acts like a prick. He simply won't leave us alone and is looking for ways to harrass the RP Site. - Hatiatsu, Administrator @ The RP Site.</p>
<p>I don't torment you on the daily. I do it when I feel like it.~77boy84</p>
