<p>Recently <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> wrote a better article, but one I still feel to be a dictionary definition (see discussion at <a href="../../../t/a/i/Talk%7ETaint_10df.html#What_to_do.3F" title="Talk:Taint">Talk:Taint#What to do?</a>) and ignores the other — normal — meanings of taint which would require adding even more dict defs.

<li><b>clean and keep</b>: there should be SOME mention of the meaning of the word as it has cutural meaning, but it should include other meanings as well. The term shouldnt be thrown out simply because its meaning is vulgar, but should instead be presented with definitions and links and historical reference (I beleive that HBO's Mr.Show was the first to popularize this term) that ARE NOT vulgar. Just because the term itself is childish and obscene, does not mean it has no signifigance. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../2/0/5/User%7E205.188.116.73.html" title="User:205.188.116.73">205.188.116.73</a> (<a href="../../../2/0/5/User_talk%7E205.188.116.73.html" title="User talk:205.188.116.73">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_205.188.116.73_97b9.html" title="Special:Contributions/205.188.116.73">contribs</a>).</small>

<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I suppose so. A more-common usage of the word as opposed to the antiquated usage is moreso how I see it. Is taint still more commonly used to refer to spoilage in the vernacular of Scotland? It seems in America, anyhow, that you here it more often refering to the perineum. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 21:29, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yeah, in the UK I think you'd get a lot of blank looks if you were using taint in the sexual slang way - to me anyway it's an Americanism. Thanks/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 22:41, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Both good points... the other problem with deleting this article is that it will just lead to a recreation in the future... but I agree with Wangi that a redirect to just the new definition is not appropriate, since there are more fundamental definitions of the word. <sub>└</sub><i><sup><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></sub></i><sup>┐</sup> 20:50, 3 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>So what, we should have a dab to two dictdefs rather than a dictdef or a dictdef for a neologism?

<li>I agree it's a dicdef, but I don't think a neologism is fair... per Cenestrad googling will reveal it is more established than that.

<li>Not at all. The traditional usage is a dictdef, the neologism is a dictdef of a neologism. A disambiguation page would be between one dictdef and another. Quite an easy call, IMO! - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 22:06, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Please google this term if you think it is a neologism. I am sure you will find ample sources to insure you that it is an established and widley used term (if only in the U.S.). If you care to look you will find web sites dealing with Taint centered sexual fetishes, Taint humor (if it's funny is a matter of opinion) and a Taint magazine.I had suggested that a disambiguation page that would link to wikitonary for the older useage and a catergory on sexual slang for the newer (non-neologism) term. This would allow a place for articles such as Taint or choad. I think that this would benifit wikipedia by eleminating the temptation to post a joke article some seem to feel when they see the page is nonexisten. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> (<a href="../../../c/e/n/User_talk%7ECenestrad_3f23.html" title="User talk:Cenestrad">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cenestrad_b1d7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cenestrad">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a disambiguation page. I can't quite accept it as a redirect, since that would hide a transwiki dictionary link. Thus, disambig - one to the traditional word, one as a link to the new one via perineum. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 17:31, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem with redirecting this term to perineum is that it retains the meaning of the word but not the context. It is true that the perineum and the Taint are the same part of the body anatomically speaking but Taint is a vulgar term as opposed to a medical term and that needs to be noted. Also this eliminates the potential for the articles growth in regards to cultural references. As I mentioned above the term Taint is employed in American pop culture having been referenced by several television shows and comedians. Also it is the center of some individual’s sexual fetishes. All of this could add to a valid article which would be much more than a dictionary definition and go well beyond what a person would expect to find in an article on the perineum.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 17:49, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would like to apologize for forgetting to sign a comment I added earlier. Dwilke seems to think that this is a major issue and posted four edits concerning one unsigned comment. The apex for me was his elation of "It appears to be Censtrad!" Way to go Colombo but next time just ask me and I'll tell you if I was the author of a comment. This is the second time you have accused me of sockpuppeting and I am more than a little irritated. If I were to use such a trick don't you suppose I would log out first? I would also like to note that the comment in question was made as a post script to my vote on this subject earlier and did not contain a vote of its own. From now on I'll be more careful to sign my comments.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 18:57, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I really don't think Dan was accusing you of sock-puppeting. He was only marking your comment as having been made by you. Please <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. He has made no accusations of sock-puppetry that I have seen. As to needing four edits: that might imply he needs help with the "show preview" button, but it doesn't accuse you of sock-puppetry. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Korn_fe1c.html" title="User:Sam Korn">[[Sam Korn]]</a> 22:45, 4 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Had he only mentioned an unsigned article possibly being mine once I would have assumed good faith. However on an unsigned comment previously posted Dan had added “I wonder if this is the author?” (It was not.) I have no problem assuming good faith and being civil but a veiled accusation of sock puppeting could tip the balance in this debate and that I do have a problem with that.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 23:13, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, I apologise if I insulted you. I was only slightly angry since I had to spend an inordinate amount of time, and edits trying to work out who had written that (and another unsigned edit). Sockpuppetry did not at all enter my head, in fact I was commenting that I wasn't expecting it to be a registered user who forgot to sign a post as per [[WP:~~~~]]. Also, I had no idea at the time that the person who had previously commented, unsigned whilst not even signed in, was not the author. Nor did I know it was you. Finally, "tip the balance"! Ridiculous. I would never consider doing something so, well, petty. I do not consider this article so important (nor would I ever give the author the pleasure), as to risk my own name using illicit means to get it deleted. In fact it seems that that is where it is destined anyway according to the consensus of the community. <a href="../../../d/w/i/User%7EDwilke_d205.html" title="User:Dwilke">Dan</a> 15:24, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>My only problem with the wikipedia is not a dictionary argument is that it seems we are singling out this word before it even has a chance to expand. As I pointed out earlier the word "an" contains nothing BUT several definitions on its wikipedia page, whereas this site offers some historical backing as to the words origins, as well as a few links to other sites, and certainly has great POTENTIAL to grow. It seems as though the word has been continually deleted almost out of habit. If wikipedia is going to be hell bent on removing all articles that are JUST definitions it would seem a better policy to start with "an" and move down the list of other words/terms that have been there for a while and haven’t grown. Deleting this page will just result in some kid putting up a comedic response so why not instead start with a better suited article and instead allow it to grow. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPickelbarrel_3c4d.html" title="User talk:Pickelbarrel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pickelbarrel_7b43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pickelbarrel">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>Wrong in quite a number of ways:
<ol>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a> does <i>not</i> comprise "nothing but definitions". It comprises a list of hyperlinks to articles which would, by themselves, either be at <a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">aN</a>/<a href="../../../a/n/_/An.html" title="An">an</a> or have a redirect from there.</li>
<li>"Historical backing as to the word's origins" <i>belongs in the dictionary</i>. Etymology is exactly what the dictionary is for. There are even etymology sections in the dictionary article already. Expanding an encyclopaedia article with such things is contrary to the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> policy and a dilution of effort, to boot.</li>
<li>You are thinking of this article as an article about a word. ("It seems as though the word ...") Dictionary articles are about words. Encyclopaedia articles are about concepts/people/places/things/events. An encyclopaedia article by this title would be about taints, <i>not</i> about the word "taint". We already have <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/taint" class="extiw" title="wikt:taint">taint</a> for that.</li>
<li>This article has <i>not</i> been "continally deleted". It hasn't ever been deleted at all. It has been replaced with a soft redirect encouraging editors to write an encyclopaedia article about taints if there is one, but to use the dictionary otherwise. The article as it currently stands is not an encyclopaedia article about taints, and is simply a bad duplicate of the dictionary article about the word "taint" that is in Wiktionary. A soft redirect is better than that.</li>
<li><a href="../../../a/n/_/AN_d968.html" title="AN">AN</a> is a <a href="../../../d/i/s/Wikipedia%7EDisambiguation_78fc.html" title="Wikipedia:Disambiguation">disambiguation</a> article. It <i>shouldn't</i> grow into a dictionary article. That it hasn't is, therefore, a <i>good</i> thing.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finally: <i>why not instead start with a better suited article?</i> — Because it has yet to be demonstrated that there is an encyclopaedia article about taints to be had. <i>At most</i>, therefore, this is a disambiguation article between <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perineum.html" title="Perineum">perineum</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corruption.html" title="Corruption">corruption</a>, and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoilage.html" title="Spoilage">spoilage</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:35, 5 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>wow uncle g. as a newbie to using wikipedia I cant believe how interested Ive gotten in "the great taint debate" of 2006. I was worried that perhaps Id lost my mind and might end up outside of wikipedias headquarters holding a SAVE THE TAINT sign. Its nice to see others on the opposing side are as fanatical in their beliefs(I wonder what will become of us when the agument is finally decided).<br />
Let me ask this then if as is okay because it contains ONLY hyperlinks to articles that stand on their own, why not offer hyperlinks to other articles in THIS entry to choad and or perinium. My point on the article continually being deleted is that while of cours THIS article hasnt been deleted(otherwise we wouldnt be having this discussion) the word HAS had several entries over the last few months (my favorite being the one where it is stated "men have taints so they dont shit on their balls") This entry seems at least a ligitamit place to start as it does INCLUDE a hyperlink that can stand on its own.<br />
otherwise Uncle g , you have made very valid points, perhaps you may yet sway my vote and we will be seen and perhaps one day we will be seen arms locked chanting "WIKIPEDIA HAS NO TAINT" in triumphant victory <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> (<a href="../../../p/i/c/User_talk%7EPickelbarrel_3c4d.html" title="User talk:Pickelbarrel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pickelbarrel_7b43.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pickelbarrel">contribs</a>) 2006-01-05 16:34:47.</small></li>

Taint piercing is considered very popular in some goth and/or metal band circles.

<li><b>Comment</b> At this point I would like to request that any votes cast claiming the term is a neologism should be discarded. That argument has been made and rebutted and anyone still calling the term a neologism has not done one bit of research. They are simply labeling the term a neologism because they are not familiar with it. It seems fairly obvious that the point of an encyclopedia is to help familiarize a person with new terms and concepts as an encyclopedia containing only things you already know would be pointless. Secondly I would like to suggest that people have a look at the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a> article. This term is a reference to the anus but asshole deserves a separate article because it is different in context. If I called a person an anus I most likely would only get quizzical looks. On the other hand if I dubbed them an “Asshole” they would surely demand satisfaction. The same is true for perineum and Taint.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 19:13, 6 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>The <i>concept</i> denoted by the slang sense of "taint" is exactly the same concept denoted by "perineum". There's no need to have two separate encyclopaedia articles for the same concept. The fact that "taint" can denote other concepts (specifically <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corruption.html" title="Corruption">corruption</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoilage.html" title="Spoilage">spoilage</a>) is why this should be a disambiguation article <i>amongst those three concepts</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Like the expansion of the article. Still think we need to disambig between this, the "old fashioned" usage, the term "tainted data" in programming, and maybe a link to <a href="../../../t/a/i/Tainted_Love_bfb2.html" title="Tainted Love">Tainted Love</a>, too. <sub>└</sub><sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 19:16, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>People don't type in "taint" when they're looking for <i>tainted love</i>, so it wouldn't make a dab page... Thanks/<a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWangi_79ab.html" title="User:Wangi">wangi</a> 19:24, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>like the added material, hopefully it will continue to grow. I was talking with my grandmother( a ninety-plus year old political activist who encouraged me to get my nose pierced) about the irony of this article and its discussion page being longer than the actual article, and she told me about a phrase I had never heard "The smell of his taint". Apparently her parents used to use it to refer to scotsmen and black people(apparently her parents were very racist even though my grand mother is NOT at all). They would talk about the smell of a certain scotsmans taint(they were both full blooded irish) being lifted after he carried their daughter Ima home from an accident which probably saved Ima's life. My grandmother didnt know weather this is an irish term, a local term or one just my great grand parent used, but I thought someone here might. I also thought it would be interesting to know if this was in fact a play on the two different meanings of the words, as this might offer some info into the amount of time the latter difintion has been around.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> 21:11, 7 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, if taint really can be expanded as a body part slang term, should a dab be made here and a new article called <a href="../../../t/a/i/Taint_%28slang%29.html" title="Taint (slang)">taint (slang)</a> be created? Im still thinking redirect and expanding the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perineum.html" title="Perineum">perineum</a> article. Main concern with doing something other than a redirect would set a precendent for the creation and survival of article like fleshy fun bridge or chin rest. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 03:35, 8 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think so. The term Taint is well known and widely used giving it cultural relevance. The term Perineum should be concerned with gross anatomy not sexual fetish, comedy routines or homosexual slang. The terms like fleshy fun bridge or chin rest could not be expanded upon beyond a dict. def. I would suggest you look at the article for both <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choad.html" title="Choad">choad</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a>.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 03:48, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>No. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a> of slang. That's Wiktionary's job, <i>and it is doing it</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Then why does the catagory <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slang.html" title="Slang">slang</a> exist? I don't think you can reasonably argue that what I wrote is a dict. def or that it belongs on the perineum page. Again I suggest that you take a look at <a href="../../../a/s/s/Asshole.html" title="Asshole">asshole</a> and it's AFD page and the reason it was kept. Also look at <a href="../../../c/h/o/Choad.html" title="Choad">choad</a> and <a href="../../../p/u/s/Pussy.html" title="Pussy">pussy</a>. Again these are anatomical terms that but the context of these articles don't belong on the coresponding anatomical page.--<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECenestrad_74db.html" title="User:Cenestrad">Cenestrad</a> 05:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

It is supposed to be for <i>articles about slang</i>, such as <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_slang.html" title="London slang">London slang</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medical_slang.html" title="Medical slang">Medical slang</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sexual_slang.html" title="Sexual slang">Sexual slang</a>, and so forth, but editors who want to create a dictionary in the wrong project do from time to time mis-use it as if it were the same as <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_slang" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:English_slang">wikt:Category:English slang</a> (which is a category <i>in the dictionary</i>, note, into which many of the articles in <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Slang" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Slang">wikt:Category:Slang</a> should eventually be migrated) and were a category for dictionary articles on slang words. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, this is now an encyclopedia article about a slang term, not just a definition of one. Possibly move to taint (term) and disambiguate. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 17:21, 8 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Much of the article, such as the parts about shaving and piercing, is about <a href="../../../p/e/r/Perinaeum.html" title="Perinaeum">perinaea</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 04:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[[[question]]] for all those that have been wikipedia is not a dictionaring this term, I would like to ask them to go to the satanic entry and tell me if that is not JUST A DEFINTION, I am still learning about wikipedia. The article does NOT have a snub listing next to it, and I cant tell why it is allowed to stay. I put the question on the discussion page but have not gotten a response. I have been going over the rules since wangi sent them to me, but have yet to find a reason why this has seemingly slipped through the cracks. I dont want to put it up for deletion though if it IS legitimate.<a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPickelbarrel_3950.html" title="User:Pickelbarrel">Pickelbarrel</a> 18:12, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
