<p>This is a non-notable fansite for <a href="../../../t/y/_/Ty_the_Tasmanian_Tiger_3e71.html" title="Ty the Tasmanian Tiger">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</a>. Was prodded by me, but deprodded, so I'm bringing it here. The argument for inclusion on the talk page is that BZPower, a <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bionicle.html" title="Bionicle">Bionicle</a> fansite with over 30,000 users, is included, so this site, with 135 users, should also be included. The site itself is hosted by freewebs, a sure sign of non-notability. Incidently, the main Ty article isn't very good - the effort put into this article should be directed there. <a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a> 09:29, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> per nom, plus the fact that Google has only 800-odd results for "ty revolution", and no pages linking to it. I'd probably even consider voting delete on that Bionicle site, should it come to it, and it at least has some significant Google results (but a really poor Alexa result). <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConMan_d21d.html" title="User:ConMan">Confusing Manifestation</a> 12:41, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> First of all, I reverted the redirect back to the article, including the AfD tag. Not just should the article be deleted, but it should not be a redirect. The site is not nearly popular enough for it to have any presence on WP. It completely fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. In addition, it should not be a redirect, as that 1) implies that the site is somehow significant, and 2) implies that anyone would search that term (which is highly doubtful). -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 00:00, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Against Deletion</b> True, TYR may be small in its present state, however it is growing at an incredible pace and we are also the only TY site to have recent information on the upcoming TY games (plus information on the recently cancelled TY: Gunyip! ), plus some very detailed articles for the two recent TY games (TY1's page is being revamped). Krome Studios, the developers of TY, also visit the site regularly and post exclusive information about the games in development. TYR is also the biggest active TY The Tasmanian Tiger fansite/community on the web right now, and getting bigger every day. By this time next year we fully expect to have over 1,000 members. TYR is becoming extremely popular in small corners of the net, and it can only spread from there. TYR's still on FreeWebs, yes, you have us there. However, we intend to buy a server within a year and move the contents of the site there, thus taking the site off of FreeWebs and making TYR a "true" independent site.ToyoWolf 06:25, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, specifically <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enot_aa34.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:not">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. You (and I mean the general "you", not "you", ToyoWolf, in particular) cannot attempt to assert notability by saying "This could be popular one day," or "She could get famous if...," or, in your case, "We fully expect to have over 1,000 members" and "We intend to buy a server within a year." Also, please look at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> for criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia concerning web sites. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Against Deletion</b> It just needs time to grow. Just read what Toyo said. But what I'd like to ask is why you even care? It's a small article, I don't think it should take up very much disk space. Does every byte count or is rule enforcement at top priority here? Oh, and Kotzu, one of the mods there, has something to say about this.</li>
</ul>
<p>"Oh my God that is one arrogant and stupid person. The only reason he wants to delete it is because he thinks his Halo and holy Grand Theft Autos are so much better and that you're a n00b for liking Ty(He blatantly leads me to believe that).</p>
<p>Here's a thought, Kicking222. Maybe some people aren't old enough to enjoy your blood and gore splattered games that you also lead me to believe you play. Ty is the perfect game for kids 6-11. Or maybe some people actually appreciate the effort, innovation, and fun in a Ty the Tasmanian Tiger title(me). Maybe if you stopped listening to your dieties such as IGN and actually approached games with an open mind, we wouldn't have this problem.</p>
<p>The only reason he's against it is because he doesn't like Ty. Plain, and simple. Because I'm pretty sure that if it was the biggest Halo forum on the net, or the biggest Half-Life forum on the net we were talking about, he wouldn't have a problem with it. He said this site was insignificant, and that no one would search for Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. Bullshit. The members of the freaking DEVELOPMENT team go here. Do you hear me, kicking222? THE MEMBERS OF KROME STUDIOS POST HERE, GIVING THE SITE A HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE THAN MOST FAN FORUMS. Jeez." A direct quote of his post. - Superkid11, mod of TYR.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm simply going to respond in order of what you stated. 1) I couldn't care less about the "disk space"- I doubt Wikipedia could hold an <i>infinite</i> number of articles, but it could certainly hold <i>a lot</i>. The concern is notability; in building an encyclopedia, we (meaning you, me, and everyone on WP) must have some standards. If every web site had its own Wikipedia article, then, obviously, WP would be larger than the entirety of the rest of the Web. 2) I'm not sure how <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP's rules on not making personal attacks</a> applies to quoting other people, but I still don't appreciate it. I'm not attacking you for your views, and I should not be attacked for mine; our views are equally valid. For the record, I do adore <i>Halo</i> and <i>GTA</i>; I also love the <i>Ratchet &amp; Clank</i> games, the <i>Tony Hawk</i> games, the <i>NBA Street</i> games, the <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> games, and games in pretty much every genre (besides RPGs and strategy games). I have absolutely nothing against the <i>Ty</i> series's games; as I have never played them, I cannot judge their quality. However, you can be sure that if a <i>GTA</i> fansite's article was up for deletion, I would argue for its deletion unless it could be proven that the site was particularly significant. 3) In addition, <i>size</i> of a web forum matters, and I'm sure the largest <i>Halo</i> or <i>Half-Life</i> forum is many dozens (if not hundreds) times larger than this <i>Ty</i> forum. I understand that staff members on the <i>Ty</i> team posts on your forums, but I know of (for example) more than a few <i>GTA</i> fansites that have direct correspondence with Rockstar (in fact, the pamphlet/booklet/whatever you want to call it for all of the PS2 <i>GTA</i> games have "Thank yous" for half a dozen or so sites), and none of them have articles. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 21:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Look, I'm a mod on the site and I seriously think the site doesn't need a page. If it becomes big enough, we might get one. But for now, there's realy no point.... Kotzu really shouldn't have said all that stuff, and SK shouldn't have posted it here. -- <a href="../../../p/o/k/User%7EPokemega32_1222.html" title="User:Pokemega32">Pokemega32</a> 02:47, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
