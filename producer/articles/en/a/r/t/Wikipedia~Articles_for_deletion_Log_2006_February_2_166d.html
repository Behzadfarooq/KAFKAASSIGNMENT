<li><b>Comment</b>, I realize that this topic is <i>somewhat</i> encyclopedic, but only if placed in the right place, perhaps a better place for it would be a note under an article about language preservation, or perhaps Gaelic language?

<li><b>Keep</b> article is still in its infancy and will be further developed and tidied. Yes, Gaelic punk and is featured in the Scottish media and is becoming a more widely used term for bands that not only sing in Gaelic but have 'Celtic' influences such as Flogging Molly and the Pogues.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - The criteria for notability can be satisfied. The sub-genre exists. There is even mention of this cultural phenomenon in recognised popular media sources. This one does not even require much consideration- it is, by its nature, a 'keep'. One caveat- the present state of the article is deplorable; lots of cleanup needed (inaccurate statements, POV-slanted phrasing, et cetera). → <b><font color="#006400">P</font><font color="#4B0082">.</font><font color="#008000">Mac</font><font color="#228B22">Uidhir</font></b> <a href="../../../p/%C3%A1/d/User_talk%7EP%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6a00.html" title="User talk:Pádraic MacUidhir"><font color="#9400D3">(t)</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_P%C3%A1draic_MacUidhir_6232.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pádraic MacUidhir">(c)</a> 06:34, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> funnily enough! This is my first submission to Wikipedia, any helpful comments and advice welcome. Layout and content is still being worked on. As to being obscure, isn't it the job of encylopedias to shed light? Yes, it certainly does exist as is evidenced by the 268,000 Google hits on the term and international media coverage. What other minority 'interests' should we delete from Wikipedia? Scots Gaelic punk would be more relevant if we only take language into account. It is argued that you can't be a Gael without Gaelic. However, some of the bands mentioned do have influences rooted in traditonal Gaelic culture, for example use of the bagpipes. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Seonaidh (<a href="../../../s/e/o/User_talk%7ESeonaidh_ecfb.html" title="User talk:Seonaidh">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Seonaidh_8d22.html" title="Special:Contributions/Seonaidh">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There are hundreds of these lists and, while VH1 is music-centered, it's far from authoritative, and not extremely notable compared to its peers; it's just one more commercial medium with its own POV and self-interest.

<li>Perhaps, I'm wrong, but I don't think that's how it works. My understanding is that the original edit history has to be retained and the target article has to acknowledge that it used material from the source article.

<p>This page was nominated on January 26th and there was no consensus. However, the "keep" side was driven by a claim that the subject was a professional hockey player - a claim that was never verified. In fact all of my research points to the fact that the subject was not a professional hockey player, as his only mention at hockeydb.com was that he played for the University of British Columbia team (which is a university team, not a professional one). Therefore, I am renominating the article to form a clearer consensus. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saunders</a> 01:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep &amp; move to Anti System</b> per Raggaga. I grant this is on the very cusp of notability, but they <i>do</i> have an All Music entry, even if it is just a discography with no bio.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, now I'm thorougly confused.

The article mentions Defence of the Realm with "2 more tracks" and none of the names match. Are we sure we're dealing with the right band here? And what is <a href="http://www.earwaxwisconsin.com/ANTI-SYSTEM-No-Laughing-Matter-discography-CD/" class="external text" title="http://www.earwaxwisconsin.com/ANTI-SYSTEM-No-Laughing-Matter-discography-CD/" rel="nofollow">this link</a> showing? It looks like they gathered the bits and pieces from their scattered catalog and released it as one CD? Doesn't that still mean they've only made enough music to fit on one CD? You've almost got me convinced to keep except now I'm worried about their verifiability with this new conflicting info. Then again, if we have to jump through this many hoops to find anything, how notable can they be?! —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 14:46, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>They are not "notable" in the dictionary sense of the word, but they do meet the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria. OK, I think I've got it all sorted out. Here was the <i>original</i> text of the article: "anti system formed in 1981 in 82 there 8 track demo came out they had 2 tracks on Punk Dead - Nah Mate, The Smell is Jus Summink in Yer Underpants Innit 12"(Pax, 1982) then they released defence of the realm ep (pax, 1982) had 2 more tracks on Bollox to the Gonads - Here's the Testicles LP (Pax, 1984) after pax records went under they singed to reconciliation records in 84 85 saw the release of there legendary lp no laughting matter in 86 they released there last best release a look at life(12) anti sytem were not a crust band they were hard core punk." They never said that "Defence of the Realm EP" <i>included</i> songs called "Bollox to the Gonads" and "Here's the Testicles", but that they contributed two songs to the album called <i>Bollox to the Gonads - Here's the Testicles</i>. <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.punk.uk/browse_thread/thread/5b3291106e37ee17/a00f4f7f4063b88a?lnk=st&amp;q=%22Bollox+to+the+Gonads+%22%22Here's+the+Testicles%22+%22MAU+MAUS%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#a00f4f7f4063b88a" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.punk.uk/browse_thread/thread/5b3291106e37ee17/a00f4f7f4063b88a?lnk=st&amp;q=%22Bollox+to+the+Gonads+%22%22Here's+the+Testicles%22+%22MAU+MAUS%22&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#a00f4f7f4063b88a" rel="nofollow">This link</a> reveals that that album is a compilation.

<li>I would argue that to several hundred people, if not thousands (let's include the lurkers), that the subject matter is important. That the signee has not heard of the subject should not be used as reason alone for deletion. I am sure if i searched through the wiki files I would find plenty of entries that I considered to be unimportant. As I stated last night when asking for the page to not be deleted, similar entries for other websites are included. As for having no notoriety, again that is a subjective viewpoint of the signee and surely cases should be reviewed on an objective not subjective issue. The entry will make more sense when it is completed, but I say again, to thousands of people the entry will be relevant. Sitheroo 10:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oi weregerbil. It's a social commentary on an internet phenomena and hence clearly not nonsense. It needs tidying up and making more readable but is still valid on the encyclodepic side of the site. Sitheroo 10:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Savidan, your entry interests me. What relevance in the wider scheme of things do the rules to a drinking game known by an few people at an educational establishment have? Sitheroo 11:00, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. The history is as relevant as the definition. To disregard and ignore recorded and factual events is a threat to democracy and smacks of communism.jerichoharris

<li><b>keep</b>. I second Sith's emotion (except I have no interest whatsoever in anything to do with Savidan and the word "entry"). It is certainly more relevant than some esoteric mating ritual practised by a bunch of idiots in green jumpers with letters on them who attend some American establishment no doubt famous for its practise of unbridled Man-Love and named after a rather shabby British Dockyard. In short, keep it, or I'll ram you up your own fudge-tunnels. Bernoulli

<li>Keep: Some of the material that appears on awag may be contentious, but it is subvesive and invetive: it is this very FACTAMUNDO (overlooked by the main page author incidentally) that is the ESSENCE of AWAG: it forms a continuum of a deeply embedded strand of British SATIRE c/f 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and 'The Office.'

<li>Hello. I've cleared the unhelpful entries off. My intellect alone will be enough to convince you that Awag should be allowed to stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the Wikipedia community. I am, however, busy at work, so if you could hold on til tomorrow night when I've got some time to argue it's case properly I'd be wholly grateful.

<li>Right, I'm back with a proper user name which will hopefully take the edge off the more anal contributor's attitudes. I have an encyclopaedic knowledge of many subjects I will be more than happy to contribute to one I discover the nature of the beast we're humping here. I reiterate that if "Dartmouth Pong" or some water park which caters to people who weigh as much as a small family car are regarded as suitable for inclusion then it would be scandalous not to extend the same courtesy to Awag.

<li><b>keep</b> A definition for nonsense as given on wikipedia. "Much madness is divinest sense to the discerning eye. Given that Zunaid is ingorant of the term AWAG, it's usage and importance in Modern Britain, it is little wonder he has described it as such and says much about his own powers of discernment.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Re: <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dartmouth_pong.html" title="Dartmouth pong">Dartmouth pong</a>. There is a difference between a game that's been popular for decades among a notable community (Dartmouth is generally considered one of the ten most prestigious universities in America, not that that matters) and a typographical error/inside joke that is relevant to a handful of soccer fans. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 15:54, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Whether a community is 'notable' is entirely subjective. Awag as a concept has been atround for several years, and is well referenced - 'handful' is your just perception - it is utterly incorrect. And it's football, thanks. Pear 16:11, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>

<ul>
<li>Whether a community is notable or not <i>is</i> subjective, but degrees of notability are very concrete.

<li>Ah, perhaps you'd be kind enough to direct me to your notability-o-meter? Again, there are considerably more than a <i>few</i> football fans out there to whom "Awag" means something. It means more to me than a university named after a stinking dock ever will. But I suspect I'll never reach the necessary levels of self-obsessed patronising bleating required to become 'established' enough on here to count for anything. Woe is me Pear 16:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You might want to try <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google.html" title="Google">Google</a>. "Dartmouth College" (including the quotes, thus excluding many relevant results, considering it is universally known as simply "Dartmouth" by all Americans) has 11,400,000 results. awag football (excluding quotes, thus including many <i>ir</i>relevant results) has a whopping 567. Anyway, don't make it out like I'm a Dartmouth-phile or anything. They rejected me, in fact. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 16:49, 2 February 2006 (UTC) (Just had a look on GOOGLE, starryeyes is telling porkies. AWAG gets over 11,000 references. "Dartmouth Pong" got 208. Liar liar pants on fire................The comparison was between Dartmouth Pong and AWAG not Dartmouth and AWAG football. Cuntwipe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a start, it's not soccer. Secondly, I believe that the point has been made above as to why the "awag" entry should be kept. Reasons have been given such as it's appearance in books, newspapers and national radio. However this appears to be a dictatorship, and we are not being listened too because "zunaid" has too much time on his/her hands. The reason so many "sock puppets" have come on here, as you seem so keen to keep pointing out, is because of the popularity of the entry of awag, and our utter disbelief that you cannot see it's value.

<li>i occasionally wear shoes on my hands, does that make me a shoepuppet? Denby 16:16, 2 february 2006 (utc)</li>
</ul>
<p>What MHG said, again I am not a sockpuppet but another person who has taken the time and effort to create an account in order that this unbelievably inane discussion comes to an end. To dismiss something so readily just beacuase you are unaware of it is staggering. AWAG is important to many many people and rightly deserves its place in history CaRtEr</p>

<li>Starryeyes, I find it fascinating that somebody who regards British music as so important can be so ignorant of the culture from which it grew. If you told Joe Strummer it was "soccer", and that Dartmouth College graduates were of greater worth than "soccer fans" he quite rightly call you a wanker.Jerichoharris 16:31, 2 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This whole debate is rather silly! I do hold a reverence for British music, like many Americans do, but my respect for British culture does <i>not</i> extend to typographical errors, nor should it! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes"><font color="#FF0000">Starry</font><font color="#0000FF">Eyes</font></a> 16:45, 2 February 2006 (UTC) (P.S. Let's say for comparison there was a very popular drinking game at <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a> with traceable lineage and so forth. Let's also say that there was an inside joke among a handful of American baseball fans stemming ultimately from a typographical error. Which would you say is more worthy of inclusion?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FOOL. They both need inclusion. You are just sounding like a snob now. Oh, and by the way, this was un unsigned entry by a non-voting intruder blah blah blah. I never realised how pompous this wikipedia thing was. You might as well forget it and read a paper encyclopedia if you are not going to be inclusive.</p>
<ul>
<li>The argument is "silly" because of your ignorance. You are ignorant of what AWAG is, or means, and of it's place in British culture.

<li>AWAG is not just a community, it's a way of life, a way of escaping boredom at work and at home with like minded people, It is also a perfect vehicle to co-ordinate social occasions across the country....sorry YOOKAY!, the football element contributes only a small percentage to that which is AWAG. Maybe you narrow minded fuckwits can't get your head around people who can actually manage their own lives and make their own decisions and generate their own community without having their heads up their own self important arses.

I'll bet good old English pounds to your vicously devalued American dollar that twenty years down the line (assuming the inevitableresource/race-wars haven't destroyed the internet/western society by then) that there will be more Awaggers than "Botcon" attendees, if only because a significant proportion of our lot have had sex with something other than our own hands and are likely to actually have some progeny. "Botcon" is a ridiculoous word, for fuck's sake - it sounds like a festival of anal adventure. AWAG is at least as "real" at least as "meaningful" and a milion times more significant than some bleach-faced Finnish Nazi sympathisers getting together with like-minded potential serial killers to spray their salty jizz over who has Galvatron in the most original original packaging.

<p>I was going to write a right good polemic on why this should stay on the webiste but having come in this morning and read the sanctimonious whiny shit above I've changed my mind. Good grief. Rightio That you self-important arbiters of what should be on this website appoint yourselves on time served on website rather than experience or qualifications shows what an arrogant up your own arse bunch of cunts you americans are. This is cultural imperialism of the highest order. Relevance? I could care less that a bunch of webtards who live in their mother's basements fantasizing about shooting their school friends with their dads AK47 collection do not find an ENGLISH website (a very popular one, 1000000 hits a month at the height of it's popularity) relevant. I assume, rightly I imagine, that you have all written off to the Encyclopedia Brittanica and asked for all the bits you don't care about to be removed? Here's the news: AWAG, to many many Britons is as relevant and important as things you care about but we have never heard of are to you. Boo hoo you haven't heard of it. It's a comedic website, it doesn't profess to be anything more and as such it deserves to be kept on this encyclopedia (from the greek meaning 'encyclo' - everything' and 'pedia - fiddler of small children' - and quite right too, that is pretty much what you all are). SO hey ho, you small band of keepers of the truth don't want us to play. Never mind. We'll have as much fun searching the site and finding non-relevant and non-important entries as we would having the pleasure of seeing this entry accepted into the fold.</p>
<p>America uber alles eh? God bless George Bush and his beacon of truth democracy and justice.</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> As an American working in Europe I am frankly dismayed by the attitude of both sides to this discussion, sadly especially my compatriots. Having moved to Munich in 1997 to work for my existing company I have had to put up with anti-american attitudes in all walks of life. Living in Germany this has become particularily hard in the last few years following the intervention in the Middle East situation. In my capacity as a member of AWAG [<a href="http://www.awag.us/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.awag.us/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>] I constantly strive to improve relationships with our European Counterparts. Living in Europe has taught me to welcome the diversity of nations, to compare a German to a Frenchman is like comparing an Alaskan with a Mexican Immigrant, one simply can't.</p>
<p>I have a duty to promote AWAG in Europe both through social convertion and the internet, and have come across the alternative British meaning of the acronym on many occasions. While often typically British in attitude, one cannot doubt the growth in use of both the term and the relevance in their part of the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, I am saddened to see such dispute over this subject, Wikipedia is growing in reputation in all parts of Europe but particularily the United Kingdom I read, such actions sadly hinder this</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours</p>

<ul>
<li>Fair enough. The nom. for deletion was based on non-notability (phrased as non-notoriety). Meatpuppet &amp; Sockpuppet votes will be discounted or disregarded, however it does seem to show that there is some minimal notability (notoriety?) on the subject. We have a fairly low threshold for notability (nearly every murderer or executed murder at least is considered notable enough, as are semi-deities in any number of sci-fi genres, and on and on). Years from now (encyclopedically speaking) these non-notables will not be remembered, but that doesn't preclude their appearance here. If we want to up the threshhold of notability (like we have done with music), I'd be all for it IFF we apply it consistently. In any event, at least I spurred some discussion. You'll note that generally my votes on AfD's are not anti-majoritarian although sometimes I state that I didn't necessarily agree with the rationale. If I end up as a minority of one, I think I can take it.&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 21:17, 5 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Better, but probably still not good enough for me to change my vote. There's no independent verification of the website's traffic claim, which seems to be the main claim to notability, and in one of the two newspaper references cited earlier, the main body of the reference is the sportswriter admitting that he's never heard the term and doesn't know what it means <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1671899,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/englandinpakistan/story/0,16791,1671899,00.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<dd>Most of the people saying 'Delete' in this article have a well-established presence and edit history on this encyclopedia.

It isn't practical to believe that the nominator would meticulously construct a 500+ post edit history for all of these people simply to abuse AFD process. Meanwhile, a lot of the people saying 'Keep' have only a dozen or so edits, almost all of which are to Awag or to this AFD discussion.

<p>To be honest I get the feeling that most of the comments by the more experienced users are said without even reading the article, they call this jumping on the bandwaggon. There may be many reasons for this but I think that at least some of this is point chasing, from what I read some of the more childish users believe that the more edits one makes, the more important one is.

<p>As a new user it is not my place to say that this is stupid but I have to say it comes across this way.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Ruth Weinberg</p>
<p><br />
I must say that this episode has been an eye-opener for me.</p>
<p>I have, of course, heard of the concept of Wikipedia before, but this is the first time I have ever bothered to look in to it - that was as a result of being part of the Awag community.</p>
<p>My first thought about Wikipedia was that it was a foolish premise which was doomed to failure. Why would the entries in it be regarded as reliable, if they were penned by people with no authority, and freely open to vandalism by anyone (anonymously at that)?</p>
<p>The project does have virtues, of course, and the key one, apart from not having to pay people to insert and edit articles, would have to be inclusivity and scope. Here was the possibility to have an encyclopedia so comprehensive that no other could possibly compete. Even the most obscure facts could be embraced at no cost, apart from a few kilobytes of disk space.</p>
<p>However, this virtue seems to be being thrown away remarkably cheaply.</p>
<p>There are many valid reasons that could be put forward for removing Andy's Awag entry. It is not written in a journalistic style, and the origins and history of both the word and the community are not made clear enough. However, these things could be tidied up. It is true that to verify that Awag exists, and the facts about it are true is not easy, because of the sparsity of other web sites referencing Awag. In this case, we could have relied on the hundreds of other members of the Awag community to edit and correct the entry (apparently the whole idea of Wiki).</p>
<p>However, suggesting that entries should be excluded because they are "not famous enough" is not only an unwise criterion, it is also clearly being applied in an idiosyncratic and irrational way by an cliquey oligarchy of narcisstic bullies, seemingly drunk in their own solipsistic view of the World.</p>
<p>As an example, I noticed that a recently-deleted randomly-chosen article (which I have not had the opportunity to read) was called "Mesh computers". One reason put forward for the deletion was "I've lived in Britain for ten years now and never saw one single box manufactured by those people anywhere". I don't know what that signifies, but we have two in the family and at least two of my work colleagues also have one - so they do exist! Another comment: "links from the vanilla Google search are mostly just product reviews and thus do not indicate notability". There are, in fact, "about 64,000" matches for "Mesh Computers" in vanilla Google. How many do you need to be included?</p>
<p>The next deleted article after that was "Engineering Week - University of Alberta". Maybe not the most important subject in the World, it appears nevertheless to be earnestly and carefully written by someone who though it was worthy of inclusion, and there may be dozens, hundreds or even thousands of people who might have read it with interest. The author may have become a valuable contributor to Wikipedia, but I doubt he/she will ever bother with it again after the vitriolic and utterly inapproriate bile seen in the deletion page, e.g. "vanity", "Does anybody outside the Uni of Alberta give a shit", "boring", "dime-a-dozen University event", etc. These comments are spiteful, unnecessary and are simply a case of shooting onesself in the foot, by alienating people.</p>
<p>I note that one of the aims of Wikipedia,as stated by its founder, is to achieve the same quality as the Encyclopaedia Britannica, or better(!). Frankly, this aim is so laughable as to be embarrassing. Tragically, Wikipedia is also failing miserably to play to its strengths of immediacy and inclusivity.</p>
<p>Personally, I doubt I will be bothering to access Wikipedia again, either as a contibutor or as a reader. If I want reliability, I can use Britannica. Wikipedia doesn't offer anything of value to me. In fact, to be honest, Awag is more valuable.</p>

Ruth, please allow me to say that you are a shining beacon of sense in what other wise amounts to a dogshit-filled dark corner of a park of mental mayhem. I feel I should apologise for the US-phobic comments of some people here who appear to be doing their best to exhibit what they perceive to be the major drawbacks of the US i.e. a parochial, judgemental, cartoon picture of other lands. As I watch hour after our of news footage of people screaming "Allah Kebab Fallaffel!" and burning down the wrong embassies I feel it is my duty to extend an understanding hand of internationalist pragmatism to try to bring disparate, mutually suspicious groups of people together and elimante the suspicion and rancour over tiny issues which divides us. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to expelling a different, semi-liquid issue I have into an old sock, whilst concentrating on a digitised picture of (a pre-cancerous) Kylie Minogue.</p>
<p>As for the self-righteous Wiki-Napoleons, to quote Mr Reggie Noble; fuck all y'all. I expect Ruth has decomposing lint jammed under her big toe with infinitely more clue of what this Wiki-business is all about than you tossers. Read, mark and learn John BCEE'äs entry with as much attention as you would pay a UNIX manual or a 24 hour Transformer marathon. ONly then can you save yourselves FROM yourselves.</p>

<p>Clearly non-notable, highly subjective, has potential copyright problems, has no substantial content beyond the list, and is extremely time-sensitive.

<li><b>Merge</b> I'm changing my vote to merge. Look above this one a few spaces and you'll see a similar vote for VH1's 100 best songs, i'd say if that list stays the maxim one should as well. Just because its not a music magazine doesn't mean there aren't people qualified to judge music who are employed. I'd say put this on the maxim page, as a link to the actual article.

<dd>"trumps all" seesm to asume some kind of points scoring thing, which doesn't interest me.

<dd>It's not a points scoring thing; my meaning is that exclaiming "but it's obscure and needs to be kept" is overridden by the fact that Wikipedia is meant to be an encyclopedia. Content must be verifiable, and if you're drawing on personal knowledge it still requires sources. If I was to write an article about <a href="http://uncyclopedia.org/wiki/kitten_huffing" class="extiw" title="uncyclopedia:kitten_huffing">kitten huffing</a> drawing from my experience in underground world of kitten-dealing, I'd still have to show that there was a primary or secondary source supporting it.

<li>See beyond the few hundred Google hits here. The term appears only to be used in humourous reference, and without any consistent reference (or any particular humour, but anyway).

I can't see the use of an article about a humorous, but meaningless idiom nor one about what the 4th law definitely isn't.

<p>Delete. Nonnotable bookstore. <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakowill_e6fb.html" title="User:Wakowill">Leppy</a> 02:46, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hi <a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakowill_e6fb.html" title="User:Wakowill">Leppy</a>, Thanks for asking for my feedback on <i>Midnight Special</i>. I'd say that the decision to keep or delete depends upon the overall goals of the Wikipedia's page on <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_bookstore.html" title="Independent bookstore">Independent bookstores</a></i>. It was one of Los Angeles' most notable independent bookstores before its closing which is why I added it to the page. If, however, it makes more sense to simply list the name on the <i><a href="../../../i/n/d/Independent_bookstore.html" title="Independent bookstore">Independent bookstore</a></i> page without a Wikilink, go ahead and do that. I'll leave it up to a general vote. -- Classicfilms</p>
<p>If there really is something that makes it notable beyond just being on that list, then I'd like to see it. I do think that a lot of people in wikiland are too quick to suggest delete on articles that they don't see the use of. I'd not like to be one of those people, so if there is more to it, let's see it. Expand the article to give the significance of the Midnight Special.<a href="../../../w/a/k/User%7EWakowill_e6fb.html" title="User:Wakowill">Leppy</a> 04:56, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In keeping complient with the GFDL, We cannot simply copy and paste the article. We have to do a move, then an admin can delete the scatalogical edits before my total rewrite.

<li><b>Comment</b> I copied this from the policy guide on moving pages: <i>The "move page" function keeps the entire edit history of the page, before and after the move, in one place, as if the page were always named that way. So, you should never just move a page by cutting all the text out of one page, and pasting it into a new one; old revisions, notes, and attributions are much harder to keep track of if you do that.</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Penang is one of my favourite places in the world to visit, and it is nice that there is a site where public events in Penang can be announced. However, this article is nothing more than a click-through add for said site, which doesn't appear notable and certainly doesn't merit an encyclopedia entry. <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">Ergot</a> 20:13, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Come now, sir. You're allowed to do whatever you want.

<li><b>Comment</b> After reading Capitalistroadster's input on the matter, I agree with him; this band does not meet the guidelines now, but they may in the future. For the record, this band's producer Brad Wood co-produced a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Smashing_Pumpkins_a913.html" title="The Smashing Pumpkins">Smashing Pumpkins</a> album and produced several <a href="../../../p/l/a/Placebo_%28band%29.html" title="Placebo (band)">Placebo</a> albums (<a href="http://www.chartwatch.co.uk/TopTen/producers/pro457.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chartwatch.co.uk/TopTen/producers/pro457.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>). Edison Glass toured with <a href="../../../r/o/p/Roper_%28band%29.html" title="Roper (band)">Roper</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_O.C._Supertones_e44a.html" title="The O.C. Supertones">The O.C.

Also, their cd "A Burn or a Shiver" will be released in April in many major electronics stores in the U.S. (<a href="../../../b/e/s/Best_Buy_c40e.html" title="Best Buy">Best Buy</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circuit_City_a200.html" title="Circuit City">Circuit City</a>, etc.) I do not know if this makes the band "notable" or not, but at the very least it gives the band the definite potential to deserve an article on Wikipedia. Therefore, you may delete this article if you want; I'm guessing it's no trouble to start it up again once it meets the guidelines. In the meantime I will study these guidelines and then write this article again when appropriate. As a new Wikipedian I am still learning&#160;:-). <a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdGl_582c.html" title="User:EdGl">EdGl</a> 21:19, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hmm. If ever there was a concept that I should think Wikipedia should be making room for it is precisely this “ Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks”. This is not to defend the quality of the present entry/intended place holder and starting block – but I do think it argues for someone coming in and lend a helping hand at a time when I am up to my neck in survival tasks (all of which incidentally involve . . . self-organizing collaborative networks – click to <a href="http://www.ecoplan.org" class="external free" title="http://www.ecoplan.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecoplan.org</a> and its dozen or so focus programs to see how this works in the real world. . . warts and all).</p>
<p>I have to say that I am a bit surprised at the virulence, but above all disappointed at the stolid unanimity of this reaction. I would have anticipated in a place such as this more variety of response, more creativity So let me see if I can weigh in here with a thought or two which to my mind suggests that zapping this entry in process would be a bad move. I am incidentally pleased to have this opportunity, because I am a big believer in cognitive dissonance as a knowledge building tool. We try to use this in our own international work to welcome a purposeful, rich imbalance of views and positions within a shared forum, and then let them rip. And since we have a small example of this here, well let’s have a look.</p>
<p>For starters, I came to the House of Wikipedia a few months ago with both genuine curiously and real interests. As I rattled around in it over the last month or so, I been impressed by much of what I have seen and experienced, but also noted with some surprise quite a number of to my mind outstanding omissions – almost all of which in a broad area which I would characterize as “conceptual thinking about critical challenges of society and technology”. To the extent that there is not even an entry for this critical tool . . . or at least was not until earlier this afternoon in which I sat down to knock in a first cut which you will find of course at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>], which you may not like either&#160;;-). (BTW, don’t you find it a bit strange that something as important as this had not been at least opened up as an entry. Of course this is not quite fair, since the Wikipedia is still very new and since it is natural that you would set out at first in more charted waters. But hey, but here we are.)</p>
<p>We live in an era in which change and speed of change are more than ever and faster than ever metrics of our daily lives. And while much of the world is indifferent to this, there is a growing current of thinkers and doers who understand that new concepts, new ways of organizing our societies, daily lives and actions are critical to our collective well being. I can think of two good reasons why Wikipedia of all new institutions should recognize this underling reality. First, because you yourselves are an example of this very process of adaptation. And second, if you cannot gear up to handle these new categories of emergent trends, then you will show that you are stuck in the old model. Let me see if I can be more concrete for you.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a traditional “transition instrument” for just one moment which has had no problem finding its ay into these pages. Say [ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amherst_College</a> Amherst College]. There it is: grounded today in a physical and institutions structure, but in 1820 nothing more than an idea on the part of (mainly) a single person, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster" rel="nofollow">Noah Webster</a>], that what was going on at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" rel="nofollow">Harvard College</a> was somehow not good enough. A concept in 1820, bricks and motor (and hopefully a bit more) in 2006. Okay? The point that I am trying to make is that at one point a simple “concept” – not mind you a ‘research project’ – can gradually advance to the point where it becomes a or at least a potential “society shaping” phenomenon which is worthy of explicit note. Including in a place like the Wikipedia. Let’s move up a couple of notches in terms of abstraction.</p>
<p>Consider for example that of [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development" rel="nofollow">sustainable development</a>], a phrase in a report in the late 1980’s and even to this day a concept which is not at all well understanding (nor, sadly, particularly effective as a policy molding or even informing device). And yet, here it is – not very profound but workmanlike and probably as good as the concept itself deserves.</p>
<p>Let me take this even closer to the bone and draw to your attention the new (and still very much in process ) entry on [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transportation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transportation" rel="nofollow">sustainable transportation</a>] . Neither of these two concepts have bricks and mortar to prove to the world that they do indeed exist, but there they are and at least in this latter case that are in fact actively informing public policy, if not in every administration that might come to your minds at least in enough places for them to be considered useful and usefully evolving shaping concepts.</p>
<p>So, if all this of this true – and I can see a number of people who might already be asleep on this one – what about the present and admittedly weak and, yes!, badly in need of work entry on Self-Organizing Collaborative Networks? Is it subject for the virtual dustbin to which the six of you are consigning it. I think you are wrong friends, because this is one of the most important operational concepts around that is as yet poorly understood but nonetheless going to take on better definition and with it increased importance in the ways in which we organize ourselves for a better world. And part of this process of definition is indeed its presence in Wikipedia which is increasingly a first- stop shop for anyone who wants to know what is up in the world we live in.</p>
<p>If this don’t work – and since we know the underlying concept to be as hard as steel -- we can always take solace in the words of Max Planck when it comes to how scientific truths must sometimes make their way:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Oh yeah. My vote: Keep it and help make it better. <a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EEricbritton_6191.html" title="User:Ericbritton">ericbritton</a> 16:19, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Eric, Wikipedia is not a blog nor a place at which to publish vague articles on pop phenomena. There are plenty of other places for this kind of creative output: wikis such as "everything2", refereed journals such as "first monday", or personal web pages. This article is no more appropriate than it would be to have allowed Eric Raymond to first publish his "Homesteading the Noosphere" essay here.

<li><b>Comment</b>:1. Fixed spelling error. 2. Don't merge.

<p>The "Commission" which is the topic of this page is not notable and does not rise to Wikipedia's standard for acceptability. This "commission" has no more credibility than a mock trial conducted in a law school class, or even in a high school social studies class.</p>
<p>The "indictments" hold no weight, and the supposed court has no jurisdiction to act on its "findings"</p>
<p>Many of the criticisms mentioned in the article are already raised in their respective articles about the specific issues.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the article is filled with original research that is not cited.</p>

<li>In the nn artical, it says something about having over 5,000 users. I have evidence of numbers over the last 12 months. SGCSim.com has 1,003 downloads. Original release on SG1files.com has 4,304 downloads, and the latest release on SG1files.com has 11,501 downloads. Thats a total of 16,808 downloads. And that is only over the last 12 months maximum. Every time the SGCSim.com website gets erased (has happened from various hosts), the number count is reset there. Last time that happened was June 2005. The counts from SG1files.com are starting from April 2005. I would safely estimate at least twice of what we have evidence for. And this doesn't include versions before v5.0.2, as there were no recorded counts for them. (v1, v2, v3, and v4.1). We should at least <b>Merge</b> the two articals. <a href="../../../t/p/g/User%7ETpg1989_4e5b.html" title="User:Tpg1989">tpg1989</a> 23:17, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The number I gave you was for the current version, 5.0.2, and its not even for all the downloads of that version. On SG1files.com, it was released there as 5.0.2, and then re-released with a tiny change. Users were advised that if they had already downloaded it that there was no need to download the other one. It is 16,808 recorded downloads for version 5.0.2. Numbers were not recorded before 2005, and previous versions of the sim have been around from at least 2002. <a href="../../../t/p/g/User%7ETpg1989_4e5b.html" title="User:Tpg1989">tpg1989</a> 06:09, 4 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: google for "palaeoxylological" for a change, to keep the mirrors out. It's certainly a valid, existing term, being used in titles of a few academic papers, though not terribly frequent. That it means what the article says it means seems clear (Greek "palaeo" and "xylon" 'wood'). Whether we can get enough material about it for a Wikipedia (as opposed to Wiktionary) stub, I can't say. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../l/u/k/User_talk%7ELukasPietsch_bc2c.html" title="User talk:LukasPietsch">(T.</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_LukasPietsch_5671.html" title="Special:Emailuser/LukasPietsch">@)</a></sup></small> 11:57, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article was a decent stub before Brya moved the content to wiktionary (thereby removing its edit history from normal view on wikipedia) and replaced it with a wiktionary hyperlink. I suggest we reinstate the original version. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aecis_c56c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aecis"><sup>Mr.</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User_talk%7EAecis_6dc5.html" title="User talk:Aecis"><sup>Mojo</sup></a> <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_Userboxes_0d05.html" title="User:Aecis/Userboxes"><sup>risin'</sup></a> 12:00, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thanks for the idea, Lukas. I hereby withdraw my request to delete it, but like to ask you all to decide whether we need the old stub here or move the entry on Wiktionary. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 12:18, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay the link to the word listcruft, an article you created, says it means:Obsolete, non-notable, or only of interest to a few. Well as this is a living language with existing TV channels obsolete doesn't apply. The language is apparently spoken by 70 million so it's not non-notable or "only a few" either.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd>That said it needs attention. After almost three years it has only three names two of them red links. If there actually are that few Marathi language channels this should perhaps, instead, become an article on Marathi language television.

<li><b>Comment:</b> This article is filled with what would potentially be considered trivial and "unencyclopedic" detail. (It is not necessary to know the band's every move is it?). Were this to be removed the "encyclopedic" content would probably be speediable. I nominated this after about half an hour of digging through Wikipedia and Google. I have a concern that many (if not all) of the wikilinks in this article are to articles that themselves may be candidates for deletion. The entire structure of <i>bands → artists who've played in them → other bands the artists have played in</i> seems to be holding itself up by <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootstrapping.html" title="Bootstrapping">bootstrapping</a>. I've chosen to nominate this one article to "test the waters" as it were (don't want to violate <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>). However, if anyone else thinks it is justified, please include several of the other articles as well. <a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid">Zunaid</a> 12:29, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If I recall, the autobiolgraphical policy is called a "soft" policy, whatever that means.

His edits and page remain, I think, no? The facts, docs and verifications I posted will read the same whether as publisher, I posted them with a biased relish or with bored aloofness. --Candace. I also quote "Largevelho" from the talk page:

<dd>--Lagarvelho 19:50, 2 February 2006)"I think this article should be kept in Wikipedia. Why? Fink may not be a "well-known" person, but he is well known among musicians and musicologists, and has done important work in the field of the origins of music. Whether one agrees or disagrees with his conclusions about this subject is another question, and whatever his political views, they are more or less irrelevant to his views on the earliest music and instruments."</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Really, Tearlach, you should try to quote in context. First of all, the key words in the quote which you claim is "completely untrue" are: "among the first" and "by itself." Also check the webpage announcing the program (which was nominated by <i>Discover</i> magazine for one of its contests in 1997 -- we have their letter). The <a href="http://www.greenwych.ca/serend4.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.greenwych.ca/serend4.htm" rel="nofollow">webpage</a> says: "This MAY be the world's first..." and further down, Fink mentions <i>earlier programs than his</i> that combined snippets from existing music, but that his program works from scratch, and Fink is then quoted: "I THINK I was AMONG the first to develop such a program," that writes melodies <i>by itself</i>. Taking all comments together hardly qualifies your claim it is "completely untrue. Are you <i>looking for flaws and faults</i> rather than making serious arguments? I hope not.

<li><b>Keep</b> This page should be kept. Whether or not the Divje Babe object is a flute, the article represents the point of view, not only of fink, but of a number of other experts.

<li><b>Delete</b> The article is interesting and certainly not offensive, but it appears to be written by Mr. Fink himself for the purpose of promoting his ideas and his publications, and thus to fall into the vanity category. I have not read these publications and have no opinion on their validity, but I note that many appear to have been self-published (Greenwych or Greenwich Publishers). We therefore have no idea if they underwent any sort of critical peer review, as all scholarly materials in conventional journals and books do. There are references elsewhere in Wikipedia to some of Mr Fink's ideas, and links to his personal website. <i>Douglas Smith</i> - <i>unsigned comment by new editor 71.141.121.176 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.141.121.176_a51f.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.141.121.176">contribs</a>)</i>

<p>Article about a band that altough doesn't seem notable itself has members from previous bands that may or may not be notable (they all need checking - I haven't done this).

<p><b>Please Retain</b>The LaVoz article is not a 'press report.' It is an opinion from a guy who apparently does sceptical and contrarian editorials, and seemingly wants to argue with the Encyclopedia Britannica references on the town. This Wikipedia article discusses the clan, not the town: Except for peripheral comments it is not a 'delirious history' of the area as his editorial claims. Legendary or oral history matters are clearly marked, which the editorial implies are not; and give relevant context to how clan members approach problems. The rest is well referenced, speaks for itself, is not disputed in the editorial, and contradicts the editorial's implications.</p>

<p>Killing a list because of the "potential" of being a POV war suggests caution which in the end depends upon who join in on ths vfd i suppose.

The article as it stands now doesn't contain very much information, but as others find the entry they can add more. The subject of the article has been told about the existence of this article, and she may very well have something to add to it. If there turns out to not be a need for this article, and no new information has been added for some time, then the article can always be deleted later. What does it hurt to keep it at this point, and just find out if there is a demand for it? Rainnede 18:16, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> although it needs attention. And although having a blog per se does not automatically connote notability, the fact that said blog - 1) is featured in AP, Yahoo News and Gawker 2) deals with a unique subject matter (life of a female new york taxi driver) 3) has received a lot of positive feedback from people in geographically diverse locations like New York, Texas, UK, Australia - means that it is notable.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Blogs, even popular blogs, have a tough hurdle to pass to claim notability because anyone can set one up and advertise one, and fleeting media interest isn't enough to assert lasting notability. —<a href="../../../c/l/e/User%7ECleared_as_filed_a7db.html" title="User:Cleared as filed">Cleared as filed.</a> 19:17, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b>The article doesn't need to be deleted, just expanded to include more information relevant to this particular company. It's definitely not an advertisement, as it's in NPOV, is verifiable and contains some original research. It just doesn't contain enough original research. I added this page to give people some information about one of <a href="../../../o/m/n/Omnicom_Group_47e4.html" title="Omnicom Group">Omnicom Group</a>'s companies, and that is all it does. It does not "[emphasize] desirable qualities so as to arouse a desire to buy or patronize", as is the <a href="http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;va=advertising" class="external text" title="http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;va=advertising" rel="nofollow">definition of advertising</a>. It only gives information on a company, like hundreds of other company stubs and company pages on Wikipedia.

<li>Alexa rank alone do not justify an article. Most hits on Google news are from searchenginewatch or SEO-related blogs, and can't be justifed as a reason to keep the article.

The <a href="../../../t/e/m/Temple_of_Castor_and_Pollux_5037.html" title="Temple of Castor and Pollux">Temple of Castor and Pollux</a> seems to be in <a href="../../../r/o/m/Rome.html" title="Rome">Rome</a>, not <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sicily.html" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. Moreover, it seems strange that an explorer would "discover" it so late in history. I could find no reference to "Henry Peters" in any database I checked. I withdraw my objection to deletion, although suggest it would be better as an AfD, in case I missed something. I will add a hoax tag as well. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 02:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I did not tag for speedy deletion. That was done by the anon ip 82.54.167.161 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.54.167.161_4bec.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.54.167.161">contribs</a>), see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peters&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37776334" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Peters&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=37776334" rel="nofollow">this edit</a>. I was investigating the article when it was tagged for speedy and wanted to figure out what was going on before deletion. I put on the hangon tag and think this is the appropriate place. I am open to further investigation revealing this guy is real, but I don't see it. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 18:20, 2 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> User:86.128.100.73 (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_86.128.100.73_29a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/86.128.100.73">contribs</a>) just posted a reference to "The Concise Dictionary of 16th Century Archaeologists (1852)." This book is not mentioned in OLCL (a worldwide catalogue of books), the US Library of Congress, Google or Google Scholar, Historical Abstracts (a subscription service), or Oxford University Library. It is impossible to rule out that this book exists, of course, but if this is the only source for verifiability, I think it is safe to say it is unverifiable. Particularly since the book (if it is indeed the source) got the location of the Temple of Castor and Pollux wrong, it would seem to be unreliable. --<a href="../../../h/a/n/User%7EHansnesse_9523.html" title="User:Hansnesse">Hansnesse</a> 01:24, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I disagree entirely with that statement malcolm. Psycho rambling is something that i have been doing with my Venture Scouts for some years now. The older ones (over 18) are the only ones i allow to do it without permission, but myself, i enjoy it thouroughly. It is running down a hill with a rucksack. Not a type of writing. Maybe its just not well known across the water in old Yankee land.

<dd>Ah yes, and the ship type has exactly three ships, the same as the class. Don't you think it's a bit nit-picking to make a distinction here?

<dd>Why would you want one article about one specific nickname and one about everything else?
<dl>
<dd>The nickname represents an interesting phenomenon, which it can be argued is worhy of an article to discuss. I would tend to agree, given the term's unique presence in naval history. However, it doesn't mitigate the need for the correct class article <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutschland_class_cruiser.html" title="Deutschland class cruiser">Deutschland class cruiser</a>. 20:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The nickname is not worth more than a paragraph.</dd>
<dd>I don't mind what the article is called. At the moment, <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_battleship.html" title="Pocket battleship">pocket battleship</a> is a superset of <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutschland_class_cruiser.html" title="Deutschland class cruiser">Deutschland class cruiser</a>; the latter is simply redundant. --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>The reason I submit my proposals to CfD or AfD is not to 'please the rule fanboys', but instead because I am not the only one with ideas on how to do things, and my ideas aren't always the best. This is especially true when dealing with subjects that aren't central to my own knowledge, but even on those I consider to be my forte it is helpful to get other's views. Intentionally making edits to circumvent the CfD/AfD process, especially when a vote like this has expressed that there is no concensus for what you are doing, is grounds I believe for administrative action. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshbaumgartner_efca.html" title="User:Joshbaumgartner">Josh</a> 20:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So watch me not doing it until this is over. After that, however, I will start a new discussion on the two pages. And I really don't think that removing redundant information is grounds for administrative action. (To give you a head start: Please provide a list of information that is in <a href="../../../d/e/u/Deutschland_class_cruiser.html" title="Deutschland class cruiser">Deutschland class cruiser</a> but not in <a href="../../../p/o/c/Pocket_battleship.html" title="Pocket battleship">pocket battleship</a>.) --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></dd>
<dd>To qualify that: I know that rule are required, I only think rules work against Wikipedia in this case. The article is completely and completely obviously useless (so far no reason was given why it should exist), and I think work directly on the articles would have shown that in a much simpler way than this AfD. --<a href="../../../y/o/o/User%7EYooden_5685.html" title="User:Yooden">Yooden</a></dd>

<dl>
<dd>RJH did say 'superset' not 'subset'. 'Pocket battleship' is a moniker applied by the British to the <i>Deutschland</i> as a counter to the German moniker of <i>Panzerschiffe</i>. The name could well apply to not only the <i>Deutschland</i> class, but also could apply to other similar German designs such as 'Cruiser P' and other designs that were not produced. None-the-less 'pocket battleship' is not strictly limited to the <i>Deutschland</i> even though in practice, it was the only class to actually be built that was called such. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshbaumgartner_efca.html" title="User:Joshbaumgartner">Josh</a> 20:21, 5 February 2006 (UTC)

I ask that you do not delete this article because the student who posted the remarks is been reprimanded by my college. I started this article to try and encourage other societies in other colleges to meet up and become more active. I also hoped that other people from around the world would see it and get inspired. please also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing#Clubs_and_Societies" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakdancing#Clubs_and_Societies" rel="nofollow">Breakdancing-Clubs and Societies</a> this is allowing people to grow and find more about other groups.

<p>Non-notable web developer. Only assertion to notability is that he is "recognized as one of the advocates of Web Usability and Standards in the Philippines," hardly persuasive since that's not exactly a notable position to advocate and there's no evidence of who recognizes him as such an advocate.
