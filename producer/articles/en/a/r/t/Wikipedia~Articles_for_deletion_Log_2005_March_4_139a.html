<li><b>Keep</b>. In general have we not kept Pokémon and the human characters in the series? Also what is up with emphasizing <i>fictional</i> gym instructor? If there are there any <i>real</i> Pokémon gym instructors I would like to see some articles about them. (Actually I do not like the Pokémon at all, but I accept that that universe is large and that articles about characters in it should stay.) <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:25, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Thank you Sjakkalle for your comments. In your own opinion, is there no bar of notability which needs to be met within the make believe universe of Pokémon for purposes of inclusion? How is it that articles about characters in a fictional universe should be kept, while real characters and locations here on Earth are not? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 17:21, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That argument makes very little sense. Fictional characters become part of culture, and are usually not comparible with their real-world contemporaries on notability grounds. Mario is a fictional plumber, and is notable as a part of culture, while no real-life plumbers are equally notable. Oliver Twist is a fictional street urchin, and I don't see a whole lot of real-life street urchins with articles. The point is that things are rarely any less notable due to being fictional. Brawly is apparently a gym teacher. Is Pokemon a work of great artistic triumph for the ages? Who cares? Thousands if not millions of people are familiar with this character, which puts him above most (all?) of the real-life gym teachers out there. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 17:56, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Just so I have this straight; you're asserting that a gym teacher from Pokémon is important above most (if not all) gym instructors in real life, while at the same time implying that <i>my</i> argument does not make sense? GRider\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 18:02, 9 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Absolutely. Let's look at some facts (keep in mind I'm not a pokemon fan, but I do know a fair amount about video games) Brawly appears in a GB game Pokemon Ruby / Sapphire, which sold <b>4 million copies <i>during their first six weeks on sale</i> in Japan alone <i>as well as the GBA FireRed/LeafGreen, which broke 1 million copies in its first 21 days of release in the USA. I can't find a single figure of how many of these games were sold total worldwide, but I'd say that</i></b> <i>10 million'</i> would be a conservative estimate. I also am not sure whether he has appeared in other games. I'd assume so, but let's move on. He's also appeared on the Pokemon TV series, which is very, very popular. I found one ratings source saying 5 million viewers in the US. Assuming it's at least roughly as popular in Japan (a safe bet) that's a further 10 million exposures, to say nothing of the rest of the world, reruns, etc (oh, and he's also been made into a toy). By even the most conservative guesses, I'd say that at least 20 million people worldwide are familar with this character. Now, really, in all seriousness, how many real-life gym teachers can that be said about? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 18:51, Mar 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I see it as indicative of systemic bias. If this were a character from an obscure sci-fi novel, we'd be falling all over ourselves to keep it. But a ludicrously popular cartoon, especially one of non-US origin, that has to go. I'm no Pokemon fan myself, but it seems pretty much impossible to deny that it's a major part of modern popular culture. On Google, for example, Pokemon gets about twice as many hits as "Mickey Mouse", "Charlie Brown", and "Bugs Bunny" <b>combined</b>! And that's not even counting Japanese-language references! <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:06, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Merge/redirect.</b> Even obscure characters from sci-fi novels get merged into single pages. (eg <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_characters_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_a4b6.html" title="Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy">Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>) The same rule should apply to cartoons too. This isn't "systemic bias"; it's just a single rule being consistantly applied. Miss Pippa 09:34, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the rules being consistently applied to one group of articles are not being consistently applied to a different set of articles, would you not argue that in reality, the rules are not being "consistently applied" at all?

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 6 clear "delete" votes, 4 "keep" votes (one of whom based his/her vote on an invalid logical premise), 5 "merge" votes and 3 "abstain" votes. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to keep for now.</p>

<li>I'd like to see evidence that this language is spoken in <i>any</i> countries, or indeed that it is spoken <i>at all</i>.

There is plenty of evidence that Esperanto is both written and spoken, with societies of speakers in many countries; web pages, dictionaries, and real books written and published in the language; U.N. recognition; moves to make it the official language of various places; and the sorts of bleed-through that are exemplified at <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto_in_English-language_media_1f84.html" title="Esperanto in English-language media">Esperanto in English-language media</a>. There is <i>none</i> of this for Romanica. I pointed at the WikiProject so that you would see the bare lists of electronic mail mailboxes therein and the cross-references to Yahoo! Groups!

Shortly after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_nedry&amp;oldid=10751884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_nedry&amp;oldid=10751884" rel="nofollow">original article at Denis nedry</a> was vfd'd, it was redirected to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Nedry_5a3a.html" title="Dennis Nedry">Dennis Nedry</a>. The latter then had the {{vfd}} template applied, and the discussion pointed here. Since at no point in <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Nedry_5a3a.html" title="Dennis Nedry">Dennis Nedry</a>'s history does any of the text from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_nedry&amp;oldid=10751884" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denis_nedry&amp;oldid=10751884" rel="nofollow">Denis nedry</a> appear, GFDL considerations do not apply. Furthermore, the redirect is both miscapitalized and misspelled, so is unlikely to be searched for, and exceedingly unlikely to be linked to.<br />

The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 4 clear "delete" votes and 3 variations on "keep" votes (evenly split between "keep as is" and "keep as merge" - yes, I know it's hard to evenly split an odd number of votes). One "keep" vote by a relatively new user somewhat discounted. Failing to reach a clear concensus to delete, the decision defaults to keep (in some form) for now.</p>
<p>Noting that there is a clear <i>majority</i> to delete and finding myself most persuaded by the "merge" arguments, I am going to exercise my discretion and call this one as a "merge and redirect". <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 05:32, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<ul>
<li>Because a series like the original <i>Star Trek</i> is notable enough to warrant it, and has people interested in doing it. Individual episodes of <i>ST:TOS</i> have been springboards for movies, countless novels, and megabytes of fanfic, and the topics of academic papers. If <i>Static Shock</i> turns out to be as influential as <i>ST:TOS</i>, it'll eventually get similar attention from a legion of fans. But this article was created by a single fan with (by his own description) <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asperger%27s_Syndrome_18a6.html" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a> who has since abandoned the project. The addition of commentary and behind-the-scenes info might make it a better article, but that seems rather unlikely when no one's even bothered to copyedit this synopsis, or even to write a synopsis of episode 2 (let alone 3-52). The series as a whole is notable, and I'm working on improving that article to reflect that; this episode by itself is not. <a href="../../../t/v/e/User%7ETverbeek_8569.html" title="User:Tverbeek">Tverbeek</a> 14:58, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sauna is a functional <a href="../../../l/o/a/Loanword.html" title="Loanword">loanword</a> to English, used also for non-Finnish saunas. Sisu is only a citate-borrowing used when referring to things Finnish. That's a huge difference.

<li><b>Delete</b>, likely hoax. Google on "Scott Donner" shows only this Wikipedia article; Google News on "Scott Donner" only shows postings in 1999 by a single user "pred@altavista.net". Similarly, Google News search on "Freedom Storehouse Press" shows only limited entries, some by "pred" himself. Significantly, <b>none of these Google News postings predate 1999</b>, although Usenet News was very actively used as early as the mid-1980s and very few topics were off limits in certain newsgroups like alt.tasteless and alt.sex.* and others. This seems like some guy doing self-promotion and inventing an "underground" legend and history for his 1999 Usenet posting. If some bona fide references could be provided that this underground book actually existed prior to the 1999 Usenet posting, and that it was actually noteworthy in some way (discussed in mainstream media even if only to strongly condemn it, or Congressional hearings or an FBI investigation or a blacklist somewhere), then it might be valid to keep. But a 1999 Usenet posting that didn't seem to generate any discussion on Usenet, either then or now ... that's not notable. There were only 3 responses to "Condor"'s Feb 2005 Usenet posting, nobody on Usenet speaking up to say they ever heard of or saw such a book in the 1980s. The burden of proof of notability, and non-hoax status of the alleged 1980s "legendary underground" hardcopy book, is on the original contributor. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 03:33, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>These are post-1999 references, and they're posted by "Freedom Storehouse Press" itself, the publisher, which is likely some one-or-two person operation. Seems like self-promotion. I'm not disputing that "Lolita Method" may have been posted to Usenet, but lots of things of every description were posted to Usenet, including material even more controversial than this. The claim to noteworthiness would seem to rest on the alleged factual existence of a notorious underground hardcopy book circulating in the 1980s; but this claim would seem to be a hoax invented at the time of the original Usenet posting. In other words, it seems that the original publication of the material was on Usenet and the legend of an underground hardcopy book was likely invented in that posting itself. Or at least that a hardcopy version was not widely known or circulated. If there really was a noteworthy and notorious book in circulation, it would have left some trace or evidence of its existence... the Moral Majority or evangelical groups or Congressional hearings or children's advocacy groups, etc. etc. would have taken note of it and condemned it. Other equally unsavory topics like snuff films or satanic cults were certainly widely discussed and condemned in mainstream news media... why does there seem to be no trace whatsoever of this supposedly notorious and therefore noteworthy book prior to 1999, if it was widely circulated a decade earlier? <b>This seems to be a vanity article, or spam advertising self-promotion.</b> I'm willing to be persuaded otherwise if references can be provided for the actual existence and notoriety of a hardcopy book in the late 1980s and early 1990s. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 04:12, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As promised months ago, I am posting the first three chapters of my book, The Lolita Method: The Sure Fire Way to Pick Up "Forbidden" Girls. This ends Part 1 of the book. I will be posting the next sections as I re-edit and re-format them. Eventually, the entire text of The Lolita Method will be posted here on alt.tasteless. It will then be archived on Jaydog's alt.tasteless archive -- <a href="http://www.aracnet.com/~jaydog­/" class="external free" title="http://www.aracnet.com/~jaydog­/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aracnet.com/~jaydog­/</a> -- if he's willing.</dd>
<dd>The original first edition of The Lolita Method was written and published by Freedom Storehouse Press in 1989, with a second edition printed in 1991. I have since revised and updated the text. The book was co-written with a friend of mine who has given me permission to revise and post it. At the time I wrote this, I was not PRED. I was just a humble public school teacher with a dream.</dd>
<dd>I left teaching and a failed first marriage soon after I completed the first draft of The Lolita Method, relocating to New York City. There I met a host of underground writers in the 'zine world. I showed one of them my manuscript for The Lolita Method, and he turned me on to Freedom Storehouse Press. They printed and published the book, and it was distributed under the counter in porno shops and headshops.</dd>
<dd>Anyone who has a copy of the first or second edition has a real collector's item. I've been looking for an extra copy for the last couple months now, but no luck so far. If you have one, put it up on e-bay. I've had an offer of $100 for the book, which is amusing because it was printed on cheap paper with a staple binding.</dd>
<dd>Well, that's enough reminiscing for one day. Enjoy ..</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Good sleuthing on the Lolita Method article.

They claim to have met Pred through <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>. And I was about to say that proves it was later than <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>, but looking at the Wikipedia Usenet article, I see that Usenet was created in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1980.html" title="1980">1980</a>. But here we seemingly have the smoking gun:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><i>Although PRED takes frequent hiatuses from writing and posting to ASS, even during his absence his presence looms over the group like an omnipresent storm cloud on the horizon. When Todd, Gary and Sean first stumbled upon ASS in the Fall of <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, PRED had been retired from the newsgroup for over a year. Yet, frequent mentions and allusions to his work prompted the trio to investigate his writings. The resulting study would forever change the three partners’ business plans while simultaneously giving birth to the concept and reality of Freedom Storehouse Press.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>After reading the body of PRED’s work, the trio’s mission became clear. Contact PRED and solicit his involvement in a website devoted to the promotion of ultracore fiction.</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><i>Reaching PRED was simple enough. His email address appears at the beginning and end of each of his posts. By the time Todd sent out the first email query to PRED, all three partners had done an extensive as well as intensive Google search on PRED. They were now intimately familiar with almost every story, commentary and flame he had ever posted. They also knew he had officially retired from ASS a year earlier, and this time he appeared serious.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Etc., etc. From the first paragraph, it appears obvious that Pred's relationship with them began in Fall <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>. Yet - on Google groups, Pred's post of Nov 23, <a href="../../../1/9/9/1999.html" title="1999">1999</a> states that Freedom Storehouse Press published his book in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>. Why would he have written about them in 1999 if they did not contact him until 2001? Ah, the plot thickens! There is some sort of contradiction here. Well, I thought I had solved this mystery, but now it appears it may never be solved. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERad_Racer_55af.html" title="User:Rad Racer">Rad Racer</a> 06:26, 14 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>There are, near as I can tell, nearly 42,000 ZIP Codes in the US, plus however many APO/FPO ZIP Codes there are for overseas postings. I question the point, purpose, and/or expenditure of resources for such a list. This appears to have been considered for deletion last April, but I can't find any archive of the discussion: I hope I'm not reinventing the wheel here.</p>
<p>See also the sublists for the states on the same page, which also deserve the axe.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> a description of the organizational scheme and the neat map are already in the actually encyclopedic <a href="../../../z/i/p/Zip_code.html" title="Zip code">Zip code</a> article that this list links from.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete all</b>. Not useful unless they're correct, which is unlikely to remain true, and complete, which they aren't. Zip codes change at the rate of two or three per year per three-digit area; even postal workers (which I was for a few years) have a hard time remembering them. A listing by three-digit prefixes would at least be maintainable, and would probably fit onto a single page besides. The need for full five- and nine-digit zip lookups can be satisfied by <a href="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp" class="external text" title="http://zip4.usps.com/zip4/welcome.jsp" rel="nofollow">a link to the USPS</a>. —<a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorath_83d6.html" title="User:Korath">Korath</a> (<a href="../../../k/o/r/User_talk%7EKorath_cda5.html" title="User talk:Korath">Talk</a>) 07:41, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><i>So you wish to delete its subpages too?</i> Of course. They're equally as useless as the main list. And how exactly are these lists useful? "Hmm, I wonder where ZIP Code 94595 is? I know! I'll look it up on Wikipedia!" And the map? It's the one from <a href="../../../z/i/p/ZIP_Code_3179.html" title="ZIP Code">ZIP Code</a>, so it's not going anywhere if this list bites the dust. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 08:31, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What about the idea of keeping it as a fairly harmless way for people to find Wikipedia? There *must* be a lot of people who have searched for zip codes on google or something, and found the article. I'd like to see it completly cross-indexed with the town/city pages, by the way. Yes, I do have something of an interest in these; I created the Wyoming zip codes page. <a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhymeless_6a19.html" title="User:Rhymeless">Tim Rhymeless</a> <a href="../../../r/h/y/User_talk%7ERhymeless_4dd3.html" title="User talk:Rhymeless">(Er...let's shimmy)</a> 09:04, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Except that Google automatically returns a map of the zip code as its first entry when you search for a zip code. Trying to spam search engines (or even appearing to try to do so) isn't what Wikipedia is about...and it's not particularly difficult to run across us on Gooogle anyway. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 14:58, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Ah, I see some people are just determined to get rid of this list. Just an FYI—it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=1524610&amp;oldid=1523018" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_ZIP_Codes_in_the_United_States&amp;diff=1524610&amp;oldid=1523018" rel="nofollow">was already listed on VfD</a> in the past, and was kept (even though it contained much less information than it does now). As for moving it to WikiSource, I am afraid this is not going to work as the list was in fact moved here <b>from</b> WikiSource in the past. Then, as for the usefulness of the list—I fail to comprehend how it is <b>not</b> useful. I, in fact, thought of Wikipedia first when I needed to look a ZIP code up (a while ago), and I like this layout much better than whatever USPS can offer. Plus, when complete, the list is invaluable to those who need, for example, to know all of the ZIP codes in, say, a state. Good luck trying to find such a list on the USPS site. USPS works fine for one-time queries, but not when you need to get ZIP codes in bulk. Finally, as for keeping the list current, this is the same issue that can be applied to virtually any information that can be updated. I can take care of all Iowa ZIP codes, and undoubtedly there will be a person (or several) to keep the lists of codes for other states as well. To me, just because some of the sub-pages are incomplete is not a good enough reason to delete them (you wouldn't delete all of the exisiting stubs solely on the basis of their "incompleteness", would you). Sorry about the long rant, but I like this list and find it useful.—<a href="../../../e/z/h/User%7EEzhiki_e732.html" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (erinaceus europeaus)</a> 15:08, Mar 4, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Does anyone have a copy of the old VfD discussion? The question was raised back in 2003—many of the arguments (or Wikipedia itself) may have evolved significantly since then. (I don't think Google returned maps of zip codes back then, for example.) Finding bulk zip codes doesn't seem particularly difficult—Googling for <i>zip codes iowa</i> returns this site <a href="http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/zip_codes/IA.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mongabay.com/igapo/zip_codes/IA.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> as the third hit.

<li>The problem with googled bulk codes is that they are awfully outdated and incorrect.

<li><b>Delete</b>, for the original nominator's reasons. Look, people, I work for Claritas, a data house which works closely with the US Census Bureau. Census geographies change once a decade, unless a new county is formed or dissolved, but ZIP codes and their boundaries can change whenever an individual postmaster says so, anytime during any year. This list's information is neither permanent nor easily maintainable, and I don't think there's anything sufficiently encyclopedic about the topic that we need to include it. Even 90210 (used in the title of a TV series) or the ZIP code of midtown Washington, DC don't meet the notability bar for my tastes. The same applies to postal codes from elsewhere. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 18:52, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Might as well <b>delete</b> it. Maybe a shorter equivalent list, such as a List of USPS sectional centers and the regions they service, would be more acceptable here, as USPS sectional centers are denoted by just the first three digits of a ZIP code, meaning there are only a maximum of 1000 such entities, making the list much more manageable, and such information would be hard to search for on the Internet, even though it is possible to do so and it would, arguably, not count as original research. <font color="#BA0000">Denelson83</font> 02:43, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If someone had suggested to START this list, I'm not sure it would be worth the effort. But considering it is essentially complete and all that has to happen now is maintenance, it seems like a perfectly good resource of information. I find it very suiting that while attempting to find the best alternative to the wikipedia article in question, RickK above referenced a mirrored version of the same article-- I think that's saying something, don't you? As for why it should be deleted-- several above have claimed it is not unmaintainable, and this list does not match any of the points listed on "what wikipedia is not" as linked in the original complaint. <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Precedents_e2a3.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Precedents</a> has nothing on this really, but <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat%27s_in%2C_what%27s_out_7f38.html" title="Wikipedia:What's in, what's out">Wikipedia:What's in, what's out</a> has consensus for listing ALL geography and ALL demography items; while the article in question matches neither, it is somewhat a combination of the two, and so prior consensus seems to support keeping this article as well. --<a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVanchuck_4aca.html" title="User:Vanchuck">Vanchuck</a> 10:05, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

If there is a list of cities, why not a list of zip codes? If someone put up an article with a list of all phone book entries in the entire world, then I can understand deleting it, but I don't think a list of zip codes is necessarily too large of a list. I do suggest perhaps putting up a warning, that the information may not be up to date, and listing the date the page was last updated. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 05:47, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Final FYI to the admins: Most of what the article says is inaccurate. The special timing information that DVB adds to MPEG-2 data falls under a standard called DVB-MPEG. "ASI" describes only the electrical connection between a module that transmits or receives over a DVB network, and the device that uses that module. It is a feature of other standards, not a standard by itself. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> 08:07, 17 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. This one is legit. Though his morning show is relatively recent, he's a high-profile radio host in Los Angeles.

<li>Is the standard national syndication? International broadcasting? A book written about you? It seems to me that a prominant and influential media figure in a social center like Los Angeles (or New York, Chicago, London...) is far more notable than a large percentage of the people and concepts I see entries for in Wikipedia. And, nowadays, much local radio (including KABC) is accessible over the web, so it need not remain opaque to people outside the region. While it's a local job, the number of local hosts with similar credentials is small--"morning drive time" at the ABC flagship station in Los Angeles is pretty much the top of the pyramid as far as local radio goes. And, yes, if he is allowed, similarly credetialed folks should be as well, of course. I see that his principal competitor, <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Handel_f3c0.html" title="Bill Handel">Bill Handel</a>, is the subject of a stubby and poorly written article that should probably sink or swim with this one.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> and everyone else, I guess my main question is what the criteria should be on <i>local</i> broadcasters. Clearly, someone in the New York <a href="../../../d/e/s/Designated_market_area.html" title="Designated market area">designated market area</a> is more notable than one in Glendive. But where do you draw the line on the <a href="http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html" class="external text" title="http://www.nielsenmedia.com/DMAs.html" rel="nofollow">210 DMA's</a>? Do you even draw a line? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 23:02, 4 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<p>This must come up a lot-is there some written guideline about what the minimum requirements for "notability" are in wikipedia? I'm not sure what "verification" means in this context... the fact that the guy is on the air daily on a major station during peak hours is easy to verify (look at <a href="http://kabc.com/" class="external free" title="http://kabc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://kabc.com/</a>). But there's a larger question of what qualifies for a Wikipedia article. If the standards are the same as a print enyclopedia, then I would agree with deleting this--McIntyre is not a historic figure. But those don't seem to be the standards in practice. For example, the Marvel comic book title <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Avengers_81f8.html" title="The Avengers">The Avengers</a> has a listing. Is that particular title "notable"? Further, there are more that 50 separate articles for "members" of the Avengers. Are all of them notable? By those standards, large-market radio talk hosts seem prominent indeed. (And a quick search reveals many articles for smaller-market radio brodcasters, e.g. <a href="../../../t/o/d/Todd_Friel_39c3.html" title="Todd Friel">Todd Friel</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Lucia_e17b.html" title="Mary Lucia">Mary Lucia</a>, <a href="../../../e/d/_/Ed_Sciaky_79fa.html" title="Ed Sciaky">Ed Sciaky</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Wheat_7655.html" title="Mark Wheat">Mark Wheat</a>...) So I'm confused about what the relevant principals are for making this judgment. <a href="../../../b/t/f/User%7EBTfromLA_9257.html" title="User:BTfromLA">BTfromLA</a> 02:53, 5 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I apologise, after further investigation it would seem that these days the terms NIE and NIC are quite interchangeable, this had not been the case when I studied Economics. I would argue that industrialising and industrialised are different in that an article about NIE's would include discussion on how the economies change/industrialise, the concept if you will, while NIC would be giving cases where this has happened, However to avoid confusion I think it might be best to go with Kappa's suggestion - short def at <a href="../../../n/i/e/NIE_e965.html" title="NIE">NIE</a> and <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newly_industrialized_countries.html" title="Newly industrialized countries">NIC</a>.

<ul>
<li>Simpler, I would have thought, to <b>delete</b> and replace with redirect to <a href="../../../n/i/c/NIC_2200.html" title="NIC">NIC</a>, and add "also known as Newly Industrializing Economy" somewhere in the first paragraph of <a href="../../../n/i/c/NIC_2200.html" title="NIC">NIC</a>. <a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHowardB_42ca.html" title="User:HowardB">HowardB</a> 17:46, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I just think that it's a bit more complicated than that... the relationship is more that a "Newly Industrializing Economy / Country" becomes a "Newly Industrialized Economy / Countries". However I think the main problem is that the article at <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newly_industrialized_countries.html" title="Newly industrialized countries">NIC</a> is actually about Newly Industrial<b>izing</b> Countries rather than Newly Industrial<b>ized</b> Countries. However, realistically I don't know that anyone is going to correct this or that they even require seperate articles, especially given that both states are transitional. In my opinion the best situation would be if the two articles were merged under "Newly Industrial<b>izing</b> Economy" (or Country) and the fact mentioned that "Country" and "Economy" are interchangable (add redirects), as far as I'm aware NIE was the original OECD term, though if anyone knows better then please say so. What does anyone think of that suggestion? --</dd>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. I count 18 clear "delete" votes, 12 clear "keep" votes (2 anons and 1 probable troll discounted) and 2 "merge" votes. While there is a clear majority to delete, there is not the overwhelming concensus necessary for deletion. The decision defaults to keep in some form.</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: Interrail is not only a pass for travelling or <i>a kind of travel guide</i> , it is a travel culture of the european youth. Interrailing is the word synonimous for <i>traveling by train</i> or <i>doing a trip trought Europe</i>. Like <i>rent a car</i> or <i>using a bus for traveling</i>.

<li>So WikiTravel cannot accept articles from wikipedia? Ok then, that eliminates the possibility for transwiki. In that case I change my vote to <b>merge</b> with material from "Inter Rail", which I think may make a fair encyclopedic article. Of course, an outright deletion is not in order. My nomination was because travel guides are not appropriate for Wikipedia and at that time, the first entry on the "Problems that may require deletion" table on the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a> page provided listing on the vfd page as the appropriate remedy. I see now that this has now been changed from "not suitable for Wikipedia" to "no potential to become encyclopedic", and I would not have nominated this if this had been the text at that time. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 09:13, 7 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello again. I have made the following observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Wikitravel <i>already</i> has an Inter Rail article which is a lot larger than this one.</li>
<li>"Inter Rail", and not "Interrail" is the correct spelling.</li>
</ol>
<p>So merge is definitely still my vote, it should be merged into the article titled <a href="../../../i/n/t/Inter_Rail_cbb6.html" title="Inter Rail">Inter Rail</a>, "Interrail" being the <i>incorrect</i> spelling should probably be a redirect. I am sorry that I nominated this in the first place, I regret doing so. Of course the title clearly has <i>potential</i> to become encyclopedic. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> 16:07, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

The result of the debate was ambiguous. After a thorough review of the material, I agree that this is original research and should be removed from Wikipedia. While the article is well written, the first two-thirds of the article are rote recitations of standard theory. The hypothesis about music's effects are unsubstantiated by evidence. My personal reaction is that it appears that someone dropped their college paper into Wikipedia. Accordingly, I am going to exercise my discretion and decline to transwiki this into either Wikibooks or WikiSource. I will, however, have no objections if someone else does and have even left a note on the author's talk page offering to help him/her do so if asked. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 06:26, 22 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Are individual museums notable? Other than the Louvre and similarly famous institutes? This one has items from Roman excavations, but then again so do nearly all history museums.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Generally, I think that most museums are <i>probably</i> notable unless strong evidence to the contrary can be presented.

Some may remember <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immanuel_Velikovsky_1537.html" title="Immanuel Velikovsky">Immanuel Velikovsky</a>, a nutjob with who wrote a book or books in the 1950s, <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worlds_in_Collision_7485.html" title="Worlds in Collision">Worlds in Collision</a> being the title of one of them, full of cockamamie theories about how all sorts of BIblical miracles were explained by planets randomly knocking other planets to leave their orbits at the right time so that they could part the Red Sea, cause the Flood, etc. I think the manna from heaven that fed the Israelites in the wilderness was supposed to be edible hydrocarbons from a comet's tail or something. Anyway, he was scorned by the scientific establishment, in part because it was just felt that the universe didn't work that way. Geological events were the results of slow, continuous processes. Then Alvarez came along, and my first thought was "Wow! Velikovsky stuff!" Now we live in a world where all sorts of things are thought be caused by asteroids smacking into planets. There really has been a change in our world view. But such comments probably belong in <a href="../../../u/n/i/Uniformitarianism.html" title="Uniformitarianism">Uniformitarianism</a> and/or <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catastrophism.html" title="Catastrophism">Catastrophism</a> and should be cautious and well-sourced.

<li>A bit of explanation needed here, perhaps. Football Manager is a fantasy football (soccer) game. Whoever plays it plays as the manager of the team of their own chosing.

All 3 redirects are vulnerable. While Solana is necessary as common usage. I don't believe anyone is going to search for either Francisco Javier Solana or Francisco Javier Solana Madariaga. Neither of these terms are common use. The only reason they should be on wikipedia are if they are common usage, and Solana was set up by a legitimate source. Neither of these names would be on here were it not to facilitate vandalism. Leaving them here is purely an encouragement for the offender(s) to do it again. We can only speculate how many readers typed in Solana and unknowingly read and outdated and possibly doctored version.

<li><b>Delete</b> (proposer). It may be valid but it is unnecessary, and needs policing continuously. <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solana.html" title="Solana">Solana</a> was left in a vandalised state (fixed older version) without being noticed asnd reverted until I discovered it this morning. All 3 redirects are vulnerable. While Solana is necessary as common usage. I don't believe anyone is going to search for either Francisco Javier Solana or Francisco Javier Solana Madariaga. Neither of these terms are common use. The only reason they should be on wikipedia are if they are common usage, and Solana was set up by a legitimate source. Neither of these names would be on here were it not to facilitate vandalism. Leaving them here is purely an encouragement for the offender(s) to do it again. We can only speculate how many readers typed in Solana and unknowingly read and outdated and possibly doctored version. So I hope those who say keep these not common usage terms are always willing to police this. --<a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESqueakBox_f62d.html" title="User:SqueakBox">SqueakBox</a> 01:04, Mar 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dan, your, "straw man" statement and removal of tag does not hide the fact that your friends are extremely <b>non-notable</b>.

<li>Classicjupiter2, your saying this page is vanity is without any basis whatsoever. Why do you believe 63.164.145.161 to be a member of this group?

<li>Dan, why do you appear to be so worried over this article? How does this article being placed on VfD affect you? Why do you even care? Dan, please look at the facts. This is clearly a non-notable group, the article was created by an Anon who is a member of the group.
<ul>
<li>Again, what is your basis for this assertion? You have none. Therefore, this article should be removed from VfD until such time as an actual basis for listing it here is come up with. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_C._Boyer_a934.html" title="User:Daniel C.

<li>You have nothing to do with this group, so why do you care about the article being deleted?

<dd>I myself speedy-deleted it once before as a re-creation. However, there appear to have been multiple independent re-creations (if you look at the previously deleted versions, each has a fairly different wording and writing style), by people apparently unaware of the previous VfD's and speedy deletions. So I erred on the side of caution and renominated for VfD instead of speedying. In effect, this could be considered a Vote_for_undeletion, except with the twist that the article currently exists since someone re-created it. Plek makes an interesting point citing <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>...
