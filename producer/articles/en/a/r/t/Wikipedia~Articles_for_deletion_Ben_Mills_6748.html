<dd>My apologies.. what I meant to say, is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> addresses the issue more succinctly. To be notable, "It[he/she] has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent from the musician/ensemble itself and reliable. This criterion includes published works in all forms... except...publications where the musician/ensemble talks about themselves." The only source listed is an interview, thus that criteria for inclusion is not met. The only other one within <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> That has been brought up, is "Has won or placed in a major music competition," so it seems that this discussion ought to come down to either determining whether X-Factor is a "major" competition, and whether finishing third overall counts towards the intended spirit of "win or place." As for that, I must say I am now sitting on the fence. <a href="../../../e/c/h/User%7EEchuck215_5075.html" title="User:Echuck215">Charlie</a> 10:54, 21 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>For example: "He states his musical influences as Joe Cocker, Tom Waits, Rod Stewart and David Bowie and some of his favourite artists are Elvis Costello, Bruce Springsteen, Dire Straits, and James Brown. He classes Jim Morrison as a legend." This information is unsourced, and does not seem particularly pertinent, unless a third party source has expressed that these statements are notable in some way. This is also a particularly tricky issue, as we are now talking about the opinions of a living person in an article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Satisfies major music competition clause (as per above), precedent established by entries from previous series of the competition - eg Journey South - as well as entries from other similarly sized competitions - eg American Idol - see Chris Daughtry entry (4th place). Concerns noted by some discussants regarding citations/references easily rectifiable, traceable to notable and credible sources (as demonstrated by copious editing post-submission for deletion by entry convenors). As noted by previous discussant, artist currently popular in the UK and more notable than a number of soap celebrities which have their own entries and many people are interested in finding out more about him. Advocate strongly for retention as not only is entry justified by satisfaction of Wiki policy but also that precedents have been established for entries of this nature.

<li><b>Delete</b> NN, I agree Wikipedia is not the place for an article about someone who may or may not become famous. The appearance on the reality show alone is not enough. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidpdx_3baf.html" title="User:Davidpdx">Davidpdx</a> 09:06, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An album is currently in the pipeline and Ben is sufficiently famous in the UK. He recently performed with a line-up of the best British comedians and had a rousing response. If there is no record by the time the next season of the X Factor comes along, then the entry can always be removed but as stated earlier, precedents have been estbalished for this sort of entry. Journey South's entry was up long before their debut album was released in March this year for eg. Guptatiggs 09:40, 26 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, article has a fair assertion of notability, is moderately well written, and very well-referenced. It'd be nice if he continues to be written about, that the article could be expanded. But as it stands, the entry fulfils all policy requirements. <a href="../../../g/e/e/User%7EGeeJo_c589.html" title="User:GeeJo">GeeJo</a> <sup><a href="../../../g/e/e/User_talk%7EGeeJo_5052.html" title="User talk:GeeJo">(t)</a></sup>⁄<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GeeJo_9c2b.html" title="Special:Contributions/GeeJo">(c)</a></sub> <small>•&#160;17:04, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

Obviously, this can still be classified as a rumor, but since this news is just a few days old it would be worth waiting for verification. If it turns out to be false then can be nominated again.
