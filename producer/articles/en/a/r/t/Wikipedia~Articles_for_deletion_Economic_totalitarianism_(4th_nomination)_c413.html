<li><b>Delete</b>. The term never gained currency in the literature - it does not appear in the Citation Index.

<ul>
<li>Alternatively, <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economics_of_fascism.html" title="Economics of fascism">Economics of fascism</a>. The term unfortunately is thrown around in the blogosphere by libertarians such as <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_J._DiLorenzo_594e.html" title="Thomas J. DiLorenzo">DiLorenzo</a>, who compare government intervantion with the Fascist regimes of the 1930s. That article has a few paragraphs on Libertarian views; redirecting this will prevent the article from becoming an attraction for trolls and malcontents. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 17:31, 15 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The problem is that totalitarianism comprises both fascist and communist regimes, so it's not clear why this should redirect to only one variety. Redirecting to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> might make more sense, if there is actually something like a serious attempt at a definition that somehow bridges the gap between the two which we could then add to the article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete or merge to Friedman</b>. This <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a> is not notable and was used once. It has no <a href="../../../h/e/u/Heuristic.html" title="Heuristic">heuristic</a> intent but only an ideological one, and recovers no historical or political reality. It ignores the importance of <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporatism.html" title="Corporatism">corporatism</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autarky.html" title="Autarky">autarky</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/l/Militarism.html" title="Militarism">militarism</a> (notably the arms-race in the 1930's and agressive policies followed by fascist states) in <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>, and is a deviation of the already problematic (but certainly notable and scholarly) concept of totalitarianism, which is, by definition, both "political" and "economic". Furthermore, although attention has been brought to the article by the preceding AfD nominations, the case was closed without justification (or rather, an erroneous "copyvio" change), and nobody has improved the article other than making it a quote of Friedman. The reason is simple: there is nothing to back this uninteresting concept. <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 15:16, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>On 1. We don't have any definitions yet. Neither Friedman nor DiLorenzo provide definitions.</dd>
<dd>On 2. According to my research: "Even more important, the changing climate of American culture is increasingly the threat of some form of totalitarian control which make the existence of privately-controlled education extremely precarious. And the growth of this economic totalitariansim with its political concomitants makes the work of racial advancement both more difficult and more necessary." -- The Impact of the War Upon Privately-Controlled Colleges and Universities for Negroes, Buell G. Gallagher, The Journal of Negro Education &gt; Vol. 11, No. 3, Negro Higher Education in the War and Post-War Reconstruction (Jul., 1942), pp. 346-358. Also no definition.</dd>
<dd>On 3. Absent sources, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> Value of the term in pol econ = 0, as amply discussed. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 10:46, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>- How can you claim that the value = 0 if you have no sources to verify that claim&#160;?</dd>

<dd>If you look below you'll notice I've done rather extensive research on the term. For any term we consider encyclopedic, we should be able to establish the following: 1. provenance, 2. a trajectory of usage starting from the original, 3. a commonly understood formal or informal definition. See <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspicuous_consumption.html" title="Conspicuous consumption">conspicuous consumption</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creative_destruction.html" title="Creative destruction">creative destruction</a>, or <a href="../../../i/r/r/Irrational_exuberance_%28finance%29.html" title="Irrational exuberance (finance)">irrational exuberance (finance)</a> for typical examples of popular terms that have an economic origin (and not to forget, the <a href="../../../d/i/s/Dismal_science.html" title="Dismal science">Dismal science</a>). "Economic totalitarianism" has been used on a smattering of (disjointed) occasions by a number of people, but there is no evidence that any usage actually caught on to the point that if we say "economic totalitarianism" we mean it in the way Friedman or Gallagher have used it. I'm by no means opposed to putting popular economic terms into Wikipedia, but I'm opposed to putting paleoprotologisms here that have no definition, no agreed-upon meaning and no history of usage to speak of. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:17, 18 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Valid argument. On the other side, if I were to read Friedman and encounter the term, I might look it up on Wikipedia. It would be nice if I then would find your above argument, that although the term is being used, it has no real commonly accepted definition or meaning. This would help me in putting the hypothetical Friedman text in perspective. --<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucVerhelst_3fe1.html" title="User:LucVerhelst">LucVerhelst</a> 11:05, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Of course it differs from "'plain' totalitarianism". The problem is that scholars already have a not-so-easy time to define properly <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> (which circumstances of invention shouldn't be forgetted), and that "economic totalitarianism" is only a polemic, pejorative word which has no conceptual contents (i.e. it doesn't means anything). <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 18:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. If you're going to base an article concerning <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_sciences.html" title="Political sciences">political sciences</a> on quotes you find Googling, I really wonder why we pay teachers to teach political sciences and analysts to observe and conceptualize politics? I mean, why bother reading books when you can describe a concept which is apparently related to <a href="../../../t/o/t/Totalitarianism.html" title="Totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a> (in appearance only, IMO), on which thousands of pages have been written? If no one has any real knowledge of this concept, I don't think just Googling in quotes to "write an article" is a really serious solution. I do understand, however, that this provides some leisure time. But isn't leisure time best satisfied by simply reading and withstanding from contributing to a subject which only way of approach is "Googling it through"? <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 18:01, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment to Taz</b>: Theres a difference between amazon's search inside and ghits. The former can be used just like anyone else uses a book to make statements within an article while the later is test in notability. Search inside is an electronic representation of pages concerning the search. With this method, you can easily source a whole article as long as its notable. You might have noticed that I specifically stated "Amazon.com" and not "google", or you might think they or one in the same. Either way, the article can be expanded once a serious contributor wishes to take the time to expand. <a href="../../../s/y/n/User%7ESynergeticMaggot_5ec3.html" title="User:SynergeticMaggot">Zos</a> 18:25, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I feel we'd be better served with individual articles, including this one. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 18:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wonder if it's worth keeping a separate article for the ill-defined term. The situation feels somehow similar to Brown's gas. <i>Brown's Gas</i> is a stoichiometric hydrogen-oxygen mixture prepared through water electrolysis under certain conditions. Supposedly it gives more heat than expected, the extra energy usually being derived from the electrodes breaking up during preparation of the mixture. It's a favorite of the "free-energy crowd". Once can either track down the history of the idea in its incarnations, attempting to write an impartial account at Brown's gas on what is a fringe subject and trying to keep the article free of trolls, kooks, pseudoscientists and shady salesmen. The alternative would be to add a few paragraphs to the article on, say <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hydrogen.html" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> or <a href="../../../o/x/y/Oxyhydrogen.html" title="Oxyhydrogen">oxyhydrogen</a> to keep a balanced view of the subject matter and keep the article policed by people who know what they are talking about. (After <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aquygen_678d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aquygen">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aquygen</a> I was thinking of writing a balanced history of the idea but then decided against it, it's an ephemeral subject.). <i>Economic totalitarianism</i> is certainly ill-defined (neither Friedman nor DiLorenzo attempt a definition) and a favorite of blogging wingnuts. Putting DiLorenzo's ideas into context with genuine, bona-fide uppercase Fascist economic practice of the 1930s seems the more sensible solution. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 06:44, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>DiLorenzo's "definition" is worthless. It's not even in a peer-reviewed article so that we could track citations. Discounting mirrors I get 12 unique hits for his definition, mostly blogs. The Von Mises Institute doesn't consider it worthy of indexing.<a href="http://www.mises.org/humanaction/theindex.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mises.org/humanaction/theindex.asp" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> It's an <i>idée fixe</i> semi-popular among a couple of partisan bloggers, which is even more reason why we shouldn't include it. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 07:11, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I wasn't arguing to keep this, rather this should be deleted. What I was trying to say is this: if the article turns out to be kept at the insistence of people a redirect is the lesser of two evils. <a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zak_7805.html" title="User:Dr Zak">Dr Zak</a> 15:22, 16 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with you, but one of the problems is that we don't even know where to point the redirect, given how slim the factual basis is. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 17:33, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
