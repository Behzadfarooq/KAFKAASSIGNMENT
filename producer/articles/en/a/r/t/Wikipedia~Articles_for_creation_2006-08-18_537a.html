<p>Squirrel Scouts are fictional girl scouts in Camp Lazlo.</p>
<p>The girl scouts were called Squirrel Scouts. The girls there had a lot to do, arts &amp; crafts, campfires, nature hikes, volleyball, soccer, pine cone sitting, tea parties, croquet, &amp; many more things. However, 1 particularly favoured sport of the Squirrel Scouts was making fun of the Bean Scouts of Camp Kidney, a more underfunded camp on the other side of the lake. While the Squirrel Scouts HAVE had rare moments where they were nice to the Bean Scouts, for the most part, they considered the Bean Scouts inferior to them in every single aspect except idiocy. They would pull pranks on them on occasion, or even take things from them, like their cabins’ flags. However, even they had their limits as to how much they would mistreat the Bean Scouts. The Squirrel Scouts were the group of girls who were about the same ages as the bean scouts and lived in a natural environment setting like the bean scouts. Only, it was a lot more appealing and beautiful to the eye and from a very different perspective it looked like a giant Jewel, sparkling and radiant. They lived in a camp called Acorn Flats. The commonly seen scouts are Patsy Smiles, Nina Neckerly, &amp; Gretchen.</p>

<b>Fiduciary marking</b> is the use of objects in the <a href="../../../f/i/e/Field_of_view.html" title="Field of view">field of view</a> of an <a href="../../../i/m/a/Imaging_system.html" title="Imaging system">imaging system</a> which appear in the image produced.</p>
<p>Markers may be used to make otherwise invisible or difficult to distinguish features of an image more visible. Markers can simplify computerized <a href="../../../i/m/a/Image_processing.html" title="Image processing">image processing</a> applications such as <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motion_capture.html" title="Motion capture">motion capture</a>, by providing an easy-to-track feature in images which follows the movements of the marked subject.</p>
<p>The appearance of markers in images may act as a reference for image scaling, or may allow the image and physical object, or multiple independent images, to be <a href="../../../c/o/r/Correlated.html" title="Correlated">correlated</a>. By placing fiduciary markers at known locations in a subject, the relative scale in the produced image may be determined by comparison of the locations of the markers in the image and subject.</p>
<p>Images of the same subject produced with two different imaging systems might be correlated by placing a fiduciary marker in the area imaged by both systems. In this case, a marker which is visible in the images produced by both imaging modalities must be used. By this method, functional information from <a href="../../../s/p/e/SPECT_c65e.html" title="SPECT">SPECT</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positron_emission_tomography.html" title="Positron emission tomography">Positron emission tomography</a> might be related to anatomical information provided by <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magnetic_resonance_imaging.html" title="Magnetic resonance imaging">Magnetic resonance imaging</a>.</p>

Steve Morsa of Thousand Oaks, CA is the inventor of Match Engine Marketing (MEM); also known as paid match, which is the method of matching advertisers over computer networks such as the Internet with consumers via the targeting of consumers' demographic and psychographic traits and characteristics.</p>
<p>As explained in the pending patent #11/250,908 (visible at the United States Patent and Trademark Office website; uspto.gov) and in the white paper posted at MatchEngineMarketing.com, MEM/paid match utilizes the well-known bid-for-position and pay-per-click (PPC) aspects of the income-generation systems of companies such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN; but strips out the search component; replacing it with a more orderly and better targeted structured "match" methodology.</p>
<p>MEM/paid match was first conceptualized by Mr. Morsa in the summer of 2004; with the patent being filed in October of that same year.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Saavedra was an Arnis fighter who was expert in Bolo fight brandishing and stick fight handling that he learns from different Instructors when he joined the secret revolutionary movement that fight against the Spanish authorities in the Philippines particularly in Cebu. He was then very young at the age of about sixteen or seventeen, but at the age of twenty he was already an expert in stick fighting, as it was a stick as their usual tool to conceal their activities in the practice of bolo fight brandishing. He was captured and put in jail for about thirty years and while in the prison cell, he continued to practice the art using only some kitchen utensils to enhance his craft through frequent sparring with his co-prisoner who became his friend a Frenchman who was also an expert in sword fighting. When he was freed from prison, he taught the art of stick fighting to his two nephews Teodoro and Federico Saavedra and there were others who also trained with him. In 1920 Lorenzo Saavedra established the “Club Lantay” the organization of Stick fighters (Ekrimadores) together with his two nephews and the Canete’s. The training was taught one-on-one and while others are waiting for their turn in training, they ordered them to observe the mechanics while sitting on the bamboo bench that are mounted around the training venue. The bamboo bench was called in the Cebuano dialect as “LANTAY” hence the club was so named, but the Americans who governs on that period in the Philippines did not understand, so Lorenzo change the name into the Labangon Fencing Club.</p>

<p>the word booyah was, is, and always will be understood by A.J. Ball and those he graces with the understanding. Those who use this mixture of the "boo" and the "yah" without complete understanding comprise their standing in society. The consequences are most likely to be eyes rolling and frowns....deep...frowns...and maybe finger pointing.</p>
<p>Example of those who shouldn't use this word:</p>
<p>Donny Oswald Fred Durst Cameron Diaz Dick Cheney P. Diddy Bill O'reilly Carmen Neely</p>

<p>R is a relation and A, B, C be subsets of attributes, of R. A be a candidate key of R. There's a transitive functional dependency (TFD) on R if the FDs: A -&gt; B, B -&gt; C, and A -&gt; C all hold on R.Each FD in the TFD can be either trivial or non-trivial FD. (Just for completeness: the FD A -&gt; B is trivial if B is a subset of A, otherwise it's non-trivial.)</p>

<p>Here is a movie guaranteed to present a load of laughter! It all begins when the ever wealthy Fernando (Ricky Davao)dies of heart attack. His wife, Lupita (Glydel Mercado) mourns for him, too happy for the windfall of funds which will shower upon her-- after all, she <i>is</i> the legal wife, right? She would dream of MORE of Fernando's money for her son (Cogie Domingo), too.</p>
<p>The former beauty queen is enraged once she finds out that he was two, not one, TWO more mistresses. Carmen (Chin Chin Guiterrez.) is the beautiful, ideal woman for a wife. Too bad Fernando doesn't play that way. Deeply religious, she believes that she has raised her daughter well. Not so. When the two (Lupita and Carmen) find out that Carmen's daughter and Lupita's son have a night of unbridled pleasure, boy things go wrong.</p>
<p>The other one is Dana (Assunta De Rossi), the "Seductress of Philippine Cinema". Saucy, hot, sexy-- who could ask for more? Definitely not Fernando. Fernando is a lover of these kinds of girls, bold.</p>
<p>Alas and alack when the threesome find out that the sexy and beautiful maid has connection to Fernando, too. Fe (Juliana Palermo) is that maid. It started in the middle of the night, where Fe goes to the kitchen for some delicious ube ice cream. Fernando bumps into (literally) Fe and spils her ice cream. He tells her, too bad the ice cream spilled. The two look at each other passionately when Fernando suddenly licks the spilled ice cream on Fe's breasts. You guessed it, they had sex. Sometimes, when Fe would be at the table, Fernando would reach into the skirt of Fe's maid outfit and provide her intimate and sexual pleasure by fingering her and fondling her reproductive organ-- her vagina.</p>
<p>As the four fight and argue for the rights to Fernando's wealth, a whirlwind of laughter is bestowed on the audience.</p>

<p><b>Fortis Healthcare</b> Limited (FHL) is an enterprise from the promoters of Ranbaxy, India's largest pharmaceutical company and a global giant. With the first flagship venture of the Group, Fortis Hospital at Mohali in 2001, today the Fortis network has grown to ten hospitals with a bed capacity of around 1,600 beds establishing itself as one of India's leading advanced tertiary care Healthcare Group.</p>
<p>Fortis Mohali, is the region's leading multi-speciality hospital, with a super-speciality in Heart. The world-class environment is nurtured by an affiliation with one of the world's leading health delivery systems - Partners HealthCare System Inc. (PHS), USA. The affiliation facilitates FHL's access to clinical protocols, quality assurance, and criteria for accreditation in accordance with US hospital standards besides training material for staff, and recommendations concerning critical medical equipment.</p>
<p>Fortis Mohali's emergence as a premier super-speciality facility in North India has been underlined by the accomplishment of numerous high-end procedures such as: Cardiac Re-Modeling, Pediatric Arterial Switch operation, Aortic Aneurysms, Kidney Tumour removal to cite a few.</p>
<p>With the addition of the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, Fortis Healthcare Limited today runs amongst the largest Cardiac Programmes in the world with over 5,000 surgeries and 14,000 angiographies on an annual basis. The competencies of the two systems jointly will help in enhancing service delivery capability and set benchmarks for the way healthcare is delivered in India.</p>
<p>Fortis Healthcare Ltd. is fast establishing a major presence within the National Capital Region of Delhi. In a span of one year the new 350-bed Fortis Hospital in Noida, has become India's leading tertiary care hospital in Orthopaedics and Neuro Sciences. This is possible because of our doctors - Dr Ashok Rajgopal, one of India's most experienced Orthopedic Surgeons who performed 1,000 Surgeries in the first year and Dr A. K. Singh, Director-Neuro Sciences who is credited with being amongst the first in performing many critical procedures. Fortis Hospital Noida also provides tertiary treatment in key specialities such as: Renal Sciences, Genito-urinary diseases, gastrointestinal diseases as well as many other disciplines.</p>
<p>In just about five years since the first hospital, Fortis Hospital Limited is rated amongst top two in India in terms of Cardiac Procedures, Total Knee Replacement, Total Hip Replacement and in Neuro Sciences.</p>
<p>Besides cutting edge surgeries are performed in Cosmetology, Opthalmology, Dental, ENT, Oncology, Minimal Invasive Surgery, Women &amp; Child Health, to name a few, within the Group Hospitals.</p>
<p>What differentiates Fortis Healthcare Limited is its strict adherence to the best international clinical protocols in Patient Handling, Operation Theatres, ICU Management and Emergency Care. Our Doctors (mostly Western trained), caring nurses, technicians and hospital staff makes the patient feel home away from home.</p>
<p>In order to provide International Patients with the highest level of service quality from arrival to departure in India with seamless registration and discharge with an element of warmth, we have created the Fortis International Patient Service Centre at New Delhi, India.</p>
<p>With the burgeoning Fortis network, patients at any Fortis hospital become beneficiaries of an enriched wealth of interactive medical expertise and a reassuringly consistent quality of medical treatment - medical excellence that is enhanced through compassionate care... the Fortis way</p>

<p>In the summer of 1999, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) and LucasArts (LA) began collaboration on a project of immense proportion; a project that would be lauded by both the gaming community and the general populace at the same time. When they entered into the domain of STAR WARS lore, SOE and LA certainly recognized the ramifications of what would become of a game based upon the fanastical imaginations of not only Mr. George Lucas, but also the countless followers of the Star Wars saga.</p>
<p><br />
Upon its launch in the summer of 2003, Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided was plagued with bugs, yet full of potential. Enlisting the talents of some the most innovative and forward-thinking game designers of the day, SWG:AED had more potential than a split atom and more problems than the first Model T. Progress does not come without a price, though.</p>
<p><br />
Months passed without significant progress by the development team, and enthusiasm on all fronts seemed to wane. The developers' promise of a “Combat Upgrade” attempted to assuage the sentiments of the multitude of gamers who were considering scrapping the project as yet another forum for an overactive imagination and an impotent initiative, but nearly half a million subscribers remained loyal. And so it was until the proposed combat upgrade came to fruition and SWG players left their galaxies en masse.</p>
<p><br />
A few unsung visionaries had the foresight to recognize the full potential of the original sandbox format realized by the first Sony developers involved with the project, and thus the saga of an SWG emulator began. The emulation community considered more than red lines and margins: they believed in a system that was originally intended to accommodate the interests of hardcore MMO gamers, STAR WARS fans, and casual players again. As such, the Star Wars Galaxies emulator, a.k.a. SWGEmu, began to be more of a way of life than a fancy.</p>
<p><br />
After cracking the necessary packets, and progressing to a near-sandbox phase with the emulator's dummy server (Team SWGEmu's internal testing server), the emulator's code was released as an open source project on July 12, 2006. Thousands of rabid community members, interested gaming media, and even SOE/LA staffers have since downloaded the project and are currently able to run and join SWG emulated servers.</p>
<p><br />
Since going open source, the project has been progressing at an intensely rapid rate. With the addition of new team members, and with the help from loyal SWGEmu community members, the emulator team have been able to quickly and efficiently post revisions to the code that come ever closer to a fully realized and completed SWG emulator.</p>
<p><br />
In half the time it took SOE personnel to re-create a universe so comprehensive, so immerse, and so dynamic that the average player, and furthermore the average STAR WARS fanatic, could feel comfortable in, the emulation team were able to not only discern the mechanics that would make such a complex game system possible, but also the means by which to implement it. At the same time they were able to appease the masses by offering the general public access to a game that hundreds of thousands came to love and hate at the same time.</p>
<p><br />
At present, Team SWGEmu are working on refining the implementation of a system of gaming interactivity and social interdependency that will forever be sought after and...emulated.</p>
<p><br />
Contact between Team SWGEmu and Lucas Arts has been confirmed, however, neither party is willing to disclose the details of their correpsondence as of yet.</p>

Ryo Fukaura (b.1992) is now a student at <i><a href="../../../f/e/t/Fettes_College_16e1.html" title="Fettes College">Fettes College</a></i> and is now devoting himself to composing. His list of completed (but unpublished) works:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Etudes (1998-2000)</li>
<li>12 Etudes (2001-2002)</li>
<li>Nocturne in E (2004)</li>
<li>3 Valses (2000-2001)</li>
<li>Impromptu Moderne in C# minor (2003)</li>
<li>Polonaise in A minor (2006)</li>
<li>5 Ballades (2000-2002)</li>
<li>In the memory of the First World War (2006)</li>
</ul>
<p>The 24 Etudes were composed as a tribute to Chopin. Number 18 in A minor shows a great density of consideration put into this work. This work has a similar structure to the Etude number 3 by Chopin. Number 2 is the second "black keys" etude, after the first one was composed by Chopin.</p>
<p>The Nocturne was composed quite recently. This E major work shows a vast variety of harmonies - modern and classic throughout the piece. Possibly the hardest piece in his repetoire.</p>
<p>The valses were stuck to a pattern - each one of them is 4 pages long. Number 4 is the hardest of the lot (E minor)with chords stretching up to a 12th. As well as the technical difficulities found in this piece, to play it with passion and expression is possibly the hardest trick a pianist could master.</p>
<p>Impromptu Moderne concentrates entirely on modern harmonies, with leanings to Rawsthorne and Takemitsu. The swift triplet to duplet switch and the agile movement of octave chords enable this 15 second piece come to life in the short time it is allowed.</p>
<p>Polonaise in A minor was the most carefully planned piece. The continuous agile movement of the right hand between arpeggios and broken chords, and the main bass melody in the left hand with octaves makes it clear that this piece was also an influence of Chopin.</p>
<p>The five Ballades are incredibly long (longest is 9 pages) and demanding. Currently the hardest one rated is number 1 in C, with its tricky ornaments and the climax at the end when both hands move across the keys in douuble notes demisemiquavers.</p>
<p>In the memory of the First World War is a single movement piano concerto. This really gives a lively impression of war in the trenches with the trumpets moving across the octaves in glissandos and the violins jumping around the span of notes almost at random, and, of course the piano at its climax has to glissando all the way down the keys and then go up again in double octaves at the speed of 10 notes per second.</p>
<p>Ryo is now recording a CD for Edinburgh University He will stay in Fettes from 2002-2010</p>

<p>The Red Masque, founded in 2001, is an original, avant rock band from Philadelphia. Primarily influenced by such progressive rock and psychedelic bands as King Crimson, Magma, Van Der Graaf Generator and Art Bears, one of the group's first concerts was at the Prelude to the North East Art Rock Festival (NEARFest) in 2001 where they performed with the likes of Land of Chocolate and Wine of Nails). Other notable shows include the 2005 Rogue Independent Music Festival in Atlanta, where the band headlined on Saturday night; the 2001 World Con Science Fiction Convention, the New Jersey proghouse series, Orion Studios in Baltimore; the Philadelphia Landing Pad Space Rock Festival; and The Gate to Moonbase Alpha concert series at the Rotunda in Philadelphia; as well as organized and performed in the 2002 and 2003 Philadelphia Underground Music and Culture Festival. The Red Masque has also opened up for notable performers and musicians such as Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears), The Muffins, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, and Present.</p>
<p>The Red Masque have released to date one EP ("Death of the Red Masque" in 2001), and two albums ("Victoria and the Haruspex" in 2002 and "Feathers for Flesh" in 2004). "Feathers for Flesh" was released through the Big Balloon Music label out of Washington state and garnered critical reviews in the press, including Wire Magazine (issue no. 248), Harmonie Magazine (issue No. 52), Progresiste Magazine (issue No. 39), iO Pages (Issue No. 55), Colussus Magazine (issue No. 26), Tarkus Magazine (issue No. 30), Progression Magazine (issue No. 47), Expose Magazine (issue No. 31), and various online newsletters, blogs, and review sites. Interviews in various progressive music media also followed, including Progression Magazine (issue No. 49) and Expose Magazine (in their online "Extra!" edition).</p>
<p>The band is currently working on a third album, "Fossil Eyes", which is due to be released later this year (2006) with an independent avant garde label (according to the band). A preview of the song "Carbon 14" off this new album were played at the 2006 NEARFest to garner publicity.</p>
<p>Current band lineup includes band founders Brandon Ross (bass, keys) and Lynnette Shelley (vocals, percussion), and Brian "Vonorn" Van Korn (drums, keys, theremin, assorted other instruments, and producer of "Feathers for Flesh" and "Fossil Eyes"), Andrew Kowal (guitars, mandolin and violin). Former members include Kevin Kelly (drums), Steven Blumberg (guitars), Nathan-Andrew Dewin (keys, electric concert harp, percussion), and Kiarash Emami (guitars, mandolin).</p>

<p>Myprotein.co.uk was launched in late 2003 to offer a new solution for users of sports supplements (whey protein, creatine etc). As you know every single person is different genetically, and everyone responds differently to different formulas... In that case why use a weight gainer, protein powder or recovery formula that has been produced for Joe Public?</p>
<p>Myprotein offer you the ability to a customise your own formula from the huge amounts of sports ingredients we offer, as well as the ability to add your own choice of flavouring and sweeteners! (If you prefer you don't have to have any flavouring or sweeteners - it's your choice!)</p>
<p>In most big name weight gainers, protein powders or recovery formulas there is huge amounts of ingredients that are not required, they are just added to improve the taste or mix ability. We feel YOU should have the choice what YOU put in to your body.</p>

<p>flirt with girls is generally matter of express your interest in some one you like but not seriously. In other situations, it may be done simply for immediate entertainment, with no intention of developing any further relationship. This type of flirting sometimes faces disapproval from others, either because it can be misinterpreted as more serious, or it may be viewed as "cheating" if the person is already in a romantic relationship with someone else.</p>
<p>there are many ways with which u can flirt with females they are like: (1) Eye contact (2) Gestures of body (3) Body language (4) Help of different signs</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-18_537a.html" title="Edit section: Fink (music)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Fink (music)</span></h2>
<p>"I feel like I'm 21 all over again," says Fink exuding enough wide-eyed enthusiasm to back up his claim. This former purveyor of cool, laidback Ninja Tune beats has done what very few recording artists would dare to do - he has changed. Completely. "I've DJed the world over, remixed for countless acts, and produced inspirational artists (including Martin Taylor, Amy Winehouse, Michael Pitt, and Robert Belfour), but what I've achieved with this album has wiped the hard-drive off anything else! I'm completely consumed by it and nothing else seems relevant."</p>
<p>What Fink has achieved is to have been reincarnated as Ninja Tune's first ever guitar-toting singer-songwriter. Immersed in a very personal labour of love, the brooding Bristol-bred, Brighton-based artist has written, produced and performed a striking, stripped-down symphony of an album. Like a twenty-first century John Martyn, Fink's insistent songs are flushed with bruised basslines and skinny blues licks. And they're exceptional.</p>
<p>"When I was sixteen, music to me was all about the guitar," reveals Fink. "I was obsessed with it - I played the guitar constantly and immersed myself in indie rock. Then…" he shrugs coyly, "I discovered the bright lights and illicit pleasures of raving - and the two just don't mix!" Seduced by house and Acid Jazz, Orbital and The Orb, he made what he now self-deprecatingly calls "a horrible" ambient techno record ("I was part of the make-dance-music-in-your-bedroom revolution of 1990," he says chuckling.) That first record earned him a deal with Ninja Tune Records. Fink was delighted. But he promised himself his guitar playing would be his "private thing - something I would do only when no one was listening." And so it was.</p>
<p>In 2000 Fink released Fresh Produce on Ninja Tune's experimental imprint, Ntone. This much-touted trip-hop-tinged album was packed with funky, dub-driven beats. But following years of DJ gigs around the world, he realised his fling with electronic music had run its course: "I wasn't interested in what I was supposed to be doing anymore. Something was missing. I thought of all the artists that inspire me – Joni Mitchell, John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, John Martyn - all the Js! - and what I love about them. What makes their music unique is that they pour themselves into it. And that's what was missing from my music - ME."</p>
<p>This epiphany inspired Fink to go crawling back to his first love – guitar music. "Like a 16 year-old, I went to every gig I could get a ticket for," he says. "From grown-up gigs like Sting and Coldplay to thrash metal like System Of A Down or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs playing in some shitty indie hole. I wanted to suck it all in, absorb it all. I devoured music. And it made me want to play Barflys so that I could be a part of it in some way."</p>
<p>With the quasi-masochistic verve of an adrenalin junkie, Fink began creating an album that would turn him inside out. Armed with his trusty six-string, Fink wrote and sung the album’s first single ‘Pretty Little Thing’ in his home studio over a weekend. Desperate for an honest opinion, Fink took his completed song to Ninja and lied: "I told them I'd used an unknown guest vocalist from the States. I said ‘…he's really young, really hot, blah, blah, blah - what do you think?’ " It was only after Ninja commissioned an album's worth of material that the newly-born singer-songwriter admitted it was all his own work.</p>
<p>The resulting album, Biscuits For Breakfast, is everything Fink hoped it would be: a collection of intriguingly personal, folk-inflected, acoustic soul songs that are essentially and intrinsically him. And aside from a guest appearance from Tina Grace on the lush ‘Hush Now’, they are all tales told in Fink's own voice. "These songs are VERY real," confirms Fink earnestly. "They are very much about my life. Every song has a mental image attached to it and every time I sing those songs I'm taken right back there, feeling those emotions again."</p>
<p>But don't take his word for it - listen to the record and you'll soon hear that Fink's tales are undeniably intense, intimate affairs. From the lust-stoked ode of ‘Pretty Little Thing’ to the brutal disappointment of ‘Pills In My Pocket’, and the wry disillusionment of the album's title track, to the crushing heart-ache of ‘Kamlyn’, the singer's bare emotions parade themselves in his revealing lyrics and the aching swoon of his raw soul voice.</p>
<p>"This is my learning curve published," he says with equal parts trepidation and pride. "I've written all of the songs on the album - I've given everything to this. It could have gone horribly wrong: I could have fucked up my record deal, ruined this private musical thing - my love life's already a disaster - but I could have wrecked EVERYTHING! It was a gamble but I'm really chuffed that I've done it."</p>
<p>"There's a fine line between arrogance and confidence," he continues. "But there's enough on this record for me to think, ‘these songs really aren't bad.’ " He fixes his gaze, but instantly his face creases into a grin as he slips back into the vernacular of his old dance music days. "Actually, I think they're wicked!"</p>

I wish to highlight this story of mine because i think as it happened with me it might happen with anyone.</p>
<p>I had rented a place in Chester with my Family at 1 Fireman's Square, Northgate Street, Chester and stayed there for about 6 months. I had rented this property from Grosvenor Rellocation's as they had there office at Watergate Street and now seem to have changed the address to "Refugee House, 33 Watergate Street, Chester".</p>
<p>I was quite punctual in paying my rent and also kept the property clean and tidy all the time. As i believed that it is the duty of the tenant to take the responsibility of the property and dont let the agent complain about anything.</p>
<p>Sixmonths later my husbands job was shifted to London and our tenancy agreement had also come to an end therefore we completed the final formalities and handed over the keys to the Agent "Grosvenor Rellocation" - Mr. Mike. At that point in time he assured us that we shall receive our Deposit money £695 back soon.</p>
<p>Days passed by, months passed by. We kept calling him for the deposit money and he kept giving excuses that the land lady is in Canada and therefore is waiting for her to call back. After few months he did send us a cheque but that cheque also bounced back. And we are still chasing our hard earned money from that Agent.</p>
<p>I wonder how can a business run this way if there is so much of cheating done with the customers. As i truly believe that Customer is always treated as GOD in our country.</p>
<p>The reason for me writing this article down was because i truly believe that this company Grosvenor Rellocation is a fraud Agent and the person responsible Mr. Mike can cheat on anyone as he did on us.</p>

<p>Tree Nebulas is a alternative rock band from Ballarat, Victoria. Current members of the band are Ed Denton (vocals and rhythm guitar) Tom Arthurson (lead guitar and effects) and Alex Young (Drums). The band formed in 2004 and took the name "Sobriety". The band included current members plus bassist Dave Blanchfield. Changes in musical direction in 2006 lead to a name change to Tree Nebulas as well as the distancing of Dave because of committment issues.</p>
<p>In recording, Ed or Tom contribute bass guitar and keyboard parts to fill the unoccupied positions. Though Tree Nebulas are yet to release any recorded material, work in their home studio is currently in progress as of 2006.</p>
<p>Playing live, the band tend to progress through long improvised instrumental sections, blending songs into each other. Many of their songs go unintroduced because the band may move into songs without actually starting from the beginning. Because of their progressive style, the band band often move in and out of specific songs without actually beginning or ending them. It is this style of performance that lead to the theatrical mystique that they use.</p>
<p>Some of their influences are, in particular, Pink Floyd as well as contemporary artists such as Sigur Rós, Decoder Ring and The Mars Volta.</p>

<p>By the arrival of the new millennium, after 2 major label releases and numerous nationwide and South American tours (including Ozzfest99) with former band PUYA, Ramón Ortíz was feeling the need to give life to a new, heavier more brutal incarnation of his musical soul.</p>
<p>Driven by a burning desire to take his trademark latin metalcore sound to a new level the puertorrican guitar player put past achievements aside and set out on a journey to find the right pieces to complete the puzzle. Ankla was oficially formed in 2001 meaning "anchor" in Spanish.</p>
<p>Ankla represents a new musical vision deeply anchored in Ortíz lifelong passion for extreme forms of metal music. While borrowing traditional elements from thrash, death and hardcore metal the band still explores and incorporates some of the latin claves and syncopations that Ramón has been known for without ever stepping out of a metallic sound of power groove that is intended to push boundaries is the evolution of modern metal.</p>
<p>Ankla consists of Ikaro Stafford on vocals, Ramón Ortíz on guitar, José Clark on drums, Edgar González on bass and Oscar Santiago on percussion. 2004 saw Ankla sharing stages with bands like Brujeria, Body Count, Six Feet Under and Hatebreed among others, proving to audiences in the west coast and in Puerto Rico the power of Ankla crushing live show.</p>
<p>The band has been in the studio since last may working with producer Bob Marlette (Black Sabbath, Iommi, Halford, Evanescence) on its debut cd. The production is on its final stages and the devastatingly heavy album will be released by mid 2006.</p>

<p>The Fats Scale is a scale used to rate movies that is named for "Villainous Fats," an internet forums poster who is responsible for inventing the scale's ratings system. What makes the scale unique is its use of negative numbers, as the scale ranges from positive four to negative four, including zero.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>The positive numbers represent standard rankings, with a higher number representing a superior film. 4 would be the best; 3 would be good; 2 would represent mediocrity, or a film that is merely "okay"; 1 would be poor; and 0 would represent a terrible movie that possesses no redeeming features and holds no entertainment value whatsoever.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>As films begin to merit negative numbers, a strange phenomenon occurs: They are so bad that their "badness" takes on a degree of entertainment value of its own. So a -1 would be a train wreck of a film that may potentially pique one's morbid curiousity; a -2 would be a camp classic; a -3 would be a ludicrous film; and a -4 would be a masterpiece of bad filmmaking.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>For points of reference, most would classify Citizen Kane as a 4 (or +4, for the sake of clarity), while Plan 9 from Outer Space would be a -4.<br />

<p>I looked at Haven holidays.co.uk but I went to reighton sands this year so I got more information there.You will get more information from the Haven camp sites than on the internet because the show is popular to the site.</p>

<p><br />
Introduction</p>
<p>It is impossible to tell the story of the Camlin hotel, without telling the story of Seattle. These two stories are intertwined.</p>
<p>Early history of Seattle</p>
<p>The founding of Seattle is usually dated from the arrival of the Denny Party in 1851. The next April, Arthur A. Denny abandoned the original site at Alki in favor of the better protected site on Elliott Bay that is now part of downtown Seattle. Around the same time, David Swinson "Doc" Maynard began settling the land immediately south of Denny's.</p>
<p>When Henry Yesler brought the first steam sawmill to the region, he chose a location on the waterfront where Maynard and Denny's plats met. Thereafter Seattle would dominate the lumber industry.</p>
<p>The logging town developed rapidly into a small city. Despite being officially founded by the Methodists of the Denny Party, Seattle quickly developed a reputation as a wide-open town, a haven for prostitution, liquor, and gambling. Some attribute this, at least in part, to Maynard.</p>
<p>Real estate records show that nearly all of the city's first 60 businesses were on, or immediately adjacent to, Maynard's plat.</p>
<p>Seattle was incorporated as a city on December 2, 1869. At this time, the population was approximately 1,000.</p>
<p>Railroad Rivalry with Tacoma</p>
<p>On July 14, 1873 the Northern Pacific Railway announced that they had chosen the then-hamlet of Tacoma over Seattle as the Western terminus of their trans-continental railroad. The railroad barons appear to have been gambling on the advantage they could gain from being able to buy up the land around their terminus cheaply instead of bringing the railroad into a more established Pacific port town.</p>
<p>Seattle made several attempts to build a railroad of its own or to get one to come. The Great Northern Railway finally came to Seattle in 1884, but it would be 1906 before Seattle finally acquired a major rail passenger terminal.</p>
<p>Seattle in this era was an "open" and often relatively lawless town. Although it boasted newspapers and telephones, lynch law often prevailed (there were at least four lynching in 1882), schools barely operated, and indoor plumbing was a rare novelty. Potholes in the street were so bad as to cause at least one fatal drowning.</p>
<p>The history of labor in this period is inseparable from the issue of anti-Chinese vigilantism. In 1883 Chinese laborers played a key role in the first effort at digging the Mountlake Cut to connect Lake Union's Portage Bay to Lake Washington's Union Bay. In 1885-1886, whites and Indians, complaining of overly cheap labor competition, drove the Chinese settlers from Seattle, Tacoma, and other Northwest cities.</p>
<p>In an era during which the Washington Territory was one of the first parts of the U.S. to (briefly) allow women's suffrage, women played a significant part in "civilizing" Seattle. In the 1880s, Seattle got its first streetcar and cable car, ferry service, a YMCA gymnasium, and the exclusive Rainier Club, and passed an ordinance requiring attached sewer lines for all new residences. It also began to develop a road system.</p>
<p>The relative fortunes of Seattle and Tacoma clearly show the nature of Seattle's growth. Though both Seattle and Tacoma grew at a rapid rate from 1880 to 1890, based on the strength of their timber industries, Seattle's growth as an exporter of services and manufactured goods continued for another two decades, while Tacoma's growth dropped almost to zero. The reason for this lies in Tacoma's nature as a company town and Seattle's successful avoidance of that condition.</p>
<p>The fire</p>
<p>The early Seattle era came to a stunning halt with the Great Seattle Fire of June 6, 1889. The fire burned 29 city blocks (almost entirely wooden buildings; about 10 brick buildings also burned). It destroyed nearly the entire business district, all of the railroad terminals, and all but four of the wharves.</p>
<p>The city rebuilt from the ashes with astounding rapidity. A new zoning code resulted in a downtown of brick and stone buildings, rather than wood. In the single year after the fire, the city grew from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, largely because of the enormous number of construction jobs suddenly created. Still, south of Yesler Way, the open city atmosphere remained.</p>
<p>Leader of the Northwest: 1900 -- 1915</p>
<p>The gold rush led to massive immigration. Many of Seattle's neighborhoods got their start around this time. Downtown Seattle was bustling with activity; as quickly as previous inhabitants moved out to newly created neighborhoods, new immigrants came in to take their place in the city core.</p>
<p>Once the obvious extensions of downtown had been made along the flatlands to the north and south, streetcars began providing transportation to new outlying neighborhoods.</p>
<p>A massive effort was made to level the extreme hills that rose south and north of the bustling city. A seawall containing dirt from the Denny Regrade created the current waterfront. More dirt from the Denny Regrade went to build the industrial Harbor Island at the mouth of the Duwamish River, south of Downtown.</p>
<p>At the same time as the city was expanding dramatically, the city planners began to put in parks and boulevards under a plan designed by the Olmsted Firm, providing numerous parks and about twenty miles of boulevard which link most of the parks and greenbelts within the city limits. Much of the ambience of Seattle today derives from this project.</p>
<p>World War I and after</p>
<p>In 1910, Seattle voters approved a referendum to create a development plan for the whole city. However, the result, known as the Bogue plan, was never to be implemented. The unused plan had at its heart a grand civic center in Belltown and the Denny Regrade connected to the rest of the city by a rapid transit rail system, with a huge expansion of the park system, crowned by a total conversion of 4000 acre (16 km²) Mercer Island into parkland. However, the plan was defeated by an alliance of fiscal conservatives who opposed such a grandiose plan on general principles and populists who argued that the plan would mainly benefit the rich. Growth during this period was almost all in wartime shipbuilding and lumber, and there was very little growth in new industries. When the war ended, economic output crashed as the government stopped buying boats, and there were no new industries to pick up the slack. Seattle stopped being a place of explosive growth and opportunity.</p>
<p>Seattle first began to be an arts center in the 1920s. Australian painter Ambrose Patterson arrived in 1919; over the next few decades Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, Kenneth Callahan, Guy Irving Anderson, and Paul Horiuchi would establish themselves as nationally and internationally known artists.</p>
<p>By mid-century the thriving jazz scene in the city's Skid Road district would produce such luminaries as Ray Charles and Quincy Jones.</p>
<p><br />
The Camlin Hotel</p>
<p>The Swedish Connection</p>
<p>In the year of Seattle’s Great Fire, in Des Moines, Iowa, Adolph Linden was born. His father, Frederick, a Baptist Minister, and his mother, Christina had come to the United States from Sweden just a few years before. Soon moved from Des Moines, Iowa, to the parsonage of the First Swedish Baptist Church, at 820 Pine Street, now the parking lot next to the Camlin. By age 16, Adolph had already finished High School, had already worked in the lumber industry, and was working as a banker. One Sunday, while attending services at his family’s church, he met a young woman from Michigan. Ester Anderson, the daughter of a traveling shoe salesman from Michigan was on a four month trip with her father when she met Adolph at Sunday Services. “I really don’t know what she saw in Adolph.” Says Jim Linden, the couples Grandson “She was beautiful, and he was, well, kind of homely.” Love prevailed, and the two were wed in September of 1910. The two settled on Boylston Ave, and Esters family moved out the following year.</p>
<p>Aaron Anderson, Ester’s Father, had done well in shoes, but he did better in timber. He soon owned one of the largest timber companies in the state, was Director of the National City Bank of Seattle, and President of the Puget Sound Savings and Loan, the bank that Adolph worked for.</p>
<p>In 1923, Aaron Anderson died, leaving his Vice President to take over, one Adolph Linden. Adolph’s new Vice President was a gentleman by the name of Edmund Campbell. Campbell, Linden’s senior by 19 years, had started doing business in Los Angles in the 1880’s, with a delivery service, but a disease that spread through his horses had caused him to move to Seattle, and go into banking.</p>
<p>A year after his father-in-laws death, Adolph was doing well for himself. He purchased a Georgian-style mansion in Lake Forest Park, and sank over $100,000 into improvements. In 1922, Campbell and Linden had gone into business together outside of the bank. They had formed an investment group, and in 1925 they began the “Camlin” Investment Group. “Camlin” being a contraction of their surnames.</p>
<p>The first order of business, open a ritzy hotel in downtown Seattle. On October 31st, 1926, the Camlin Apartment Hotel had its official opening. The Seattle Times at the time stated “the exterior effect of the Camlin is such as to make it stand out from all parts of the city. Instinctively, the though is born of the magnificent view of the Sound and Olympics which is to be had from the lofty windows in the rear of this edifice. Nothing has been spared in the way of expense in its construction. The Camlin stands as a monument to seat’s development, a mark which equals anything to be found anywhere on the Pacific Coast” On the day of the opening, other events of note happened around the world. Illusionist Harry Houdini died in Detroit. A young man was beaten to death by a mob for attempted assassination of Benito Mussolini. Reports from Kelso, WA, there was steam raising from the peak of Mt. St. Helens, but most people scoffed at the notion of an eruption in the modern age of the twentieth Century. At the Bon Marche, silk neckties… 65, and Girdles …. $1.25. The Architect for the Camlin was Carl Linde of Portland, a one time brewery builder, had built the edifice to resemble an Italian Castle. The 93 apartments had all of the latest conveniences, such as “shower baths” and dinettes and kitchenettes. The penthouse comprised the entire 11th floor.</p>
<p>But, the Camlin did not open to happy faces. Earlier in the month, a bank employee had noticed some questionable withdrawals, and had brought them to the attention of the banks board. The withdrawals, totaling about $1 million dollars, were made in loans to KJR radio, Seattle’s first radio station, and about $866,000 to finish the Camlin Hotel, and about $27,000 for oil concerns in Oklahoma. The State Supervisor of Savings and Loans, Mr. W.L. Nicely, after meeting with the board and looking at the evidence stated “This resulted in the meeting of the officers and directors with the supervisor October 2, when it was decided, with my advice and concurrence, that instead of closing the institution, the interests of the shareholder would be better served by securing an agreement with Linden and Campbell to make restitution as far as possible by turning over to the association all of their personal and other holdings, including the Camlin Apartment Hotel, under a trust agreement, and that, under the direction of the supervisor an endeavor would be made to restore the impairment o the capital of the association, the same officers and directors to continue in office, and the completion of the Camlin Apartment Hotel, which is under construction, to be carried out” It took at year for this trust to be finalized, and put on record, it was valued at 1.75 million dollars, and included everything that Campbell and Linden owned. The agreement was not made public at the time.</p>
<p>Linden then moved into Radio, buying KJR, and expanding its operation ten fold. He continued to “Tap” the bank for loan’s to pay for this new venture. In March of 1928, Linden resigned as bank President, and Campbell took over his job. Campbell moved from his eastside home to the penthouse of the Camlin.</p>
<p>Linden made a big success of Radio, he had stations through out the west coast, and as far east as Chicago. But it wasn’t enough, Linden’s radio network “The American Broadcast Company” was overextended, and on the verge of bankruptcy, he had lost everything, except the clothes that they wore, his wife, Ester’s jewelry, and a Lincoln sedan. When The Twentieth Century Fox Company of New York contacted him wanting to buy the network, Linden jumped at the chance. He pilled Ester and their son James, into the sedan and headed for New York on October 15th, 1929. By the time they arrived, the stock market had crashed, and the officer from Fox was no longer valid.</p>
<p>Linden decided to stay in New York, since he couldn’t even make it back to Seattle, and opened a restaurant there. It failed almost immediately. By 1931, they were living in a rented apartment, when two men arrived, policemen with a warrant for Linden’s arrest from Seattle. Adolph looked them up and down, and said “All right, where do we go?”</p>
<p>Within a week, Linden was put aboard a westbound train, headed back to Seattle. Ester, and James, now 16, were two cars behind them. Once back, and standing trail, friends of the family raised bail. No one could believe that this all stemmed from the Savings and Loan Trust that was set up surrounding the Camlin Apartment Hotel, since none of the information had been made public.</p>
<p>Within a few months, indictments had been handed down for Linden, Campbell, Nicely and a handful of others on the now defunct board of the Puget Sound Savings and Loan. It is said that they defrauded the Puget Sound Area out of $2 million.</p>
<p>After two hung juries, a third trial was begun. Campbell was accused of stealing rugs and towels from the Camlin Penthouse, in addition to the other embezzlement. Campbell and Linden were sentenced to 15 years in Walla Walla State Penitence.</p>
<p>Campbell, rather than spend the next 15 years in prison, attempted suicide out of second story window of his home. He fell into bushes and broke his leg. Campbell and Linden served seven and eight years respectively.</p>
<p>When Campbell was released from prison, he worked as a credit manager. With the death of his wife in 1940, he moved in with his daughter and her family. His grandson has many fond memories of his grandfather, who died 1954. Long after, Campbell’s grandchildren took their mother to the Cloud Room for dinner, did they learn of this story, and why their grandfather always walked with a limp.</p>
<p>After his release, Linden went into pressing records. After the death of his wife in 1960, he spent most of his time with his son and grandchildren. On Christmas Eve, 1969, he was found dead in his low income home.</p>
<p>Before the Puget Sound Savings and Loan went under in 1931, the Camlin had been sold to the Vance Lumber Company, which already owned the Vance Hotel.</p>
<p>In 1942, Vance proposed the addition of a cocktail lounge to the top floor of the Camlin. The penthouse, which had never been as successful as hoped, would be converted into the Cloud Room. At the same time, fifty new rooms were added, by cutting down the size of the original rooms.</p>
<p>In the insuring years, the Cloud Room hosted numerous famous faces. Frank Sinatra and Elvis, just to name a few. The Cloud Room had the smoky atmosphere of a speakeasy, with the comforts of a four star restaurant. Live entertainment was the main idea, and several acts got their start right there.</p>
<p>In 1960, in preparation for the 1962 World’s fair, 52 Cabana Units were added, along with a pool and a sun deck for a total cost of $2 million dollars.</p>
<p>After 1960, the Camlin was home to the Italian Consulate, among other things. One in particular, a 40-foot yacht floating in the pool, as a promotional gimmick. When the boat’s bilge pump malfunctioned, and it started taking on water, it was even more of an advertisement. “Boat sinks in Downtown Seattle”.</p>
<p>In the late 1980’s and 1990’s, the Camlin went through many owners. One owner, in 1990, was going to sell off all of the antique furniture, but was stopped only when the state Attorney General’s office slapped a lean on it for tax evasion.</p>
<p>Finally, in 2003, the Camlin was bought by Trendwest Resorts, to become the jewel in their crown of properties world wide. After more than a year, and 21 million dollars in remodeling, the Camlin is ready to open.</p>
<p>Also, after 78 years, and 3 months, Adolph Linden and Edmund Campbell’s dream of a Ritzy Hotel in downtown Seattle, named the Camlin has been realized.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>A wigger bitch is someone who is ethinically challenged and is a male caucasion. The wigger bitch has identity crisis, and believe they are of african american decent...they are not. Often they can be found around schools or at the mall "wigging" it up. With the introduction of Xbox Live, wiggers can spread their deluded views of "pimping" and trying to impersonate the african american male.</p>

Spencer Charlie is arguably one of the most popular bands to emerge from the town of Oxford, Ohio where the band was formed in October of 2005. Drawing from a pool of early 90's alternative rock, the band attracted a large local following. After only 2 shows, Spencer Charlie had a regular following, with some shows attracting as many as 500 people. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Spencer Charlie is the history of its members. Not only did each member come from very different backgrounds, but each one was born on a different continent. Lead singer Liam Donohue was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, and is famous for his trademark show opener "I may be from little rock....but I’m bringing in a LOT of rock." Bassist Ryan Bodle also grew up in Arkansas, but was originally born in Chile while his parents were on vacation (Ryan was actually three weeks ahead of schedule). Lead guitarist Elliott Thomas, whose parents are world renowned anthropologists, were studying with monkeys in the Congo when Elliott's mother Janet Thomas gave birth to him eight days before the revolt against the government took place. Rhythm guitarist John Lewis, while also having grown up in the United States, was born in North Korea while his father was organizing an anti-slave and sex trade movement within the country. In interviews, John is said to have been traumatized by the event, stating that he "used to live in the red light district....I would wake up, see little girls go out because their parents had abandoned them and they had no way to live." John is arguably the least vocal of the group despite having the most interesting upbringing. When he was ten years old, John won a national science fair that was supposed to be devoted only to children ages thirteen to fifteen. Ironically, his first place prize was given to now drummer Brian Dietzen, due to the age restriction. Dietzen was born in Delhi India, and lived there till he was 6 years old when his father was wounded in a terrorist plot that injured 8 others. The band broke up in May of 2006 when drummer Brian Dietzen died of a drug overdose, although various bootlegs are available online.</p>

FACAA enhances the quality of life for the people in the Atlanta area by providing a cadre of services that respond to the needs of the low-income community under its jurisdiction. Specifically, they offer services that address emergency needs such as financial assistance to prevent evictions and foreclosures, utility payments, food and transportation to work. Additionally we provide counseling and education to teach fundamental problem solving and life planning that prevents future economical and family disasters such as joblessness, homelessness and domestic problems. Special services to youth, welfare recipients and senior citizens serve to enrich our ability to reach individuals with long-term problems. FACAA population and the geographic area of services are Fulton County and the City of Atlanta. Operating in the largest county in Georgia, with the largest pool of low-income residents, FACAA consistently serves over 20,000 persons and households annually. Utilizing survey results from service recipients, FACAA programs are designed primarily from recommendations of people who know what they need, and we include the input of Board Members, Community leaders and elected officials. There are several services within the organization that empower and promote self-sufficiency for low-income residents of the City of Atlanta and Fulton County. All programs combine to form FACAA’s Academy for Life which offers classes, seminars, collaboratives and training that provides skills and enhanced ability to conquer demands of life not accomplished previously in the individuals’ lives.</p>

<p>Interested with the sensual experience of sound, Scott picked up his first guitar at age 15. The Frustration of the limitations of the instrument allowed Scott to slide into deep depression and mental instability, which eventually drove him to alcoholism. Over the next five year period, the initial desire to break the barriers of personal expression came to life. Meanwhile within the walls of a dark room, Michael began experimenting with synthesised sounds, going beyond artificial and introducing to the world electronic soundscapes that allowed him to capture unlimited raw human emotion, not usually associated with the electronic sound. The Samsara was formed through a mutual hate of Y2K syndrome currently plaguing modern culture. Y2K Syndrome: The cultural movement to imitate rather then innovate.</p>

<p>Donnie Lunsford A Sigma Chi Legend. Though he never did graduate from the University of Cincinnati after 7+ years, he did manage to pick up numeropus STD's and fail English 101 a record 5 times. Known to his friends as Momo, mainly due to his fascination with shiny things and Pete Rose, he certainly was a crowd pleaser. With his "hooded" member in hand, he would run around naked with a hockey mask covering his pudgy face. Though many of his fellow fraternity brothers thought he was just drunk, it was actually a Lunsford family ritual originating in Worcester, Mass in the 1800's. The ritual was meant to signify a love of stale beer and dirty skanks. Lunsford now 31, resides in Florida where he sleeps all day and eats his toe nails</p>

<p>Captain William Moore In 1858, Captain William "Billy" Moore came north from California with the gold seekers. He immediately entered the steamboat trade and began his life as a riverboat captain, a career which would span 50 years.</p>
<p>His first sternwheeler, Henrietta, operated on the Fraser River for many years, and over his career Captain Moore owned and operated many other vessels, including Alexandra, Glenora, Western Slope, Gertrude, and Rainbow.</p>
<p>Captain Moore was one of the most prominent captains on the Fraser River. He was a respected businessman, and had a major influence on Fraser River shipping. He also had a reputation of being an adventurer (even once being accused of piracy) and he made a name for himself in northern British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska, where he is credited with being the founder of Skagway.</p>
