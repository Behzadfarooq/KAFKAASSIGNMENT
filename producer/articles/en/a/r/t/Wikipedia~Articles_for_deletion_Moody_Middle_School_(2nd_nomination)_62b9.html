<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting, but the DCYSC is simply a list of what students participated in it (so some students from Moody were in, this is not a claim of notability), the other pieces are an uncritical puff-piece about girl scout cookies and a minor note on another website about the earlier school burning down. Other than a 1 or two sentence article I don't see how any of this would be useful for verifying any facts. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:11, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I stand corrected, that changes the matter slightly but not by much- winning a local science competition hardly qualifies as something notable nor would it allow us to expand the artice beyond another sentence still leaving this as a tiny stub. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:39, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a middle school, how notable does it have to be? A small town does not need to be notable as a person, and by the same logic not every topic needs excessive notability. Notability does not mean the article has room for improvement. Also, it is not a local science competition, it is a national competition. <a href="../../../h/i/g/User%7EHighInBC_48ba.html" title="User:HighInBC">HighInBC</a> <small><sup>(Need help? <a href="../../../h/i/g/User_talk%7EHighInBC_90e4.html" title="User talk:HighInBC">Ask me</a>)</sup></small> 00:44, 12 November 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Yes, that's precisely the issue- middle schools need to be notable just like everything else. If that makes most middle schools not notable, oh well. As to the town matter, I have stated on many occasions that as far as I am concerned it would make sense to have very towns merged or deleted (I think there are a few small arguments against this that differentiate towns from schools but the overall notion is sound). Also, maybe I'm misreading things here, but the candidates were only semi-finalists. As I understand it(correct me if I'm wrong) that means they placed at the local level. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:53, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am gathering from this that you think all subjects need to be held to equal notability standard? I know that by policy that bio's are held to a higher standard. Do you think countries and musical bands should have the same standards?</dd>

<dd>I apologies if I am making unrealistic comparisions, I try to avoid that.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Normally non-notable schools would be candidates for merging (per <a href="../../../l/o/c/WP%7ELOCAL_5ad0.html" title="WP:LOCAL">WP:LOCAL</a>, which enjoys more stability than the proposed <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>).

Since that article is already on the long side, I vote to keep (with the recognition that the "reputation" section is not encyclopedic at all and should be removed.) --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 06:52, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is nothing intrinsically wrong with someone using a sock to nominate an article for AfD, and if the nom's claims are weak they should be evaluated under that basis. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:28, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually you are not supposed to create a new account for the purposes of making controversial decisions.
