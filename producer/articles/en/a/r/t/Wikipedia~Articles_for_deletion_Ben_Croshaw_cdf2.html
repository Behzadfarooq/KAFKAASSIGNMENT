<li><b>Keep</b> If you delete this then go ahead and delete the <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Game_Studio_5281.html" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> article and all the games associated with it because Ben Crowshaw is the most notable creator for it. Then call for the deletion of all the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_Fiction_1313.html" title="Interactive Fiction">Interactive Fiction</a> articles and all related authors and games like <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Plotkin_1e75.html" title="Andrew Plotkin">Andrew Plotkin</a> and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photopia.html" title="Photopia">Photopia</a> because they're just as notable as Ben Crowshaw and his games. If you're not willing to do that then stop bothering these pages. Richard Cane 02:35, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's not a valid argument. Perhaps all of those things <i>should</i> be deleted if they're not sourced and proven to be notable. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 02:54, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, they <i>have</i> to be deleted because they <i>aren't</i> sourced or notable to the extent you seem to demand. Start with putting that deletion notice on <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Plotkin_1e75.html" title="Andrew Plotkin">Andrew Plotkin</a> and then work on over to <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Cadre_606f.html" title="Adam Cadre">Adam Cadre</a>. Delete their games and then go from there. I've provided you a list and all you have to do is put that deletion notice on them so you can clean house. Richard Cane 14:17, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I've decided to post a list to help you on your deletion crusade.
<p>Delete most of the games on these lists: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_freeware_games.html" title="List of freeware games">List of freeware games</a> <a href="../../../f/a/n/Category%7EFanmade_computer_game_remakes_and_sequels_d6d7.html" title="Category:Fanmade computer game remakes and sequels">Category:Fanmade computer game remakes and sequels</a></p>
<p>These aren't notable so delete this article: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_amateur_adventure_games.html" title="List of amateur adventure games">List of amateur adventure games</a></p>
<p>Why bother? Amateur developers aren't commercial and that makes them unimportant. Not notable: <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_adventure_game.html" title="Amateur adventure game">Amateur adventure game</a>.</p>
<p>These are what allow people to create their own games and not make a profit so I don't think anyone needs to know about these: <a href="../../../a/d/v/Category%7EAdventure_game_engines_7dcb.html" title="Category:Adventure game engines">Category:Adventure game engines</a>, <a href="../../../t/e/x/Category%7EText_adventure_game_engines_2bd3.html" title="Category:Text adventure game engines">Category:Text adventure game engines</a></p>
<p>Sorry Japs, not notable&#160;:-(: <a href="../../../d/o/j/Dojin_soft.html" title="Dojin soft">Dojin soft</a> <a href="../../../d/o/j/Category%7EDojin_soft_5caf.html" title="Category:Dojin soft">Category:Dojin soft</a> Richard Cane 03:16, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I have already tagged many such pages for deletion. However, it has nothing to do with being commercial. <i>Software is notable if it has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.</i> As it happens, very few games created by amateurs using game creation software can make that claim. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 03:45, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>To elaborate: it's clear to me that, say, <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cave_Story_6d82.html" title="Cave Story">Cave Story</a>, is quite notable, despite being noncommercial, due to the great deal of critical coverage in independent, notable, reliable sources. However, Ben Croshaw's titles do not have this sort of critical recognition. Not that I feel that they are without merit because they are obscure, but that they are simply not suited for a general purpose encyclopedia due to notability requirements. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 03:53, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seriously, how can the notable quality of Ben Croshaw even be worth of discussion? The guy won innumerous awards for his games, check out their pages:
<ul>
<li>www.fullyramblomatic.com/5days</li>
<li>www.fullyramblomatic.com/7days</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and that is just the tip of the iceberg
<p>The guy also ran a pretty famous webcomic... Please, if the <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" class="external free" title="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/</a> should put ONE person to be grateful of having as developer, he'd be chosen by far.</p>
<p>Also, he'd been featured in many specialized magazines (I'm sorry I don't know links to prove this, but I've seen such magazines.</p>
<p>And one more thing, to prove the man capabilities, he have been working on a fairly well known australian games mag to write for it (if you also don't belive this, buy a mag and see it for yourself)</p>
<p>I'm not a frequent wiki editor, so sorry if I made any mistakes here, I'm just trying to prove a point--200.178.127.73 04:07, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
</li>
<li>even more info about him:

<ul>
<li>That's a mirror of the Wikipedia article. If the only source that you can cite to demonstrate that this person satisfies our <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies</a> is the Wikipedia article itself, then not only does this person fail to satisfy the notability criteria, but the article content even fails to satisfy the <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> requirements. Please <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">cite sources</a> to show that the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria are satisfied. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:27, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then delete every author of an <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interactive_fiction.html" title="Interactive fiction">interactive fiction</a> title. Then delete every interactive fiction game and then proceed through the lists I've provided above. You can't just pick one group of authors and amateur games designed from <a href="../../../a/d/v/Adventure_Game_Studio_5281.html" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> while ignoring others who have just as much notability. Eliminate them all or don't even bother trying to argue about notability. Richard Cane 13:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I say, we <i>will</i> eliminate them all if they are as notable as Mr. Croshaw. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 14:32, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why the delay? Are you scared to touch the interactive fiction games and authors? Prove they are more notable than Ben Croshaw or delete as per norm. Richard Cane 14:43, 7 December 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since you say that they aren't notable, I'll get to them when I finish with the amateur adventure games. Face it, the "there are other things equally unnotable" argument isn't working. For now, this article must be assessed irrespective of any future deletions. <b><a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrevan_5d4d.html" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndrevan_e20d.html" title="User talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 21:28, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Croshaw is the most renowned developer of AGS freeware adventure games, is well known amongst the freeware adventure community, has a very large following AND has had his games featured in UK PC Magazines. I think you need to leave him alone. Mark</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The above user is right, two of his adventure games (5 days a stranger and 7 days a skeptic) were included on the February 2006 PCGamer UK DVD, issue 158, as 'some of the best' of modern freeware adventure games. -- <a href="../../../c/a/t/User%7ECatriona_McM_64eb.html" title="User:Catriona McM">Catriona McM</a> 16:27, 11 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Many of yahtzee's games have been on cover disks of print magazines.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is an interactive online encyclopedia, You should be able to search for and find out about as many things as possible. Whats the point of deleting something that is perfectly informative and relavant? If this and it's related articles were nonsense about a nobody then it's understandable that it should not exist. However Ben Crowshaw is a well known AGS developer with a cult following, I see no reason whatsoever why he should not be listed here for anybody who wants to find out about him to be able to do a search. Anything that says otherwise in your policy is just Bureaucracy and you Mr. Andrew "Power trip" Fader are using that policy to achieve your own ends. 148.197.133.135 13:05, 13 December 2006 (UTC) Walexei</li>
