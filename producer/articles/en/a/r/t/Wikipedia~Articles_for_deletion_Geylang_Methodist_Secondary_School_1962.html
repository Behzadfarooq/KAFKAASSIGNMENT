<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was (apparently) Deleted, perhaps because of the copyvio, and possibly ignoring the late Keep votes resulting from GRider's posts on multiple User_talk pages. The admin who deleted the article did not close the VfD in the usual way. I am just adding the closure templates. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 22:59, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually, it would be detrimental. The important words are "proper article". An encyclopaedia is not simply a directory. It contains <i>knowledge</i>, not mere information. To be worthy of a "proper article", an entity that is one of thousands (or, as in this case one of hundreds of thousands if not millions) has to stand out from the crowd for some reason. There has to be something more than can be inferred from the fact that it is a school (and thus has all of the things that that entails, such as enrollment, teachers, songs, crests, buildings, sports teams, and so forth). <a href="../../../h/i/g/High_schools_in_Connecticut_6c1b.html" title="High schools in Connecticut">High schools in Connecticut</a>, before its deletion, showed how large numbers of entities with lack of individual notability can be handled.

<li><i>The reasons why notable schools get deleted while articles about fictional bus drivers get kept is due to systematic bias</i> â€” That is a flawed argument that assumes the erroneous premise that the schools actually <i>are</i> notable. Out of the millions of schools in the world, the overwhelming majority <i>are not</i> notable (despite all of the efforts of <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_academic_boosterism_a43b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid academic boosterism">academic boosterism</a> to the contrary). School articles get deleted because there is nothing of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance</a> to say about the schools and the articles are tantamount to directory entries. <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a directory</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:06, 2005 Feb 21 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Notabillity is a POV, which is sculpted by systematic bias. You have the bias that schools are not notable as your POV, but realize that there are other people who think that they are notable. If you don't think that they are notable then don't read them, but getting them deleted and denying the people who do think they are notable to write about them is bad. Thats why deletionists are bad for the Wikipedia project and they must change their ways. Think KEEP, make Wikipedia more comprehensive and therefore useful, or a merge and redirect to an article in your POV is notable enough to include. For exmaple, a few weeks ago, someone wrote an article about <b>MY</b> former school! Instead of listing it on VFD, I merged and redirected it into the town that it was in, that is a much better soloution. See <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thornbury%2C_South_Gloucestershire_7131.html#Schools_in_Thornbury" title="Thornbury, South Gloucestershire">article about it</a>. If more people kept or merged and redirected there will be less aruments on VFD and Wikipedia will be a better encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorm_25a0.html" title="User:Norm">Norman Rogers</a>\<sup><a href="../../../n/o/r/User_talk%7ENorm_b46b.html" title="User talk:Norm">talk</a></sup> 15:39, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In regards to claims of vote-stacking, their are large amounts of people who beleive well-written articles for schools are inherently notable. Merely bringing an article to someones attention is no more votestacking than providing a link for someone is. If you'll notice, GRider's contributions were far and wide and not concentrated on any bloc or mailing list group. Speaking for myself, I evaluated the article and voted to keep it out of sincere belief that it deserved to be kept and not out of any votestacking motivation. I have faith that the majority of the other voters did as well. Thank you for your time. -<a href="../../../c/u/n/User%7ECunningLinguist_5ed1.html" title="User:CunningLinguist">CunningLinguist</a> 03:56, 6 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
