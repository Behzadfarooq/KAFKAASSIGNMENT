<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see sufficient independent press coverage, which would be needed to provide a reliable bio on him. I don't think blog quotes, are sufficient sufficient counter-balance. Also, the subject matter that this guy writes on, guarentees this article will permanently attract link spammers. One of the blog links, used to provide criticism/balance, includes a sales pitch for the guy's book. While I'm sure editor who added that link, did so in good faith, it's links to advertisements like that, which are extremely difficult to protect against. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 21:05, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Quintin, as you have interest in this area, why not work together on creating an NPOV article on the community, which does not unduly promote DeAngelo or any other commercial interest? The point is to explain the <a href="../../../m/e/n/Men%27s_rights.html" title="Men's rights">men's rights</a> movement from which DeAngelo and Ross Jeffries have been profiting. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 15:12, 5 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It depends on the outcome of this vote.

If this article is deleted, I am not willing to spend another ten hours researching and removing <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam.html" title="Spam">spam</a> only to have it risk deletion also. If you want to change your vote to "keep," and work to improve this article, the article on the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_community.html" title="Seduction community">seduction community</a>, and the article on <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Jeffries_4e44.html" title="Ross Jeffries">Ross Jeffries</a>, then I would certainly be willing to help you. --<a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuintin3265_8d7f.html" title="User:Quintin3265">Quintin3265</a> 15:19, 5 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Quintin, what you don't realize is that <i>everything</i> related to the seduction community is regarded as commercial spam by a large number of WP deletionists. We need to start from the beginning without any promotional biases toward any particular website or any commercial seduction teacher. (This article is the most poorly written of the three you mentioned and the most POV.) Lest you or I be accused of sockpuppetry or spamming. The bottom line for a lot of people is that the subject of guys picking up women is controversial and not notable, regardless of the amount of Google hits, television and newspaper coverage. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 09:56, 6 October 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> There are currently <a href="../../../a/f/d/AfD_0ef6.html" title="AfD">AfD</a> and VfU votes taking place for this article, for <a href="../../../r/o/s/Ross_Jeffries_4e44.html" title="Ross Jeffries">Ross Jeffries</a> and for <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>. DeAngelo and Jeffries are two of the big commercial teachers to come out of the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>. These two are also the ones who do extensive Internet marketing, so you will definitely get some Google hits for them. Where media coverage is concerned, the most interesting (and IMO most NPOV) story revolves around the <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> itself and covers a number of the "schools of thought" on this phenomenon. <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a> had an extensive list of media references due to the recent publication of a book on the subject, 'The Game' by Neill Strauss. <a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 04:15, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> So was David DeAngelo (referenced in this new best-selling book 'The Game' by Neill Strauss). All the more reason to keep the article, as his program is now referenced in mainstream materials. To make an arguement something needs to be removed because there's a commercial element to it would require removal of every product/company article on Wiki (IE - movies, high-tech companies, etc.) And yes, his material changed my life as well. -- <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarrettmagic_ed4a.html" title="User:Barrettmagic">Barrettmagic</a> 07:51, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> Barrett, I agree. See my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DutchSeduction" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DutchSeduction" rel="nofollow">talk page</a> and the VfU for <a href="../../../s/e/d/Seduction_Community_12c9.html" title="Seduction Community">Seduction Community</a>, which endeavors to provide an unbiased portrayal of the seduction community - i.e. the trainers, books, etc, teaching people how to seduce women. The topic overall is notable. The problem is that the subject is also controversial and a spam target. You are showing bias to one particular businessman in this case. He himself should probably be a footnote in a bigger story as he is barely mentioned in Neill Strauss' book. <small><a href="../../../d/u/t/User%7EDutchSeduction_7022.html" title="User:DutchSeduction">DutchSeduction</a> 12:26, 7 October 2005 (UTC)</small></dd>
