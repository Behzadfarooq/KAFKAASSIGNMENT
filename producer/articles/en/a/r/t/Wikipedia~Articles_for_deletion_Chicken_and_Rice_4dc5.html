<li><b>Comment</b> That is indeed exactly the problem. It is a food cart operated by (as far as I could tell form the article, no sources given) a maximum of 4 people. I might as well be doing an article on the local hotdog stand next to work. That seems pretty popular too and even has a heater during winter. Nevermind sources or notability, I'll just refer to some award hosted by a free webhosting provider. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 11:19, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

This article is neither. On top of that this place is VERY notable. Quick research shows that this site has been covered by multiple independent sources stating <i>"I work in this area and occasionally go to carts like these, but wikipedia is not an open advertising space/directory for random food carts"</i> is a completely irrelevent argument because the notability of "a food cart" compared to that of Chicken and Rice is the same thing as saying I have met people therefore George W. Bush is no different. This stand is a has been cited as a place for strengthening the muslim communities in New York and is a constant hot spot in New York for food. Secondly, the article is CITED, just because there are a few uncited sources does not warrent a delete. New York city is a large city, how is nominations for the vendy award not notable? <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 22:19, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>/Restated Keep First thing to KEEP in mind <b>AFD is not a vote</b> please dont leave per someone if there is already counter-argument to that argument. Before anyone votes please read through this response. I am sorry, but I am very busy right now with school, however I agree per nom that this article needs to be cleaned of word weasels in order to remain NPOV.

<p>First of all the Street Vendor Project, Vendy awards is a New York City sponsored public program run by Urban Justice <a href="http://www.urbanjustice.org/ujc/projects/street.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.urbanjustice.org/ujc/projects/street.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> therefore winning the Vendy Awards is notable since it is a public program of New York City. A statement of "street vendors" in my town has also won an award is irrelavent since NYC is among the most notable cities in the world. Also this article pass notability and is not a self promotion since it has been cited by multiple indepedent sources. I will go over a list of citations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>1. Chicken and Rice is an integral part of student life at <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_University_dca5.html" title="New York University">New York University</a>. It is a major hot spot for food among NYU students. <a href="http://www.nyunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/11/02/45499fc3d45d0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nyunews.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/11/02/45499fc3d45d0" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></li>
<li>2. The stabbing involved was directly related to the food served by the vendor. The lines can grow so long that a person stab another person for "cutting in line". Name me another food stand that can do this. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/466625p-392516c.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/466625p-392516c.html" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></li>
<li>3. Chicken and Rice has won a notable award from a public service of New York City. It is has been cited as <i>"uniting the Muslim community from the tri-state area and beyond in their search for halal food"</i> <a href="http://streetvendor.netfirms.com/public_html/staticpages/index.php?page=20051021224336800" class="external autonumber" title="http://streetvendor.netfirms.com/public_html/staticpages/index.php?page=20051021224336800" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></li>
<li>4. As both a Wikipedia editor with a good history and a customer of Chicken and Rice, I can be a primary source to this event. All of the information on the page is true minus the POV comments. The food itself is amazing and is more notable than even the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Grease_Trucks_8ebf.html" title="Grease Trucks">Grease Trucks</a> and can generate unbelievable lines. <a href="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/best-street-food-53rd-and-6th-avenue-206492.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gridskipper.com/travel/new-york/best-street-food-53rd-and-6th-avenue-206492.php" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> I live in <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princeton%2C_New_Jersey_b719.html" title="Princeton, New Jersey">Princeton, New Jersey</a> and have travelled countless times to NYC just for a platter.

<li><b>Comment</b> AfD is a voting process. You cannot "Restate" your keep and tell everyone else they cannot vote because of it. Doesn't matter if you are in school.

<li><b>Response</b> One can use a primary source to establish facts, just not for establishing notability. Many of the statement in that article can be sourced by simply going to Chicken and Rice. I was stating that I have been there and can confirm its accuracy (as can anyone) not that I was trying to create a new precedence.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have restored my former edit. I stated that Wikipedia is not a vote, because a few editors were saying the same thing. The reason why I said "Before anyone votes please read through this response" is because I tried by best to disprove many of the reasons why this article was nominated in the first place. I cited sources to disprove WP:OR and that this article was WP:V. I wanted to put an emphysis on what I said which is why asked people to read my comment. However this statement was irrelevant to the debate which is why I removed it not because I was trying to hide something. Also my statement about being busy with school was because I initially did not have time to edit the Chicken and Rice article so I was hoping someone else could, however I did so anyways, which is why I removed that statement as well. Because of issues unrelated to this AfD I was forced to put it back in. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 17:47, 14 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>; This is actually a well known New York establishment, although the write-up should do more to establish it's notability.

<dd>Not just this one person - only a few instances of "opinion canvassing". but its not a good trend. I'm not sure if this variety of vote-stacking is technically out of order, but it's just not cricket. I could selectively post messages "asking for their opinion" on the talk pages of editors I know have deletionist tendencies or are friendly with me, and I could post an one-sided perception of the debate on the talk pages of admins too, but I don't do it because its not in the spirit of afd <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 19:33, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response</b> I have only asked for the opinion of EveryKing and Easyas12c. My calling for Easyas12c was more because he is an inclusionist, however I did not ask him to say keep, just what he felt given the circumstances, however for Everyking, it was completely neutral. I wasn't asking Mailer Diablo for an opinion on the AfD itself, just who he felt had the stronger argument. In fact you have asked me for my opinoin for several AfD as well, it happens all the time. I see nothing wrong with asking for notable Wikipedia editors for opinions, it is not the same asking sockpuppets and random people. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 20:17, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If a push cart is a New York landmark then apparently I haven't missed much which I find strange given what I have otherwise heard of New York as a great place to visit. Seriously, am I the only one who finds this devotion to a food cart a little too much? I can understand they serve great food but this is just an odd AfD when you really think about it.

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with MartinDK. While this article is now less POV in tone, it's still just an article about a food cart.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I disagree, all POV references have been removed, the article most certainly establish notability as there was both a stabbing over the food because of the demand and the nomination for top 4 food cart's in New York City. This article was nominated for POV and OR and based off my reading both have been removed. Also, what do you mean just a food cart? <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnathan_Wendel_90df.html" title="Johnathan Wendel">Johnathan Wendel</a> is "just" video game player, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Carl_Roberts_4210.html" title="Charles Carl Roberts">Charles Carl Roberts</a> is "just" a murderer, and the <a href="../../../w/e/l/Wellesley_College_Senate_bus_dfc6.html" title="Wellesley College Senate bus">Wellesley College Senate bus</a> is "just" a bus. Are you suggesting that food carts can not have articles despite notability claims? Of course a small cart in Shanghai won't get an article unless it establishes notability. If that cart in Shanghai is rank one of the best food carts in China then it most certainly deserves an article. Wikipedia is not bias. Simpleerob 22:43, 15 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Firstly, AFD is not a vote. It looks like one, it has a lot in common with one, but it isn't a vote. It's an attempt to achieve a consensus decision, or failing that, to measure community feeling. The closing admin uses the page to make a decision, considering first the weight of argument, and then perhaps the weight of numbers. Mistakes happen, which is why <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> exists. The raw numbers are a part of the process, sometimes they they are even the major part of it, but it's not a vote.</dd>
<dd>Regarding this specific page, <b>merge</b> to <a href="../../../f/o/o/Food_cart.html" title="Food cart">food cart</a>. Most of this article should be chopped, but there are things in there that are not in food cart, such as a description of how the cart works, typical food. Maybe the bit about customer demographics and probably the stabbing. I think there is enough mentions of Chicken and Rice to earn it a line in 'food cart' but not an entire article of its own.
