<p>This is an unusual case.</p>
<p>This article (concerning a cast member of the television show <i>Big Brother</i>) was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Janelle_Pierzina_0db9.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Janelle Pierzina">originally listed for deletion</a> on 1 September. On 8 September, I closed out a number of AfDs, including the one in question. I interpreted the discussion as a rough consensus to redirect the article to the main <i>Big Brother</i> television series article. Two users <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html#Janelle_Pierzina_vote" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo">took issue with my interpretation of the AfD</a>, so in the interests of total transparency I made a detailed enumeration of my logic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJanelle_Pierzina&amp;diff=22878563&amp;oldid=22876281" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AJanelle_Pierzina&amp;diff=22878563&amp;oldid=22876281" rel="nofollow">on the article's talk page</a>. A number of users continued to express concern over my handling of the matter, and have <a href="../../../j/a/n/Talk%7EJanelle_Pierzina_c3e4.html" title="Talk:Janelle Pierzina">called the fairness of my actions into question</a>.</p>
<p>I do not believe that I did anything wrong in the closing of this AfD; I stand by my decision. My action, however, has created sufficient consternation that I feel it is necessary to re-list the article here at AfD and allow an opportunity for a clearer consensus to be reached. I will not be closing this AfD, and my nomination here does not constitute any sort of vote. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 10:35, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - One of the most notable members of a hit show on prime-time nationally broadcast network TV. She was a nationally published model, before even going on the show. National media coverage of her as an individual, including controversies, have beeen covered by the media. Her weekly deeds are followed by millions. She is one of just four remaining contestants on show. She's been on most of the season. She was voted one of two most popular in nationwide pole. A good stable precident is <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_Idol_b300.html" title="Canadian Idol">Canadian Idol</a> which typically has 8-10 articles per season for contestants. Strong keep for high notability. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 11:09, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Big Brother has been going on for several years in several countries. The shows have their entries and until something exceptional can be said about Janelle, please <b>merge</b> into the article for that BB run. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 13:48, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I'm of the opinion that the decision on whether to merge is an editing matter and should be decided by the consensus of editors on an ongoing basis. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> did a good faith close and his decision was fair, and I affirm his right to exclude the opinions of editors with few edits on the basis of their inexperience. But I've given this a lot of thought myself in the past, and after much reflection I've decided that it's not my business as an AfD closer to go around telling editors that they can't ever make or break a redirect because the outcome of an AfD debate some time in the past supported that redirect. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:16, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Comment: To those supporting a merge, any and all BB merger discussion should be in one central spot: <a href="../../../b/i/g/Talk%7EBig_Brother_%28USA_TV_series%29_0621.html#Merge" title="Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)">Talk:Big Brother (USA TV series)#Merge</a>. So far, any suggestion of merger has been rejected by editors of the main article, partly because the article is already to big. Hence, a vote here for a merge, won't result in a merge, but rather (what amounts to) a page blanking. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 15:42, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> please wikipedia is not paper and this is a real long article so why should we redirect it that does not even make sense <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 17:39, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Janelle, as I previously said, is The PEOPLE'S favourite to win the show. Having other members on Wikipedia who are not even questioned is found unfair. Keep her.</li>

<li>Comment- seeing as my last vote was discounted for not crossing the edit threshold (which I understand, although it's a little irritating), I just want to add that my vote would still be <b>Keep</b>- Janelle has been one of the summer's breakout stars on a show that is consistently rated in the top 15 of the Nielsen ratings. I don't advocate a page for every contestant on the show, but for a person as popular as Janelle a page should be created (at least for the wiki-niche of reality nuts). --<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatadyBag_273f.html" title="User:PatadyBag">PatadyBag</a> 18:46, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Reply: "CBS's Big Brother 6 premiered well on Thursday, handily winning its 8-9PM ET/PT time period in both total viewers and key demographics and teaming with CSI and Without A Trace repeats to lead CBS to a clean sweep in the night's primetime ratings.

<li>"premiered" is not "maintained its audience". Tell me where it ranks now, not what it ranked in the first episode. And I am only voting delete because of all of the POV pushers who insist on keeping these as sepearate articles on the day-to-day eating habits of people who should be merged and redirected to the Big Brother article. And your comments on Katherine Beck are completely inappropriate and as a result, I will change my vote back. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 04:20, September 11,</li>

<li>Oh, and by the way, I watch this stupid show. So it isn't elitism or anything like that, it's a matter of trying to figure what makes any of these pathetic people notable.

<li>Comment: On it's sixth season, it opened at 8.5 million and still has 8.2 million; that sounds like a "maintained audience" to me. With only four contestants left, that's over two million per contestant.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't stand the woman personally, and I agree that every person who was on a reality show is not deserving of an entry, but Pierzina has filmed a major television pilot (despite it's not being picked up) and has appeared in several other acting roles.
