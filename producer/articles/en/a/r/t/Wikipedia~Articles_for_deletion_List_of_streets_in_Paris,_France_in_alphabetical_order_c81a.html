<li><b>Keep</b> This is part of the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Portal%7EParis_2a63.html" title="Portal:Paris">Portal:Paris</a> project. These lists are a useful way of finding information. Nobody is saying that every entry is going to be turned into a blue link but the important streets will (and should) have their own entries. Even the red links have some value as a data source. The of lists itself is a clear keep as method of organisation. The sublist commencing with Z for example is now complete. Seeing as this reorganisation has only happened over the last couple of days I suggest giving it some time to see how it works out before deleting it. Also, its not really correct to say that this is a recreation of Paris streets-list - it's a reorganisation which is proposed on that Afd talk page and to which nobody objected. And finally I disagree that this violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a directory - that is using directory in quite a different sense. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 00:25, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b> I think there's a danger of confusing two separate issues here - the question of the size of these lists/their possibly unencyclopedaic content and the separate question of how to organise a list of streets. Most of the negartive comment above seem to be driven by an understandable wish not to have large lists of unencyclopedaic streets. I suggest the way to achieve that is open to any editor - just go into a list and delete some/all of the entries. Other editors can later recreate articles from scratch for any streets that are notable enough. Alternatively, we can leave some/all the red links as an encouragement for people to turn the important ones blue and that was my motivation for reformatting the original list. There seem to be only about 20 live street links which is too few for a major city like Paris - we should try to encourage creation of others. I think is useful to have the structure of a master list and sublists and I feel it would be a pity to remove that - that would be the result of this Afd as currently formulated. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 08:58, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Perfect example of a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">collection of indiscriminate information</a>. And the comparison between this list and the list of roads in Hong Kong is utterly pointless; the Hong Kong list has a) discrimination and b) some actual <i>writing</i>, which this doesn't. What is it with listcrufters and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia_talk%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Scientology_centers_75d4.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Articles for deletion/List of Scientology centers">making irrelevant comparisons</a>? --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 12:18, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another pointless comparison- Hong Kong list created Nov 1, 2004, Paris list created December 2005. That left a bit more of a margin for writing. Oh, and the HK list's discrimination is that it is incomplete, I assume once completed it gets deleted-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 12:41, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>No, once it becomes an indiscriminate collection of information it gets reverted. I don't think they're heading in that direction, given the "Here is a partial list" disclaimer. It's incomplete because they haven't included every single <i>notable</i> street, not because they haven't included every single back alley and cul-de-sac. And if this list is unfinished, then as I've said time and again, it can be worked on somewhere else and recreated when it doesn't contravene <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, at which point it won't be eligible for speedy deletion. Moreover, the Hong Kong article never looked like this - check the history. P.S. What's the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> for this? The back of the Paris A-Z? --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 12:51, 22 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, verifiability is a major concern. Imagine the havoc that could result if a non-existent street snuck on to one of these lists. Therefore, I guess we should set up a project to source all our road lists such as List_of_roads_and_expressways_in_Singapore, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Nova_Scotia_provincial_highways_b91c.html" title="List of Nova Scotia provincial highways">List of Nova Scotia provincial highways</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_numbered_routes_in_Massachusetts_0284.html" title="List of numbered routes in Massachusetts">List of numbered routes in Massachusetts</a>. I prefer individual footnotes for each street, but am open to suggestions. The project could run for some time, though, given that there are at least 75 more of these lists <a href="../../../l/i/s/Category%7ELists_of_roads_2128.html" title="Category:Lists of roads">Category:Lists of roads</a>. Of course, the better route might be a blanket nom on AfD, particularly if maps such as Paris A-Z are the only available source. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 02:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I would support a merge to List of notable streets in Paris for instance, pruning the list heavily.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Sorry guys, but, as it is, it must go, as it lacks any context. Had I known it would make such a fuss I wouldn't have uploaded it in the first place - true that that kind of data is not easy to come by (and it <i>was</i> a lot of work to compile) but I had second thoughts (Encyclopaedic?) almost right after I saw it in place, and tended to agree with its (almost immediate) nomination for deletion. By the way, this list is in no way "part of" the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Portal%7EParis_2a63.html" title="Portal:Paris">Portal:Paris</a> project - I uploaded this on a completely different whim. There is still much work to do on the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Portal%7EParis_2a63.html" title="Portal:Paris">Portal:Paris</a> page so if you would like turn your attention there and take this "data" to a personal page to fill it out somewhat (all those redlinks!) at a more liesurely pace, maybe we can do something with it later.

<p><b>Comment</b> I've now created <a href="../../../r/u/e/Rue_de_l%27Abbaye_94e3.html" title="Rue de l'Abbaye">Rue de l'Abbaye</a> - a notable street.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's unencyclopedic to have these useless lists of unnotable streets - it just slows down access to notable ones.

<p><b>Comment</b> - You know what rings a bell for me? The <i>category</i> "Streets of Paris". If every street in Paris had an article with a "Category:Streets of Paris" tag at the bottom of it, the "Streets of Paris" <i>category page</i> would end up looking like the list of streets. And in alphabetical order to boot. That way the list wouldn't be an article in itself. Articles on every Paris street - WikiProject? The list of streets as it is could be a Talk page "to do" list.

<p><b>Comment</b> - Frankly I don't see the use of grouping these two together on a "France" page - the general consensus (and even my own, the creator of this error) was to delete this article in favour of attributing categories as indicated in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Paris_Streets_ba6d.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Paris Streets">Paris Streets</a> project. So for this particular list, to the bit bucket!</p>
