<p>None of these asteroids are notable and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> an indiscriminate list of information <a href="../../../n/a/r/User%7ENardman1_ed82.html" title="User:Nardman1">Nardman1</a> 02:11, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Are you serious? None of the asteroids are notable? How do you measure the notability of an asteroid? Although Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information, this list can hardly be considered a useless collection of facts. Lists like this which maintain valuable scientific information are exactly the sort of data which make Wikipedia useful. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 02:33, 11 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Maybe someone should write a guideline at WP:ASTEROID? In any case I'm not really advocating this article's deletion, just questioning its place on Wikipedia.

<li>If you ask me, the guidelines at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> are totally inappropriate in this particular instance. It's not like any newspaper columnists are going to write a review about an asteroid.

<li>That is a problem I've been mulling over. The 100-count pages were created to ease editing and server load; they are not meant to be browsed directly.

<li><b>Delete</b> I may be a voice crying in the wilderness on this one, but... this is a list of trivial astronomical information. None of these asteroids have articles, probably never will. Is Wikipedia a host for reams and reams of trivial astronomical info? What is next - bulk star catalogs? Does everyone realize how much data this would mean, and how little it would be of value to anyone except astronomers? Grains of sand on the beach, stars in the sky... asteroids are not far behind.

<li><b>Note</b> I'm going to bold this, because I think everyone voting should read it. <b>If you look on the Minor Planet Center site where this list came from, you can see clearly that there are 150,000 of these asteroids identified so far.</b> Yes, that is "one hundred and fifty thousand" - and thousands discovered each year. How many of these is anyone <i>ever</i> going to care about? Probably 0.1% of them, if that. Why don't we start a list of NOTABLE asteroids? This enormous list of astronomical trivia belongs on Wikisource, if anywhere other than the Minor Planet site. I also took a look at the copyright terms, and I have no idea if our usage is legal as is; my guess would be not, principally because we haven't reformatted or reworked the data in any way.--<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 08:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that we are not an indiscriminate collection of data, but I'm inclined to feel that this data is not indiscriminate: we're not seeking to list every grain of sand in the sky, we're simply providing an organised arrangement of data. Although obscure, I'd rather have the complete list than edited highlights in a "list of notables". <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:06, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> — It should be possible to come up with a concensus for what makes an asteroid notable (or any Solar System object for that matter). We shouldn't have to record every single 100m rock in the sky. Here's a few thoughts:
<ul>
<li>It was discovered prior to the use of photography for finding asteroids.</li>
<li>It has had (or will have) a close approach by a spacecraft.</li>
<li>There is a solid diameter and/or mass estimate, along with good orbital elements.</li>
<li>It has been imaged by radar or other sensors, including but not limited to occultation profiles.</li>
<li>It has unusual spectral properties.</li>
<li>It has had (or will have) a close-Earth encounter.</li>
<li>It is known to have a moon.</li>
<li>There is a published paper on the asteroid.</li>
<li>It is a trojan asteroid for a terrestrial planet.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, there are lots of these rocks out there, but "notability" applies to <i>individual</i> asteroids, in my mind. I feel the Wikipedia list is much easier to consult than the MPC or Lowell astorb data files, if only for the links. I would love to see how it could be deposited in Wikisource --we've kept the discovery data and "meanings of names" lists separate precisely with Wikisource in mind. As for copyright concerns, the list is scientific data. We have reformatted it massively (all the wikicode in the individual pages, plus the organisation into blocks of 100 asteroids). I'm certain there is no problem whatsoever on that axis. <a href="../../../u/r/h/User%7EUrhixidur_9dbb.html" title="User:Urhixidur">Urhixidur</a> 00:45, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question Is this tied to an article about these asteroids?</b> Could someone answer this question? If it's not tied to any article that discusses these asteroids it's simply a list of asteroids and doesn't belong on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 03:31, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There is no article about these asteroids because there is no encyclopedic information about them. The data in the lists could be supplemented with orbital elements and magnitudes but that's it for most of them (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_asteroids.html" title="List of asteroids">List of asteroids</a> for the complete run down). I say <b>transwiki</b> the whole kit-and-cabbodle to wikisource and ony allow lists of asteroids that are named or otherwise assert notability. These lists are clearly useful but they are also clearly directories which Wikipedia is expressly <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a>. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 08:08, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
