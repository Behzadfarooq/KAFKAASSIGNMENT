<li><b>Speedy keep.</b> It is current Wikipedia practice to feature articles grouping like events, situations and individuals. That the article is unimportant to Kenwilliams does not mean it is unimportant to others. That it is poorly sourced, I concede. This, like many other Wikipedia articles could benefit from a thorough documentation effort. But are we now going to delete all insufficiently sourced articles?! That the historical couples are not "real couples" is an extreme and unsupported contention, as well as an indefensible generalization. As for this being said of some people in order to stigmatize them, perhaps, but we will really have to examine each case in question - that is no reason to throw the whole lot into the dustbin. And why assume that this was universally stigmatizing?! That is a pov contention. In many cases, it was seen as praiseworthy. Modern history examples in question?! Such as? What this article needs is a group of interested editors to subject it to the healthy dialectic of Wikipedia editing, pruning and adding as consensus develops, instead of being swept under this or that ideological rug. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 22:01, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>For an historican like me it's hard to read such rubbish like this article. Ofcourse they are stigmatized. Maybe you can imagine - not at all times in history it was OK to be gay. Such rumours were used to stigmate people. An other problem I forget - here the authors mixed gay and pererastic "couples". The wohle article from the beginning to the end is pure horror. But I belive the article will be keeped. The en:WP seems to the other WP's like a dustbin/ashcan. Such POV-articles without sources, without using modern literature will keep. And actually neraly the only argument for keeping is the reproach, I'm a POV-warrior. It's funny. But I have nothing against such a list (is not important who with who - but at the end it's also not bad) - but <b>this</b> list is to delete. Thers nothing more to say. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwilliams_44c4.html" title="User:Kenwilliams">Kenwilliams</a> 10:44, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I am sorry, but your vehemence renders your criticism suspect. It is not our concern whether accusations of sodomy stigmatized or not their targets. These people often went to their death, together with their lovers - are we expected to believe that they were all framed and drawn up on false charges?! And then you say that we mixed gay and pederastic couples. But does that statement not refute your contention - that these were indeed pederastic couples? As for the alleged mix, will you now argue that only those who bedded young adolescents were pederasts, and those who loved older adolescents were not? What are you basing yourself on for making your distinction? Sources? You are right, but that was discussed already. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 12:12, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>If so, that's disappointing - he should know better.

<p><i>Unimportant</i> is only one point of some. Interesting, that the Keepers try to reduct it to this point. I'm a studied historian (I know, this is in the en:Wiki a bad point, people who are experts are not welcome), with special subject (ancient) culture history. I know, how ta handle the sources. The author of the article seems to have a problem with this. And to the personal attacks: I think it's interesting, why people are for keeping the article. Instead to cry, the main author should work on the list - for keeping the List must be free from any rumours - only couples without any doubt could be list there. And there are much less than on the list. And all must be referenced with serious sources. In my opinion there should be a new start without the actuel main author - he seems to be a POV-pusher in his own way. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwilliams_44c4.html" title="User:Kenwilliams">Kenwilliams</a> 14:48, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The tone of your discourse speaks louder than your claim of being a historian. Likewise your disparagement of the English language version. Is this how you go about editing your version of the wikipedia, with personal attacks and denigration of others?! Sounds like a pretty unpleasant environment. At any rate, despite your odd attempt to disqualify me from further editing, allow me to say that <i>you</i> would be welcome to contribute to the article, as you already have. Then perhaps we can hash out who should and who should not be featured, rather than engaging in pointless diatribe. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 23:15, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Definition of pederasty seems to wobble between chaste relationship and a physical one. Many of the pairings are unverifiable and subjective. Inclusion of living persons violates WP:BLP unless they acknowledge it or there are other verifiable proofs such as legal proceedings, i.e. conviction of the older person.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>There is no "wobble." Pederasty can be either chaste or sexual, this is well known by anyopne who has studied the various historical forms of the practice, and is discussed in the literature. The rest of the criticisms are unanswerable for being too vague. <a href="../../../h/a/i/User%7EHaiduc_5b55.html" title="User:Haiduc">Haiduc</a> 01:16, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> To call something "unimportant" (as did kenwilliams) is completely POV, so to that extent, the opinion doesn't matter in the least. I completely agree that sourcing and references should be improved, but the key aspect of an encyclopedia is that it should be full of as many topics as is possible. Let the reader decide what is or is not important to them. vertium 19:17, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>How small must a mind be, to say it would be important what a people like? I know here it's important if a person ist gay or bisexual. But normally people don't define themsolve about sexuality. Only if they are ill in some way. One of the biggest mistakes here at the en:Wiki is, that's more important what a people "is", than what he does. I know from the beginning this article will be keeped. <a href="../../../k/e/n/User%7EKenwilliams_44c4.html" title="User:Kenwilliams">Kenwilliams</a> 14:48, 1 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
