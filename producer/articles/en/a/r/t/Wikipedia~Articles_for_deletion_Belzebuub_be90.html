<p>Belzebuub is a notable character. He is known by tens of thousands of individuals who have been greatly affected by his life and work. It is arrogant of you to state that he is "non-notable" when people around the world take part in his courses and read his books. See Amazon on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Belzebuub/102-3367402-9363309" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Belzebuub/102-3367402-9363309" rel="nofollow">Belzebuub</a></p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> Just get rid of it, apparently nobody on Wikipedia has an open mind enough to find the information of any use; from what pure nonsense i've seen here, nobody here is even worthy receiving this information. Since the only spiritual beliefs that matter to Wikipedians are those of the corrupt organizations already in existence; anything that isn't already corrupted by mainstream mediocrity and greed should be deleted. Only corrupt mainstream-accepted information is allowed on the Wikipedia (i.e. information from organizations that collect large sums of money from their members "on behalf of god"), not information from individuals who give away electronic copies of their information and seek no financial support from their students. Good luck finding any truly valuable information from an organization founded on the pervasive principles of modern day religious organizations. I'm sorry that I'm not like everyone else, and I'm sorry that Belzebuub has a different way of portraying himself than most people. I hope that reading the article didn't offend anyone's fragile constitution. Adreamsoul 20:07, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, I forgot the outrageously POV aspect: <i>Known to history as a famous demon, Belzebuub later repented in the internal worlds with the help of Master Samael Aun Weor - wanting to transform himself back into a Being of light. To do this, he was given a physical body with the name of Mark H. Pritchard</i>. Is that supposed to be an encyclopedic statement? <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 03:02, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>i don't see why the wikipedia should discount this information merely because it is of a spiritual nature. Channels and other spiritual leaders have done a great deal to help humanity. The work of Belzebuub has helped many people achieve the ability to perform <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astral_Projection_452f.html" title="Astral Projection">Astral Projection</a>; it has also helped many people to become aware of higher spiritual states. I, honestly, cannot see the harm in displaying such ideas. Adreamsoul 03:43, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The problem is not the ideas, but their presentation from a single point of view. If kept, the material would need presenting in a way acceptable to both those who believe it and to the majority of readers who think it extremely unlikely that some guy in Australia is literally the incarnation of a reformed major-league demon. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 10:54, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes, you're right, Zoe. It happens quite commonly elsewhere. I actually am the incarnation of Asmodeus. A man called Obi Khan Wenobi, showed me the error of my ways, and I'm a being of light now. <a href="../../../t/e/a/User%7ETearlach_4ffa.html" title="User:Tearlach">Tearlach</a> 23:51, 10 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I attempted to make the article more neutral. The body of the article about Belzebuub's life has been changed to more of a neutral perspective. I have also added a section of criticism; please add your criticisms to it. I hope that this makes the article more valueable to the wikipedia. Adreamsoul 15:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What do you think that the "Jesuit Authorities" know? What makes you think that because some religious entity is established that it is correct? Just because something has been around for a long time doesn't mean it is legitimate, take the catholic church for example and all of the corruption therin. Adreamsoul 13:34, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Jesuits are Catholic and more than legitimate authorities on theirs and other religions.

<dd>The Catholic church is one of the most corrupt organizations in the world. They have committed so many crimes against humanity throught history: pedophile preists, getting the top Nazis out of Germany after WWII, selling indulgences to "pay your way to heaven", sending children on crusades and then selling them into slavery... It is beyond me why anyone would ever trust such an organization. There is no such thing as spirituality within such an organization. God help anyone who tries to get spirituality at a church, they have none! They have encouraged individuals like yourselves to do whatever they can to discredit anyone who claims to have spiritual information that is different from theirs. Maybe you should delete the wiki on catholicism if you really want to do the world a favor! Adreamsoul 21:56, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
