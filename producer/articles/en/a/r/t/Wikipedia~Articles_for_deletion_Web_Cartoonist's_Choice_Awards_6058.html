<p>The result was delete.</p>
<p>While there was some lack of serious deabet, the nomination called into question the notability of the subject, which is a matter of sources and interpretation of those sources. Only two have been provided, which under <b>any</b> circumstances would only satisfy the most stretched-thin definition of "multiple."</p>
<p>Consideration of these sources shows that even this very-low baseline is not satisfied:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Times article can easily be read as demonstrating the <i>lack</i> of importance of the awards: They are mentioned in a "plucked from the air" manner and the critic refutes most of the awards. This is also one of over <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=Critic%27s+Notebook&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" class="external text" title="http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=Critic%27s+Notebook&amp;date_select=full&amp;srchst=nyt" rel="nofollow">four thousand</a> such "Critic's Notebook" entires. It's firmly established that items are not "non-trivial" merely by virtue of being in the times.</li>
<li>The "Attack of the Show" episode is arguably a stronger source than the times article, but again it's a minor item in a minor show: They ran five-ish times a week at that stage, and this is only a minor episode in a minor show.</li>
</ol>
<p>While it's clear there is vocal <i>support</i> for the inclusion of the web awards, the article was not well served by the perfunctory manner in which this debate was carried out. When it's "so obvious" that something is notable that stating so (and re-stating so) is the method of argumentation rather than than providing solid evidence, it's worth looking again at the assumptions being made.</p>
<p>There have not been made sufficient refutation to the claim that this is not notable (by providing multiple non-trivial sources).</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> If you change the google search to WCCA webcomics, you find roughly 40,000 google hits relating to the award. The problem is that it's usually abbreviated to WCCA, but WCCA is also an abbreviation for many other things; google hits are next to useless in measuring the awards notability. That said, just about anybody involved with webcomics knows that the WCCA is notable. I'm searching for print media links establishing this now. Also, if you don't consider the Web Cartoonist Choic Awards to be notable, then what DO you consider to be a notable webcomic award?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.138.44.220_b19d.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.138.44.220">129.138.44.220</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.138.44.220.html" title="User talk:129.138.44.220">talk</a>) 01:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<ul>
<li>Do you have a link to the Ontario article? In conjunction with the NYT article, I would say that establishes notability. Given the extremely credible and notable reference in the NY Times, that sounds like a good reason for inclusion. As for your other complaints... How on EARTH can you claim <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>? It's very neutral, with the possible exception of the controversy section. And, in my opinion, the controversy section maintains a neutral tone as well. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> isn't a problem, here; it doesn't make any interpretations in the main section, merely reporting the facts (thus fulfilling the stringent guidelines of primary source work). The controversy section probably constitutes original research, but when it's a subsection of an article, the procedure is to rewrite, not erase. <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> is fulfilled; it links to the main site as a primary source, and merely reports the facts, making no interpretations. Again, if the controversy section is the problem, rewrite, don't delete. As for <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, what more do you want? Once we include a link to the two news articles, that verifies both the contents of the page, and the notability of the page. To mention one other item as an aside, this award is currently being used to establish the notability of a large number of webcomics on this site. This is because the award is well-respected. A simple search of the webcomic community will reveal that just about everyone who deals with webcomics as a hobby pays attention to it, if only to gripe that it isn't fair. While I realize that this doesn't do much for this debate, it does indicate that it is notable; something with this much attention must have attracted more print sources then a pair of newspaper articles. I found a large number of podcasts referencing the WCCA; is there a policy that would allow those as sources? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.138.44.202_0901.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.138.44.202">129.138.44.202</a> (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.138.44.202.html" title="User talk:129.138.44.202">talk</a>) 05:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC).</small>
<ul>
<li>The Record article only briefly mentioned the award in a profile of a local artist. It's not an article about the award by any stretch. Here on EARTH, my NPOV concerns stem from an article based on things like "Controversy over the procedure" " Common claims" "the awards are said" "It has therefore been argued" etc with no sources. Clearly these arguments and controversies involve somebody's point of view, but they don't seem to be points of view based on reputable sources. What do these arguments and controversies represent? Disagreements on a message board somewhere? Wikipedia is not the place for such things. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I had rewritten the article to remove the uncited controversy section, but the article has since been reverted. That said, the answer to fixing the NPOV concerns, not deleting the article, especially since it is only applicable to a subsection, not the article as a whole. Sorry for the WI:CIVIL violation, I'm just somewhat shocked that this is up for deletion.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I just rewrote the article to add sources and remove unverified information.

<li><b>Keep</b>, because the <i>NY Times</i> and <i>AOTS</i> coverage establishes notability; the article is not terribly well written and would benefit from more references, but I don’t currently see any problems that cannot reasonably be fixed. —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 22:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't know about that. I'd think that 6-year-old annual awards would generate much more than 2 decent sources if it were all that important. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 02:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, it is an award for something that is exclusively online... The only people who would care about it all have internet access, and read about it from internet sources that have reported the results. I really can't imagine it being printed in an offline source, in the same way that I can't imagine ANY webcomic award being printed in an offline source. That said, I'm also a bit surprised that there are only two offline mentions of it. Then again, I guess two are all that are needed under Wikipedia guidelines.129.138.44.202 03:18, 26 January 2007 (UTC)girl from before

<li>Indeed. As has been observed repeatedly, this subject - by and large - abhors mainstream media attention.
