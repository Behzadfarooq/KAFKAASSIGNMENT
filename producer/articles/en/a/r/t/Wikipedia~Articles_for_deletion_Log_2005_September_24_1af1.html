<dd>Most cities on a square grid are in North America due to the way the continent developed. Off the cuff I can come up with <i>just two</i> cities laid out in a square grid in all of Europe, which are the Baixa Pombalina in <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lisbon.html" title="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> and <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mannheim.html" title="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> in Germany.

<li>No it doesn't, but many cities (eg in Britain) have main streets that wiggle around so much that they can't even be said to be <i>roughly</i> north-south or east-west.

<dd>Some cities don't really have a main street anyway, even those with a historical main street. <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston%2C_Massachusetts_d688.html" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a> for example -- while the historical main street was Washington Street, Washington St is now mostly one-way through most of downtown, and there are at least a half a dozen streets that could qualify as a main street but for one or another failing (don't pass through downtown, don't even make it to downtown, don't go all the way through the city, what have you). Across the river, <a href="../../../c/a/m/Cambridge%2C_Massachusetts_da41.html" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a> has a Main Street that acts as a mostly-irrelevant westbound feeder road to the real main street, Massachusetts Avenue.

<dd>Well that's another problem with this article, isn't it -- a rather quirky definition of what qualifies as a main street.

<li>Ah, you mean according to the original grid--that is, nominally--not according to current geography. In that case, if there <i>is</i> a category (and I still have my doubts about the usefulness of such a category), it should certainly not be named "Main streets," which is misleading, but something like, "Grid-dividing streets." <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChick_Bowen_2101.html" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 20:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

It should be noted that this article survived a previous battle with the VfD page, so I'm wondering why it's up for deletion again[?]. Anyways, the linked to forums aren't active, but that's mostly because the artist doesn't push them at all. The artist has an active readership (numbers mentioned) and holds contests every week that have <a href="http://www.lunchbreaktoons.com/caption72.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.lunchbreaktoons.com/caption72.htm" rel="nofollow">active participation</a>. A rather minor comic, I agree, but one that is mentioned on enough other sites (Phil Kahn, plus this author is the co/guest-author for No 4th Wall to Break) that it warrants an entry simply to avoid having dead links all around wikipedia. For this reason, and the webcomic readership numbers, and its clear fulfillment of webcomic alternate proposal (over 500 comics in archive since 2003, including LunchBreakToons comics) I vote for keep. --<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 22:58, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>.I agree with part of the above statement. Discount the IP Address votes, but I would still vote <b>Keep</b>. As for this article being an internet link, I take offense to that as I worked rather hard to write it from a neutral viewpoint and include information the way I would on any of the many webcomic articles that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tedzsee_9253.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tedzsee">I've written</a>. Calling the article <b>rubbish</b> is not only unneccessary, it is also innaccurate, considering that the article is written in the same way any other Wikipedia webcomic article is written. If you're going to VfD the article on the basis that it is non-notable (in your opinion), that's one thing. But starting a flame-war and questioning the authenticity of the article in the first place is not only innaccurate, it's unnecessary and insulting.--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 04:05, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

I respect your say Tedzsee, and I understand that you were just filling in redlinks.

<li><b>Considing <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7ECOMIC_83ec.html" title="WP:COMIC">WP:COMIC</a></b> BFC has over 500 comics stored in it's archieve because it followed on from Lunch Break Toons. Which fulfils the Alternate Alternate proposal. I wrote the orginal article on BFC, and I am not the author, so that is point 3 taken care off (do an IP check if you must with me against HiJamieFans), and for point 2, it has been going on for over 2 years. So according to the Alternate Proposal, this comic deserves a place on BFC. Alexa is unrealiable because it only deals with IE users and not users of other browsers (such as Opera and Firefox) and if you check the bbc homepage link in it's search it returns less than 20000 hits per day when the bbc website gets well over 5 million hits per day from within the UK.</li>

<li><b>Comment from nominator (Hahnchen)</b> - I think my arguments for deletion may have been lost somewhat in the puppeteering above, and would just like to restate this as well as some others. Firstly, if a webcomic is notable, it would not require calls to arms on both the webcomic site <b>PLUS</b> the no 4th wall to break site (which I only just spotted). People above have been stressing the notability of this comic because the comic author also helped on No 4th wall to break. Is no 4th wall to break that popular? Alexa says 600k+, so it's not a definite yes. And this argument seems to fall flat, when we note that the author already has his own wikipedia entry at Jamie McGarry! Is Jamie McGarry notable? Having made half a dozen websites? I'm not so sure, but I don't think his webcomic is. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 02:01, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>New:As for the "Call to Arms" found on both the N4W page and the comic artist's website, I would suggest that these have to do more with the ignorance of Built For Comfort's author, <a href="../../../h/i/j/User%7EHijamiefans_b84c.html" title="User:Hijamiefans">Jamie McGarry/Hijamiefans</a>, towards the purpose of Wikipedia. This is also evident in the creation of the Jamie McGarry article (which should not be considered in this debate, in my opinion, although I also believe the McGarry bio article to be rather unneccessary... for the record I didn't write that one). No doubt the links and subsequent responses of Jamie McGarry's readers do great detriment to the non-deletion argument in the eye of the nominator. However, I would urge potential voters to consider both the arguments found in this section on their own merits, extranious comments aside.</b>--<a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedzsee_8440.html" title="User:Tedzsee">Tedzsee</a> 04:43, 28 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Reply</b> I find the use of the term 'sock puppets' in a negative way to be very demeaning to me and my socky brethren. It really is the most blatant racism. - Mr. Sock</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> As a long time reader, I am totally against the deletion of the Built For Comfort article. It is as entertaining (if not more) than most webcomics. You can clearly see -by the number of votes- that the majority of people want the article to stay. The fact that Jamie is regularly keeping his comic up to date as well as doing his A-Level studies and having a wild social life is astonishing. I also find it totally insulting that you now seem to be slagging off the webcomic author himself. I think you should reconsider your argument and offer Jamie McGarry an apology.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> I'm a fairly new reader of the comic, having only put it on my daily list a week or so ago - anyway. Bias aside, I don't think this should be deleted, for pretty much all the reasons under the 'against deletion' section of this restatement. After all, consider that the people coming to vote before the restatement were from the BfC site. The author, Jamie, didn't specifically say to vote 'keep', merely thanked those who did. Point is, the 'sockpuppets' are just readers from the comic, but I don't see why their votes worthless. After all, isn't this supposed to be a democracy? I don't see it's that relevant that a lot were from the comic as long as people aren't voting twice. --Snuffkin 14:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've just discovered something very interesting. The [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Hahnchen&amp;page=|wiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=&amp;user=Hahnchen&amp;page=|wiki" rel="nofollow">logs</a>] say that all of Hahnchen's recent edits have been, rather than webcomic articles, articles about towns in Yorkshire - in fact, mostly in EAST YORKSHIRE. I myself am from East Yorkshire, and BFC itself is actually set there. This is too big a coincidence to ignore - I think this (and the insulting tone of the mods comments throughout) suggest that this is some sort of personal vendetta against me from the real world, rather than one brought on by any knowledge of what makes a worthy webcomic article.
<ul>
<li><b>Totally False</b> - I do live in East Yorkshire during the summer, yes. I have however, never seen or heard of you. My recent edits have been to do with deletion of non notable webcomics. I have a personal venetta against each and every creator? No, I just think that there are many non notable webcomics listed on Wikipedia. Thinking that I may hold some sort of grudge against you seems to be very egotistical. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:30, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - You've been looking at my "move" logs and not my contributions. That was when I was maintaining title consistency. I was searching for placenames followed by Yorkshire, and instead moved them to specify county as the consensus seems to show. I have made numerous stubs for villages and towns in east riding however, the <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Riding_of_Yorkshire_83cb.html" title="East Riding of Yorkshire">East Riding of Yorkshire</a> page looks kinda stark. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 23:49, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>How notable is Freespace 2 or Descent: Freespace or whatever? (Current <a href="../../../g/t/v/GTVA_a405.html" title="GTVA">GTVA</a> content Sunday night says "the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freespace_2.html" title="Freespace 2">Freespace 2</a> universe", the creator above insists readers won't need the context identified "SINCE IT IS LOCATED IN THE DESCENT: FREESPACE SECTION.") I play many kinds of games but have barely heard of this. If the cited companies no longer hold the copyrights, is the game abandoned as a commercial failure, notable to nobody but a few fans? Or was it in some way so noteworthy that several game magazines did feature articles and mainstream media gave coverage to big events? (Compare, for example, the rise of big-prize-money Magic: the Gathering tournaments getting national newspaper articles.) We need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:Verifiability</a> for the higher-level article about the game system in order to justify keeping fine-grained in-game stuff at all. Even then, policy says we keep only canon stuff, not fanfic. If this is just stuff that a local gaming group has developed extrapolating from canon, it's not of sufficiently widespread importance to meet WP's basic policies. If what's kept is all canon, I think it should probably be further merged into the game system's main article, or at worst one level of sub-article below that. Alliances that form the backstory or context for a gaming system are "of interest only to fans of that game", and not of encyclopedic value. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 03:18, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>What's a dicdef?</p>
<dl>
<dd>A dictionary definition. An article that just says this is what the word means. The idea is that if it's an encyclopaedia article, there should be more to say. Ben Nevis 02:35, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>A dictionary definition. If Blogosophy is a real concept, then this article should be extended beyond a dicdef by discussing the subject in more detail. Many important stub articles <b>are</b> dicdefs, and that's ok, probably noone's going to nominate those. The real question is will <b>the article be extended</b> so it is more in-depth than a dictionary definition. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 02:36, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, inventing one's own form of martial arts is no big deal unless it catches on among widening circles of thousands of people, or in some other fashion achieves widespread public awareness and verifiability. I haven't dug through the Google links yet to see how substantially he might be notable within a wide area. Nothing in the article suggests that this is more than a run-of-the-mill syncretism of what some fellow likes from various existing systems. (In other words, not notable in its category.) Nothing in the article serves as a source except the URL of the founder's website. This inclines me toward weak delete as advertisement, unless evidence of notabilty is added, but I won't vote since I haven't done the research. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 03:36, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><strike><b>Weak delete</b>.</strike> I don't think that a list of attacks in Pokémon (which would start with the 100 or so in the games, and then could end up including the hundreds of one-off called attacks in the anime, manga, and card game) is encyclopedic material, and it borders on an unmaintainable list. Furthermore, I don't think that such an article would lend much to understanding of Pokémon either as fiction or as a social phenomenon, given that in nearly every context the attacks will appear in, their effects or attributes will be immediately apparent or immediately explained. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 05:49, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> (disclosure: I created this page). As noted above, more than one person seemed to share the sentiment that, while individual pokeattacks did not merit seperate articles, the information should be kept <i>somewhere</i>. Thus, this article. I'm not sure why an article on common attacks in the pokemon universe, which would surely be of interest to quite a few people, is unencyclopedic. AS for concerns about the list being too long, criterion can be selected so that the number of attacks is limited to the more common ones. As for concerns about the individual write-ups on the attacks being too long, those can be shortened (I've already shortened them some). <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 07:37, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We have an excellent place for descriptions of common or signature Pokémon attacks: in the articles for the individual Pokémon involved. The fact remains that there aren't many (none that I can think of) common Pokémon attacks that aren't plainly obvious, and the uncommon ones don't bear mentioning (for the same reason that <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters_c18c.html" title="List of Pokémon characters">List of Pokémon characters</a> doesn't include every single Pokémon trainer in the games; there are hundreds and most are more-or-less interchangable). Anyone with a basic grasp of English or a dictionary understands that Flamethrower is going to be a blast of flame, Water Gun is going to be a jet of water, and that Thunderbolt is going to be a blast of electricity.<br />
As for attacks that aren't as obvious, in both the manga and the anime (where the effects of the attack are extremely fluid, depending on the needs of the plot) they are immediate explained, in all but the oldest games they're described in the game, and, most importantly, it's exceedingly unlikely anyone without access to those primary sources will ever have cause to look up further information on Wikipedia (unless that information was specific in a technical way, a la GameFAQs, which isn't Wikipedia's thing anyway).<br />
I just don't see how this sort of list could contribute to an encyclopedic understanding, instead of being a random list of loosely-connected trivia. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 07:55, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The very fact that we even have a list of (notable) Pokémon charachters is, in my view, a good argument for keeping a list of (notable) Pokémon attacks. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 08:06, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My point is that they aren't notable, on top of being obvious. Most of the characters on that list aren't notable; that's why their only presence on Wikipedia is one-sentence mentions on that list. These attacks are even <i>less</i> notable than those characters who are only bullet points on a list, and are comparably notable to the interchangable one-off Pokémon trainers who form the starchy parts of the Pokémon games and anime. Any list of the attacks would be statements of the obvious, information better off placed in the individual Pokémon species articles, or trivial minutia (most likely in the form of raw data) that doesn't serve to create understanding (e.g. "Charizard uses Flamethrower in episodes X, Y, and Z. Charizard learns Flamethrower at level Q.") - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small>
<ul>
<li>My thought on that is, an individual article about a single pokemon attack would probably be obvious and none too interesting, as you say. But, in my view, an article listing various pokemon attacks provides some useful information...such as the names of various attacks, and which pokemon use them. It also just provides a good general overview of the ways in which Pokémon attack each other. <a href="../../../w/a/n/User%7EWandering_oojah_611f.html" title="User:Wandering oojah">Wandering oojah</a> 08:56, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I dislike Pokémon, it was a worldwide phenomenon, enough to have its own encyclopedic entry - and I guess the same could be said of everything affiliated within the phenomenon, perhaps this list or article could expand to include other aspects of the Pokémon universe so as there isn't so much Poké-clutter.

<li><b>Comment</b>: We already have another, more complete although less descriptive list of Pokémon moves, Pokémon moves by type. Also, if there is going to be a list of this sort, I think it should have a title with 'move' in it rather than 'attack' - move is the catch-all term used in the games that includes non-attacking techniques, such as Recover and Withdraw. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 04:52, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>That list is inaccurate, out-of-date, and incomplete, to the point of being misleading and useless.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. While we had accepted beforehand that Pokemon is an encyclopedic cultural phenomenon, there's way too many Pokemon attacks, and the alternative is having an article for each one of them. It's a lesser of two evils thing for those who viciously hate Pokecruft. <a href="../../../t/i/t/User%7ETitoxd_5bc7.html" title="User:Titoxd">Tito</a><a href="../../../t/i/t/User_talk%7ETitoxd_d711.html" title="User talk:Titoxd"><font color="#008000">xd</font></a> 06:21, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a false dilemma.

<p>Dear People at Wikipedia,</p>
<p>“Social Technology” is my first article at Wikipedia. I am new to this world of web publishing. Please pardon me for any errors that I have made and may make due to my ignorance of the norms and rules of the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>This summer some good ideas occurred to me and I put them down in this article. In the article, I defined the term “Social Technology” and some basic areas to think and work upon.</p>
<p>Then I heard about Wikipedia where any one can contribute and enhance an article. I felt that this was a great place for ideas. I thought that many more ideas would come in and the article would be enhanced.</p>
<p>I posted it from my web log <a href="http://neeray.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://neeray.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://neeray.blogspot.com</a> to this site. Unfortunately I forgot to post the copy right notice and a very vigilant member noticed the same article on my web log and marked it for copyright violation. I am very happy that people here are very vigilant. I have now posted the copy right message under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 on the “Social Technology temporary page” and in the article on my web log too.</p>
<p>Then I worked a little on the temporary page and find that now this is marked for deletion for “Rambling”. These are tiny seedlings of ideas. Please do not delete them even before they are seen and flower into something better. Please advise me as to what should I do to improve this article.</p>
<p>I have great faith in the collective wisdom of the people. That is what this article is about. Please do whatever is right according to the rules and norms of the community.</p>
<p>Best regards, Nirupma Kapoor</p>

<p>Dear People at Wikipedia,</p>
<p>“Social Technology” is my first article at Wikipedia. I am new to this world of web publishing. Please pardon me for any errors that I have made and may make due to my ignorance of the norms and rules of the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>This summer some good ideas occurred to me and I put them down in this article. In the article, I defined the term “Social Technology” and some basic areas to think and work upon.</p>
<p>Then I heard about Wikipedia where any one can contribute and enhance an article. I felt that this was a great place for ideas. I thought that many more ideas would come in and the article would be enhanced.</p>
<p>I posted it from my web log <a href="http://neeray.blogspot.com" class="external free" title="http://neeray.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://neeray.blogspot.com</a> to this site. Unfortunately I forgot to post the copy right notice and a very vigilant member noticed the same article on my web log and marked it for copyright violation. I am very happy that people here are very vigilant. I have now posted the copy right message under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 on the “Social Technology temporary page” and in the article on my web log too.</p>
<p>Then I worked a little on the temporary page and find that now this is marked for deletion for “Rambling”. These are tiny seedlings of ideas. Please do not delete them even before they are seen and flower into something better. Please advise me as to what should I do to improve this article.</p>
<p>I have great faith in the collective wisdom of the people. That is what this article is about. Please do whatever is right according to the rules and norms of the community.</p>
<p>Best regards, Nirupma Kapoor</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly, there has been a VfD for a related article 4 months ago, and the result was a keep. Is there any good reason to AfD this again now? I hope admins may take note of this.</li>
<li>Secondly, as proven by just how many updates this article got since 4 months ago, no, it didnt need alot of maintanence as I have said earlier.</li>
<li>Thirdly, yes, the information is original from CAAS, because wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not meant to be an avenue for original research</a>. I canot be churning up my own numbers from thin air (although I do my own simple maths in coming up with obvious data, for eg, mannually counting the number of flights per week). At the same time, it is not a <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">wholesale reproduction of original data</a>, because this table combines information found in the Airport site, CAAS's monthly and annual reports (which is not available free online and required a trip to its library, which is not open to the general public), plus counter-referenced data from publications by the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines and the<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Air_Transport_Association_09c3.html" title="International Air Transport Association">International Air Transport Association</a>, again from sources not neccesarily available to everyone for free.</li>
<li>Fourth, please explain "<i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information", when the sources and the work committed to compiling the above data has been explained.</li>
<li>Fifth, I do not see how people can decide for themselves what would be considered "usefull" or "interesting" topics for users of wikipedia. Do we have a policy in only writting articles which people will be assumed to be interested in? Not really, because we only do have one for writing <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_articles_useful_for_readers_25cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Make articles useful for readers">useful articles</a>. How would removing data make this site any more useful? When someone just wants to know the number of passengers flown between Singapore and Sydney per year, and how that compares with other city pairs out of Singapore, why should we deny this person the chance to see this information in wikipedia instead of turning to another source?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 12:04, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

Because recording every verifiable piece of data in human knowledge is not Wikipedia's mission. Instead, the parent article article needs to better <i>summarize</i> the subject, rather than including every associated number and piece of data. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">Contribs</a>)</small> 06:57, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If we may look at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a>, there is non of those categories of information this particular falls into and hence is deemed as an "indiscriminate collection of information". Lists like these combine information from several sources to present in table form the traffic flow into and out of this airport, which is an important <b>starting</b> reference for anyone involved in international transport study, for example. May I remind that if it looks like a mess of "detailed" data to the less initiated, it looks elimentary to those who are more familiar with it, and that is the way it is designed to be. Unfamiliar with it? Let this be the intiation. Not enough info? Pay and get detailed info from the relevant authorities unless others are kind enough to add to this one.</dd>

<dd>You claim that "people who want to get this info will go directly to the primary source". The trouble is...could these people get it? I got some of these data by visiting the only aviation-themed library in my country, and only because my professor wrote in on a personal basis to the librarian to allow me in as part of my academic study. Sure, you could write in and subscribe for this kind of primary data directly from the publishers, but not before paying thousands of US dollars for them. Anyone can get this info? I doubt so. Wikipedia has a mission of providing and sharing knowledge for free, and I fail to see the rationale of asking these people who could otherwise be relying their research on wikipedia to look elsewhere?</dd>

<dd>It appears the only argument for its deletion is that the information is "not important enough". Who are we to judge? Yes, this article could outline the more significant flight routes out of this country.

<li><b>Comments</b> To add on, a few points to make in response to the above comments, and from what has been discussed before:
<ul>
<li>Firstly, there has been a VfD for this article 4 months ago, and the result was a keep. Is there any good reason to AfD this again now? I hope admins may take note of this.</li>
<li>Secondly, as proven by just how many updates this article got since 4 months ago, no, it didnt need alot of maintanence as I have said earlier.</li>
<li>Thirdly, yes, the information is original from CAAS, because wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">not meant to be an avenue for original research</a>. I canot be churning up my own numbers from thin air (although I do my own simple maths in coming up with obvious data, for eg, mannually counting the number of flights per week). At the same time, it is not a <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_include_copies_of_primary_sources_e36f.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't include copies of primary sources">wholesale reproduction of original data</a>, because this table combines information found in the Airport site, CAAS's monthly and annual reports (which is not available free online and required a trip to its library, which is not open to the general public), plus counter-referenced data from publications by the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines and the<a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Air_Transport_Association_09c3.html" title="International Air Transport Association">International Air Transport Association</a>, again from sources not neccesarily available to everyone for free.</li>
<li>Fourth, please explain "<i>indiscriminate</i> collection of information", when the sources and the work committed to compiling the above data has been explained.</li>
<li>Fifth, I do not see how people can decide for themselves what would be considered "usefull" or "interesting" topics for users of wikipedia. Do we have a policy in only writting articles which people will be assumed to be interested in? Not really, because we only do have one for writing <a href="../../../m/a/k/Wikipedia%7EMake_articles_useful_for_readers_25cc.html" title="Wikipedia:Make articles useful for readers">useful articles</a>. How would removing data make this site any more useful?

</ul>
<p>Two people seem to have submitted entries for the same artist, one of them a gag. The first Lance Romance page is nonsense and should be deleted. The other page, Lance Romañce, is not nonsense at all and is a legitimate, original entry which I wrote myself. Unfortunately, because it has a special character in the URL, I am unable to link directly to the article so that other people may discus it.</p>
<p>The artist in question is popular in underground circles in several scenes and cities, and has made an impact on these scenes. Hence the Google entries, but not the AllMusic. Keeping the second article, which should justify itself, is a good idea. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiantrats_d892.html" title="User:Giantrats">Giantrats</a> (<a href="../../../g/i/a/User_talk%7EGiantrats_1dbd.html" title="User talk:Giantrats">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Giantrats_e6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Giantrats">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>It doesn't solve the lack of notability and lack of artistdirect or allmusic entries. Nor does it solve the question of copyvio. If it is not a copyvio, it needs to be rewritten into an encyclopedic style if it is kept. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 21:02, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Also, the question arises: the User who created the article is <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiantrats_d892.html" title="User:Giantrats">User:Giantrats</a>.

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The listing Lance Romance was a gag and has been edited so that it now merely acts as a mirror link to the legitimate entry Lance Romañce. The Lance Romañce listing is unsearchable due to the tilde over the n (ñ) and there was some confusion. All offending information has been deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Historically, the most significant road in Raleigh is Hillsborough Street, bar none. Wake Forest Road would be second. Not that anyone cares about this, but I'm just making the point that simply because an article states something does not automatically make it true. This would be good on a personal webpage, but it's not encyclopedia-worthy. And besides, if we start putting "significant" roads on Wikipedia, who decides significance? It's a slippery slope. --<a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacknCanes_334e.html" title="User:PacknCanes">PacknCanes</a> 12:26, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can completely understand where you're coming from, and I'm not threatening to leave Wikipedia forever or anything like that (sorry if that disappoints anyone&#160;:)) if this article isn't deleted. But, at the end of the day, how many roads in American cities (or cities anywhere, for that matter) have no claim to fame other than bad traffic, lots of traffic lights, and lots of McDonalds along the side of the road? That's all Capital Blvd is, folks. I travel it just about every day. It's no more "significant" than any other road with similar characteristics anywhere else in the world. --<a href="../../../p/a/c/User%7EPacknCanes_334e.html" title="User:PacknCanes">PacknCanes</a> 06:24, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> its a significant street in the community as noted.

<li>Road articles are not helping Wikipedia be more relevant to local issues. Quite the opposite, road articles have illustrated how overwhelming local topics can be (by the huge numbers of unexpanded, substandard road article that exist). Pragmatically, if you want articles on local topics I believe the best route is to fork an article off a community's article describing the topic, in this case something like 'Road network in Raleigh, NC' or what-have-you. Having a 100 articles on a 100 different roads in Raliegh only serves to fragment an interesting discussion and repeat information 99 times. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMaclean25_1193.html" title="User:Maclean25">maclean25</a> 01:46, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Curebie seems to be an established term in the autistic community. I disagree as to the NPOV of autism related pages. The norm is that questionable treatments are presented in central parts of the articles while anti-cure ideas are at best mentioned in "passing". For instances, the autism page has recently been updated to use "person with autism" instead of the anti-cure peoples choice of "autistic". --<a href="../../../r/d/o/User%7ERdos_1fa6.html" title="User:Rdos">Rdos</a> 19:40, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>*sigh*. First off "NPOV of autism related pages" generally has community consensus here. In addition, the "person with" usage was only used for the third paragraph in the autism article because it wasn't explained yet in the article - for the rest of the article uses "autistic". Not only that but "Curebie seems to be an established term in the autistic community" does not mean it warrants an article on wikipedia... I mean what all can you say about the word anyway? The whole anti-cure pro-cure debate should be kept to pages that can explain them better and in a more NPOV light. <small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 20:09, 24 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with everyone who has said 'keep'. No offense, but I do have to wonder why it's so important that a simple page devoted to a minor character in a famous play get deleted. If that's so, then why hasn't anyone tried to do the same to some of the other minor characters in the plays whom I've seen have articles? The whole point of the Shakespearean characters category is to make articles for the characters of his plays, and that's exactly what I was doing. <a href="../../../t/i/r/User%7ETiria_54b5.html" title="User:Tiria">Tiria</a> 07:12, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>My reasoning is that this is too detailed for an encyclopedia, even a Wikipedia.

<li>I was the one who proposed for deletion, and that was essentially my reasoning. I am a fairly new user, and perhaps I should have waited longer to see what sort of standards people apply to these things, but it did seem like a very trivial entry to me, one that I would not expect to find in an encyclopedia. It is evident from the responses that there is a strong consensus to keep this page, and I'm fine with that.

<li><b>Delete</b> I definitely wouldn't want to replace this with Babelfish semi-gibberish.

<li>Re:<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, the "Wall street Journal" link is a very small article in a ZdNet repost of an article from the Wall Street Journal <i>Interactive Edition</i>.

<li>I know I'm starting to sound a bit shrill here, but is this really what we're calling "significant [...] media coverage"? North Andover, MA? An Independent Daily Newspaper from Ohio University? I'd also point out that those citations appear to be <b>purposefully deceptive</b>. For example: Mieszkowski, Katharine. "<a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/13807/" class="external text" title="http://www.alternet.org/story/13807/" rel="nofollow">The Bot Who Loved Me</a>", <i>Salon</i>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2002.html" title="2002">2002</a>-<a href="../../../a/u/g/August_9.html" title="August 9">08-09</a>. Did this article actually appear on Salon? It doesn't appear so as it's on AltNet, however Mieszkowski <i>also</i> writes for Salon. This is not good form, it's bad for the encyclopedia. If we keep this article based upon this performance, we're rewarding it to our detriment.<br />

<li>Recommend that we <b>don't move</b> this to <a href="../../../f/j/e/Fjellstrand_Skole_e0df.html" title="Fjellstrand Skole">Fjellstrand Skole</a>, Norwegian convention is to leave the "skole" uncapitalized since "skole" (school) is not considered part of the name.

<li>Sorry, I'm a little unclear. I thought, the only reason for "skole" being in the article name and lead sentence of the article (instead of "school"), is that it was assumed to be part of the official name. Even for English schools, we only use upper-case "S" in "Example School" *if* "School" is an official part of the name. Otherwise we might say "Example school", or call the article "Example (school)". I'm a little uncertain if your talking about official school naming conventions, or Norweigan conventions for capitalizing proper names. Note: I'm asking more for future cases, and support your request to keep the article name. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 17:15, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If "skole" is not a part of the Fjellstrand's official name, then the article should be titled "Fjellstrand (school)". If it is part of the official title, then it should be "Fjellstrand Skole". (IMHO) <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 17:18, 30 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I partly agree, and disagree. If "skole" is not part of the official name, we should use "Fjellstrand (school)". But, if "skole" is apart of the official name, and despite that, Norweigan language convention dicates it be lower-case, we should respect that, and say "Fjellstrand skole". Upper-case "Skole" should never be used, since it's not English *and* its not official. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">rob</a> 17:34, 30 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm the auther, and new to wikipedia; it would be helpful if someone could expain to me why the entry is up for deletion- as a newbie I don't understand what the problem is?</p>
<p>OK, I've done some looking in the FAQs and now understand that Wiki doesn't host original stuff- UToR is original so I guess you should delete it. Anyone know of a similar kind of thing to wikipedia that does host such stuff? Apologies for posting something innapropriate. As a bit of constructive feedback, it may be worth your while making it clearer that you don't want original work; I did check several of the intro FAQs prior to posting, and didn't pick up on that.</p>

<li>To the author: Apologies for the somewhat sarcastic vote for deletion above - I was assuming awareness of the guidelines. Why not create an account (it's free and very quick) and that will give you a user page onto which you can put your article with no fear of it being deleted. You can then work on it, as and when you wish, to make more like what wiki expects an article to be.

<p>Hey I think its alright that you have added an article on a scottish town - and it's really great that maybe more people from that area could learn more information - but if you Really want to keep it up - then please add some more information on the place - what does the after schoolclubs do - what other sghts can you see in Collydean - etc. Then maybe you can save the article.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. encyclopedic content for me is, "what the hell is this?" if it's a word, it goes in a dictionary. if it's a person, place or thing, it goes in an encyclopedia. the content isnt a recipe, because theres no way you could read it, go to the supermarket, go to the kitchen, and make it. besides, claiming "non-encyclopedic content" is pretty similar to "doesn't belong in an encyclopedic," which is redundant following a delete vote. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 19:51, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> there's already a long paragraph about the plane in the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delta_Air_Lines_1541.html" title="Delta Air Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> article. The plane is, in fact, much more notable than the stub article indicates; it was bought &amp; paid for by the employees and retirees, through a voluntary contribution scheme, and there was a lot of press attention, etc., at the time, as a story about the loyalty of the employees and so forth. As it happens, I actually wrote up an article about Spirit of Delta a while ago, but then read what was in the main Delta article, and decided it did not really merit an article on its own. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 00:06, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If you do a search for just "Naimolinet" you'll get at another 12 results, a majority of which are external to naimolinet.com. It may not be terribly huge, but as a growing forum/podcast it is an interesting thing to see. The website also has a relatively rapidly growing population and a rather diverse audience for the podcasts. BaKanale 23:46, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>it could still be construed as promotion in less than good faith. personally i think if a topic is notable, it's notable, regardless of who creates the article on it. it could be claimed as "tribute" i guess; we often get pages by students written about their non-notable high school teachers/university professors. there was a band vanity article written recently by a member's little brother that led to some confusion, as the member was denying having written it but of course had the same IP address. <a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENateji77_10a2.html" title="User:Nateji77">Nateji77</a> 22:04, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The second point is that the article is extremely hard to read to the point of being gibberish or nonsense, and contains little, if any, useful information.

<p>The result of the debate was rather ambiguous. I count three "deletes" and 2 "merges", which have been given without any reasoning so its borderline. A concern here has been verifiability and another has been notability. This one is a tough one to close, and I know extremely little about the subject, and my attempt at merging will probably be dreadful. Therefore I will simply make this page into a <b>redirect</b> to <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autocephaly.html" title="Autocephaly">Autocephaly</a> and leave the history in tact so that anyone may merge it later if appropriate. If the redirect is inappropriate it can be brought to <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:04, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> How does this relate to the Transverse Doppler Effect which is an accepted effect? <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493">Dlyons493</a> 21:37, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Answer</b> There's no direct relation. The thing called "false doppler" in this article is not really false at all. It's a genuine classical Doppler shift resulting from the fact that the receiver is moving away from the transmitter. The article seems to be trying to say that this can be regarded as a false TRANSVERSE Doppler effect, because even though the receiver is moving away from the transmitter, he is receiving the signal from a direction that is, in terms of his own system of reference, perpendicular (i.e., transverse) to his direction of motion, due to the effect of aberration. But it's silly and incorrect to call this "false Doppler", and it would be only slightly less silly to call it "false transverse Doppler". It is simply the classical Doppler effect combined with the classical aberration effect. At most, this warrants a sentence or two in an article on aberration. Wikipedia is not the place to be making up new terminology, especially incorrect terminology like "false Doppler", and claiming that it is historical. I know of no reputable reference for the term "false Doppler" to describe this.63.24.114.48 19:47, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not crackpot, as the article sorts itself into <a href="../../../h/i/s/Category%7EHistory_of_physics_1e60.html" title="Category:History of physics">Category:History of physics</a> and states <i>in some theories, preceding special relativity</i>. But some doubts about the usefullness of a separate articles concentrating on calculations. <b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b>.

<dd>Referring to the Wiki article on emission theory is not very helpful, because it was largely written by the same well-known pseudo-science crackpot (Erk) who contributed the article on False Doppler. Also, the fact that it is classified as History of Physics doesn't exempt it from Wikipedia policy. The point is not whether Erk's ideas about science or history or anything else are right or wrong. The point is that Wikipedia is not the appropriate place for Erk's ideas (or yours or mine). Wikipedia articles are required to be verifiable from reputable published sources. If someone can find a reputable reference for "False Doppler", then it should be added to the article. If no one can find such a reference, then the article should be deleted.63.24.118.187 01:15, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There seems to be some confusion in the above comment. The subject of this proposal for deletion is not "Emission Theory", it is "False Doppler". Emission Theory is an actual subject in the history of science. False Doppler is not.

<dd>It fits in the history of physics <b>only</b> if it is actually a factual description of something from the history of physics... which it isn't. There is no such thing as "false doppler" in the history of physics. Check any reference on the history of physics, optics, accoustics, electrodynamics, you name it. You will find no references to "false doppler". Do a google search on "false doppler" and the only hits (other than these Wiki pages contributed by Erk, aka Eric Baird) are for things like false doppler indications of stormy weather, which have nothing to do with this subject. Also, if you glance at the "example" calculation of false doppler in this article, you will see that it's utter nonsense. But that's irrelevant, because the question is not whether the article is true, the question is whether it's verifiable from a reputable source. It isn't. So it should be deleted.</dd>
<dd>So far, the only "keep" votes for this article have been by people who cited as their reason that it is classified as history, and those people have declined to address the fact that the article is on a completely fictitious subject that was fabricated by a lunatic fringe pseudo-science crackpot and is not verifiable in any reputable published reference, and therefore has no place in Wikipedia, regardless of whether it is in the History of Science category or any other category.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I tried but couldn't figure this one out. There is such a thing as a transverse doppler effect, its easy enough to google. However, this page fails to distinguish between the relativistic and the non-relativistic form. Also, the references/quotes at the back of the article look very authoritative, but again, its not clear just what they are referring to. Given the un-googlability of the term "false doppler", it does sound like a neologism to me. I don't know whether to vote for "keep" and suggest that someone should convert this to a bona-fide article on transverse doppler, or to "delete" because the article is beyond repair. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 16:48, 2 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Comment: This isn't about censoring an article because it deals with a profane Web site, it's about deleting an article due to the subject matter's lack of merit. The Web site (including its history) is just a non-notable stink bomb that is "illustrative" of very little other than how the Internet can be used for insignificant, run-of-the-mill, hate-filled tirades. By the way, its Alexa ranking (which, in my opinion, does count) has pretty well been bottom-of-the-bucket insignificant except for a week-long spike to so-so status after the elections (by no means "immensely popular"). In case anyone is interested, here's <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=r&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=wikipedia.org&amp;y=r&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" rel="nofollow">a link to the Alexa page</a> comparing traffic to the site in question to Wikipedia.org over the past year.

<ul>
<li>Specious argument. Compare ANY typical private website to Wikipedia over the past year and it'll be a tiny blip. Even many of the most notable and popular would be as well. Look <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=fuckthenorth.com&amp;y=t&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=1y&amp;size=medium&amp;compare_sites=fuckthenorth.com&amp;y=t&amp;url=fuckthesouth.com#top" rel="nofollow">here</a> and you'll see that this was in the <i><b>top 5,000 web sites</b></i> shortly after the election.

<ul>
<li>If you want to call being in the top 5,000-traffic Web sites during one two-week period "notable and significant," well, I guess you're easily impressed. To me it's convincing evidence (as if any is needed) of the site's lack of notability. Using your reasoning, Wikipedia ought to have articles about all the other tens of thousand of Web sites that have at one time or another crossed the so-so 5,000 benchmark. Like I said, non-notable. — <a href="../../../m/a/y/User%7EMaylett_1b3a.html" title="User:Maylett">C Maylett</a> 06:36, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, now you want to discard Alexa since it's proven counter to the point you were trying to make when you brought it up. Fuck the South is notable not only because it was a top 5000 web site, but for the other reasons I've already posted here AND that it was a top 5000 site.

<li>Keep in mind that AfD remains pretty much binary for the closer: a normal editor cannot merge what isn't kept, and you cannot compel the closer to read your mind to merge to your liking. I would suggest being bold and merging the content yourself next time, and if reverted, back down. If unreverted, you've improved Wikipedia, which is the goal of everyone here. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 04:32, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think it's humor, not hatred. Extreme, frustration-based humor that reflects the depth of the political divide at that point in time.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Unfocused.

<li>And lastly, I find some humor in the number of "kill/burn the hate site" remarks. We who hate the South hate it for its hatred of others (like say, historically, blacks, gays, Catholics, liberals, the disabled, pacifists, intellectuals, internationalists, anti-capitalists, and "Yankees", some of which hatred indisputably persists.) Objectively, of course, this is just pot-calling-kettle and kettle-calling-pot. But, for devout Bluesies, comme moi, saying fuck the South is like saying fuck Nazi Germany. I can't say, objectively, that the South is evil; but, I can say, having lived there (in Virginia, Mississippi, and North Carolina) and having suffered scorn and violence for the first 18 years of my life, the values which make the South distinctive are values I hate as passionately as I hate Nazism. So it is for many people. And, yes, this is a soapbox, but I take offense at the suggestion that this is a "mere" hate site -- the question is intensely complicated for those of us who have <i>lynched grandfathers</i>. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 05:45, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<p>User:JimmyCrackedCorn, a particularly uncivil editor, has created this article as a way to circumvent consensus-building on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Ray_Nagin_a73c.html" title="Ray Nagin">Ray Nagin</a>, which has been protected over his insistence upon inserting this same inadequately sourced and biased information into the Ray Nagin article. Several editors are currently working toward a consensus on how best to include information on the flooded school buses and criticism of Nagin inside the Ray Nagin article itself. Instead, JimmyCrackedCorn has created this fork without notifying anybody as a way to circumvent Wikipedia's policies in general and the discussion on <a href="../../../r/a/y/Talk%7ERay_Nagin_406f.html" title="Talk:Ray Nagin">Talk:Ray Nagin</a> (in particular see <a href="../../../r/a/y/Talk%7ERay_Nagin_406f.html#Forks" title="Talk:Ray Nagin">Talk:Ray Nagin#Forks</a>).

<p>Not at all. I am supporting consensus building at the Ray Nagin article as anyone can see by looking at the Ray Nagin discussion page. Your personal attack against me as "uncivil" has een noted as reported. No one has even tried to explain what is POV about the article on the article's discussion page. The fact that this article is factual and does not repress inconvenient fact is understandably irksome to those with a proNagin POV. However, as anyone can see this article is well balanced with Nagin's responsibilities, the event, Nagin's POV as well as the POV of both defenders and critics of Nagin. To delete this article would be a clear attempt to repress fact for no other reason than fact does not comport with an admitted "libertine's" POV. --JimmyCrackedCorn 23:10, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article was originally created by an anonymous contributor with an IP of 68.4.247.187 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shelby_Yoshida&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=23932768" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shelby_Yoshida&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=23932768" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. I placed a speedy tag on it because it was about a non-notable middle school student. After the tag was applied, the same IP address edited the page to say that Shelby Yoshida was in fact a mildly-notable 20-year-old artist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shelby_Yoshida&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=23932854" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shelby_Yoshida&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=23932854" rel="nofollow">[23]</a>.<br />
<br />
Google turns up around ten hits for "Shelby Yoshida", none of which discuss artistic ability (they all reference swimming and dance competitions). One of the articles about swimming is from 2003 and Shelby Yoshida is given as being in the 9-10 age range. In addition, googling for "National Artists Convention", "Young Artists of California", and "Grislto" turn up no results.<br />
<br />
Even if Ms. Yoshida is an artist, I don't think receiving two artistic awards (from two invisible organizations) merits inclusion in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuicksandish_8fc3.html" title="User:Quicksandish">Quicksandish</a> 23:34, 24 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Admittedly, Chet Shakesbeare does inpart refer to a rather minor website. However, Chet's "articles" have been published in several literary arts magazines and while Wikipedia is not a web directory, there is no problem with having articles on various topics. After all, one of Wikipedia's greatest assets is its incredible breadth on a variety of subjects that few other encyclopedias discuss. Potatoes345 23:23, 25 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Untrue, you may consult the magazines if you so choose. At the moment I can provide you with one citation, a Chet Shakesbeare story appeared in the <i>Delphi</i>, a literary arts magazine. That is where I first encountered Chet. You could probably email the Chet Shakesbeare site for more information, they have a contact link. Furthermore, Google is not the best we have. Google is simply one search engine of mere web pages, Lexis-Nexis ad the like are generally considered to be more powerful tools. Potatoes345 23:54, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I offer the following, the articles "chet shakesbeare" (written by my brother) and Chet Shakesbeare (I'm not certain of the author) do, perhaps, deserve removal. However, the article Shakesbeare (of my own creation) should be kept. It is brief, encyclopedic, and informational with no bias whatsoever. Delete the other two if you must, but keep the article Shakesbeare. Potatoes345 23:49, 25 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The non-notability of the subject would still be a problem. -- the best thing for you to do if you would like the article kept would be to add citations of evidence that verify the importance of the subject for an encyclopedia; this means not merely suggesting or asserting that shakesbeare has appeared in magazines, but citing some prominent articles -- including enough information to locate and read the source. (Just like I suggested in the conversation at <a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">User talk:Mysidia</a>, but repeated here so it will be part of the Afd record). --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> (<a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysidia_50b2.html" title="User talk:Mysidia">talk</a>) 01:29, 26 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Once again, I am not personally aware of the locations of such articles. I myself have only seen one, in the <i>Delphi</i>, spring 2005 issue.
