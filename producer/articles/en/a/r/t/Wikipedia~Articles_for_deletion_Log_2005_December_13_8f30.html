<li>How is that supposed to happen? This is an essay from User:Paganbaby without sources, worse than that, there isn't the slightest indication that "economic spectrum" has ever been used to describe the degree of government control on the economy.

<li>I have to assume your request is disengenuous since you have made no attempt to improve the page. No talk page message was left prior to AfD and you long ago expressed the belief that the page was <i>beyond salvation</i>. I also assume that if I fail to hand you a blueprint for improving this article you will next claim that my vote is baseless, or unfounded and should not be counted- as that seems to be a common approach among noms. While your defeatism may appear seductive, my thinking is based on the following: the term is far too common not to have a page here. This is shown by google, google scholar, google books, a search of newspaper databases, etc. The term has been in wide use throughout the English speaking world since at least the 1920s. I have found many examples in government, academic and financial reports. Therefore, I believe, the best approach would be to come up with a definition for the term and provide examples. If that requires deleting the nonsense down to a stub, and expanding from there, then sobeit. The editors who will continue to contribute to the page are certainly experienced enough to undertake this process. I'm sure they would welcome your contribution. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 03:31, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Did you actually <i>look</i> at any of the references that you say you have found? Wherever Google Scholar finds the phrase "Economic spectrum" (often as its synonym "socio-economic spectrum") it nothing but the gamut of income from poor to rich, this is trivial and at best a dictdef. It certainly doesn't mean the degree of government control on the economy. As such, there is nothing salvageable here, the unsourced essay that currently resides under the lemma discourages editors to contribute. (Note: the last good edit was back in July.) Delete, and maybe redirect to <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_class.html" title="Social class">social class</a> or somesuch is my roadmap, as there is nothign to be gained from the history is <i>my</i> roadmap.

<li><b>Keep</b> It is not from <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_compass.html" title="Political compass">political compass</a>. The discipline of political science uses these terms(political system, democracy, totalitarian,economic system, market economy, centrally planned economy, ideology, socialist ideology, conservative ideology, liberal ideology, spectrum,left-right rate of change spectrum(i.e., radical, liberal, conservative, reactionary) as a matter of course. What is lacking is proper distinctions between the four separate spectra because of the use of the same word, liberal, for instance, to refer to completely different subject matters. Liberal, in one instance, is refering to the rate of change that is advocated. In another instance the same word is used to refer to a particular ideology comprised of: private ownership of property, individualism, competitive, and limited government per John Locke. The same can be said of the term conservative as a measurement of rate of change and at the same time a description of a particular ideology. For many people(societies) the distinction is not made and political systems are equated with economic systems. Even in Wikipedia this situation exists in some of the discussions. Hence, in the mind of many, democracy=market economy and totalitarian=centrally planned economy. Or, in another way, it is: democracy=capitalism/free market and socialism=totalitarianism. This is an error because in each case a political system is being equated with an economic system. How should all of this be sorted out? Correct definitions and correct applications according to the proper spectrum would help--wouldn't it? Is there a definition used that is incorrect? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.100.18.131 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.100.18.131_95df.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.100.18.131">contribs</a>) 04:27, 13 December 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<p><b>NOTE</b> The reference to the entry as being contrary to Wikipedia's <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_spectrum.html" title="Political spectrum">political spectrum</a> entry is accurate. Here is part of the Wikipedia entry(in the Left-Right heading):</p>
<p>"In modern Western countries, the political spectrum is described along left-right lines. This political spectrum is defined along an axis with conservatism, theocracy and fascism("the Right") on one end, and socialism, communism("the Left") on the other."</p>
<p>There are problems here that confuse rather than clarify.Theocracy describes a particular type of political system. Socialism/communism/fascism describes particular types of economic systems that have particular types of political systems. The reference to conservatism is not clear as to the intent. Is a particular ideology based on inequality and status being determined at birth being refered to(medieval Europe)? Or is this a reference to a preference to maintain the status quo in a society; which is a rate of change measurement? Many people and societies equate a democratic political system with a market economic system(democracy=capitalism.) They also have a tendency to equate a centrally planned economic system with a totalitarian political system(socialism=totalitarianism). This ignores the fact that there are separate political and economic spectra and where a country is located on one does not necessarily dictate where a country will be located on the other. In a democratic country, the people can choose to have any type of economic system they want. If they cannot choose the economic system that they desire--it is not a democracy. Fascism has a market economic system and a totalitarian political system. Socialism(communism is one type) has a centrally planned economic system and a democratic political system. Socialism has never existed in a modern society. The USSR(nor any of the others that claimed to be) was never socialist nor communist for that reason. How does the average citizen, who looks at an encylopedia to try and makes sense of these terms, deal with the fact that there terms that have different meaning depending upon the reference? How is the term liberal being used? As a reference to a society that has an ideology based upon private ownership of property, individualism, competitive, and limited government? Or is it a reference to a measurement of being willing to accept a measure of change? Shouldn't an encylopedia try to sort all of this out? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paganbaby (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paganbaby_383e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paganbaby">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>Using the reasoning mentioned in the last post would suggest that the term political spectrum be deleted also. It is just two separate words that are used in the newspapers and it has greater or lesser control by elected and government officials. Social class?

<li>Check out the link I posted above - "Vietnam Deaths Spread Over Economic Spectrum." This was saying that US casualties in the war ran the full gammot from poor to rich. That's how the term is generally used. If you think that a discussion of various economic systems as a spectrum is needed, then if you find some good sources to cite go ahead and add a new section to <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_system.html" title="Economic system">Economic system</a>. If that section gets big enough it could become its own article with a title like "spectrum of economic systems." Also, a note could be placed on the "social class" article to the effect that "economic spectrum redirect here - see blah-blah-blah for other uses..." <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 17:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

Isn't Wikipedia an opportunity for accurate information to be presented in a manner that the average citizen can understand? There is much confusion about distinctions about political and economic systems. Note the effort to try and make any discussion of economic systems spectrum a discussion of social class or rich and poor. Why? That is not the subject. How to make sense of the different meanings of these terms is the subject. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Paganbaby (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Paganbaby_383e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Paganbaby">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Where a country is located on an economic spectrum is the proper way to use the concept of an economic spectrum. Of course it is not proper to use the term economic spectrum to refer to the economic system present in a given country. What is useful is to have a range (sometimes visual) that gives expression to the relative position of various countries of the world on the economic spectrum.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not unsourced or uncited: the opening paragraph is primarily a source citation.

<li>I may not be familiar with Wiki conventions on this, but if the words are copied directly from a secondary source, with no reference to where it came from, I consider that uncited. The opening paragraph *was* a citation in the orginal Wikipage - here is is uncited and the source material copied. But this is semantics, and I mainly reply to learn more about Wiki practice in this area. Thanks. --<a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrich_e5dc.html" title="User:Krich">Krich</a> 02:09, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, ok, I see your point now. I think it was really unintentional. My "delete" vote was more to the point that the page was, IMHO, a newbie's test page that was done without malice (which is grounds for speedy, actually.) -- However, this does make for an interesting situation. While the page is copied directly from another Wikipage, The play text is itself public domain, and sourced by the preceding paragraph. This leaves the preceding paragraph as the uncited material. Thus, we have text which is primarily a citation for something else, that is itself not properly cited - oh, the irony! -- <a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaiichi_2_513b.html" title="User:Taiichi 2"><font color="green">Taiichi</font></a> «<a href="../../../t/a/i/User_talk%7ETaiichi_2_fb12.html" title="User talk:Taiichi 2"><font color="green">talk</font></a>» 00:36, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- We have to keep this one. Efforts to delete other candidates (even ones that had yet to secure a party nomination, such as [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barbara_Warner" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Barbara_Warner" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>]) have not always succeeded, and I don't think it's fair to delete some candidates, but keep others. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 12:34, 8 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We keep some candidates because they satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria on <i>other</i> grounds. Being merely a candidate for elected office is <i>not</i> one of the inclusion criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:02, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That might be the theory, but it's not the practice. We should keep them all, rather than haphazardly deleting a random few. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 13:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is the practice, by and large, too. Don't draw inferences from <i>just one</i> case where this hasn't been so. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it is the practice, then it's not being implemented very well. I just spent three minutes pulling articles on candidates in central Toronto, where I live, and I've already located a number that likely don't satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Conroy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Conroy" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmichael_%28politician%29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmichael_%28politician%29" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Reford" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Reford" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tindal" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tindal" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coy" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Coy" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>), unless having a job, belonging to the Lions Club, etc. qualify a notable. I'm just saying that balance and NPOV require that we either eliminate <i>all</i> articles that do not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, or we let all candidate articles stand. If the former, then are you suggesting that we nominate potentially hundreds of articles for afd? And wouldn't fairness require that we do so fairly early in the election? <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 17:49, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Keeping the articles on subjects that satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria and not the ones on subjects that do not is exactly what many editors aim for. That the articles that you point to have <i>never been put forward for consideration</i> does not invalidate that. To see how ill-founded such a line of reasoning is, consider that we could equally argue that we should keep all articles on 13-year-old schoolchildren that fail to satisfy the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria, simply because some of the articles about such children have never been nominated for deletion, and "it wouldn't be fair to delete some and not the others". Clearly, the argument is flawed.
<p>Finally: "Potentially hundreds" is not the same as "hundreds". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:01, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a big difference between 13 year old school children and candidates in the upcoming federal election, as only one pertains to a significant political process in Canada. Haphazardly and selectively deleting articles on certain candidates gives rise to accusations of political favouritism by Wikipedia in a way that deleting or not deleting articles on schoolchildren does not.
<p>As for the reference to "potentially hundreds", the election just started, and is not expected to pick up steam (so to speak) until after the holidays. Over the next few weeks, many candidates (or more likely, their supporters) will undoubtedly create additional articles on Wikipedia that will not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, in addition to all those that already candidate articles that already exist.

Then, just this week, we're hearing about them again in the context of these events in Sydney.

<dd>Sunny, Jai and Koby have made media appearances to contradict "supposed" involvement, as recently as yesterday's Daily Telegraph (14 Dec, pg 4).

I searched and could not find any mention of it on any forum, but even so - the fact that one or two individuals have used a made-up terminology does not make it ligitimate or note-worthy.

<dd>I wouldn't call that plenty - I've certainly seen pages with many hundreds of results being proposed for deletion (can't remember off hand if they actually were). It really isn't that hard to get a hundred or so results at all - I mean, a pseuodnym I use and is unique to me gets 647 results, but I don't think that's worthy of an article! A piece of software I wrote gets 1,570 results, but it's yet to get a Wikipedia mention let alone an article (and rightly so). (Of course, Google hits isn't the only way of rating how widespread a term is, but I've not yet been persuaded of any other reason why this term is notable.)</dd>
<dd>Also to be exact, although the term exists and may be worthy of documenting, the information in the article is certainly incorrect (the article takes the way it would be used as a derogatory term, and presents that as fact - and claims like "has a difficult time being aroused by bondage imagery unless it contains a gag" look just like insults). I don't mind if the article stays - if so I'd delete most of what's there and document its usage as a derogatory term - but thought I'd propose for deletion here as it doesn't seem to be used much at all. <a href="../../../m/d/w/User%7EMdwh_d2b7.html" title="User:Mdwh">Mdwh</a> 20:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep it</b> I came looking after the dedication and found my answer. Appreciate it's existence, sort of an obituary as well. Wouldn't fit as well as a merge, but should be a link from the Daily Show page.</li>
<li><b>Keep it</b> The detail in the article is difficult to find elsewhere. I, for one, am curious to know why he died. Based on the article and his interests and the "Moment of Zen" dedicated to him, I wonder if he was gay. It's interesting that the show dedicated to his death also said some positive things about South Africa's decision to allow gay couples to marry. I caution that I have no knowledge of Bill Clarey's sexual orientation, but gay suicides of young people are very common, and if it does turn out to be the case, it could be a public reminder of this. (Matthew Sheppard's death initially was not focusd on his sexual orientation either.) In any event, I'd keep it, with a link to and from the Daily Show. And I, for one, will check it periodically to see if anyone comes forward with additional information.</li>

<li>Thank you guys for not notifying me so I can edit this page, now I must edit AND re-submit instead of a simple edit online. Please use the tools to notify authors to edit pages instead of deleting pages within minutes of their posting. -Adam
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure exactly how you think this process works, but there's two things you should be aware of. First of all, the page in question has not currently been deleted. All discussions for deletion are left open for 7 days for people to discuss, vote, and revise. If you revise the page such that it meets wikipedia criteria and policy, people who have previously voted for deletion may even be inclined to change their votes. Secondly, the AFD tag at the top does nto prevent you from editing the article in the same way you would have. The only thing we ask is that you not delete the box at the top which indicates to the viewer that the article is being discussed for possible deletion. Lastly, you can click on "watch" at the top of any page and any changes to that page will appear in your watchlist. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 14:43, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep. The group may get less than 600 google hits, but there are few people playing this game currently, as it is a "classic". more than five active members thank-you. and its forums at <a href="http://www.newjedix.com/jas" class="external free" title="http://www.newjedix.com/jas" rel="nofollow">http://www.newjedix.com/jas</a> serve as a hub for several groups of this specific gaming community. from the forum stats: Number of posts: 726 Posts per day: 3.37 Number of topics: 106 Topics per day: 0.20 Number of users: 36 Users per day: 0.79</p>
<p>the group IS active, and would like to be accessable to more people who have an interest in this game as it is increasingly diificult for newcomers to find gaming groups in this game as "Zone.com" the original multiplayer hub when the game was released was bought out by Microsoft and the websites support of the game was dropped. I believe this is worth keeping on the wiki, as a service not to the group, but simply to people looking for gaming communities of this game. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColt_38_f742.html" title="User:Colt 38">Colt 38</a> 08:33, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Unfortunately, according to the consensus developing at <a href="../../../w/e/b/Wikipedia%7EWebsites_fbda.html" title="Wikipedia:Websites">Wikipedia:Websites</a>, a web-related article should meet certain criteria to be included as a Wikipedia article. Firstly, it should be the subject of at least national-level media attention, which, although may be there, I am having trouble finding. Secondly, a forum or group must have 5,000 plus active members, or have a significant impact on the wider community; by your admission you only have 36. Thirdly, the website must have an <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa.html" title="Alexa">Alexa</a> rating of 10,000 or better. The domain that hosts your clan's page (at clubs.battlestats.com) rates in at <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=clubs.battlestats.com/clans/JAS/" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/?url=clubs.battlestats.com/clans/JAS/" rel="nofollow">over 4 million</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A few mentions of memorable titles are appropriate in the main article. Attempting to create a comprehensive list of every such title is beyond the scope of even a paperless encyclopedia. This list is so large (and will continue to get larger as long as the show continues) and the contents so trivial that the list can not be effectively protected from subtle vandalism such as the introduction of plausible but inaccurate information. Yes, in theory it could be protected. But in practice, we have a continual shortage of informed and responsible editors. "Merge and redirect" is, in my mind, unnecessary since the contents of this article came from the main article. History of the original attribution is already preserved there. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 16:34, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

One quick question, did I screw up some policy somewhere that prevented the original VFD from getting listed in all the appropriate places? AFAIK, everything was done properly.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This is the kind of problem I am talking about. The article is so poorly written that the importance of his achievements don't come through. He did not win a school competition, it was a <i>nationwide</i> competition, in all instances. What constitutes a prodigy, may I ask? Is it Google sources? If you want some more evidence, may I direct you to <a href="http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2005/dec02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.news.ops.gov.ph/archives2005/dec02.htm" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, which is a government archive. It clearly states in one section that President Arroyo awarded Gutierrez an Achiever Award. Personally, I think that for a single person to attract the attention of a president, in whatever nation, he has to be quite talented or skilled or notable or whatever word you'd like to use. I do not think this is a vanity article or anything similar. This kid is fast on the rise, and sooner or later, somebody's going to write him in here, whether you like it or not, so what's the use in deleting it? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDon_Diego_3829.html" title="User:Don Diego">Don Diego</a>[[User talk:Don Diego|&lt;sup&gt;(Talk)&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't see what's so racist in saying that I don't believe that a 15-year old can do math and music and come from the Philippines at the same time. It's a fact of life that even competent adults, much less teens, cannot balance their time so that they can study two entirely different fields and still be good at it. And I do not know anybody talented from the Philippines, which I think is currently embroiled in a corruption scandal, correct? I simply cannot begin to comprehend how a "prodigy" can come from such an un-nurturing country. And even with proof of his "achievements", I'd still be very skeptical. <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJake013_0fc9.html" title="User:Jake013">Jake013</a> 13:26, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b>. I happen to know Master Gutierrez personally, and I think he does deserve an entry, after all he's done (though it is in dire need of rewriting). I don't think it would be fair to cite a lack of sources as proof of non-notability. After all, some of the articles written in the Philippines aren't online, and some are real old or have been erased from archives (which happened to some reviews I've been looking for), so it wouldn't be fair saying that a lack of Google sources justifies his non-notability. While it is true taht he still has much to achieve, it is also true that so far, he has already achieved much. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChosen_One_4db9.html" title="User:Chosen One">Chosen One</a> 16:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

However, the drummer for KMFDM is En Esch, not someone named "Blads".

<li><b>Keep.</b> I updated the article to assert notability. Bard is projected by reputable baseball organizations to be among the top five or ten draft picks in next year's major-league draft.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Both of these statements are simply incorrect. According to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies</a>, the following may be included in Wikipedia (italics added):</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or <i>at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States.</i>"</p>
<p>Thus, there is no specification that only major leaguers may be included in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where the Class AA reference came from; Bard has never played in the minors. (The Cape Cod League, referenced in the article, is an amateur league.)</p>
<p>The original article, which I had nothing to do with, didn't particularly make a case for notability. I came across the article while scanning AfD and felt that it was an easy matter to improve the article to show it belongs in Wikipedia. Anyone who takes the time to do even a little Googling will realize that Bard is considered one of baseball's elite college players. His awards, play, and reputation among major-league scouts, front offices, and organizations such as Baseball America confirm this. Barring injury, he will likely be among the first several players chosen in the 2006 major-league draft, and he'll receive a signing bonus of likely one or two million dollars in addition to his salary. Nonnotable baseball players simply don't happen upon this type of situation.</p>
<p>Bard, in fact, has already been drafted once; the New York Yankees drafted him as a high-school pitcher in 2003, but he elected to attend college instead. So if having been drafted is your criterion for inclusion, he's already done that. If verifiability is your thing, every last fact in the article has, as its source, one of the accompanying links. Sawney 00:20, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Playing at the top professional level is one way for an athlete to get over the notability bar, but not the only way. Bard's awards and honors are, in my opinion, enough to establish him as a notable amateur. That said, creating an article for every player ever drafted is an unreasonably broad standard. -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 17:45, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I would argue that point on the general case, as well as the specific one.

<li><b>Delete</b> - nah, I'd say it's a notable site, even if it is closed registration. Yes, it does exist. And I'm sure there are people who go to it who are also Wikipedians, it's difficult to verify anything about it unless you're a member of LL itself. It's probably the most comprehensive links database on the net, even if it is a wee bit hard to get on to, and it is large enough to make a contribution to the internet's over all culture. And before anyone puts a snide little note below this post, I know I haven't made many edits. Thank you for noticing, and have a nice day. LupusCanis 19:12, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and expand</b> I don't know much about the band, but the ideals and beliefs of the band go against the definitions of notability that Wikipedia uses. That does not mean that they are not a legitimate band. They put out several records, and their members are all still active in the <a href="../../../f/o/l/Folk_punk.html" title="Folk punk">folk punk</a> scene. Superradjoe 09:40, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b> As has been stated on behalf other Plan-It-X bands nomintaed for deletion, I do not believe that this is a significant enough deviance from those provisions to warrant deletion. The band has done an internetional tour, as well as countless US tours and released several albums. Those provisions actually work against a band like this who choose not to become "notable", so to speak, due to their personal beliefs about music and life. They are very prominently known among people in the underground punk scene and have a sizable national fanbase. thejer 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b> This band is a huge source of inspiration to DIY punk around the world. Just because they don't fit into the cookie-cutter description of success that you have does not mean that they were not successful. WikiPedia is about providing information to the world, and taking this page down would be counterproductive to those goals. allergic 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not too sure about that, since the punk scene has been rejuvenated in the last few years.

<p>'non-notable movie' - well, your non-notable existence is even a greater source of humour. if you're so righteous, why do you not delete your own user page and save wikipedia some funds. you pretend to administer neutrality but contribute nothing to knowledge, that is why wikipedia is suffering from an image problem. another typical bigot. 70.26.180.74 05:28, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>I think it's fair to say the imdb tag is inaccurate. Apart from that however, I am unsure what constitutes a 'notable' movie to you. How would you know, apart from making that inference due to the fact that I come from a small country?

<p>This article is created in respons to a revert was in the Ali article. IMHO, the article is pov in both content, form and title.</p>
<p>If the "Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib" article is simply NPOV, then it must be merged into the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> article. If it is representing a pov, that being Shi'a pov, it must be merged into <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>. However, it is neither, it is not representing Shi'a pov, nor is it NPOV. Nor is it the pov of anyone else. The creator of the article, and sole contributor to it is <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">User:Zora</a>. The article is nothing more than Zora POV.</p>
<p>The whole content is basicly saying this:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Shi'a are a minority</i></li>
<li><i>Shi'a love Ali</i></li>
<li><i>Shi'a belive Ali was born in the Kaaba</i></li>
<li><i>Shi'a quote Sunni sources, not implying that Sunni belive their own source.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>(a direct lie, since i have proven in many talk pages and dialogs with Zora that Sunnis belive in that also)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Sunni say he was born in his own house.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>(Again, i direct lie, Zora presented a page she belive contained that information, but in fact, the site contradicted her by stating that there is a consensus that Ali was born in the Kaaba. No matter, the site was unprofesional and would not constitute evidence even if it contained what Zora belived it contained. Zora has not presented any source at all that has contradicted or even comments negativly on the credibility of that specific narration.)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Sunni have a alternative candidate, whom they hardly mention.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>(This part of the article is given unfairly little attention)</p>
<ul>
<li><i>No academic historian supports the Shi'a claim.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>(Implying that Shi'a and Sunni scholars are not academics. I have proven that a Sunni scholar regarded it as authentic)</p>
<p>Now, compare it to this article: <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_reported_to_be_born_in_the_Kaaba_82f7.html" title="People reported to be born in the Kaaba">People reported to be born in the Kaaba</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>That article clearly says it is "reports", not mentioning factual credibilty.</li>
<li>It mentions both cases separatly</li>
<li>It gives clear reference to both cases</li>
<li>It gives the pov of Sunni, Shi'a and non-Muslims on both cases</li>
<li>It does not try to discredit the information of one of the cases by first giving a rant about why shi'a whould be biased to beliving in one version.</li>
<li>It contains a NPOV title, "People reported to be born in the Kaaba", instead of the a pov title focused on one of the two.</li>
</ol>
<p>Lastly i want to repeat myself:</p>
<p>If the "Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib" article is simply NPOV, then it must be merged into the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali.html" title="Ali">Ali</a> article. If it is representing a pov, that being Shi'a pov, it must be merged into <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Ali_e6a0.html" title="Shi'a view of Ali">Shi'a view of Ali</a>. <b>However, it is neither, it is not representing Shi'a pov, nor is it NPOV.</b> Nor is it the pov of anyone else.

<dd>My first entry on the talk page said that the article was a placeholder and not very good. On looking at it again, I agree that it needs a lot of work. I had just forgotten to come back to it. However, I don't think it needs to be deleted. Give me a day or two to work on it and I'm sure I can improve it.</dd>
<dd>Striver is trying to get this article removed so that his version of this same controversy, <a href="../../../p/e/o/People_reported_to_be_born_in_the_Kaaba_82f7.html" title="People reported to be born in the Kaaba">People reported to be born in the Kaaba</a>, is the only one left standing. Clearly, the two articles should be merged. They should not be merged under "People reported to be born in the Kaaba", as that is ungrammatical. Nor is it a good representation of the controversy.</dd>
<dd>The use of the term "report" suggests eyewitness reports. But the "reports" were in fact recorded 200 to 300 years after the supposed event, after having been passed down as oral traditions for hundreds of years. Moreover, they were recorded at a time when the Shi'a and Sunni sects of Islam were "settling out" as religious sects rather than political parties. Proto-Shi'a were already making extensive claims for Ali's exalted status, birth in the Kaaba, semi-divinity, etc.</dd>
<dd>Hadith are a vast corpus of contradictory materials. Even Muslim scholars agree that many of them are not reliable. Non-Muslim scholars treat them as so much fable, or use them with extreme caution. By treating 200-300 year old rumors as "reports", Striver is pushing his Shi'a POV, in which Ali is a perfect human being, without sin or error, and must therefore have been born in a way befitting his exalted condition.</dd>
<dd>What Striver is NOT saying is that many Sunni do not believe that the hadith reporting Ali's birth in the Kaaba are reliable. We had one Sunni editor who flatly contradicted Striver, saying that he did NOT believe the tradition. But Striver has already forgotten that and is again accusing me of lying.</dd>
<dd>Striver is also being less than candid in not reporting that the "birth in the Kaaba" tradition is not included in any of the sira literature. It seems to be a late tradition, not an early one. Nor is Striver mentioning the contemporary academics who don't even mention the tradition, having dismissed it as a myth that doesn't even merit refuting. I'm perfectly willing for Striver to have all the room he needs to lay out the Shi'a position and list all the hadith said to support it. I just want him to let other views have equal room -- and for him to let proponents of other views state their own positions.</dd>
<dd>When I picked the title "Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib", I was trying hard for a non-POV title. I think the title I chose is non-POV, in that it doesn't take any stand on where Ali was born. If other editors can think of a different, better, title, I'd be OK with that too.</dd>
<dd>If the two articles are merged, the resulting article is going to be the scene of intense controversy and many revert wars, I'm afraid. But I suppose that's OK, since what I was trying to do was take the controversy out of the <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_ibn_Abi_Talib_924a.html" title="Ali ibn Abi Talib">Ali ibn Abi Talib</a> article, where it has been simmering ever since Striver started editing there. If the controversy has its own article, there should be room to lay out all the arguments, references, etc. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 08:31, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with putting the issue in the bio is the issue is so contentious that it completely hijacks the bio. Putting it in a breakout article makes room for discussion, for all parties to lay out arguments, etc. I'm not adamant about this, however. Particularly as my tactic of trying to keep the bio neutral and put the controversies into their own articles has been completely undermined by an influx of Shi'a editors determined to turn the article into hagiography. It's rather like the continuing struggles over the <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus.html" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As it stands I'd support the deletion of this article, but I'll hold off on voting since Zora intends to work on it. Clearly there is an issue here worth treatment, but I'm still not sure that it can't fit into the Ali article. While I appreciate Zora's comments in that regard, in principle I really don't like the idea of creating separate subarticles for controversial issues that aren't justified by the amount of valuable content in them.<a href="../../../p/a/l/User%7EPalmiro_d72a.html" title="User:Palmiro">Palmiro</a> | <a href="../../../p/a/l/User_talk%7EPalmiro_7aea.html" title="User talk:Palmiro">Talk</a> 21:57, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Name is NPOV in my opinion, but Zora does not like "reports" since it implies eyewitnesses. I do not agree with her, "reports" is NPOV. A "report" can be false, as Shi'a belive the Hakim "reports" are fabricated. Zora wants to remove the possibility of the "reports" even having the possibility of being true, and that is the POV of Zora and those believing all event related to it to be a fabrication. "Claim" is POV, implying "they claim it, but there is no evidence", "Belived" is even worse. There are documented reports of the claim, some people beliveing the reports to be false does not make the word POV, only needs to be represented in the actual article, as it already does.</dd>

<dd>I'm reading Moojan Momen's history of Shi'a Islam right now (thanks to dgl) and it expands a fair bit on the various Shi'a sects and their conceptions of Ali -- some of them turned him into a semi-divinity. I don't think the discussion of this tradition belongs under Kaaba, it belongs under Ali and Shi'a Islam.

<dd>You're probably right. The way Sunnism and Shi'ism played off of each other in history is very interesting and something we fail to discuss well at all. The Safavid / Ottoman split where they formed their identities contra the other to an extent. In all honesty with the breadth of information we could cover I'm not sure how we can have it all in an orderly, readable, and well weighted fashion.

<dd><i>Ali was born under unusual circumstances. On the thirteenth of the holy month of "Rajab", Fatima, the mother of Ali, visited the Kaaba for performing the pilgrimage. During the course of the pilgrimage while circumambulating the Kaaba, Fatima felt the pangs of childbirth. She retired to a secluded place in the precincts of the Holy Kaaba, and there Ali was born. Ali had thus the unique honor of being born in the House of God. This unparalleled honor has endowed Ali with a halo of sanctity, which has become the subject of many legends. A hundred years later, Zain-ul-Abidin a grandson of Ali (son of Husain) met as Arab woman at Najaf who told him that her grandmother had helped on the occasion of the birth of Ali. She narrated that according to the account of her grandmother, the child was beautiful, a smile played on his lips, it did not cry like other children, and its birth did not cause any pain to his mother. <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/01_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[38]</a></i></dd>

<p>PURE non-sense, Sahih Muslim says "Quran and AHl al-Bayt", there is no controversy whatsoever! Now, this guys try to claim there is a controversy about the words, and try to spin it to "quran and Sunnah". Now, HERE in Ghadir Khumm you see a disclaimar abouth "colored because of sectarian and partisan considerations", when there is totaly concensus regarding what was said!</p>
<p>Is this what you call a joint Shi'a Sunni site?</p>

<p>Zora, is this what you are trying to claim is a joint Shi'a-Sunni site?</p>
<p>The site reiterates sunni pov, and when it must sayin <b>established</b> sunni pov that benefits Shi'a pov, its gives disclaimers!</p>
<p>Zora, where did you get the idea of them being a joint Shi'a-Sunni site from? Did you even bother to look for five second around before labeling it a "joint sunni-Shi'a site"?</p>
<p>Again: Zora logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ali being born in the Kaaba: <i>"It's a distinctive feature of Shi'ism". (Because Zora says so)</i></li>
<li>Anyone accepting the narration is Shi'a, because Zora says so.</li>
<li>That site give that narration, hence, it must be Shi'a, or maybe joint Shi'a Sunni.</li>
</ul>
<p>Get your head out of your <a href="../../../b/i/g/Bigot.html" title="Bigot">bigoting</a> <a href="../../../e/g/o/Ego.html" title="Ego">ego</a> and start doing some real reserch!</p>
<p>Its feels like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zora: "The earth is flat"</li>
<li>Striver: "But this guys says the world is round"</li>
<li>Zora: "He is Shi'a, it doesnt count"</li>
<li>Striver: "But they are Sunnis, they belive in the four Sunni Caliphs"</li>
<li>Zora: "It does'nt mater, then they are joint Shi'a Sunni. The earth is flat, end of discusion!"</li>
</ul>
<p>She is totaly incapable of accepting a defeat or even entertain the thought of being misstaken. This is not a new argument, i have tried to make her realise that this Sunni site says he was born in the Kaaba, but she goes on with her fingers in her ears sayng it a "distinct Shi'a belief". She is truly unique... --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:01, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Striver, I think you've seen me apologizing for mistakes numerous times. As to Witness-Pioneer -- I said that I'm not sure of what to make of it. I paged rapidly through the narrative looking for the usual points of controversy, and it seemed to me that the author of the work was trying to make nice-nice to both sides. Frex, here's a quote about Ghadir Khum:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>When all people, over one hundred thousand in number had assembled at the pond in the Khum valley, the Holy Prophet addressed them. The exact text of the address is not available. There is a good deal of controversy about the contents of the address, and both the Sunnis and the Shias have their own versions of the address. <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/32_ali_bin_talib.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/32_ali_bin_talib.htm" rel="nofollow">[45]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And after that, the author doesn't take sides! If this is a Sunni site, it seems to me that it's not a typical Sunni site. Now that wouldn't at all be important if there were a dozen other Sunni sites, or books, anything, giving the Ali-born-in-the-Kaaba story. But I haven't been able to find them. That's not to say that they don't exist. I'm perfectly willing to believe that some Sunni accept this story. It seems utterly implausible to me (I'm religious, but I don't believe in miracles) but millions of Sunni Muslims believe other things that I'd regard as implausible. But it is really not clear just how widespread this belief is among the Sunni. I have a few books written by Sunnis (Zakaria and Lings) and they don't mention the story at all. More references would help. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 12:13, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Zora, you know that it is standard issue for the sunnis to not talk about that. They dont want to "take side", since there is only <b>one</b> side, only <b>one</b> version of the text of the event, the one saying that Muhammad left the Qura'an and Ahl al-Bayt and saying Ali is the Mawla of everyone. That is authentic by all Sunni scholars. Yet, Sunni biographies dont want to touch it. That is not NPOV, that is POV to the point that they dont even want to admit their own POV.</p>
<p>And further, you remeber this? <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.islam/browse_thread/thread/1a0e8ae31161d9fe/c5bee68b4b1c1fdb#c5bee68b4b1c1fdb" class="external autonumber" title="http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.islam/browse_thread/thread/1a0e8ae31161d9fe/c5bee68b4b1c1fdb#c5bee68b4b1c1fdb" rel="nofollow">[46]</a></p>
<p>A Sunni answering "somone" that asked if Sunnis belive Ali was born ther with:</p>
<dl>
<dd><i><b>Indeed Ali was born in Kaaba</b>, but he was not the only one born in Kaaba. From time of Ismael &amp; Abraham the <b>people born in Kaaba amount to 100 thousand</b>. It was the custom for pregnant women of high statue to spend the last days near Kaaba hoping they deliver there. <b>There were two people contemporary with Mohammad and Ali who was born in Kaaba.</b> He was an Infidel and ran from Mekka when Prophet entered the City. He was wanted by the Prophet. He was later pardoned and converted to Islam. Also, many many Arabs had the Name Ali at the time of Mohammad and before him. <b>So, I don't know what is the big deal about these two matters.</b></i></dd>
</dl>
<p>Shi'a belive only Ali was born there, that sunni guy belived half the world, inclusive Ali, was born there. You know this, you have read this, yet you are doing something that can be nothing else than lying by writing thins like</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>"It's a distinctive feature of Shi'ism".</b></dd>

<p>Zora, stop lying. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:30, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm tempted to say "A pox on both your houses." There is no room in Wikipedia for personal attacks <i><b>on either side</b></i>. It's clear we have divergent POVs here; so I'd suggest relying more on verifiable references that don't prefer one side or the other. If the protagonists in this soap opera can't take a step back, then the most prudent move to make is to <b>Userfy</b> until they can resolve their differences and work jointly on <b>ONE</b> article. If userfication is not an option, it might be best to delete both as vandalism magnets if the persons involved cannot show self-restraint. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 18:25, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I re-added a lot of the stuff that was previously at <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papoose.html" title="Papoose">Papoose</a> (before that article was made to be about Papoose the thing rather than Papoose the rapper), because the original <a href="../../../p/a/p/Papoose.html" title="Papoose">Papoose</a> article had a lot more info than the rapper article. I have also added the references, including his 50-part discography and him receiving the MTV award.

<li>I'd just like to comment here that this was a good faith attempt at an article. The user who created this page was not doing so for vanity, and genuinely believed that Papoose was suitably notable for his own article. It was written by a newbie, and hence is written in a newbie way. The author didn't cite the references very well, and it is poorly written. But please remember Wikipedia's policy of "Don't bite the newbies" and also to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> assume good faith. I have seen the comments made by Susan Larson about this, including refusing to allow the author to make their voice heard, which is really a bit unfair. An author is permitted to have a vote. The sock puppet issue comes in if they try to make 2 votes. Whilst I don't know what happened in the original article nomination, I just think that we should be working more towards helping newbies rather than automatically suspecting them of evil deeds.

<li>Strange, I see etymology, and two differing objects the term refers to (a small Native American child, and the a form of bag or holdall). There is most definitely sufficient there for a stub on a notable topic, with a very good chance of expansion. You should not vote to delete an article because it's a dictionary definition at the moment. Instead, perhaps you could consider tagging it for expansion. It should only be suggested for deletion if there is <i>no possibility</i> of expanding it beyond the dictionary definition. Here you could have the history of the papoose bag, manufacture techniques, manufacturers, market conditions, periods it was popular in fashion, why the bag is called a 'papoose', and so on, and so forth. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 15:29, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If the article title is confusing, than a move to a new title is appropriate. The title shouldn't be grounds for deletion. The article as it stands is pretty poor, but we have a number of decent articles on different military units (based on the unit's history and not one battle). It is possible this could be expanded to that level, but I don't know enough to know to one way or the other. <i>unsigned by <a href="../../../j/l/a/User%7EJLaTondre_be65.html" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> 00:48, 16 December 2005</i></li>

<dd>No problem.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Here is your cite <a href="http://www.rockol.it/rockol/reggae/dizio.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.rockol.it/rockol/reggae/dizio.htm" rel="nofollow">[61]</a>. I will quote the relevant part, "PUM-PUM a woman's genitals (6) ". It is the Trinidadian equivalent of <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punani.html" title="Punani">punani</a> apparently. Another cite here <a href="http://www.ddg.com/LIS/InfoDesignF97/malyce/dict.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ddg.com/LIS/InfoDesignF97/malyce/dict.htm" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> and here <a href="http://www.yush.com/rewind/yush0109/slang.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yush.com/rewind/yush0109/slang.htm" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. It is in extremely widespread use, but, as you can see from the google links I provided above, it has come to mean more than just a woman's genitals. It can refer to a type of sexy close-fitting shorts (worn by women) called "pum pum shorts". It can refer to a woman herself "a bunch of pum pums are dancing". And it seems to have other meanings as well. It also seems to be a <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafarian.html" title="Rastafarian">Rastafarian</a> word, not just Trinidadian. Oh, and here is a cite giving its meaning as "vagina" or "woman" <a href="http://www.earthcultureroots.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.earthcultureroots.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>. And, whilst this is slang, it is clearly in widespread use in Rastafarian areas with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Pum+Pum%22+and+%22rasta%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Pum+Pum%22+and+%22rasta%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">14,400 google hits</a>.

<li>Actually, sorry, I should correct that.

<li>Interesting on punani - I know it as a Trini word long before pum pum (a J'can word) came into common usage. Given usage I assumes that punani had hindi origins. As for "pum pum shorts" - the meaning is the same - it's shorts that are so small and tight that they show off just about everything. The alternate usage is a dicdef though, not really an article. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 18:19, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm not convinced that they mean the same thing. Historically, maybe, but currently no. Punani only means vagina. Pum pum can also mean women. They also have deeper meanings that differ. I am beginning to think that I should have left the essay in there. It looks like that explained everything nicely. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 20:03, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I got a link to something that traces the history of the word pum pum here <a href="http://www.pumpumpoets.com/pum_pum_poetry_defined.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pumpumpoets.com/pum_pum_poetry_defined.htm" rel="nofollow">[65]</a>. I am not sure how reliable the information is, but it seems that they are suggesting that Punany came first, and Pum Pum is a "dirtier" version of Punany, since Punany eventually came to be more polite. But apparently now even Pum Pum is not derogatory anymore. By the way, the <a href="../../../p/u/n/Punani.html" title="Punani">Punani</a> article is really inaccurate if it credits it to <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_G_f9eb.html" title="Ali G">Ali G</a>, given this evidence. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 19:45, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Its actually a bit confusing, since it seems to be both derogatory and a compliment at the same time. I guess its similar to <a href="../../../s/l/u/Slut.html" title="Slut">slut</a> in that way, or perhaps <a href="../../../h/o/_/Ho.html" title="Ho">ho</a>. It'd be interesting to find out what its deeper meaning is, and its place in <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rastafarian.html" title="Rastafarian">rastafarian</a> culture. Oh, and apparently since Punany/<a href="../../../p/u/n/Punani.html" title="Punani">Punani</a> is now Americanised, Pum Pum is now the preferred term in Rastafarian culture, since they now view the definition of Punany as being Americanised. It'd be an interesting thing to look in to. Pity if we have to wipe something that's enormously popular and in widespread use with cultural significance before we've had a chance to write it properly. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 19:48, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not too sure about your use of "rastafarian" - it's a "mainstream" word (crude, not polite, but not limited to a single subculture), in Jamaica, Trinidad, and almost certainly the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean.

<p><b>Article should remain</b> I take issue to this article being deleted as "propaganda". While the article currently may have a bias, it is listed as a stub and is a new article. It is hardly the only biased article on Wikipedia, and bias means the article needs improvement; not deletion. I agree that google doesn't return many results, but google is not the only source for peer reviewed information! I have edited and added to this article, and while I did reference several sites I found via google, I also live in Volusia County (the county in which the group operates) and talked with several people about the group in order to check the accuracy of the information - this included both members of the group and those not associated with it). To my knowledge the information is accurate. I would be happy to continue editing and revising this article, and hope that any bias issues can be addressed on the talk/discussion page rather than just deleting an article because of a political bias for or against the group. <a href="../../../d/a/t/User%7EDatapharmer_4319.html" title="User:Datapharmer">Datapharmer</a> 02:11, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Rename/redirect?</b> I am not against the idea of combining the article with an entry on local level Democratic Parties in the State and I would certainly not block a consensus on merging it if others feel it would be appropriate, but I feel it would be innapropriate if merged directly into the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Democratic_Party_6a1c.html" title="Florida Democratic Party">Florida Democratic Party</a> article because the article is about the state group not the local ones. There are distinct articles for the state and national level, is there a reason there should not be one at the local level as well? Perhaps a single article that would cover all local democratic groups within the state would solve this issue? <a href="../../../d/a/t/User%7EDatapharmer_4319.html" title="User:Datapharmer">Datapharmer</a> 03:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I propose to delete this article. A google search for "ecological cognition" does not bring up any references to this guy bishop (other than his own webpage). Ecological psychology is an important branch of psychology, and there are centers devoted to it (e.g. CESPA at the university of connecticut). Ecological psychology has much to say on the subject of cognition. What is this fellow saying that has not been said by the 50 year old community of ecological psychologists, that is so important that we need a whole new "branch of cognitive psychology"?</p>
<p>I suspect that this article has been written by Bishop himself. What he says does seem to be related to ecological psychology, but rather superficially. You cannot just coin some phrase and then put an article up on wikipedia suggesting that you have invented a disicpline!! To make that claim, you need to have a large body of publications, and several researchers other than yourself using your ideas. This guy graduated a couple of years ago (not in psychology, neuroscience or cognitive science I might add) and has knocked together a couple of papers on E-learning. From this we are expected to regard his body of work as a discipline comparable to ecological psychology. This is the kind of stuff that puts wikipedia into disrepute.</p>

If you have criticisms of Kyttä and Bishop's outstanding and groundbreaking research why not make them on the page? It seems to me we have two young researchers making progress in post cognitivist psychology and all their not so academic peers can do is try to destroy the progress they have made. I have an interest in all forms of psychology, as you can see from my edits, I think ecological cognition and situated cognition are very interesting theories and we should not deprive people like Kvcad of finding out about them.

<p>Keep. Could we suspend judgment until the Bocij-Holmes Law becomes part of the archive? Google is not a conduit to scholarly sources, mainly just to junk from Usenet (e.g. see Godwin's Law).

<li><b>Comment</b> - There are so few Yiddish words used in English, that IMO they all should have their own articles. Yadda yadda yadda, <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schmuck.html" title="Schmuck">Schmuck</a>, <a href="../../../o/y/_/Oy_vey.html" title="Oy vey">Oy vey</a>, <a href="../../../k/o/s/Kosher.html" title="Kosher">Kosher</a>. I think that's it. A whopping great 4 of them. Words from other languages that have made their way in to the English language are notable too. Like <a href="../../../c/27/e/C%27est_la_vie.html" title="C'est la vie">C'est la vie</a>, <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eureka.html" title="Eureka">Eureka</a>, <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voila.html" title="Voila">Voila</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/o/Aloha.html" title="Aloha">Aloha</a> and I think that's about it. Indeed, the words that moved from another language to become English words are more notable than those which started off English - especially those that have only recently moved. Anyway, that's my opinion. I was quite shocked that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schmuck.html" title="Schmuck">Schmuck</a> is about people with a German surname of Schmuck. I think that's just wrong. What's more notable? A common surname in another language or a term used to mean "you no good person" (roughly)? The Yiddish Schmuck is way more notable. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 13:45, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry? I didn't check through the google too much, just enough to note that all the google hits were actually about this. It meets Alexa pretty easily though. 2,000 while 10,000 is the criteria.

<li><a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Cdghost_2076.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cdghost">Per UncleG</a>, the best use of Google results is to carefully scan through them, and find "other people have found the subject notable enough that they have gone to the effort of writing and publishing stuff of their own about it". Many of the Paperdoll Heaven hits are either simply links to the site that look like they could have been placed there as part of an <a href="../../../s/e/o/SEO_d889.html" title="SEO">SEO</a> compaign (eg. many one-liners from blogspot <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/17/google_draws_fire_over_blogspot_spam_blogs.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2005/10/17/google_draws_fire_over_blogspot_spam_blogs.html" rel="nofollow">[75]</a>), or are mentions by blogs (many of them non-notable). I suppose that it's not a subject that newspapers would write about often, but maybe that means its inclusion in an encyclopedia should be borderline, not Strong.

<p>Since notability is subjective, how is the notability judged? Would listing the copyright information satisfy the verifiability claim? Emcnutt</p>
<ul>
<li>Let's see here... I would start by trying to establish the company that released the film (online); then checking such reliable sources as rottentomatoes.com or imdb.com or any other the movie review guides, either on paper or online (and if it's not listed in <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leonard_Maltin_2cf9.html" title="Leonard Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a>'s guide and less than 20 years old, I don't go further as it would be there if it were a notable recent film). Now... let's double check a few sources -- <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rottentomatoes.com.html" title="Rottentomatoes.com">rottentomatoes.com</a> (not mentioned); <a href="../../../i/m/d/Imdb.com.html" title="Imdb.com">imdb.com</a> (not mentioned); <a href="../../../m/o/v/Movies.com.html" title="Movies.com">movies.com</a> (not mentioned); <a href="../../../y/a/h/Yahoo%21.html" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo</a> movies (not mentioned); <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">movies.nytimes.com</a> (not included in over 15,000 movie reviews published in the <i>New York Times</i> since 1981). I don't need to check the Leonard Maltin book -- <b>Delete</b> as an ad for a sequel for a nn motion picture. And, yes, the article explicity mentions it to be a purported film (how many plays have numbered sequels?). <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 01:23, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>The article mentions quite clearly that it is a screenplay, not a film. I'm not sure why you said it was explicitly mentioned to be a film as the word "film" isn't even found in the article. There would be no listing in film directories as it has never been made into a movie. Emcnutt
<ul>
<li>The last two subheadings in the article indicate otherwise. Either way you look at it (as a nn screenplay that wasn't made, or a nn motion picture, or an ad for a sequel for this nonentity), the argument reinforces the rationale for my original vote, which I shall not change. If the last two sections of the article are flat out wrong in indicating that there were a finished screenplay and movie (again, the giveaway is the announcement of a sequel), then the article should be speedily deleted. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 23:02, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Whilst it isn't an enormously notable term to describe people from <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redding%2C_California_4731.html" title="Redding, California">Redding, California</a>, it is nonetheless used a little bit <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Reddingites%22+and+%22california%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=%22Reddingites%22+and+%22california%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>, and there is confirmation that the information in the article is correct, too <a href="http://reddingforum.com/rf/viewtopic.php?t=162&amp;view=previous" class="external autonumber" title="http://reddingforum.com/rf/viewtopic.php?t=162&amp;view=previous" rel="nofollow">[80]</a>, <a href="http://www.redharvest.net/2005_04_01_red-harvest_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.redharvest.net/2005_04_01_red-harvest_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[81]</a> and others. Would consider a merge in to the town. Also should go through what is said and fact check it a bit. I couldn't find a source that said anything about what a Reddingite is usually like.

<li><b>Keep</b> I live in San Diego and I know a few people that use the term Reddingites and I feel that this article is useful for out of towners to learn about the background that molds those that move out of the small town.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the only reason given for deleting this is WP:WEB which is a) Not policy [direct quote] and b) A POV notability standard. Therefore WP:WEB is not a valid reason. As for Alexa, it has great difficulty tracking sites that are outside the UK - I have a fairly reasonable search engine ranking for my site but Alexa is still showing the version from a few months ago. The other reason (Alexa) is therefore also invalid, and since no section of the Afd policy was quoted as justification for this, that makes it a keep in my book. <a href="../../../c/y/n/User%7ECynical_3d57.html" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a></li>

Notablity is an ephemeral concept of course but the article gives no indication of why this concept should apply to this site.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It's a major part of university administration and student life in American universities. The term is regularly used and it's a recognized profession with its own international organization (ACUHO-I), several annual international, national, and regional conferences and training events, and a regularly-published peer-reviewed journal. I haven't spent much time looking at the particulars of the article but the topic itself is certainly worthwhile and could be expanded into a much larger article with details about the OxBridge foundations of American residence life, the three areas of housing administration recognized by ACUHO-I (of which residence life is but one), RA recruitment, selection, and recruitment, programming requirements, living-learning communities, and so forth.

If we merge, the original article should remain as a redirect. In any case, <b>AfD is not the place for merges</b>. I believe the ever-increasing trend towards nominator voting has fuelled this misconception: people think their nomination is no different from any other vote; it requires no more effort, and provides no less in the way of options. <b>If you nominate an article for deletion, it means you want the article deleted, or, if not, are acting in proxy for someone who does</b>. It's bad enough trying to vote instead of writing a nomination for an article, without then making your vote "merge". Merges can be carried out without AfD. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 17:56, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Then perhaps "merge" wasn't the right way of expressing what I thought should happen. I feel the article should be deleted because "i don't see it merits its own article" per nomination. I made the point that IF (and it is an if, I'm not sufficiently knowledgeable to know) any of these people need to be listed they should be added to the university article. Doing so wouldn't violate the GFDL (edit histories could be merged if the need be) but in any case - it is purely a list of names which we are talking about, so there is no "original content" with which an author needs credit. I'm not in favour of a simple "copy and paste content to other article and make this a redirect" or I would not have listed on AfD. <sub>└</sub> <i><sup><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">TALK</a></sub></i><sup>┐</sup> 19:30, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I am well aware of the options available on AfD, thanks. Merge is a legitimate option on AfD, yes; but we do not list articles that we want merged. We merge them instead. AfD is <i>articles for deletion</i>, not <i>articles that should have something drastic done to them but I don't know what</i>. Following on from "don't nominate merges", you can expect "don't nominate stuff you just want cleaned up" and "don't nominate stuff you don't want deleted just to make a point", coming soon to a theatre near you. 'Course, as I mentioned above, if we didn't have a large subset of nominators attempting to vote instead of writing a decent nomination, this would probably cut down on the problem a little bit. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 03:39, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Eeugh! Someone more polite than I should consider taking this user under their wing and teaching them how to use Wikibooks or something. Anyway. The article. Well, it's an unnecessary and unencyclopaedic (though I dare say interesting) fork, which incidentally fails to take into account the need for a geographically neutral POV (if nothing else, don't assume that everyone will immediately think "America! Land of the free, home of the brave!" at the mention of "1775").

<p>The only reference in the whole Internet to a company called Morgan Stanley Investments, Inc. is this Wikipedia article, entered by an anonymous user. Google references regarding the name of its chairman point to a Chilean character, once rejected as a candidate to the Senate because of not having proved completion of secondary school, and identified by several sources as a swindler. The same anonymous editor inserted false data in <a href="../../../m/o/r/Morgan_Stanley_e95b.html" title="Morgan Stanley">Morgan Stanley</a> associating this company (and other "phantom" company called Morgan Stanley Chile S A) with the "real" Morgan Stanley.

<p>Reply to these false statements: Cinabrium in writting false statements abour Morgan Stanley Investments, and deleting without reason: It is false that " the chilean character " was rejected for senate post due to not having proved the completion of secondary school. Further, the chilean newspaper "La Tercera" published a rectification article saying that it was wrong to say that this man involved with Morgan Stanley Investments did not have proper qualifications. A Licence was issued by the chilean education authority stating that under file 05/1468/29/07/1997 was duly validated his High School Diploma issued in the U.S. on 1967. The company Morgan Stanley Chile, S.A. is a duly formed company under the chilean corporate laws, and as this article in cowardly written, we can't take Cinabrium to Court for his slander. I take full responsability of this statement as attorney at law. Signed: Jaime Ortuzar - phone 664-0000.-</p>

Also, the existing category seems to cover places from all over the greater Wellington region, while this page sticks to Wellington proper, so they're not really equivalent. -- <a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVardion_fde2.html" title="User:Vardion">Vardion</a> 23:50, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Keep- Results 1 - 10 of about 342,000 for ilxor. (0.08 seconds), it's been cited and discussed in newspapers like the New York Times and The Guardian, enough articles on her actually mention discussions on it (see the entries for MIA and Prolapse), I would venture as far as to say only someone who doesn't understand Wikipedia would request a deletion for this entry.</p>

<p>Keep or Delete, it's up to you, but if you're going to keep, then for god's sake get some better content than that in - none of the names cited are "much-loved internet personalities" they are music writers, apart from the last-named, who is a homophobic nuisance poster on the board (who is also probably responsible for putting the article up in the first place).</p>

<dd>Excuse me, but I am that "homophobic nuisance poster". I didn't put up the article in the first place (it was Tuomas, don't you know) and I am an internet personality. Just the other day, someone walked up to me and said "I KNOW YOU FROM THE INTERNET. TO BE SPECIFIC, I LOVE MUSIC!" -- Love, Esteban Buttez

<dd>I'm sure the folks at Wikipdeia are fascinated by this, "Esteban".

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The content of the article could be improved, but ILM/ILX is of cultural significance.</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. As per the above exchange, any entry about "I Love Music" is likely to be persistently changed back and forth for "humorous" purposes by board trolls, such as "Esteban", above. I'm a long-term regular poster on "I Love Music", it's a fun place, but to be honest I really have my doubts about its "cultural significance", despite its appearing in newspapers, and some of the other regulars being published authors etc.</li>

<p>Is Wiki reserved for items of "cultural significance" now?</p>

If a new page is, in its first draft, going to be unsuitable for Wikipedia, then it can be worked on in a user subpage or, for that matter, in Notepad. And it can still be worked on after it's deleted. If it's substantially improved and recreated, it won't be eligible for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia has information on all sorts of obscure topics, why single this one out as not being notable enough?

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I appreciate the effort that user George has put in, this is too granular for an encyclopedia.

<li>It seems that people pounce on an article with a narrow title. It is easy to identify such an article, and kudos to the first person to nominate it for destruction. This must be a sport on Wikipedia. Anyway, what about the 6000 uncited words on Winston Churchill? There must be twenty books in my local library that cover Churchill better than that page. What I was <b>trying</b> to put up was new information, not available <i>anywhere</i> else. I don't think you can judge the usefulness of this information now - maybe after a few years or decades. Think of the details historians would love to have about Lincoln's life, but they weren't recorded because they were deemed to be <i>trivial</i> at the time. People here are too quick to judge. I would strongly argue that an article should get at least a week or better 3 months before it becomes possible to target it for deletion. How can ideas get off the ground otherwise? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeccampbell_ddc7.html" title="User:Georgeccampbell">george</a> 00:46, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This article contains information about <i>very local</i> history. You may not be interested in the postwar Suburban development in the midwest, but others may be. This article gives the development history of a stretch of North High Street in Columbus, Ohio over the past 50 years. I am trying to create a web of interlocking pages covering <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worthington%2C_Ohio_a6d9.html" title="Worthington, Ohio">Worthington, Ohio</a> and north <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbus%2C_Ohio_64f3.html" title="Columbus, Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>. A lot of work went into researching each property and photographing it. Why should I put a lot of effort into creating Wikipedia pages if they are going to be deleted? Some guy from Maine doesn't think north Columbus, Ohio history is interesting, so he throws a rock at my work.

<li>Before starting a wikipedia article, the most crucial question to ask yourself is: "Can this article one day be a featured article?" If the answer to that question is no, then the next question should be: "where can I place this information for it to be easily found and appreciated?"

<li>Then how will you ever build a base of knowledge? I can't believe that you would eliminate carefully researched information from what is essentially a limitless storage medium. You know what the historians value most when looking at the past? Its the detailed, specific, mundane day-to-day details of life. If that information is blocked from Wikipidia today because its "too granular", then how will it be available to Sociologists in 2050? I guess they will have to content themselves with reading about <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a> to glean what our society was like. Another point - this page wasn't even up ONE DAY before you decided to delete it. Why don't you let other people read it before you shoot it down? If information is a fractal, then the 'Politically Correct' Wikipedians would eliminate all the whorls and spikes leaving a dull, bland outline.

<li><b>Comment</b>: One thing that influences me is that if we decide a small stretch of one road somewhere in America is worthy of inclusion, theoretically either a) we should create similar articles to cover every road everywhere (this one demonstrates no especial notability), or b) we're basically implying that this street deserves special attention. If it's kept, someone is going to come across it (how, I have no idea, as I can't think what articles would link to it, but...) and think "Why is this on here?" It's all very well to say "Because Wikipedia is not paper" (which is, let's face it, a truism), but they aren't going to understand that. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:35, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>So basically, any unique information on Wikipedia is going to get killed off and it will simply cover topics that are covered <i>much better</i> elsewhere.

How do you know where this will lead? Did you read the part about <i>Ann-Ton's</i> restaurant? As far as I know this is the only place that had been pulled together. You say the street is not <i>notable</i> - well that is a purely <b>subjective</b> assertation.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I too go to Harvard Law School. This day is real. This is the second year it was celebrated, and this year it was bigger than ever. Nick had nothing to do with the entry at all.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Why is this so hard to believe? Do you really think that Harvard announcements would be open to the public? Do you really think we want the unwashed masses, the riff-raff that populate Cambridge, attending our events? Forbid it almighty God! As should be clear by now from the voluminous response from Harvard Law students, this is a real event. The Nick Rose Day Happy Hour was held at Tommy Doyles in Harvard Square. This celebration occurred immediately following the Nick Rose Day party, an event that was heavily attended. Perhaps if those of you who doubt this holiday’s existence try very hard and pray fervently to your gods, you too can attend Harvard Law School and experience this deeply significant cultural event. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.128.136.63 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.128.136.63_866c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.128.136.63">contribs</a>) 16:13, 14 December 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not attend HLS, but I am a lawyer, I do know several people who currently attend HLS, I interview applicants from HLS, and I am well aware of Nick Rose Day. First person accounts should be allowed for a Wikipedia entry; any suggestion about 'standards' not allowing first person accounts is absurd. You can contact any number of HLS students (or me - bpashler@gmail.com) to verify - if after that you feel that this is all part of an elaborate conspiracy to invent a tradition out of whole cloth, then feel free to edit the section to include that commentary. But to delete the content in the face of first person verifiable accounts (and no verifiable does not require a web link - check your definition of veracity) is not consistent with the standards of Wikipedia, so get off your high horse...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 38.117.182.130 (<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.117.182.130.html" title="User talk:38.117.182.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.117.182.130_1b53.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.117.182.130">contribs</a>) 20:14, 14 December 2005.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Though I know the wikipedia holier/nerdier/somehow-better-linked-to-a-general social and intellectual-conscienceness-than-thou "community" will nix it. HLS brethren, look at the discussion for (the ultimate) deletion of [D-bag football]. It is quite enlightening to see what others think they know about this school, its students, or even what a reasonable argument to keep a page looks like. Again, the anti-HLS bias present in this "community" ranges from innane contempt to outright animosity. Know that comments like "I fear for the future of American jurisprudence" and "if you're a law student, shouldn't you....(wow, whoever wrote that, just wow)" reflect a larger issue with the people on this site ... considering the number of undeleted, horribly written pages on this server that have little to do with anything of importance (by any definition ...even the mighty Wikipedia's, which you will find means <b>nothing</b>). Seriously, look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football</a> and see where well-articulated, logical, and, frankly, CORRECT arguments will get you. See the SAME BS COMMENTS? .............................The irony is simple; the better you defend your site, <i>the more they will go after you</i>. Make a broad argument? You are too dumb for law school, much less Harvard. Mop the floor with a Nozickian deconstruction of their flimsy premises? Well now you are simply being pretentious, and hey, you aren't that smart anyway you over-privileged snoot. Point out their OBVIOUS prejudice? What are you talking about you elite ass -- get out of your ivory tower and taste the real word (for a change). Now for the record, I am bitter and angry at Wikipedia, but not for the loss of the d-bag article .... it is for the hypocrisy that seems more than apparent by this alledged community.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a real holiday celebrated by students at the Harvard Law School, with defined rituals (wearing pink/red) and a real-life inspiration (the actual Nick Rose).

<p>NB on "sock puppet" votes. As it turns out HLS is expensive, and as such we students like to get what are called "roomates" in the parlance of our times. this being the case, myself and my 2 roomates (as well as other apartments i might add) share the same wireless connection and (lordy!) the same IP address. Thus, any claim of "sock puppet" votes is in fact re-tahd-ed as people here would say. good day. 24.61.41.250 00:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC) (no idea what "24.61.41.250 00:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)" means.</p>
<ul>
<li>And how does anyone external to Harvard verify that there's a procession of people using the same IP and not one person attempting to sockpuppet? We don't. Regardless, the long procession of anon-IP votes is not helping to keep the article. As I previously noted, it is in fact harming it. If you want this article to remain, then provide some externally verifiable proof. How about scanning an article about the holiday from The Harvard Crimson and tossing it up on a web server somewhere? Better yet, reference the article on their website. I searched their website though, and there's nary a peep about it. If it's such a big event, how come the Crimson doesn't even cover it? Look, all of these assertions by the anonymous IPs are meaningless without verifiable sources.

<p>Wow. It appears that Wikipedia is overrun by people with way too much time on their hands, something which I do not have. I can no longer fight this battle. If you want verification, I will forward you emails from a harvard law school account. I can take pictures of stuff for you. whatever you want. I can not change that fact that Harvard Law School protects that part of its site. I dont know what else you want from me. That article was written by a few students here. We are in the middle of finals here, hence the lack of careful attention to editing etc. I cant defend this anymore. If you are so nuts about deleting it then just do it. Maybe some day I wil re-post it and try and work this all out. Everything here can be verified. And no, this is not done by Nick.</p>

<li>I'm not going to undo the changes I made to unsort logged in and non-logged in votes. If you feel there is a need to do so, then feel free to go through the ~hour of work to do so. Personally, I don't see there being a reason for doing so. There is no de facto marginalization. The votes for anon-IPs exist and have not been removed from the page. They've been sorted by IP in an attempt to quell the apparent sock-puppet attempts and allow the admin that closes this AfD to do so more easily rather than having to contend with the mess this AfD was in before I did the sort. I invite you to review <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#AfD_etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#AfD_etiquette</a>, in particular the 4th bullet.

<li>so you have "~hour" to support one point of view but 0 time for the other. Interesting. That seems pretty unbiased to me. ... Right.

<li>My changes did not support one view or another. My changes organized the AfD in an appropriate manner. It was horribly formatted before my changes, and very difficult to follow. I don't particularly care if you think I am a liar or fool. I acted in good conscience, and my conscience is clear. Rather than spending so much time attempting to rebuke me and others for all sorts of perceived sins, why not spend the time to find some externally verifiable information regarding this supposed holiday? You're not helping keep the article with your efforts. If you really want the article kept, then exert some of that energy into finding some sources. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 13:20, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think you are a liar or a fool, and I apologize if you found the comments above to imply as such. I was strictly speaking towards the "percieved sin" of biased organization. I (and others) found these "housekeeping" edits to be so obviously slanted that the only avenues of denial appeared to be deceit or ignorance. Well, that plus my perception of you and others harboring a healthy bias against HLS. But that is not how a discussion should run, and I apologize to all for nudging it off track. However, I took your advice and refocused my efforts. With some cross-checking (verifying some "long pointless text" posted above), I found cause for some reorganization of my own. I have re-confirmed a source <i>and</i> participated in some clean-up. Thank you for the sage advice. --<a href="../../../d/g/a/User%7EDgaston_8334.html" title="User:Dgaston">Dgaston</a> 08:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It continues to astonish me that presumably smart people somehow think that sites like WP generate these ridiculously low unique hit counts. I have explained elsewhere, but will do so again
<p>When you perform a google search, it collects a sample of 1000 pages (based on pagerank). What you are seeing is the total number of unique pages per the thousand collected. A rough extrapolation requires therefore that you take the total number of unique hits x the total# of pages, divided by a thousand. In the case of Wikipedia, you have to correct for your sample; the number of duplicates is so low <i>because the pagerank of Wikipedia itself is so high.</i> I mean honestly, did you really think that Wikipedia was only mentioned in 81 unique places??? <b>Delete</b> this as nn. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 14:35, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I agree with you that it still fits well within the speedy deletion criteria. However, <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> notes that "If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to AFD instead."

<li>I take "the assertion" in that phrase as meanign the asserion of notability. taht is, if the articel says "X is notable because he did Y" then saying "no he didn't do Y" makes the assertion disputed. Simply saying "yes he is notable" with no reason given does not make the matter disputed IMO. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 01:06, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>If simply saying "X is notable" avoids a speedy, and if simply saying "I dispute the deletion" requires undeltion and AfD, both with no evidece for or indication of notability beyond mere assertion, than A7 is pretty useless and pointless.

<li>Can we stop worrying so much about Google hits? The main problem is that the article doesn't say anything about why he is notable.

<li>I'll admit, the Google test is not always meaningful; the thing that saves those articles from speedy deletion, however, is not their Google hits but their <i>content</i>. Prove to us that the Google test has failed us here and <i>add something meaningful to the article</i>. If you are unable to do so in English, as you have indicated on my talk page, there's not a whole lot we can do here unless we get a translator. Does an article on this person exist on the Chinese Wikipedia?

In addition, over the last year he has been profiled by every college football recruiting service and been the subject of hundreds of articles on those websites and publications. If you think Stafford is an unremarkable person because the world of high school football recruiting is limited, I would suggest you browse ESPN's website and read the synopsis and reports they provide on Matt Stafford that bare striking resemblance to the articles they author on professional athletes. 24.131.5.142 01:37, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, I know shit about football except for the little bit from high school. Great times, and excellent times from high school. Often, the notability isn't so grand for these type of athletes. However, this may be a different case, perhaps unprecendent. I have briefly overlooked the matter and it is my understanding that most of the information in the article is truthfull. Some of it specially the last sentences may not be as verifiable, however that still doesn't solve our problem. Is a high school notable enough?

<dd>Can we consider "High school," as part of the highest level in mainly amateur sports? I would imagine the bar is pretty high, (higher than Canadian High School football), however I'm not convinced that it is the highest level of amateur sports football. Perhaps, a quick blurb on the "<a href="../../../h/i/g/High_school_football.html" title="High school football">High school football</a>" would be appropriate and may help this article for better acceptance. Perhaps, simply, merging the information onto the school's article would be even better. Again, we need to konw if the high school is notable enough to be compared to college or professional football?

<li><b>Keep</b> It seems to me that the language (<i>Sportspeople who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in an individual professional sport, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles.</i> ) concerning the inclusion of athletes in Wikipedia was written with the ultimate goal of keeping "unremarkable" athletes from being listed. The diction chosen provides a necessary leniency for athletes because it is difficult to determine a set of qualifications that would work for every country. The best rough comparisons of Matthew Stafford's remarkableness and stature would be to say that he is the best under the age of 18(henceforth U18) Amercian football player in the world. This honor would be roughly the equivalent of being the best U18 soccer player in Europe. The only difference is that due to the American football system, Stafford does not have the opportunity to play professionally at this point. This does not make him unremarkable, however, when one considers the aforementioned media attention he receives. Furthermore, whether you like the sport or not, the spread of American football through avenues such as NFL Europe and the leagues forming in Japan associated with the yearly NFL preseason game played there indicate more than just a passing appreciation of the remarkable abilities of a player of Stafford's stature. Finally, it seems somewhat settled that once he is officially enrolled at the University of Georgia that his inclusion in Wikipedia will not be at issue. The question then shifts to how his notoriety or remarkableness will change, when he enrolls in the first week of January, to make him worthy of being included in Wikipedia. The answer is that it will not. He will still be the ludicrously talented and widely known Matthew Stafford and will still receive coverage from the same national newspapers and sports media outlets as he does now. 24.131.2.1 04:08, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

Please note: That we are talking about a high school student. He is not in college yet. Though it is my feeling that high school is trully an <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Amateur sports">amateur sport</a>, this discussion continuously fail to demonstrate whether it is the "<i>highest level in mainly amateur sports</i>" (as per the requirements of wikipedia biography guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#People_still_alive" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#People still alive</a>&#160;:sportspeople). Secondly, it is suggested to include a biography if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad already have articles. Prove your case. Is this a verifiable and a notable club? For hockey in Canada we have AAA (called triple A), or "AA." or "A". In Ontario, Canada we have the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">OHL</a> or the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Hockey_League_f160.html" title="Ontario Hockey League">Ontario Hockey League</a>. I believe many people consider this "A" major junior <a href="../../../i/c/e/Ice_hockey.html" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> (though they are paid a minimal amount of money) one of the highest amateur leagues. According to the wiki article <a href="../../../a/m/a/Amateur_sports.html" title="Amateur sports">amateur sports</a>, money seems to be an issue. However, aren't college football student often rewarded by large bursaries, free education, and even a mediocre pay. If you take a look at my Ottawa team "<a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_67%27s.html" title="Ottawa 67's">Ottawa 67's</a>" you will notice a section called <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_67%27s.html#Players_of_Note" title="Ottawa 67's">Players of Note</a>.

Dear Unsigned or anyone. If you can provide the source of the information... that is that he's enrolling "on January 3rd", that would be greatly appreciated. (even then we all know how hasty some news papers can be at trying to be the first to publish information) This is important to the delete subject because it put in question his present status (even though he hasn't even done the try outs for the QB position) Actually now that I think about it, he could miserably fail at not be accepted on the team even though he's at Georgia, right? So, again we're into prospective semi-pro athlete. I'm still not convinced.

<dd>First off, an article stating he's enrolling in the Spring of 2006 is an article stating he is enrolling in January. The vast majority of American Universities work on a two semester a year system. The first semester runs August-December and is known as Fall Semester. The second semester runs January-May and is called Spring Semester. Therefore, when they say he's enrolling Spring of 2006, they are conveying to the reader that he will begin classes in January of 2006, as we've been stating all along. Also I'm not quite sure why you think someone would invent the idea that Matthew Stafford is beginning classes in a couple weeks just to have his bio posted, but nonetheless you can find that information at plenty of other places as well. For instance, you can visit the University of Georgia's website and utilize their "search for people" function to see that Matthew Stafford is already enrolled as a student. This is the most official source possible. You would not find Stafford in the UGA system unless he has already enrolled in classes. In other words, If he were not going to be taking classes until next August, he wouldn't be in the system yet. You can search for him here. <a href="http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html" class="external free" title="http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.uga.edu/inside/find.html</a></dd>

<p>Or you can visit the Atlanta Journal Constitutions website and right this second you will se a picture of Matt Stafford front and center with the caption underneath that reads "QB Matthew Stafford enrolls at Georgia in January as its star recruit." <a href="http://www.ajc.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ajc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajc.com</a> There is also a detailed in-depth story on him connected to the picture- <a href="http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html" class="external free" title="http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/uga/1205/18stafford.html</a> Or you could go to either of the websites devoted to covering UGA sports and ask one of the people who run the sites as their job when Stafford begins classes. You will not want to do this, however, because due to the extreme interest in the sport and UGA, these sites charge a monthly fee to read their articles and talk to their experts. You can find these sites at <a href="http://www.ugasports.com" class="external free" title="http://www.ugasports.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ugasports.com</a> or <a href="http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com" class="external free" title="http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.georgia.theinsiders.com</a>. At the very least you could go to the following page and look at the list of 50 something various articles, although you won't be able to read the content for free, that have talked about Stafford on that website alone. <a href="http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228" class="external free" title="http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228" rel="nofollow">http://uga.rivals.com/prospectnam.asp?Type=1&amp;Sport=1&amp;pr_key=29228</a></p>

<dd>First, sorry for forgetting to sign the last comment. Second, he has already been accepted into the Football program. In the United States, you get recruited to play football at a University. In other words, by signing with UGA, he has not only been accepted, but UGA has promised to him that they will pay for the cost of his education, any injuries he incurs during his career, his housing, his food, his school books, and a monthly stipend. This is a necessary facet of the American football system because players are not allowed to enter the NFL until they are three years removed from high school. Combine the inability to play at the highest level because of this restriction with the high percentage of quality football players that come from low income families, and you find a need to provide college football players with these perks in order to insure they can matriculate at the university. Furthermore, his name cannot be added to that official roster and bio link you entered until he starts classes, or in other words January. The NCAA, which oversees college sports in the USA, does not allow Universities to make comments on kids that have not yet taken classes. In other words, even though he has been widely published about in Nat'l media outlets for a couple years and has been officially accepted and enrolled at UGA, no one on the UGA staff can comment on him until he takes his first class. The NCAA would consider posting his roster and bio on that page to be a comment on him. Therefore, you will not see his bio officially added until after classes start back up in a couple of weeks. As for whether or not he needs to be on the All Star page, you should note that there is at least one member of the team, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Tereshinski_III</a> , who is not on that list but has a bio that has apparently never been questioned on Wikipedia. 66.191.177.80 23:34, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>&#160;:) AHHa! And the smoking gun is finally here! (or at least a fairly good point to take into consideration)&#160;:) Good job on counter argument! Now we must see if that precedence withstands the tests of WP:BIO. I say that because seemingly, that article doesn't have many categories listings, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Joe_Tereshinski_III" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/Joe_Tereshinski_III" rel="nofollow">anything linking to it</a>. This means the article, I believe, might not have had the chance to be properly revued by a substantial amount of peers. It may not be the best precendence. However, I would seemingly tend to support that article, (under the impression that this is a player of that college team) This is only because you have indicated he is on the team roster already. (that article itself sucks and needs much improvement) Anyway I tried finding something similar with my University team the <a href="../../../o/t/t/Ottawa_Gee_Gees_dcd0.html" title="Ottawa Gee Gees">Ottawa Gee Gees</a> but I couldn't find a precedence.

<p>No claim to notability in her field. Also, it is unlikely that any information will be available on her any time in the near future, given the secretive nature of pornographic performers.

<dd>OK, so she's listed on the porno version of imdb (as well as the real one). The porno IMDB has the following encyclopaedic data:

<dd>So, once we excise the unverifiable we have an article which says her name, and counts the films. Since these films are apparently churned out at the rate of one or two a day by their film crews, that essentially amounts to "she was active in the porn film industry for a couple of years".</dd>

<li>Zordrac, I understand what you are saying, but what it amounts to is that the sources available for porn "stars" are neither reliable nor authoritative. That is <i>not</i> a good reason for using their info because there is none better available! At the very least a biography should have someon's real name, we haven't even got that. There is next to no properly verifiable data (in the Wikipedian sense of verifiable from trusted secondary sources) on this person. IMDB is a reasonably trustworty secondary source, the porn databases probably aren't as they are prone to PR puff from subjects and speculation from fans. As far as I can see this article is still functionally unverifiable in the Wikipedian sense. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 09:03, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I thought that this was a good point, so researched (and discovered verifiable proof) of the real names of a number of porn stars, namely <a href="../../../t/i/f/Tiffany_Teen_8345.html" title="Tiffany Teen">Tiffany Teen</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawnee_Stone_39af.html" title="Tawnee Stone">Tawnee Stone</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jordan_Capri_6617.html" title="Jordan Capri">Jordan Capri</a> and included their real names in the articles. Apparently the porn community of Wikipedia has decided that real names CANNOT be included in articles of porn stars because of a fear of stalking them. Thus, we cannot include them. I would personally be quite happy to, but we are not allowed to. Apparently I am in some trouble for providing more verifiable information with those cases. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 06:57, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, the names are not <i>widely</i> known and do not come from <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> sources. (I've done some checking on my own. For instance <a href="../../../t/a/w/Tawnee_Stone_39af.html" title="Tawnee Stone">Tawnee Stone</a>'s real name was "revealed" on a bulletin board system. Basically, due to the nature of bullein boards, this information doesn't suit the verfiability piece.) Now if the names came from a verifiable news site, such as AVN, then they would be suitable for inclusion. Even when people are concerned about "internet stalking". Obviously, if you can list some of your sources here, then we can go through them as a group and see which ones are truly verifiable sources. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._f03b.html" title="User:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Joe Beaudoin Jr.</a> <sup style="font-variant:small-caps;"><a href="../../../j/o/e/User_talk%7EJoe_Beaudoin_Jr._eb69.html" title="User talk:Joe Beaudoin Jr.">Think out loud</a></sup> 07:28, 20 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I think the reason is selfevident from the article. Can it be speedied? It's not <i>patent</i> nonsense. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 22:58, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
I disagree with "Just zis Guy, you know?" The reason for any deletion is not self evident nor is it even discernable. I would like to know SPECIFICALLY what in the listing he found to be inaccurate or offensive and I would be happy to debate whether he is correct or not and if he is I would be happy to edit the listing appropriatly but to just "object" to the listing and not give a real reason is absurd. The account is as accurate as I can remember it to be, I have links to the Bungie website to back up that these matches did indeed take place and that the monikers of both the teams and the one team member mentioned are factual as are the dates. If in fact the person who is objecting is sexypizzaman1 and he does not want his GamerTag (which obviously is not a real name) used, then I will be more than happy to edit it out but otherwise I can see abslolutely no valid reason for this listing to be deleted. The listing refers to an actual historical event that is held quite dear to a group of people over one hundred and growing everyday,(The members of the "Married With Children" mature Xbox Live Gamers group) and is no less valid than several long standing listings that recieve no flak whatsoever.</p>
<p>I am the author of the listing and as I mentioned, if it is found to be in any way inaccurate, then I will be happy to modify it properly but people need to know the story and the legend of the Blue Team and why they are considered to be the Suckiest Sucks to have ever sucked at the fine game of Halo 2 online. I have several witnesses that will attest to the accuracy of the accout in the listing and links to sites to back the story up if neccesary.</p>

<li>That is also your personal view. It may not be properly fundamented and based on logic but it is still your oppinion.

Also, I think people looking for info on <i>abortion trauma syndrome</i> probably aren't so much interested in the debate. The objectives of the article (as I see them) are:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>define the term,</li>
<li>present the view of the mainstream medical establishment on the issue and</li>
<li>place it in the context of the larger debate about abortion.</li>

<dd>It seems consenus is to <i>move</i>. I don't have a strong objection to that.

In other words, the name of the article (like the issue) has a POV; the disorder was made-up to put fear into women that are considering an abortion. <a href="../../../n/e/p/User%7ENephron_555e.html" title="User:Nephron">Nephron</a> 15:55, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
