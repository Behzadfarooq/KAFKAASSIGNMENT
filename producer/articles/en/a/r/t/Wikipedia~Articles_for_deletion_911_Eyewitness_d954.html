<li><b>Comment</b> I want to thank those of you who have actually taken the time to edit and make it reasonable to this entity. I think that the link to the businessweek article from Sept 2001 was important to the credibility and the fact that the "zapruder" type tape did exist from that time. I guess you moved it to Ricks page. But thank you to the ones that saw, took the time, and did the job. Now it only remains to be seen how this works today, the 5th day. 911 Eyewitness 01:46, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>he top news Web sites--msnbc.com, cnn.com, nytimes.com, abcnews.com, usatoday.com--command from 3 million to 10 million visitors per month, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. Contrast that with New York-based OnlineTV Inc., one of the few independent sites that provided Webcast footage of the World Trade Center attack rather than TV news clips. OnlineTV, which usually offers entertainment fare, got only 334,000 hits that day, says CEO Rick Siegel. His company is barely making it on the $4.95 monthly fee its 31,000 registered users pay. Big media companies "will dominatethrough their ability to fund," says Siegel. "It's impossible to compete with them."</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Regardless of its implications, it's a documentary with relevant information regarding 9/11. The only reason for wanting it removed is because your political views disagree. We're already to the point major news networks won't or can't talk about it, articles and forums like these are one of the only ways of freely expressing your opinion left. Don't censor it just because you disagree with it. DgtlDreams 21:32, 24 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>To censor this page is a classic case of censoring honest debate. This is a huge issue of debate, that is growing every day, yet there is no public forum availabe in the mainstream. Should we delete and censor pages about border watch, or the war in Iraq?</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia is for information not censorshipt. A leading documentary cannot be left out and be complete.

<li><b>Keep</b> Censorship is different than POV. I cant help your lack of skills in google, or your laziness in following links. The best I can do is add the links to the awards, media coverage, etc. Since the "media" is part of the problems this movie exposes it is not impossible to get them to incriminate themselves. Instead people do it themselves. It has the awards in less than 3 months from when it was released. It has already been shown with Dr. Griffin presentations as well as shown in Salt Lake City Library, Utah for a huge public gathering and at Palatine High School for an assembly of students and parents. For a grass roots film it is moving like wildfire. April 10 Mr. Siegel goes on national radio on Coast to Coast, next week on Republic Radio. The documentary is massive. 911 Eyewitness does not need this as a webhost or platform. This entry is here because the 911 Eyewitness is real, it is here in this world, it is reality. As a piece of history that is gathering momentum, you would be wise to not be censoring it because you disagree with what it may show. The only thing such deletion will show is that Wikipedia is just *<a href="http://www.911eyewitness.com/truth/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=30" class="external text" title="http://www.911eyewitness.com/truth/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=30" rel="nofollow">Agents trying to remove 911 Eyewitness</a> because it exposes too much about the frauds.

<li>In my opinion this is a public encyclopedia - if removing this is a form of censorship, than it should not be done, I think as an encyclopedia this should be a wealth of information - it should be up to the reader to decide or look into with their own open mind as to if this eye witness text is valid or not.

<dd><b>Comment</b>-- The documentary contains the complete 38 minutes of continuous footage, uncut or censored - that is the part - and is the zapruder film of this century. There is no doubt the footage has been used by researchers since the day it appeared on Sept 11, 2001 on the Internet. It is a large slice of history in its completeness.911 Eyewitness 08:42, 24 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>--If this issue were not important then there would not be this much debate. Obviously the firestorm over the content in Wikipdeia on this subject, at the very least, is enough to include this information as a growing portaion of our population are interested. The subject of 9/11 is ambiguous to some and set in stone to others so we must make our best effort to offer both sides of the story with the hope that a general concensus can be found. This, however, does not mean one will be found and since this site can be edited by its users we must make sure that each side is given the chance to present their own compilation of information while informing the readers of the nature of the information.</p>

<p>CENSORING A REAL 9/11 EYEWITNESS AND HIS HISTORIC FOOTAGE SHOWING CONTROLLED DEMOLITION AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER is clearly against the design of Wikipedia as a historic information source. Charlie Sheen's radio interview on CNN must have forced the 9/11 coverup team to leave the reading room and get back to work putting out information awareness fires like here on Wikipedia. 911Eyewitness won the Portland Independent Media Oscar for Best 9/11 Documentary 2005 for those who have trouble typing and using search engines.</p>

This would put it on par with a lesser internet meme, which probably wouldn't be notable enough for inclusion. The snarky comments and sock/meatpuppet votes are also really annoying.

<li><b>Keep</b> (after severe cleanup). While I do see how this is a clear violation of advertising and other policies, there is some amount of information that should be included as part of Wikipedia, and if this is not enough for an article without the advertising junk then it should be merged with 9/11 conspirancies. IMHO comments such as <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a>'s above are not constructive... The issue is not whether or not this film is credible or, in your eyes, based on crackpot theories. The issue is whether or not this <i>article</i> merits inclusion on Wikipedia. If this many people care so strongly about its existance, then it probably deserves some kind of presence here. Someone mentioned <a href="../../../f/a/h/FahrenHype_9_11_c4fa.html" title="FahrenHype 9/11">FahrenHype 9/11</a> above. I think that article is appropriately formatted for Wikipedia, free of POV, and of an appropriate length considering its importance. We should do the same for this article, regardless of how its creator is behaving, because others who aren't behaving inappropriately agree that it should remain in some form. If you want to ban or censure the creator, do that, but there's no reason to take down an article that could potentially be cleaned up and provide information about a documentary that DOES exist.-- <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMac4drew_13fb.html" title="User:Mac4drew">Mac4drew</a> 04:45, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is information about the documenterary. You don't delete information about the documenterary just because you don't agree with the message or thing it's in the wrong direction, you rewrite it! You talk like it's advertising, but you don't want to put up proper information about it. To me, it sounds more like you want to cover it up than fix any problems this article has. Have you ever heard of "freedom of speech"? I think you have, it's that pesky first ammendment you want to do away with so well.</li>

<dd>Since a lot of people are screaming about First Amendment rights in regard to this AFD, I thought I'd quote the First Amendment here:</dd>
<dd><i><b>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</b></i></dd>
<dd>Nowhere in this text does it say anything about Wikipedia, or what it can decide to keep or delete. For that matter, the First Amendment doesn't force newspapers, radio programs, or TV shows to publish everything that someone has to say. A newspaper editor or a TV program producer decides what's published based on standards of newsworthiness and noteworthiness. (And advertising popularity, unfortunately.) So why would the First Amendment application to Wikipedia be any different? --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 18:48, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> It's an advertisement for a documentary that is neither popular nor outstanding. "Freedom of speech" does not apply on a website with rules and regulations about what can be on here and what can't. That's why there are style guidelines and candidates for deletion in the first place. Why aren't all you freedom of speech martyrs on the other candidates for deletion screaming "freedom of speech!"? This is not a case of freedom of speech, it's a case of "why is this necessary"? <a href="../../../x/b/-/User%7EXB-70_153b.html" title="User:XB-70">Ryan Salisbury</a> 19:27, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>CLEAN UP FOR NEUTRALITY</b> In the version of it which I viewed, it seemed like propaganda. I have seen many articles discussing movies, television shows, online games, and so on. The article should stay, but be cleaned up to be a neutral description of the movie in question. There should be a separate section of the article to discuss the controversial nature of the film. (also to help limit the possibility of vandalism to one section) <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarysa_5e0c.html" title="User:Sarysa">Sarysa</a> 11:38, 26 March 2006 (GMT-8)</dd>

<p>Quote from Wikipedia's page on Fasiscm: "Fascism is also typified by totalitarian attempts to impose state control over all aspects of life: political, social, cultural, and economic. The fascist state regulates and controls (as opposed to nationalizing) the means of production. Fascism exalts the nation, state, or race as superior to the individuals, institutions, or groups composing it. Fascism uses explicit populist rhetoric; calls for a heroic mass effort to restore past greatness; and demands loyalty to a single leader, often to the point of a cult of personality."</p>
<p>Quote from Wikipedia's page on Propaganda: "Propaganda is a specific type of message presentation directly aimed at influencing the opinions of people, rather than impartially providing information. In some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. Its connotations can also vary over time. For instance, in English, "propaganda" was originally a neutral term used to describe the dissemination of information in favor of a certain cause. Over time, however, the term acquired the negative connotation of disseminating false or misleading information in favor of a certain cause. Strictly speaking, a message does not have to be untrue to qualify as propaganda, but it may omit so many pertinent truths that it becomes highly misleading."</p>
<p>I feel that this "personal" account is neither fasiscm or propaganda.</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Why don't we just get all the encyclopedia's we own, and burn them...it would be the same thing if we deleted this post...regardless of its nature.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Burning encyclopedias, which are full of useful, factual information researched extensively by a team of professionals, is NOT akin to removing an advertisement from a site dedicated to knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia is an international site; the constitution of any single country does not apply here. There are numerous references to other similar tapes within this thread, and there's enough on the internet, and on Wikipedia itself, that getting rid of the detritus wouldn't be a bad thing. A tape with this much obvious bias cannot be called a documentary, as a documentary is an impartial account of events.</p>
<p>To put it simply, get rid of BS advertisements so that more credible versions of the same thing can continue to exist. --Makavely91 23:29, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Shouldn't matter what the film is about or what side of any issue it is on. If the reason for delete is that you don't agree with a film, don't delete as that would be unfairly influencing wikipedia with your POV. On the other hand, this is a nn documentary with no verifiable sources and so really shouldn't exist.. Propoganda, freedom of speech, advertisement, book-burning, facism, etc all have NOTHING to do with this at all. It simply isn't verifiable enough or notable enough for a wikipedia entry. There are 911 conspiracy films on Wikipedia. There is nothing wrong with including 911 conspiracy films. But they have to be at least somewhat notable. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowoftime_3763.html" title="User:Shadowoftime">Shadowoftime</a> 04:07, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
