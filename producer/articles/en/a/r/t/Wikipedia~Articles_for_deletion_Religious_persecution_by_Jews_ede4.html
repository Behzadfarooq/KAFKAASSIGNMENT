<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). As for vote count, my tally (which may be slightly inaccurate) places this at 34 keep (after Dv and Incognito have been discounted as possible sockpuppets, and LokiCT has also been discounted), 66 delete votes, 2 merge votes and one redirect vote. In other words a very close call, with a lot of comments. There are a lot of shouting matches with a load of people emphatically holding their positions. The main concern has the neutrality and verifiability of the article. I am in doubt here. Therefore I cannot delete. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:03, 28 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>A confused work of pure <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> created for <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. 95% of it deals with actions of the ancient Israelite tribes over 3500 years ago; describing them as Jews is dubious at best, and the "historical source document" for the actions listed (the Old Testament) is considered even more dubious by most modern historians. As well, it throws in one sentence asserting that the Arab-Israeli conflict may (or may not be) an example of "religious persecution by Jews", ignoring the more obvious ethnic underpinnings of the conflict. No credible sources have been brought which assert that any of this is actually "religious persecution by Jews"; it seems to be another back-door attempt to revive the "Jewish ethnocentrism" topic using a novel approach; articles on that topic have already been deleted via two VfDs: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jewish_ethnocentrism/previous" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jewish_ethnocentrism/previous" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jewish_supremacism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jewish_supremacism" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> Perhaps there is an article that could be written about this topic, though it's not clear exactly what it would be referring to, but this article certainly isn't it. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:09, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article, like the articles on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Christians_79e1.html" title="Religious persecution by Christians">Religious persecution by Christians</a> covers a very <b>real</b> and very <b>notable</b> topic. These articles are intended to be the first three of a series of articles covering outgroup religious persecutions committed by members of the world's religious/spiritual groups. So far all the contributors to these pieces have shown themselves willing to withdraw or source material that others request be sourced. I agree, of course, that these articles are likely to attract POV warriors. But this is not grounds for preemptively destroying the articles. If you have particular complaints, please make them on the Talk pages so that they can be addressed. Don't just impulsively go a VfD. Also, I suggest that this might as well be a VfD on all three of them, and on the other planned additions to this series, since each of the articles in the series covers equivalent topics. I think it would be a shame if this new series were deleted out of wikicowardice and unwillingness to protect Wikipedia from the POV mosquitoes who will be attracted to these articles. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>You comments do not deal with any of the issues I raised. Please focus on them. Oh, and providing a source does not help at all with the Original Research problem, unless the source itself also asserts that the information provided is an example of Religious persecution by Jews. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 18:20, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm absolutely flummoxed by your claim that this is original research. Please help. I guess I'm slow. I quite literally do not understand what you mean when you say that it is original research to state that the Bible claims that Jews, qua Jews, committed acts of violence against non-Jews. Take a look at my Wikipedia edit history and see whether you think I am acting out of the anti-Jewish agenda you suspect has motivated this article. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 18:33, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please review the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> article; the "Religious persecution by Jews" article asserts that there is such a phenomenon as "Religious persecution by Jews", and that actions by the ancient Israelite tribes constitute examples of the same. This is a novel thesis which needs to be supported by citeable sources. Considering that the Bible is not considered a particularly reliable historical source, and that the Bible nowhere says the incidents mentioned were done by Jews (but rather by Israelites), the whole article is questionable. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:26, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh incidentally, the Bible repeatedly describes these events as being committed by "Yehudim" (Yud-heh-dalet-mem), then and now the Hebrew word for "Jews". I think what you are trying to say is that the Torah (pentateuch) describes only Israelites, but the transition to "Jews" is made at some point in the Nevi'im. Not that any of this will influence any votes on the VfD, which is fueled by more, uh, primal concerns. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:14, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would posit that drawing a connection between ancient Israelites and modern day Jews is not a "novel thesis". Certainly members of every synagogue on the planet would be startled to learn that this is a novel thesis, as would anyone who has glanced at any primary or secondary source covering 2300 years of post-Tanakh Jewish theology or Jewish history. "Moses was a Jew" is not an outlandish assertion, though it certainly can stand for scholarly qualifications. Anyway, why did you not raise these concerns on the Talk Page? Why did you go straight to VfD? And yes, you did speculate on the motivations of the contributors, by speculating that the article was an attempt to revive some already deleted article that none of us had actually heard of. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 19:35, 19 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If it's not a "novel thesis", then please present a scholarly source which asserts that the alleged actions of the ancient Israelites are examples of "Religious persecution by Jews". I went straight to VfD because this article was an obvious candidate for deletion. And I did not speculate about motives, but rather about actions. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:50, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I was unaware of those two previous VFD that <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> highlighted, but they are irrelevent anyway. This is one part of a proposed series on Religous Persecution, a series I did not start. As for them being Jewish, a quick look at the <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jew.html" title="Jew">Jew</a> article tells me "The word <i><b>Jew</b></i> (<a href="../../../h/e/b/Hebrew_language.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>: <b>יהודי</b>) is used in a wide number of ways, but generally refers to a follower of the Jewish faith...." This is the first time I've heard a Jewish person tell me that Moses was not a "Follower of the jewish faith", I woul have thought he wrote the book on the Jewish faith. In all honesty this VFD seems to me to be more about making a point than a genuine reason to delete the article, frankly I would have liked <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjgs</a> help with this piece.

<li><b>D</b>elete. No merits. The record in the Bible, even if correct, cannot be termed "religious persecution" - it certainly was not by the standard of those times. The Biblical record is not a "hard source" for most readers, and should not be used as such. As for modern-day Israel, the so-called "religious persecution" is not the result of the perpetrators being Jews but Israelis. <a href="../../../j/f/d/User%7EJfdwolff_9ea6.html" title="User:Jfdwolff">JFW</a>&#160;|&#160;<a href="../../../j/f/d/User_talk%7EJfdwolff_aee2.html" title="User talk:Jfdwolff"><small>T@lk</small></a> 19:43, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> - for several reasons. 1) The evidence presented is very weak and makes the assumption that biblical literature can be used as historical sources, an assumption that would be met with harsh opposition if it were made anywhere else, e.g., the status of the West Bank and Gaza; 2) the title begs the question, namely that Jews (in some timeless sense) are guilty of religious persecution; 3) it makes a strained point that the Arab-Israeli conflict somehow is grounded in Jewish religious persecution. I certainly agree that point #2 also applies to articles about "Christian" and "Moslem" persecution as well, but this article - as often is the case in this area - appears to have a hidden agenda. If someone wants to make the point that societies in biblical times were religiously intolerant, that should make a separate article. --<a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeifern_3f3b.html" title="User:Leifern">Leifern</a> 19:44, July 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wish people would stop with the panicky speculations about "hidden agendas". I don't want to reveal too much about my real world identity here, but suffice it to say that anyone who knows me would find comical (or just nonsensical) the idea that I had been tagged as having a sinister, anti-semitic agenda. Well, what can one do. The article, and the whole series, could have been very good. I contributed more to the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> than to this one, but still I think they all had potential. But I don't want to waste my Wikipedia time contributing to articles that paranoid folks will preemptively VfD and dog with their unfounded anxieties.

<li><s>Keep but cleanup, otherwise delete</s> - The topic is valid, but the article as written is a poorly researched anti-semetic rant. Specific book-chapter-verse must be cited for biblical qoutes. Appropriate sources must also be cited for documenting the Arab exodus at the inception of Israel and why it is listed. Other incidents such as those noted in "A History of the Jews" are missing. Also, the use of terms like "ethnic cleansing" must be avoided. The facts can speak for themselves. We Jews have not been angels, but we have not been Nazis either. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:48, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>EMS, in most other topics that were in this condition I'd probably agree with you that "keep and clean up" would be a good vote. Unfortunately, from my recent experiences and looking back at the history of articles like <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> I'm pretty sure that this article cannot be redeemed. The moment anyone tries to do so, expect the POV warriors from those articles (and I'll note that one of the worst offenders, IrishPunkTom, frequents both) to come running for a chance to bash Jews.<a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExistentializer_7778.html" title="User:Existentializer">Existentializer</a> 20:53, 19 July 2005 (UTC)

You will of course note that I have edited the noted <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a> article less than once. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 11:13, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, I agree that putting terms like "ethnic cleansing" in these articles does nothing but fan POV flames, and should be avoided. I agree with you that cleanup and improved citations are needed. On the other hand, I disagree that, as it exists, it is either anti-semitic or a rant. The biblical quotes are cited "book-chapter-verse". I agree that the discussion of the dislocation of Palestinians must include other arguments and explanations for this dislocation, just as I have tried to solicit Muslim explanations for Muhammad's massacre of the Banu Qurayza at the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> article.

<dd>I do not believe that this was the intent, but it sure is the effect. For example, you use <i>Ethnic cleansing</i> as a header instead of <i>Palestinian exodus</i> and <i>Biblical incidents</i>. Compare this article with what you did for <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a>, which is much more broad and where the headers have no inflamatory POV.</dd>
<dd>However, I repeat that your worst offense is that you do not know the material. Since we Jews have for most part had little opportunity to perseucte over the last 2500 years it is a somewhat sparse record, but it does exist and you have barely scratched its surface. For example, there was a forced conversion episode during the Maccabean period that is famous amongst Jewish scolars, but which you are apparently quite ignorant of. You need to settle down, do your research, and produce a product that is at least as concise and comprehensive as <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> is.</dd>
<dd>If this gets deleted, I encourage you to try again later, once you can produce a product on a par with <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a>.

<dd><a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a>, thanks for that comment, it was appreciated. I had only barely began the piece and my intention was to start at the prophets work my way through history and end up at Present-Day israel. The Palestinian Exodus was edited in, I had said that Critics of israel claim that the foundation of the state ofd Israel was an attempt at Ethnic Cleansing, And that is a point I've eard made many times over, I then noted that rougly One-Fifth of the current population is Arab, which substantially disproves that, I would have thought. I appealed for help from <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a><sub>See his talk page</sub>, but he just VFD'ed it. I do, or rather did, need help with this, I don't claim to be an expert of the history of the jewish people throughout the lands, and if this article stays (Which looks unlikely) then I will still appeal for help. The more specificly Jewish editors involved hen the better, surely, this will be. If it gets removed I'll be requesting <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Christians_79e1.html" title="Religious persecution by Christians">Religious persecution by Christians</a> get taken off too. --Irishpunktom\<sup><a href="../../../i/r/i/User_talk%7EIrishpunktom_3aca.html" title="User talk:Irishpunktom">talk</a></sup> 11:32, July 20, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I strongly counsel you to keep what you can. This is a valid topic. <b>However</b> it is also a sensitive topic. To do this properly, the article has to be thorough, well documented, well written, and with a genuinely neutral POV. It has to be a calm, collected, organized recitation of the relevant facts and incidents. As a found it yesterday, it was a hearsay filled diatribe screaming that Jews engage in "ethnic cleansing". Even with my edits, it still fails to do this topic justice in any way, shape or form. I repeat to you what I have said to Babajobu: Do the research and do the work needed to do this properly. In your case I also add in a strong warning: The offensive headings seem to be your doing.

<dd>It sounds like it would be very nice if you made good that promise.<br />
I thank you for liking my edits, but you do not seem to be very interested in defending them. Because of that lack my vote is now "strong delete".<br />
I hope that someone will revive this article in the future, but it must be someone who can and will do a good job with it. There are a lot of votes to keep this article because it can be used for Jew-bashing and a lot of votes against it for the same reason. In the middle is a core vote that dislikes it because it is just plain a poor article. A good article will have the approval of that core and will therefore survive a Vfd effot. It's too bad that you could help to create such an article, or even be bothered to defend an improvement (however inadequate) of this one. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 01:55, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>EMS, I agree with everything you say about this being a sensitive subject and requiring copious documentation and meticulous wording. I disagree that I'm ignorant of this material: see my talkpage discussion with Eliezer on the debate within the Gemarrah on dealing with female POWs. And my knowledge of Jewish history is pretty solid. Anyway, I appreciate your efforts to get the article going, and apologize for not, as it turns out, having the time to work on these articles, as I'd hoped to.

<li>That'll be enough of that, IrishPunkTom. Going around making needless accusations of sockpuppetry is ridiculous. I have not seen any evidence of any sockpuppets around here, save perhaps for the theory that YOU might be the anonymous IP vandal who plagued the <a href="../../../j/i/h/Jihad.html" title="Jihad">Jihad</a>] article yesterday. As far as evidence, I'd say that your creation of the piece is strong enough evidence at the start that the article wasn't intended to be here for any other reason than Jew-bashing, because you've got a long history of doing just that. The continual attempts by editors (both yourself and others) to insert Jew-bashing comments into the article is all the confirmation I need, and I'm not the only one who thinks that way about this article as evidenced by the numerous deletion comments stating exactly that. <a href="../../../e/x/i/User%7EExistentializer_7778.html" title="User:Existentializer">Existentializer</a> 14:45, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> <i>This won't get a fair trial.</i> Any time that there is an article like this which discusses factual examples of Jewish negativity, it goes for VFD because people blanket label it some Nazi POV and if not that, an Islamic POV that nobody will take seriously. Now for me, I have had many offhanded bad experiences with Jews and their attitudes but this could be because they lived in the city or because of their culture and I'm about to say it's a bit of both. There are no people on this planet with a blank check for how much damage they can do without return criticism. Those who believe the Jewish people are unable to be guilty for any significant charges, are just as wrong as any Nazi who tries to paint the White race as unfailing in kindness and decency. For instance, Jews in the media(yes, I checked names) believe it is all right to paint White culture and history in a negative light and you will only ever see Jewish culture expressed negatively by Jews. Then again, the Jews don't mind if Whites hate on themselves and speak against their people, even for the sake of propping other races up on their shoulders instead. Fox news is probably the only station that I see which steps away from the chronic anti-Gentile bias which plagues most of the other media conglomerates, but you'll probably meet a Nazi who disagrees with me on that. There is no justification for institutional prejudice by Jews and Judeophiles, any more than there is for Whites and Blacks. Of course, most here would be loathe to act bold and decisively where there is a case of potential ego dropping for the people who shove the Holocaust on Whites. For me, I find a problem with the outspoken Jews who rail on about that Holocaust as if it was all about them and not other people, with their complete sense of innocence in comparison to carving a plot of land out where the Palestinians live because the British said they could. Jews rewrite White history with Jamestown and the Wild West, while Whites cannot criticise the Mid-East conflict. It's almost like using the word Nigger/Nigga, or that only Whites owned slaves.

<li><b>Delete</b> The name of the article is not encyclopedic. Something like: “Religious persecution in Israel” could get an entry, but for sure not this. It is simply a generalization of an ethnic group, and the support of a POV, the POV being that, an ethnic group is more than a social construct, all this, in the articles name alone. I think there should be appropriate rules here in Wikipedia, on what is an encyclopedic entry, this will spare us all the trouble of having to vote the deletion of articles that should not exist in the first place. This sort of article will only get answered by similar articles(I just hope they don't already exist), which the subject, and probably the aim, will be generalization. There is a distinction between directly criticizing a group of people, and criticizing an aspect... If I write an article like: “Religious persecution under king David's reign” or something such, I could write an encyclopedic article. I could of course, as well, write something like: “Religious persecution under Judaism.” While this seems to be about the same thing as the article voted for deletion, it is not. In the same token, I could write an article, like; “Religious persecution under Islam.” This will be an encyclopedic name, but not: “Religious persecutions by Muslims,” or even more direct: “Religious persecution by Arabs” (I'm making the comparison, because being a “Jew,” is not only being part of a religion, but as includes the ethnic group.) But I could write: “Religious persecutions under Arabic regimes.” It is permitted to write about an aspect, or a system, etc. but not to generalize directly. Guilt by association is simply not encyclopedic. One way of knowing if a name for an article like this is encyclopedic, is to wonder if when using the name to criticize, it would be considered as a generalization. Having said all this, I think that the problem is not only with the name, but what the name could permit to write in the article, in this cases. We can not write with such a subject(the name of the article/subject), a real NPOV article, so it will be unwiki, and it's existence will inevitably lead to failure. <font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 20:16, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would like more information on how "Religous persecution under Judaism" and "Religous persecution by Jews" differ, and why the former is better. Also, I for one do not see why this requires a delete instead a move of the existing article. (I support deleting the article, but that is because it is a lousy article on the subject.) I also cannot support your view of their being a lot of smaller articles. In that case, the larger scale article is still needed to pull it all together.<br />
I also disagree that such an article is inherently POV, but to be NPOV it has to be dry recitation of the facts, something which most of the current editors seem to be struggling with (when they are trying for it at all). --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 20:37, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>“Religious persecution under Judaism” report persecutions under a system, while the second directly point a finger on a group of people. If I say that Jews are idiots, it is a generalization, I directly point a finger on a group of people. On the other hand, if I say, Judaism is idiotic, I criticize a system. Jews may be offended, but I criticize one aspect of their being, rather than criticizing them as a whole, because I am criticizing an aspect of their being, rather then directly and entirely criticizing them. And also, by this statement, I am not saying in anyway that Jews are idiots. From the same logic, when I say religion is stupid, I am not necessarily saying that those that practice a religion are stupid. An encyclopedic article, to maintain an objective tone, should as much as possible, not point a finger. It should be “encyclopedicaly” correct(in allusion to politically correct).</dd>

The articles aim is to directly point a finger on a group of people, and not report, in a cold encyclopedic fashion the persecutions by a regime, a system etc. If you neutralize such article, you somehow disconnect it from its name. <font color="blue"><i>Fadix</i></font> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix"><sup><font color="green">(My Talk)</font></sup></a> 21:08, 20 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I accept your argument on the semantics of the article name. However, I retain my position on NPOV. I admit that a finger is being pointed when writing on a subject such as this, but if the facts are there and properly documented, then that finger deserves to pointed. In other words, the article can be neutral without being neutralized, and need not be comfortable for the subject group while still being NPOV.<br />
It is unfortunate that those who most wish to write on this subject are the least capable of producing an article with NPOV. As a practical matter, that is more of an issue than whether an NPOV treatment of this issue can be done.</dd>

<li>Yikes! <b>Delete</b> as soon as possible. It is clearly original research and shows no knowledge of a huge amount of historical research, about both Jewish history and about the composition of the Bible. Its use of the word "religion" itself is anachronistic. Israeli policy on the occupied territories is something worth analyzing, in all of its complexities (which does not mean "defending" it). But that policy is not religiously motivated or about religion (the Israeli State that occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967 was secular, and Fatah, the major militant wing of the PLO, was/is secular). And then to conflat it with stuff reported in a document writtehn 2500 years ago about stuff that <i>may</i> have happened 3000+ years ago — well it is just baffling. <a href="../../../s/l/r/User%7ESlrubenstein_021c.html" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a> | <a href="../../../s/l/r/User_talk%7ESlrubenstein_2990.html" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:47, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> It took me a while to decide on this (and to be sure that my response was not POV), but the entire section seems to be unnecessary nonsense. Most groups of some identifiable type, religious, racial, sexual, etc, have committed some form of organised persecution or crime. It is simply difficult to justify the need or purpose of an entire section in this vein except to feed arguments to those against particular groups, often ascribing to modern groups (note the site does not consider extinct religious sects) the actions of their predecessors. And on that note, I agree with jayg that it would be problematic to academically ascribe the acts of ancient Israel (even <i>Yehudim</i>) as those of Jews, and to further consider them factual, even if many Jews would happily claim both of these statements as true (on that basis the article would be POV!). And then there may also be similar problems in ascribing the acts of the State of Israel as those of Jews, even if the Christian acts article included those done by Christian countries in the name of their Lord and Saviour. Again, this idea that it is an act of persecution of the group as a whole would be difficult to defend. --<a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 12:14, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Original research is where the person is presenting and/or justifying a novel thesis. There is nothing novel about this. I therefore reject the label of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Also, the article now names scolarly sources for the Modern State of Isreal section even if there is not an explicit References section yet. My complaint is that this article is still inadequately researched, missing important incidents that can easily be gleaned from authoratative sources while retaining lesser content that is only weakly justified. That is also grounds for deletion, but is not the same thing as it leaves open to door to new, improved article at a later time. --<a href="../../../e/m/s/User%7EEms57fcva_dbe3.html" title="User:Ems57fcva">EMS</a> | <a href="../../../e/m/s/User_talk%7EEms57fcva_f7d0.html" title="User talk:Ems57fcva">Talk</a> 19:34, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>This article is getting more ludicrous as it is expanded. Babajobu has essentially made a list of any situation he could think of in which Jews held any kind of power or autonomy. Anyone familiar with the Khazar kingdom's history will know that not only did the various religious groups in the Khaganate enjoy complete religious freedom, but that its <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazars.html#Judiciary" title="Khazars">supreme court</a> included Christians, Jews, Muslims and pagans. The one incident that even comes close to persecution is the execution of a muzzein (reported only in Muslim sources) and the destruction of a minnaret in retaliation for persecution of Jews in Persia. Likewise, he has listed <a href="../../../b/i/r/Birobidzhan.html" title="Birobidzhan">Birobidzhan</a> despite his inability to recall its name. That province, of course, was settled by a few totally secular Jews who never held any real political power or composed more than a small fraction of the oblast's population. It's more clear to me now that this article was from its inception intended purely as a platform for Jew-bashing. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 19:42, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Briangotts, yes, I suggested a section on the Russian oblast, and yet, for shame, could not remember its name. I was hoping that people who had more knowledge of it might contribute to that section. I forgot that such people were more likely to sit around on the VfD page trying to snowjob the whole topic rather than contribute their knowledge. Viva la Wikipedia! Brian, do me a favor on run over to the VfD on Religious persecution by Muslims (to which I contributed more than I did to the Jewish article), and show the same disgust and dismay that such a topic should be tackled.

<li>Don't hold it too long, as I wouldn't want to be the cause of any asphyxiation. The difference between that article and this is that one, however flawed it might be, documents numerous examples of a centuries old, ongoing phenomenon for which one could come up with thousands of examples. The proponents of this article have yet to produce a genuine example of religious persecution that did not take place in a single, 3500 year old source, and certain proponents (not naming names) then proceeded to list every single instance they could come up with (not many of those exist) in which Jews had any kind of power over others. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBriangotts_6470.html" title="User:Briangotts">Briangotts</a> <a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBriangotts_9359.html" title="User talk:Briangotts">(talk)</a> 21:03, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I listed the few instances in which Jews held power in between the displacement from Judea and the Yishuv. Why, perchance would I have made such a list, other than the virulent antisemitism that you assume motivated this article (and presumably somehow also the persecution by Christians and Muslims articles)? Is it conceivable that I made that list because this series of articles was intended to describe how <i>dominant religious groups misuse their power</i>? And as such, that it made sense to explore those rare situations when Jews, though in exile, wielded some power? No, no, it must just have been my virulent antisemitism acting up again, like a troublesome canker sore.

<li>Yes, yes. Especially the one on "Religious persecution by atheists" (French Revolution, communist countries), which was already being discussed before this whole VfD fiasco derailed it. That would have been the most shamelessly anti-religious of all. You know what, I think the people who wrote these articles just hate people. Yep.

<li>All these groups (atheists included) are too large and diverse to be lumped into some monolithic label as perpetrators of persecution. It would be more appropriate to address various persecutions that have occured in history in the relevant articles that discuss their more specific contexts.

<li>The groups are not too monolithic to be covered as such in numerous other articles, so I don't see why this one should be different. And you cannot honestly tell me that there is a more balanced description of the displacement of Palestinians <i>anywhere</i> on Wikipedia than is in this article. My guess is that the Hebrew wikipedia covers it with less sympathy to the traditional Israeli perspective. More thorough, perhaps, but not more balanced. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 01:40, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, I think it's a common (xenophobic) human problem to project monolithic (particularly negative) behaviors, beliefs, intentions, attributes onto *other* people who are different than *us*. Reality is that people are individuals, influenced by all sorts of complicated unique variables that shape each person's outlook. As far as balance RE Palestinians... if we get more editors like Ramallite highly qualified to represent the Palestinian perspective [ multi-faceted of course&#160;:-) ], I'm sure there will be vast improvement. --<a href="../../../m/p/e/User%7EMPerel_ce51.html" title="User:MPerel"><font color="#330000">M</font><font color="#334400">P</font><font color="#338800">er</font><font color="#33CC00">el</font></a> <sup><small>( <a href="../../../m/p/e/User_talk%7EMPerel_2b5d.html" title="User talk:MPerel"><font color="#11BB00">talk</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MPerel_0ace.html" title="Special:Contributions/MPerel"><font color="#3399FF">contrib</font></a>)</small></sup> 02:28, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> all three, the template, and everything else related to this project. It's just a bad idea, destined to piss off everyone at the same time. In wiki articles describing specific, documented historical events, I would support having a "religion X persecuted group Y" kind of analysis. But trying to create a general "people persecuted by religion X" topic is the wrong way of doing it, and extending it to all religions and atheism, while it may seem neutral in theory, will only serve to attract the ire of everyone at once. This topic will turn into an endless edit-war and flame-war, with each side claiming to be absolutely right and the only one backed by historical evidence; a little like what happened with the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> page. Furthermore, like Michael Snow pointed out, making a "persecution by religion X" topic implies that religion X is a harmonious monolithic group with a single clear agenda; there is no religion on Earth for which that is true. Trying to group all actions of all sects and sub-groups of religion X over millenia under a single "things done by religion X" topic is a gross oversimplification of a very complex situation. <a href="../../../r/i/t/User%7ERitchy_3c4d.html" title="User:Ritchy">Ritchy</a> 22 July 2005</li>

The real issue here is the precision of the term - "Religious persecution by ____" does that mean persecution by members of that religion against anyone?

Would the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedwabne_massacre.html" title="Jedwabne massacre">Jedwabne massacre</a> be religious persecution by Christians against Jews, or a case of anti-semitism?

<li>Polonius, I agree that the title is ambiguous and has caused problems. In my contributions to the articles in this series I've understood "religious persecution by..." to mean persecution of a minority religious group by a majority religious group, irrespective of whether the motivation for the persecution may have included economic, political, cultural, nationalist or other considerations. Thus the <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedwabne_massacre.html" title="Jedwabne massacre">Jedwabne massacre</a> would definitely apply. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 13:14, 23 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Babajobu, but that is the problem - it basically means that anytime anybody persecutes anyone else of a different religion, in any way, that it is religious persecution. This would mean that almost every war since <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martin_Luther_b8dd.html" title="Martin Luther">Martin Luther</a> in Europe would be religious persecution of some group or another, and every incident by an Israeli against an Arab in Israel would be religious persecution, as would any incident against the Jews from 140 CE to 1948 CE, anywhere in the world. I don't buy it, and it seems like a mess. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoodoldpolonius2_11e8.html" title="User:Goodoldpolonius2">Goodoldpolonius2</a> 05:16, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

Get real, who has persecuted who around here in history? It's pretty sad when all the article can do is cite the Hebrew Bible...how about the other parts of that Hebrew Bible that affirm the Jews as God's chosen people? You can't have it both ways, either all of the Hebrew Bible is accurate or none of it. This is not about "race" (what a weird thought!) this is about pure facts and logic. Wikipedia is not in the business of setting up the "relativity of religions" and such like. The fact remains, Christians and Moslems have killed millions of Jews over the last 1500-2000 years, and not the reverse...and now, to "hide behind the mommy's skirt" of the Jews' own Hebrew Bible is a mental distortion worthy of the Nazi hate machine.

There are so many articles about that already! Are you claiming that the Israelis (as Jews?) are RELIGIOUSLY "persecuting" the poor Palestinians??? Now you know that that is a load of crap! Israel is the most religiously tolerant country in the Middle East! (Errrr: How free are Jews in Iran or Libya or Saudi Arabi to practice Judaism?) No-one in Israel is stopping anyone from practicing any religion (plenty of mosques and such like to prove it), but Israelis do have a right to capture or kill TERRORISTS who want to kill Israeli citizens. (Ever heard of <a href="../../../s/e/l/Self_defense.html" title="Self defense">Self defense</a>?) <i>That</i> issue has no relevance to "Religious persecution by Jews". What is Shem saying? That we must also excuse Christian and Moslem violence against Jews over the last 1500-2000 years if this article is to be deleted?

As for the points you made: no, this article is not exclusively about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but some of the events which occured in that conflict will naturally be relevant. I don't necessarily deny that Israel is the most religiously tolerant country in the region (see earlier comments on this issue). I think Shem was making the commonsense point that even groups which are ordinarily on the receiving end of persecution can themselves occasionally act as persecutors, and if we are to reject the very idea of an article on religious persecution by Jews, then we really have to reject such "persecution by" articles generally.

<dd>Isn't that kind of backwards? "We cannot reject <i>a priori</i> the concept of religious persecution by Jews, therefore we should start the article and see if we can find some". I'm not impugning your motives or anything, just questioning the plan. It still reads to me like an article on ethnic cleansing and nation building; the modern Israel part is entirely such, I think unavoidably because the conflict is national-based, not religious, at least from the Jewish side. Israel was originally intended to be secular, Islam is still freely practiced along with pretty much every religion known to man. The Biblical part might be put into a religious persecution context in that it's in the "God told us to kill them" vein, but religion was pretty much indistinguishable from nationality at the time and my feeling is that in such a case, religion is subservient to nationality, much as is diet, clothing, language, etc. You wouldn't characterize Biblical conflict as persecution by people who don't eat milk with meat, for instance, but it's the same population whether you're defining them by nationality, religion, or diet. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:00, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Gzuckier, I don't think there is any way you can entirely disentangle religious persecution from nationalist, economic, ethnic, cultural, et cetera. The Republic of Ireland has been virtually emptied of Protestants since the state's founding. Was that due to religious persecution, or nationalistic persecution because of their association with Britain? Muhammad massacred the males of the Jewish tribe of <a href="../../../b/a/n/Banu_Qurayza_16f3.html" title="Banu Qurayza">Banu Qurayza</a>...was that religious persecution, or just an act of particular barbarity during an intercommunal struggle over power, resources, et cetera? Trying to come up with a single monocausal explanation for these examples and others is a fool's errand: there were lots of contributing factors, the motivation was complex. So for the purposes of these articles I've considered "religious persecution" to be persecution of a minority religious group by a majority religious group, rather than restricting it to cases in which motivation could be proven to be exclusively religious. No real-life cases exist of such perfect and idealized "persecutions for exclusively religious reasons". And yet persecution of religious minorities is a real and important phenomenon. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 15:10, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>But writing an article on "religious persecution by Jews of Palestinian Arabic Muslims and Palestinian Arabic Christians but not of Lebanese Christians or European Christians or Bedouin Muslims or Muslimish Druze" is a bit like writing an article on "the color which is exhibited by objects which are blue before Jan. 1 1005 but after that date is exhibited by objects which are green". <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 18:16, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>"The color which is exhibited by objects which are blue before Jan. 1 1005 but after that date is exhibited by objects which are green", surely that article, too, is worthy of a stub. Remember, I'm an inclusionist (See the tramautic-for-all-involved events that unfolded below in response to Ambi's post). Regardless, I think that if the article on <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Jews_5375.html" title="Religious persecution by Jews">Religious persecution by Jews</a> survives the VfD, it should certainly be expanded to include any instances of persecution of the other groups you mention. I don't think that's quite so jarring or arbitrary as the switch from one color to another that your new stub adopts at the change of millenium. I think they all fit neatly under "Religious persecution by Jews", just as persecuted Sudanese animists in the 20th century and persecuted Yathribi Jews in the 8th century both fit under <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religious_persecution_by_Muslims_5cc6.html" title="Religious persecution by Muslims">Religious persecution by Muslims</a> <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 21:18, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete.</b> I think this question is really about the validity of the series as a whole. There's no doubt that there've been persecutions by Christians and by Muslims. The question is whether there has been sufficient persecution conducted by Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, etc. etc. to justfy articles on <i>each one</i> of these faiths. IMO, the article on Jews provides no good evidence that there has been a history of <i>religious</i> persecution by Jews – <i>persecution</i>, maybe, but not religious persecution. Like Babajobu, I am an Inclusionist, but I don't think this article makes the case that its title implies. Change it to Historical persecutions by Jews, but don't pretend that it is part of a "neutral" series on religious persecution that inclues all faiths. That's hypocricy designed to conceal the fact that some faiths have a history of persecution and that others don't. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 22:20, 26 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that Historical persecutions by Jews would have been a better title for this article. Not perfect, but definitely better. I don't know what the perfect title would have been. <a href="../../../b/a/b/User%7EBabajobu_ed0d.html" title="User:Babajobu">Babajobu</a> 22:40, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The Historical Persecutions title isn't perfect, true. Part of the problem is the "by Jews" bit. Individual Jews may have been responsible for persecutions, just as individual Christians, Atheists or whatever may have been, but it would be absurd to list all persecutions by by individual Jews or groups of Jews. But "Judaism" is no better, since the belief system itself does not do the persecuting. Part of the problem lies in the fact that Jewishness as a belief and as an ethnic identity can't be clearly distinguished. There isn't really the same difficulty with most other faiths. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_Barlow_1e36.html" title="User:Paul Barlow">Paul B</a> 08:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not sujre about that; I think the "universal" faiths are more of an exception than a rule. Christianity and Islam, of course, and Buddhism I guess. But even then individual subgroups are tied to different nations. Coptic Christianity, Druze version of Islam, etc. and in the ancient world, I think distinct religions for each nation was pretty much the rule. Judaism has a funny spot, as it posits a universal God who everyone should believe in, but doesn't require adherence to the faith itself for anyone other than Jews. This of course is interpreted as some sort of superiority complex by.... here it comes..... get ready..... antisemites. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 14:16, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
