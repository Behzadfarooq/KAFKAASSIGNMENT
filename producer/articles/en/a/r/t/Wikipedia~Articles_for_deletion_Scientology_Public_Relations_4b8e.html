<dd>The article on Xenu has nothing to do with <b>this article</b>. And yes, saying that an article should be deleted because of the original author's account name is a personal attack on that author.

<dd>"See <strong class="selflink">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Scientology Public Relations</strong> for the discussion.

<dd>In my opinion, you <i>have</i> made a personal attack. You have attacked both the article and falsely referred to its author as a "vandal" on the sole basis of the editor's username. It appears I am not alone in my opinion, as <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheFarix_32b9.html" title="User:TheFarix">TheFarix</a> had the same complaint about it. Thanks, but I am well aware of where <i>The Life and Times of Xenu The Space Alien</i> fits in the secret texts of the scientology cult, so there is no need for a scientology cult member to explain what Xenu is to me. Lord Xenu is a regular contributor to the Usenet under the same alias, and you have failed to cite any evidence that Lord Xenu is a vandal, nor any evidence to support your claim that the article was written with malicious intent. <a href="../../../o/r/s/User%7EOrsini_2b01.html" title="User:Orsini">Orsini</a> 04:58, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think it is intensely inappropriate for Republitarian to be trying to summon other parties into this discussion, not to get <i>their</i> point of view, but rather purely to support his own. The fact that he is soliciting <i>only Scientologists</i> to join the discussion borders on sabotage of the AfD process. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<i>Strong keep and rewrite</i>. I see a strong bias for deletion expressed towards the creator of this article only because of the editor's user name, hence the "strong keep".

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Merge</b> into one of the other 100 Scientology articles.

<li><b>Keep and rewrite</b> This could be a significant article were it to be de-POVized. That's by the nominators own admission.

<li>Yes, but please do consider what I wrote carefully. "... I don't think those writing [an acceptable article on this subject] would even find this stub to be of much assistance." What good does it do to say "oh, a good article <i>could</i> exist on this subject, so we have to keep a poor one that won't lead to a good one"? Please, try this and tell me if you get a different result than I did: remove the vague and poorly sourced portions of the article. How much is left? Can you really see it as even a decent stub? If the focus were tighter -- if it were specifically about "TR-L", the Training Route that taught Guardian's Office members how to "outflow false data effectively", i.e., to lie, then there might be enough to make a usable stub. But for the whole topic of "Scientology public relations" ... I'm afraid that I have trouble not seeing it as "Hey, this is a <i>perfectly good</i> jigsaw puzzle piece... let's keep it around in case someone chooses to build a jigsaw puzzle it fits into." -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:35, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
