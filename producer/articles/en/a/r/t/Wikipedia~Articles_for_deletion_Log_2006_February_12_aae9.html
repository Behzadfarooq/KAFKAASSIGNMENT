<li><b>Comment</b>: No. They never <i>officially</i> announced a fourth film, only the <i>possibility</i> of doing one. There's no concrete plans on doing a fourth film and everything in this article is nothing but speculation and gossip. It's the same reason why every single article on <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman_Begins_2_6070.html" title="Batman Begins 2">Batman Begins 2</a> gets deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even in the absence of an official announcement, it seems fairly clear that there are well-established and credible plans and expectations for this movie to be done. The article states (I'm assuming truthfully, until someone changes it) that "Producer Paul W. S. Anderson has signed onto the project and may write the script", so obviously there is at least a hypothetical project within the studio for him to sign onto. And if nothing else, it appears that the plans themselves for this movie are notable enough for an article (i.e., the article can be about <i>present</i> plans and verifiable reports instead of about a nonexistent future movie). –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 21:53, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

This battle has been fought on high school articles dozens of times with AfD's failing 99.9% of the time, even with articles that had far less content. The article was also been created as part of <a href="../../../n/j/_/WP%7ENJ_29f7.html" title="WP:NJ">Wikiproject New Jersey</a>, which is expanding many articles related to the state of New Jersey, with a particular emphasis on education. Furthermore, as the school is a regional high school, serving students from multiple municipalities, the text cannot be simply merged into one article. Clearly the article will benefit improvement and expansion. But the user who created this AfD has been on Wikipedia for barely 12 hours and has already submitted several AfDs without clear justification.

<p>To save people the trouble of reading through this, this is Kengineer and near the bottom of this long discourse I finally discovered (on my own, nobody else knew it) that Human Branching is Human Diversification and Human Diversification is the widely used term in scientific study. There is no entry for Human Diversification on wikipedia so anybody is welcome to do it. I agree wholy that the term human branching can be deleted because even if somebody uses it, it is self-descriptive. Human Diversification is the better term to use in conversation. --Kengineer 03:39, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Don't delete - do a research project to properly define the term. Allen - herein lies the problem. You are afraid of human genetic branching. You actually fear it because, yes indeed, for people to allow it would require discrimination. Why do you fear population diversity? It makes little sense to delete the term itself - the definition that you may not like is certainly up for discussion. It needs to become a research project - --Kengineer 04:33, 12 February 2006 (UTC)Kengineer</p>

<p>White supremacist? You have entered into the delusional land of lala... and the more people that pay attention to your post the more delusional this land becomes. Human Genetic and cultural Branching is natural. Don't be afraid of it, embrace it.--Kengineer 04:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>If the policy is to delete and then it can be reborn again with proper research references - then I to am for deletion because I certainly agree with the reference policy of wikipedia... I actually considered the term "Human Branching" to be such a fundamental phrase as to not need references. It seemed a void that needed to be filled. Human Genetic and Cultural branching pretty well defines it, but a bit more information is needed regarding the legal and social aspects of it.--Kengineer 04:54, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Richard, it is hardly nonsensical. It is actually quite logical which means you either need to read it again, or I can be your teacher - I say this because it really is simple logic and not nonsensical... You can disagree with it sure, but if you don't understand it, you need to read it again or speak with me so I can explain it to you.--Kengineer 05:08, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Wikipedias policy on deletion actually states that the person who nominates for deletion should first consider whether the term itself should remain, and help to enhance it. Essentially this term should exist and somebody will eventually put it back up with references. So this nomination for deletion really refers to the essay I wrote about it rather than the term itself - unless you can point to another term somewhere that sufficiently means human genetic and cultural branching or, human branching for short.--Kengineer 05:27, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I may as well just lay it out there so it's really clear. Racism is opposed everywhere as extremist and bad. Now we've swung the pendulum all the way over to the other extremist side - "we're all one, period, and we'll bring the guns of law out as needed to enforce this." I absolutely support the right of sovereign lands/countries to exist (although I'm sure enough $$$ could convince me otherwise). Because I understand implicitly how genetic branching happens, and how that is human population diversity, I also support the right of every country to discriminate as to who can become a citizen. Without that freedom, where's the human population diversity, and the freedom for that matter? Perhaps you desire such a homogenous, dare I say, boring world... but I do not. Do you think it's right to point a gun at me, or blacklist me from posting, or whatever else to pursue your extremist "all one" vision of the world? --Kengineer 05:45, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>People... please wake up. Please step out of delusion and into reality. I didn't create the term... frankly nature created the term along with certainly hundreds or thousands of humans before I ever uttered it. I did write this particular definition. The term itself can be kept and enhanced by soembody who thinks they can define it better. I can't help but think again; what exactly are you people afraid of? Are you really that afraid of natural human branching? You want to squash the term itself so "nobody gets the idea that it's OK for human genetics and culture to freely branch?" --Kengineer 06:02, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello, I have converted the definition of Human Branching to a stub of evolution and genetics. It now reads only - The term "Human Branching" connotes the genetic and cultural branching of the human species. The references I already provided show the use of this term as a simple convenient way to communicate the genetic branching aspect of the human species itself.--Kengineer 16:12, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Hello again, I've enhanced the definition further keeping accurate with references available and even making the main definition its most common use of when the human branch itself, branched from other genetic branches.--Kengineer 21:01, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Hello, Cladogenesis deals with the speciation of one species into two or more species due to a reproductive branching event. "Human Branching" does not require speciation to take place - it is simply the genetic variation that exists between any two populations that have had isolated reproduction from one another over some period of time. While Human Branching can become Cladogenesis, Human Branching need not be Cladogenesis.--Kengineer 01:19, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Indeed, if you can address the points raised during the discussion by improving the article, you are encouraged to edit a nominated article (noting in the discussion that you have done so if your edits are significant ones)."--Kengineer 01:19, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Human Branching is the simple self-descriptive term that simply means what it says. It can be any amount of genetic distance, from one generation and up. Obviously one generation won't produce much variation at all - but any mutations that pop up in one population but not the other is variation... so even just one generation of isolated reproduction could begin the branching process (depending upon the size of the population and possibility of mutation - I don't know the frequency rates of mutation for human reproduction). The other factor of human genetic branching - partner choice - which selects for desired traits within the culture, takes longer than one generation to see certainly.--Kengineer 01:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A good synonym for "Human Branching" would be "Human Diversification," but that term is also not present in Wikipedia.--Kengineer 02:37, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In fact, we are all idiots - the term "Human Diversification" is exactly human branching. There are resources which talk of microevolution of the human species itself and they refer to this as Human Diversification, not human branching. But Human Branching is still a descript term which has the same meaning. I'll definately create the Human Diversification page at some point, but I'll add this as a synonym to Human Branching right now... or Human Branching should redirect to Human diversification.--Kengineer 02:50, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><br />
I created this article. And I would like to clarify some things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Failure to Deliver shares does not equate with Naked short selling. On this, Mantanmoreland, has been very adamant. Just read his comments on the discussion page of the Naked Short Selling page where he is adamant about the fact that FTDs are not all caused by Naked Short Selling. I agreed with him there and I agree with him here. FTDs are a separate issue and topic that stands on it's own two feet and with differently legal definitions, causes and effects. It is a topic that stands all by itself and is apart from Naked Short Selling. Like an article about a Musical Orchestra and another on individual musical instruments, the both make music, but they're not the same and they're both legitimate articles on different topics.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why is a WIKI article on "Short Selling" or "Futures Contracts" etc., somehow not offensive, but an article on failing to deliver, is? Let's just reduce the entire market mechanisms and effects to the consensus of the naked short selling article then, if that's the logic. This logic makes no sense.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The fact that Bob O'brian made some edits, is not in itself a reason for removing the article, is it? Please tell me WIKI is not that way. Perhaps he should make some edits on the naked short selling article (I think he has, actually) so that it can be removed on the same grounds? Doesn't each article stand on it's own two feet? Why should my article be removed without any factual arguments what so ever?</li>
</ul>
<p>--71.106.236.198 01:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>No, that is not an accurate characterization of the discussion in the other page. What I said was that not all FTDs are naked shorts, in response to the assertions of the above user they were identical. Now he is arguing the opposite, in suppoort of his POV fork.</p>
<p>FTDs only have public significance as an aspect of the naked-shorting controversy. The head of the anti-shorting lobby himself makes that point in his website, saying that "The practice of defrauding investors by taking their money and not delivering the product they paid for has many names. Some call it market manipulation, some call it naked short selling, others call it failing to deliver..." <a href="http://www.thesanitycheck.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thesanitycheck.com/" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Though his comments re "defrauding investors" are rejected by regulators, he is correct what is at issue here is a single issue, most commonly known as "naked short selling." See Google -- 414,000 hits for "naked short selling" vs. 174 for "failure to deliver shares" with virtually all of the latter in the naked-shorting context. --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 03:45, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Should the above two comments be moved to the discussion page? --<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMantanmoreland_c701.html" title="User:Mantanmoreland">Mantanmoreland</a> 16:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Mantanmoreland, Nobody knows the reason or context of why someone googles a term. The use of this type of logic will steer wrong almost every time, and when it doesn't it's coincidence.</p>
<p>IF this article is to be deleted, the information here should be merged into the naked short selling article, otherwise a big chunk of information would be left out of WIKI.</p>
<p>As an example, what does an FTD create? The SEC says it creates a securities entitlement, but what exactly is that?, Etc.... Naked shorting creates and FTD and an FTD creates.....</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to say and naked short sale creates a securities entitlement. Certainly the end result of all naked short selling is not always the creation of a securities entitlement. There are a lot of little steps in between that then fork the end result this way or that...</p>
<p>So I'm OK with the deletion of this page, so long as the information contained here is merged into the naked short selling article</p>

<p>Fine. I would suggest proposing what additions you want to make to the discussion page of Naked Short Selling.

<p>I believe this article is a POV. There is no evidence that one certain civilization is older than the rest. For a comparison <a href="../../../j/i/r/Jiroft_Kingdom_822a.html" title="Jiroft Kingdom">Jiroft Kingdom</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/e/Predynastic_Egypt_3d5a.html#Late_Lower_Paleolithic" title="Predynastic Egypt">Predynastic_Egypt#Late_Lower_Paleolithic</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/s/Mesopotamia.html" title="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>, etc all claim around 5000 BC years or more..</p>
<p>I think its best to either delete this article, or redirect it to Ancient history, or whatever else.. Kash 02:01, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>

<li>Bugger. I was just about to suggest that! Well, I've <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">boldly</a> implemented the <b>redirect</b>. I would <i>love</i> to read a good article on this topic, but this will have to suffice for now. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 02:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>FYI, you can't redirect to an anchor point like "#Early Civilizations". —<a href="../../../w/a/h/User%7EWahoofive_09c2.html" title="User:Wahoofive">Wahoofive</a> (<a href="../../../w/a/h/User_talk%7EWahoofive_6e5c.html" title="User talk:Wahoofive">talk</a>) 03:53, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, I've fixed that. It's still the right article to redirect too, but if that section expands too much then it would be <i>great</i> to extract it out into Early civilizations or something like that. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgeStepanek_8612.html" title="User:GeorgeStepanek">GeorgeStepanek</a>\<sup><a href="../../../g/e/o/User_talk%7EGeorgeStepanek_0414.html" title="User talk:GeorgeStepanek"><font color="gray">talk</font></a></sup> 06:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Do you all have any idea how crushing it is to have people arguing to have the little bio page you set up for yourself deleted? I would argue for non-deletion based on several things:</li>
<li>I write for several publications with a circulation of more than 5,000 (Nerve and Renaissance being two)</li>
<li>Corporate Mofo (which doesn't need its own entry) is linked to Fark, a high-traffic newsfilter, and my Matrix analysis thereon garnered a lot of media attention</li>
<li>I have two books coming out</li>
<li>It's helpful to include my qualifications for editing those obscure fencing articles.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Hey everyone. I'm the one who wrote the article. I am not George Tadross and am not affiliated with his campaign. I was intrigued by his website, and I think he is serious in his intentions to run. I've talked with him, and he's sparked some interest in the voting age youth, and is set to be interviewed for 2 university newspapers (Toronto, and Laurier his alma mater). It could spark interest in mainstream media but who knows. As far as Dogbreathcanada and ikkyu2's problem with my writing it early, there certainly has been precedent. Martha Hall Findlay has never been elected into parliamentary office and has never done anything formally political, yet no one is threatening to delete her info, or the info on the Liberal convention page (the stuff I put on Tadross was gone in less than 24 hours). So that's fine if you're going to delete my work, but just be consistent and use your criteria for every politician. I honestly don't think Tadross will win, but I think it's an intriguing story. Findlay won't win either, and her story isn't nearly as interesting. So cut up my article all you want, but do so fairly and don't assume there's "vanity" involved just because he is different than the other candidates.Dfahmy 06:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes but Findlay's candidacy has been reported in the Toronto Star, no mainstream media has reported Tadross' candidacy - there is nothing to verify it save for a one page website. Homey 06:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Read my comment again. My problem isn't that you wrote the article early, which opinion you misattributed to me; it is that the subject of the article in no way meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. You should read <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>; maybe you will see a way to make Mr Tadross qualify. Ikkyu2 21:52, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't know how, or if, I can delete a site myself, but you're not reading it wrong; I've changed my position. I still stand by the fact that all people making a legitimate run should have their information available on Wikipedia. Newspapers use the same fact checkers as anyone else, and are subject to biases of editors, and the position the newspaper wants to uphold. That's the great thing about Wikipedia. We're not subject to those same biases, and we are able to change or add information to inform others, even before the newspapers get the scoop. However, in this case, George Tadross has taken his site down. So the only source of information is gone, and I can't argue to keep it around anymore. As far as his history about being the "Greatest thing since sliced bread". Although hilarious, I have no idea what it was about. He is a university student after all. Could be one of his friends messing around. That should have no bearing on the legitimacy of what I wrote. Dfahmy 05:04, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Tricky one, this'n. If he actually files as an official candidate for the leadership race, then he <i>will</i> merit an article whether he's seen as a real contender or not. (I sincerely doubt he <i>would</i> be seen as a contender, but political party leadership candidates merit articles for the fact of being candidates, <i>not</i> for POV assumptions about their chances.) But it's also distinctly possible that he's talking out of his hat, and won't actually file as a candidate when pu$h comes to $hove. And a candidate who's not particularly well-known isn't necessarily going to generate a whole lot of media attention right away, particularly on the weekend when there aren't that many media at work in the first place, so it won't be easily verified until he either does or doesn't actually file nomination papers. If it's deleted and he does file, it'll have to come back; if it's kept and he doesn't, it'll have to be deleted. So personally, I'd suggest that we suspend judgement on it for the time being, and either keep or delete at a later date based on whether anything actually comes of this or not. We can always hide it somewhere as a user subpage if need be. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:30, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

WS is a site that has kept on going after any other site would have given up. It's an inspiration to many. And yes, I stole the time/date tag from TheRingess. Considering the original delete nom came from <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> maybe I should include some of his wikis:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragonfiend|" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dragonfiend|" rel="nofollow">[8]</a></p>
<p>Several of his include webcomics, WS started the web comic nerrds.</p>
<p>In fact, several of Dragonfiend's entries appeal to a smaller group than the impact of Warpstorm.</p>
<p>This article has been marked for deletion before it's even finished. We have not had the time to include more than 80% of the content that is relevant to the article. It was marked no less than a few hours from when it was written.</p>

<li>You like this. It means the article was looked at by someone who really, really deeply understands the Wikipedia inclusion criteria and is strongly committed to them.

</ul>
<p>In addition, Nyxfall and Terran Imperium (published stories) is cross-linked to Warpstorm, so when that part of the article goes up, it would be good to have it known where the stories originated from.</p>
<p>One last thing, instead of a mod posting to "delete per nom," In cases such as this, where we are not some bored internet geek looking to pass the time that they should post an independent reason of their own for why the feel it shouldn't be deleted. member count of a forum is not a good reason... a member count is just a number. I've seen dead websites with thousands of users.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Warpstorm has had far more then 120 members. That is all that is left after many site crashes throughout its history.

<li><b>Keep</b> Alternately, why this is trying to be deleted off Wikipedia is beyond me. I have yet to see any reason as to how this page is inadmissible to Wikipedia. This page falls well within the parameters of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. The criteria for WP:WEB content has been met, citing heretic's evidence for example. Furthermore, this page still has a great deal of content to be added. Warpstorm may not have universal fame, but this page is notable, verifiable, neutral, without original research, and with reliable and cited sources. Eberwolf 21:09, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As a published researcher in the field of <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleontology.html" title="Paleontology">paleontology</a>, Dr Curry Rogers is certainly <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">notable</a>. As is obvious from the list of published papers in many scientific journals on the bio page, she fits the wikipedia notability category of published <i>authors</i> who have written articles in periodicals with a circulation of 5,000 or more (papers published in scientific journals). In addition, she has also written one chapter and co-authored one chapter in one book (<i>Sauropods - Evolution and Paleobiology</i>) and one chapter in another book (The <i>Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs</i>). Add to that, as the co-editor of one of those books, she is an <i>editor</i> of a book with an audience of 5,000 or more.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: As I've already pointed out on Batman2005's user talk page, and Jeffrey Wilson AfD page, but will repeat it here; while there are plenty of entries on Wikipedia on a many different dinosaur genera (something I do support and think is cool), there are still as yet very few write-ups on the paleontologists who are making these discoveries. This means that Wikipedia has lots of stuff on names and types of dinosaurs, but very little on the <i>real</i> science and scientists behind their discovery! For this reason, pages on scientists who have made important discoveries in this field are absolutely necessary. In fact this is one of the tasks I have set myself here on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 09:38, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think this article is referring to the term "memetracker", rather than any particular software. I'm not sure who invented the term, but it has recently been used by bloggers following an article on my blog which attempted to round up some of these services <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/02/03/the-rise-of-the-memetrackers/" class="external autonumber" title="http://mashable.com/2006/02/03/the-rise-of-the-memetrackers/" rel="nofollow">[10]</a>. The name is likely derived from Memeorandum, the most popular memetracker. At the time I wrote the post, I wasn't aware of memetracker.org, although the whois data shows that the domain was registered before the post was written. I don't think I'm in a position to say whether it should be deleted or not (the consensus appears to be that it should). Mashable 20:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

Add to that he is editor of the book on Sauropods you mention, hence he has <i>edited</i> a book with an audience of 5,000 or more. In addition, he has <i>also</i> written one chapter and co-authored one chapter in the afore-mentioned book. So an Amazon search <i>alone</i> is highly misleading in this case! (in fact even if he hadn't written and co-written all these other scientific papers, Dr Wilson would <i>still</i> be notable by Wikipedia standards, as (co-)editor of a book with a circulation of over 5000)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>: I already explained this on Batman2005's user talk page, but will repeat it here (and also on the Curry Rogers AfD page); that while there are heaps of entries on Wikipedia on a many different dinosaur genera (something I do support btw), there are as yet very few write-ups on the paleontologists who are making these discoveries. This means Wikipedia has a sort of kids' book quality when it comes to paleontology - lots of stuff on names and types of dinosaurs, but very little on the <i>real</i> science and scientists behind their discovery. For this reason, pages on scientists who have made important discoveries in this field are absolutely necessary. <a href="../../../m/_/a/User%7EM_Alan_Kazlev_3836.html" title="User:M Alan Kazlev">M Alan Kazlev</a> 09:09, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Wow, a very tough one to close, and no way to do it without pissing somebody off. A simple vote count gives us 68% in favor of deletion. On both sides we have persuasive arguments from experienced users. Before deciding on this one I reread <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Wikipedia:Consensus</a>, <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">WP:Verifiability</a>, and <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators</a>. In the end, although the site does smashingly well on the Google test and barometers of "internet fame", IMO the delete voters have successfully made the case that it falls short of notability as delineated at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and also suffers from fatal problems of verifiability.

<p>I would like this article deleted or the passage regarding me ("nathanr") changed to represent the actual facts.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Reason why I would like it deleted:</p>
<p>a) Article (at least the passage regarding me) is filled with rumour and hearsay, and can damage a person's reputation.<br />
b) Information in said article (at least in the passage regarding me) is biased, false and is not accompanied by facts.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>Yes, there's evidence to warrant its deletion. A person's reputation is at stake. The article is full of rumours/hearsay/gossip and second and third-hand information. I think that's enough.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>While yes, it has created enough of a stir in the LiveJournal community, we don't need examples of "user conspiracies" because they seem to be full of rumours/hearsay/second and third hand information and usually not factual. They seem to do more harm than good.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>I recommend:<br />
a) DELETE the article if the author(s) fail to delete "user conspiracies".<br />
b) KEEP the article if the "user conspiracies" are deleted.<br />
<br /></p>
<p>LJ Drama is hardly a "notable site" as it slanders others. (and to those who say it is, you try being on the receiving end and see how you like it)<br />

And no, the LJ article doesn't automatically make anything that touches it notable, as anybody that edits the LJ article regularly can attest, vanity entries appear routinely. LJ Drama also appears routinely, within the article, in see also links, and in references. But what LJ Drama actually <i>is</i> does not belong in the LiveJournal article. Again, our editorial standards aren't there to be used as a cudgel, nor robotically, nor arbitrarily, but with common sense. LiveJournal is a larger community of concepts, places, and ideas than JUST the website itself - thus, satellite articles make sense and are necessary in order for wikipedias coverage of the larger community to have a complete context. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 21:27, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</strike>

<p><strike>Minor fundamentalist christian convention with main speakers from conspiracy backgrounds (Missler, Hovind). This is a promotion, as admitted by author of the article, to put fundamentalist Christianity on Wikipedia.<a href="http://wiki4christ.com/" class="external autonumber" title="http://wiki4christ.com/" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The article claims that Cameron and Keyes have been part of the conference (no sources). If true Wikipedia does not need to log every small conference a 1980s TV star or one time presidential hopeful attended. There are four articles that link to the article. Two of which are Missler and Hovind, conspiracy theorists who lack academic credentials. As the author of this article admits, "These conferences are usually one day in length, but they are sometimes two days long" and has music by "Andy Day or another Christian musician." Those two lines show that this article has little to offer by using terms like "sometimes" and "or another." This is cruft to promote religious leaders favored by the author. <a href="../../../a/r/b/User%7EArbustoo_b426.html" title="User:Arbustoo">Arbustoo</a> 04:39, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</strike></p>

<li>I would vote <b>Delete</b> but more based on lack of context. I read the article. I am no closer to understanding what it is talking about than before I read the article. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJames084_3305.html" title="User:James084">James084</a> 19:42, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not delete.</b> I am one of the referees for CP, on the plot writing team. The largest event does indeed have over 1000 players. This makes it the second largest event of its type in the country and so should probably qualify as "notable." Also, it no longer counts as an off-shoot of Lorien Trust, but rather is in direct competition. The current article does lack content, but I'm working on a replacement - Troll <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.171.212.186 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.171.212.186_fd19.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.171.212.186">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Criticizing a mistake in the article is unfair considering that it was tagged after one minute and was obviously done by a non-native English speaker. Furthermore, how do we know this is not an important Thai-language MMORPG in the Thai market?

I apologize for any offense I might have given, but frankly I don't see the point of keeping this unless we want all the other several thousand MMORPGs with higher Alexa ratings we've deleted in the last several months. If it's an important Thai MMORPG, let them do an article in the Thai Wikipedia first (assuming they haven't already). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 06:28, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know how many Thai articles we have deleted, but I tend to doubt it's in the thousands. As I don't read Thai, I have not verified whether the Thai wikipedia has an article (I assume you have). However, does the Alexa rank matter if the game is played over mobile phones? What kind of participation are we looking for with these games in the Thai context? The press reports suggest 3,000 users in the beta. I beleve we need some valid input from Thai users here. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 06:42, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was referring to MMPORPGs in general, not Thai ones. All I'm saying is, keep this one and you open the door to an ungodly number of MMPORPGs, in every language.

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Delete</b>. "LUEshi" is a meme virtually exclusive to the GameFAQs community.

<li>Changing vote, and additional comments. The article itself is largely fluff and only references GF/LUE/LL throughout its content. There is nothing in the article to suggest any significance outside of the community; it's comparable to the majority of the "Notable memes" list in the <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> article. In my opinion, LUE itself is significant enough in GameFAQs history to warrant its own article (though others disagree), and LUEshi should then be part of such an article. The meme itself does not deserve its own page. <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarpstarRider_35b7.html" title="User:WarpstarRider">WarpstarRider</a> 22:22, 13 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me clarify. My first thought was yes, merge it into GameFAQs message boards (heretofore referred to as GameFAQs). However, I went over to GameFAQs and noticed the article was already moderately long, and even if the whole article is not necessary for a merge, it would still account for a significant portion of the GameFAQs article. If there were a page such as GameFAQs fads, or something of the likes, I would say merge it into there, but I don't think that there are enough other fads to justify that kind of page. -<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanhurley_5b45.html" title="User:Jordanhurley">J Train</a> 03:43, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Oh my, the LUEsers are up for it - I see a topic with 41 posts about this AFD nomination, plus two other topics about it.

<li><b>Keep</b> Is there some conspiracy to remove internet memes from Wikipedia we should know about? LUEshi is quote notable, with GameFAQs being one of the larger internet communities.

<li>Right. Let me clarify. The reason I've voted to delete is both that I agree with the nominator and that I instinctively vote to delete articles where a flood of "meatpuppets" (meaning new users, users with very few contributions, or unregistered users, no more and no less) contributes and asks to keep or "do not delete". My request was simply for the closing administrator to carefully check whether contributions from certain users should be discounted. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 21:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yeah, your logic is pretty flawed. Maybe you didn't read the article, but this was actually a huge deal on GameFAQs and other places, such that users were banned or suspended for 2 months just for posting it once, and it's not anything shocking like tubgirl, goatse, etc. Your picture you've uploaded is just that; something of note to you, not a website with 3 million registered users and "hundreds of thousands times more hits than your personal website does". -<a href="../../../j/o/r/User%7EJordanhurley_5b45.html" title="User:Jordanhurley">J Train</a> 03:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pfft. Nobody was banned for LUEshi. The worst I heard was purgatory, but that was pretty much brought on yourzselves by abusing it to the point of no return (i.e. Night of a Thousand LUEshis). Out of the 3 million <i>registered</i> GF <i>accounts</i> it was only a big deal to a few thousand, the LUEsers (22,000 as of ExcLUEsivity).

<li><b>Comment</b> Two questions should come out of this whole discussion. First, are fads and internet memes noteworthy. Are they significant in the sense that anyone looking back years from now would even care? Probably not. Are they significant in the sense that someone might actually look up something like this for reference, yes, I've personally looked up the <a href="../../../o/r/l/ORLY_bceb.html" title="ORLY">ORLY</a> article myself to figure some things out. In discussing internet memes their inclusion may be inevitable in a community dominated by the internet.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The second question is whether or not it's possible to lobby wikipedia. Can a dedicated enough forum, which is all we're talking about here, defend an article or topic of their choice and promote it to notability? These votes suffer from a self-selection bias, the only people likely to show up are people who really want to defend the article, few people are likely to put the same effort into getting rid of it. But does this basically mean that a commmunity like somethingawful or slashdot can hold wikipedia articles hostage or dominate coverage of themselves and promote their topics? Aside from making votes like this more public or putting out an appeal to wikipedia that a message board or community is exercising undue influence, I'm not sure what we can do.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 09:49, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Considering that, I, a LUEser, do not believe in the notability of this article, I think we can rule out the idea that any community can truly be solid on this issue.

<dd>In the long run, almost certainly, just like in the long run any article tends towards being accurate since enough people will have had a chance to correct it. However, in the long run, we're all dead. The average VfD may have only dozens of users where as forums have hundreds of members at their disposal, we'll just have to trust that people in the community of wikipedia make wise judgements.--<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigCow_5aad.html" title="User:BigCow">BigCow</a> 20:55, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>OK. Here they are. This person, while I am sure he is a talented doctor, has done nothing of note to earn a Wikipedia page.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as the list sticks to the Sony and related links, I see no problem with it as this is a rather controversial subject.

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem is precisely that <i>it isn't</i> verifiable. What if your friend's 90 year old grandma had problems playing Britney Spears' latest album, and decides to add it to the list? You can't verify if her album actually has any DRM by buying the same album, because the record company could have sold two versions of the same album, one with DRM and one without. Essentially where you need to go for reliable lists are the record labels' websites. Hence it doesn't provide additional value that you can't get by following the external links. In fact it's worse because this article could accumulate misinformation.—<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 03:04, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your comments, Pavel. Yes, I agree that one or two external sites have larger lists than the article as it currently stands. I was not going to spend hours and days on a fuller (and more up-to-date) list only to see it deleted. If it is agreed to keep the article, it will be much more comprehensive.</p>
<p>I don't believe that Google or Yahoo or similar can produce a satisfactory list: that is the reason I considered doing one on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>I think that the online section of the list is fairly easy to maintain: there are probably around 20 online absinthe shops of any significance.</p>
<p>As far as bricks and mortars sellers are concerned, I would guess that your perspective, Pavel, may be slightly different from mine (or most readers of Wikipedia) since absinthe is much more readily available in the Czech Republic than elsewhere. In London, apart from Tesco and 1/2 other large supermarkets. one can only find absinthe at 4/5 large department stores and about 3 specialists. The situation is similar in many other European countries.</p>
<p>I hope I can persuade you to re-consider.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have been asked to provide some further comment after Pavel's additional information. I still believe that Wikipedia is not a business directory. The argument put forward by Pavel, could be used for many pharmaceuticals that are only available in certain countries, or for certain drugs etc. Just because Kava is legal in Fiji and illegal elsewhere, does not mean that Wiki should provide a way of finding the stuff. It is non-encyclopaedic, difficult to maintain and provides little that a Google search could not eventually find.

<p>My purpose in starting this site is NOT to set up a business directory. As you may or may not know, absinthe has only recently been legalised in most countries in Europe and it is still very difficult to find. In the US it is still illegal and I am seeking to help both Americans and others in Canada, Europe and Asia to find out where they can get absinthe. Absinthe's status in the USA means that US consumers either use the internet to purchase or make it themselves which is a highly illegal activity and a much greater risk to people trying to do this at home.</p>
<p>I see little difference between what I am proposing here and this section of Wikipedia</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Supermarkets" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Supermarkets" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Supermarkets</a></p>
<p>which seems to take readers to long lists of stores (and the Wikipedia entries) for various countries. The only major difference is the scale .. and since I have just started this entry, I need a while to get that far and to do it as well.</p>
<p>I would be grateful for help in creating this site and any links in the correct way.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Well, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Category%7ESupermarkets_377a.html" title="Category:Supermarkets">Category:Supermarkets</a> is a <a href="../../../c/a/t/Wikipedia%7ECategory_37f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Category">category</a> of articles, not an article itself, but the comparison to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_supermarkets.html" title="List of supermarkets">List of supermarkets</a> would actually be a valid one. Hmm. I <i>might</i> be willing to change my vote to "keep" on this article, but the following things would have to happen for it to become a valid list article:
<ol>
<li>The title should be changed to List of absinthe retailers (and <a href="../../../l/i/s/Template%7EListdev_8a9d.html" title="Template:Listdev">Template:Listdev</a> would be appropriate).</li>
<li>The first paragraph would have to be pared down to a short lead, probably a single sentence, so that it doesn't sound like it's introducing an advertisement. Anything to be said about absinthe's legality and sale can be said <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrally</a> at the <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absinthe.html" title="Absinthe">absinthe</a> page.</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, the page should not be an invitation for businesses to put their own links (or names) there for free advertising.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>This last point is why the page could turn into a collection of "linkspam", in which case it would wind up on AfD again. The important thing would be that the page is an <i>encyclopedic list</i> that would be reasonably informative to the reader, not an indiscriminate list of businesses (no matter how useful it may be to the reader—Wikipedia strives to be useful only within the bounds of being an encylopedia). But Alanmoss may be correct that the page has the potential to turn into something more like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_supermarkets.html" title="List of supermarkets">List of supermarkets</a> instead of just another linkspam page. It's an interesting question and I'd like to get other editors' feedback on it. Thanks. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 18:30, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've changed the first para already, but cannot see how to change the title or template. Do I need to start the page again to do that?</p>
<p>I certainly don't want it to become listspam, and I'm sure that there are other absinthe experts who would help me in policing that.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration.</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> You should see a "move" tab at the top of the page, next to "edit this page" and "history", which moves a page to a new title (i.e. changing the title.) One simple way to avoid it becoming a spammy page would be to only have links to Wikipedia articles about the listed retailers, and not external links to their websites. Also, restricting it to notable retailers might be a good idea, rather than potentially listing every <a href="../../../o/f/f/Off-licence.html" title="Off-licence">off-licence</a> or equivilent that sells absinthe. -- <a href="../../../a/j/r/User%7EAJR_ccb2.html" title="User:AJR">AJR</a> | <a href="../../../a/j/r/User_talk%7EAJR_a5b7.html" title="User talk:AJR">Talk</a> 22:25, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Can we keep it? It looks pretty handy to me, as Google is especially poor at helping to locate real-world shops for absinthe. It's still pretty rare on the ground here in the UK. Binkydozer 16:32, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Per some of the arguments above, I'm changing my vote to <b>keep</b>. I think I'm convinced that this article has the potential to be encyclopedic as long as it is restricted to large, notable retailers (i.e., many of which would hopefully have their own legitimate Wikipedia pages) and is not allowed to become a business directory, indiscriminate list, or invitation to linkspam. Just because the list will be a little short does not mean that the article is worthless. This is not a clearly non-notable subject, so let's give the article a chance to be edited into a good one, or at the very least err on the side of inclusion. –<a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESommers_4abf.html" title="User:Sommers">Sommers</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESommers_adb5.html" title="User talk:Sommers">(Talk)</a></sup> 17:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm on the fence and thus abstaining. On one hand there are some notable vendors and stores that have helped to push absinthe forward, making it better know, and/or working with both small and large distilleries to create a better product. As absinthe on wikipedia grows these companies probably deserve their own pages. So a page grouping them together makes sense. On the other it does seem to come pretty close to what wikipedia is not and could cause link-spam problems. There are a number of small, unnotable, and/or unscrupulous sellers that I wouldn't put it past them to link spam the page. If the page stays I think a criteria for listing a link needs to be added to the talk page to reduce any possible edit wars from vendors or vendor fans who feel their site should be added to the list. <a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAri_x_43f0.html" title="User:Ari x">Ari</a> 18:03, 17 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thanks for your comments, Ari. Ari's presence will, I am sure, helps maintain the article's integrity as much as is possible. I would like to suggest, given the variety of views, that I do a bit more work on the article over the next week or so, knowing that there is still a possibility of deletion, but also the possibility that it will then address the concerns raised here. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmoss_3273.html" title="User:Alanmoss">Alanmoss</a> 09:58, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I am now starting to adopt the suggested policy of linking, wherever possible, only to outlets that have their own Wikipedia page, eg Tesco, Harrods, LCBO, some airports and airlines. There are some exceptions and I take Ari's point about the criteria for listing a link (assuming this to be external). I will have a stab at that (easier for bricks and mortars stores than for online sellers, I think). A lot of work in progress here ... <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlanmoss_3273.html" title="User:Alanmoss">Alanmoss</a> 12:25, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

I found many definitions for drive. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLR,GGLR:2005-48,GGLR:en&amp;oi=defmore&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:drive" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=GGLR,GGLR:2005-48,GGLR:en&amp;oi=defmore&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:drive" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>. At a minimum have the page redirected to a dissambiguation page of "Drive." Again, I think we can have some encyclopedic material added to this article and references to organizations and examples and perhaps even a how-to book on wikibooks. --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 22:21, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - useful list; Hi, this list was basically broken up from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_butterflies_of_India_6511.html" title="List of butterflies of India">List of butterflies of India</a>, There are 4 more pages; ending with Papilionidae, Nymphalidae, Lycaenidae and Hesperiidae. The idea of this list is to help people interested in butterflies with a tentative list. I have just started this process and am getting together people to put in life histories and images. For eg. <a href="../../../e/u/p/Euploea_core.html" title="Euploea core">Euploea core</a>. This list acts as 1. a seed (other people invloved can see how much is done and how much needs to be done) 2. A pictorial guide to butterflies and their life histories for anyone looking for info on the net. I do agree that some of these butterfly lists of india have more red links than blue. But it will fill out and soon these pages will look like the model we copied it from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_butterflies_f0f5.html" title="List of British butterflies">List of British butterflies</a>. --<a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EVirenVaz_d87d.html" title="User:VirenVaz">Viren</a> 18:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Time to come clean. I've been here since 2003, and not all my contributions have been... stellar. All the stuff I actually made up was either discovered or turned in by me when I reformed. However, there are still a lot of things I think probably deserve to be evaluated as to whether or not they deserve to live.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> "List of real people appearing in fictional context", <b>Weak keep</b> "List of mythical and religious beings appearing in fictional context" (which is much, much lower-quality and less interesting, but still has tons of potential if future editors spiff it up). No justification for deletion; "too long" is not a reason, in itself, to completely eliminate a page, and it confuses me that you'd list these with so many much less interesting and valuable pages.

<p>A google for "I sing praises" and McAlmon yields around 10 unique hits, the writer about 150, mostly adverts for other songs.

<li><b>Keep</b> Can we put a hold on the deletion process please. I have been updating the entries for this site and am responsible for their webmaster linking to the wiki page. The place is a place of Buddhist worship, and as such is listed under Buddhist temples on wikipedia, and many of the other temples have entries about them.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The deletion process lasts five days, and as things stand it'll get another five days due to lack of contributions. However, it will not be put on hold.

<dd><b>comment</b>: I'm sorry. You are technically correct. I believe its called CentrePoint Theatre here in Ottawa. On the street though I'm used to calling it CentrePoint mall. It can be found <a href="http://local.google.com/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=101+Centrepointe+Drive,+Ottawa,+Ontario,+Canada&amp;ll=45.366137,-75.592117&amp;spn=0.204062,0.686646" class="external text" title="http://local.google.com/local?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=101+Centrepointe+Drive,+Ottawa,+Ontario,+Canada&amp;ll=45.366137,-75.592117&amp;spn=0.204062,0.686646" rel="nofollow">here</a> or <a href="http://www.centrepointetheatre.com/about_en.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.centrepointetheatre.com/about_en.shtml" rel="nofollow">online here</a>. Although there is an instance of the mall allegedly being in Toronto. <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20010419/ctvnews87699/CTVNewsAt11?s_name=&amp;no_ads=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20010419/ctvnews87699/CTVNewsAt11?s_name=&amp;no_ads=" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> But it's spelt with an "e" at the end of pointe. Like "centrepointe" mall. Another instance is Centrepointe Mall, 6374 Yonge Street, Willowdale, Ontario. <a href="http://www.ic.gc.ca/cmb/welcomeic.nsf/0/85256a220056c2a485256a3200779267?OpenDocument" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ic.gc.ca/cmb/welcomeic.nsf/0/85256a220056c2a485256a3200779267?OpenDocument" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. That may however be a typo because my govermnents web site lists it as one of the mall where a dispencer, for vehicle information and renewal, is located.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are many "Centrepoint" shopping malls around the world. At the very least the name of the article should make this clear. Regarding the comment about <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShopping_malls_by_country_0c69.html" title="Category:Shopping malls by country">Category:Shopping malls by country</a> - well, I was shocked to only find one article on shopping malls in Mexico. And looking at another example <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShopping_malls_in_Egypt_d41c.html" title="Category:Shopping malls in Egypt">Category:Shopping_malls_in_Egypt</a>, someone seems to have tried to turn the category page into a list.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I actually fail to see encyclopaedic aspect to many mall articles. The fact that many (IMO) un-encyclopaedic artcicles exists is no excuse for one more. I would like to have opinions on what are actually the facts in this article which could not be mentionned about any random shopping mall. I maintain my delete vote. I am unconviced about the interest of this given article and it's kind. I personnaly think it is vanicruftisement: just because I can make an article about a subject I make it, forgetting btw to ask the key question about significance. I hope WP will not hosts an article for each mall mentionned <a href="../../../h/e/r/Here.html" title="Here">here</a>. Just imagine: 100 times details about basements, car parks, lifts, shops...

<li>I respect your opinion, but I like reading these types of articles. Schools, streets, malls, bridges, towns, etc. are interesting and are generally handled very well here. Remember that malls are huge businesses that attract millions of people every year. They can be vital economically to their local regions. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:22, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This list of articles lack sources. Note this is not to delete the template but the article. It hence lacks citations. In turn it becomes original research.

Each of the pages with a specific olympic date (i.e. 1960 Summer) do not have sources, though. These pages <b>can't</b> be deleted because a lot of hard work has been put into making them. Furthermore, these pages have been in Wikipedia for a long time, so why is it now that they are up for deletion? A source for this information can be found anywhere (IOC, Olympic.org, Sydney2000, etc) so the real problem is finding someone who is willing to find and append valuable sources for each of the other pages, or make an umbrella citation covering all of them. As for now, I think that the deletion should be removed and a tag for sources should be put on every page. --<a href="../../../j/p/0/User%7EJP06035_fdfe.html" title="User:JP06035">Jared</a> 18:10, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Furthermore, what is the purpose of having 4 tags? All that you need is that sources needed tag and the deletion one, because you and I know that this is not a matter of "factual accuracy"; the proble is that there are no sources. I have created a new tag that will act as the source tag. The other two (which are redundant) I am going to remove becuase they are appearing on 50 or more pages (because of the link to the template) and at a time of high traffic due to the current olympics, we don't want Wikipedia first time users to get a bad notion of Wikipedia because there are ugly tags filling up the page. I am not a vandal trying to ruin Wikipedia, I just am thinking of the other thousands of users and viewers.

comment in the talk page of CyclePat as Written by JzG:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Pat, next time you are tempted to tag up an article like that (let alone a template), please do ask around first. If you don't trust me, ask somebody else. Your action was precipitate - to suggest that an Olympic medal table "requires sources" is pressing a point too far since the sources are freely available on the Internet and published every day in the press, whether or not the people using them have accurately transcribed the figures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Apart from anything else you apparently only half-did the process, and it was the wrong process to start with (should have been miscellany for deletion). Oh, and you tagged entirely the wrong article - you tagged the medal tables template, in effect demanding sources for the existence of the 2006 Winter Olympics. The article you want deleted, Olympic games medal count, does not exist and never did.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Also, you said in the delete request that all it required was citations - that is not grounds for deletion unless you believe that the article is irredeemable in that regard (i.e. original research without prospect of reliable external sources - absurd in the case of an Olympic medal table). If that sounds like "don't be a dick" then I probably got the tone about right&#160;:-) Just zis Guy, you know? [T]/[C] 18:43, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If you see how much time it took for you to find one year. How much time do you think it will take to find all the other years. Oh! And whatch what your saying there JzG. I might just snap. Please assume good faith in me. I appreciate your summary of the issue. (the one at the top of this nomination, not your comments just above this comment though) I think this label (Template:Medal sources also displayed below), which you removed, sumarizes the issue verry well. One of the reason I didn't put it on every article is my laziness to put the afd on every article. Why do that when you can simply put it on the template that shows up in every article. At the end we can decide on what article are properly cited or not. &lt;grinning/light heartly&gt; You old stuburn dog. &#160;:)
<ul>
<li>I removed the template, it's linked above. You don't include templates in discussions, it screws everything up. Pat, the difficulty or otherwise of digging up individual medal tables is completely irrelevant to whether all the medal tables should be deleted as inherently unverifiable, whcih is in effect what you've asked for. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> 20:32, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> One question, how the hell is the olympic metal counts "original research". Honestly this is the biggest stretch I've ever seen. Since Cyclepat may not know what original research is I'll give an exmaple. Lets say I am a medical biology student (hey what do you know I am!!) and I do a cause and effect study, for example does deodorent cause breast cancer (dont laugh, someone actually tried to claim this), and instead of publishing in a peer reviewed publication, I publish it on Wikipedia. This would then be original research, and be deleted for it. Olympic metal counts are NOT original research. I am posting this to WP:AN as well since this is WP:POINT. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOnthost_efee.html" title="User:Onthost">Mike</a> <sub>(<a href="../../../o/n/t/User_talk%7EOnthost_6d42.html" title="User talk:Onthost">T</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Onthost_a9ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/Onthost">C</a>)</sub> <a href="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Star_of_life.svg/20px-Star_of_life.svg.png" alt="" width="20" height="19" longdesc="../../../s/t/a/Image%7EStar_of_life.svg_5f65.html" /></a> 20:26, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation. Failing to cite sources does not make an article original research, and is not grounds for deletion. <a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> has made at least one other bad faith/frivolous AFD nomination in the last few hours. Finally, adding the AFD tag to the template hides the AFD notice at the bottom of the article, rather than displaying it properly. It should be removed from the template as vandalism; if the user is fool enough to want to nominate these articles for deletion, put the tags on all the articles, so they display properly and can be seen by users as required! <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 20:35, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What makes that anymore different then saying 2 + 2 = 4? (original research)... The lack of sources may mean this information comes from such original research (or attending the event) (Or tabulating the facts to give a result!) It makes me assume, where there is no citation, that this is an individuals recollection or a tablature from a source (Original research). However if the source is properly cited we may be able to verify this. I'm not saying this is original research... well actually I am... But It may not be. (which the odd are probably very high... I hope!)... In that case it should be easy to substantiate all these claims. Otherwise, instead of claiming I have some bone to kick, why don't you try helping out to find a source to substantiate the unverified information. &lt;walking away... back to researching&gt; Now... How many medals where from 1976 or 1980... etc... --<a href="../../../c/y/c/User%7ECyclePat_5e52.html" title="User:CyclePat">CyclePat</a> 20:44, 12 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: It's a poor article for being excessively chatty, insufficiently detailed or focused, and poorly styled as well, but the subject is historically interesting and the article is not inherently worthless.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I also disagree with Arthur Rubin that there is no one with both the knowledge and ability to fix the article: I think there are plenty of mathematics history buffs out there. The first one to read the article will surely improve it. Meanwhile, the cleanup notices will warn other people not to take it too seriously, or encourage them to look up some facts to improve it themselves.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I also disagree with Trovatore: it is very unlikely to be original research, as it basically makes note of some famous quotations, a few prominent historical trends, and some very basic mathematics. It is also not "highly POV": it is weakly so at worst, and mostly just in the writing style and lack of details. The "arithmetization" of mathematics, which is the point of the article, is well-known to mathematicians. <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyan_Reich_feb7.html" title="User:Ryan Reich">Ryan Reich</a> 02:55, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think the agenda of the article is clear; the author thinks that all of mathematics can be reduced to the arithmetic of the natural numbers. He's quite wrong about that; the reals are fundamentally richer than the naturals. (Of course the reals can be thought of in terms of the naturals in <i>second-order logic</i>, but I seriously don't think that's what the author has in mind.) To get a clearer picture of his agenda, check out this link from his user page: <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/fable.htm" class="external free" title="http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/fable.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/fable.htm</a> .</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Now I didn't say the article was <i>worthless</i>; I <i>said</i> there was some interesting material there. But it is <i>extremely</i> POV, not just a little bit, and I still think it's kind of OR, which is not to say there aren't citations, just that I think his synthesis of them may not be what the original authors had in mind. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 04:05, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ul>
<li>You know, reading it again, I'm still pretty sure the author has an agenda, but I'm less sure what it is (and I'm also less sure what the point of the "fable" is). Maybe that's what you meant about being "POV in the writing style". Ordinarily a good test for NPOV is if you can't figure out the author's opinion, but I think that doesn't apply if the <i>reason</i> you can't figure it out is that it isn't written clearly. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 05:38, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>An arbitrary set of naturals can be coded by a real, so yeah, I think you pretty much <i>do</i> need full second-order to get the reals from the naturals.

<li><b>Comment</b> With two days left in the AfD, I'm not convinced any two of us agree on what the article is actually about. That's certainly not an indication of a good article, but it also makes me nervous about deleting it, because there <i>might</i> be something there that could be cleaned up. Should someone invite Jon Hays to comment? Probably, on general fairness grounds, though having browsed some of his comments, I'm not sure he's really going to clear things up for us. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 18:26, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

It is also not useful to editors, as it needs to be completely rewritten. Better to delete it and, if somebody feels like it, they can start afresh. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 18:56, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, not really sure whats its about, but there is some stuff here which should be covered, but I think its best to start afresh. (Some material may be covered elsewhere, I've not really found my way around the relavant articles yet). Heres my take on some of the points in the article:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Gerneral thesis: much of mathematics can be generated from simpler elements.</li>
<li>Sucessors: how to get the natural numbers from set theory, I think this is how Russle did it in Principica Mathematica, covered at length in Godel Escher Bach. Covered in successor operation</li>
<li>Reals from Integers: use cantor sets
<ul>
<li>The effort to have a Cauchy sequence of <i>pairs</i> is odd. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complex numbers from reals: this seems dodgy, while we can go easily go from pairs of reals to complex numbers, we do not get the additional multiplication structure. Personally I don't like this approach. In a lot of situations (analalytic, poles) complex numbers behave more like the reals than pairs of reals. My understanding of complex numbers improved a lot when I gave up thinking of complex numbers as pairs of reals and started thinking of them as an algebraic extension, sort of the number line with a bit more.</li>
<li>Random philosophical notes. Contrast between geometry and arthmetic, there is scope for a good treatment of this. I saw Atiyah give a great keynote speach on the link between the two along the lines that they are two side of the same coin and much of the best mathematics has happend when one has been transfered into the other.</li>
<li>(Off topic) Are numbers a real thing? There is a good history of people questioning various extensions, negative numbers, zero, irrationals (named because Descarte/Kroneker? though they were not a <i>rational</i> concept to hold), imaginary numbers (likewise name as a put down). Theres was a recient edit somewhere which addressed this but it was quickly deleted.</li>
<li>minuend, subtrahend two terms new to me, don't know if are common, not given any proper treatment.
<ul>
<li>Standard nineteenth century usage. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 21:07, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pedagogy (teaching). There is definatly a school of thought that one way to teach maths is a purely genarative, start with the most basic concepts (sets) and work up. Well it took Russle several thousand pages to get as far as the natural numbers using this aproach, and then we find that maths is axomatic after all Godel/ZFC.</li>
<li>Links. Mostly to authors own pages so OR.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So there is the germ of some good articles here, much is probably already covered elsewhere. Unconviced it is a coherent whole, or this article is a good starting point. --<a href="../../../p/f/a/User%7EPfafrich_c43f.html" title="User:Pfafrich">Salix alba</a> (<a href="../../../p/f/a/User_talk%7EPfafrich_40ba.html" title="User talk:Pfafrich">talk</a>) 19:30, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>What everyone agrees on is that the writing is, as per nom, convoluted. It is a POV fork (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_fork_a460.html" title="Wikipedia:Content fork">Wikipedia:Content fork</a>). The concept's principal author is also the article's principal author, Jonhays0 (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>). Because I find absolutely everything in the article is somewhere else, I deny merge. Until I see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> independent of Jonhays0, I say delete. I'm disappointed we've been serving as free web hosting to jonhay0's ideas since 2003. End this. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 20:51, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was created a long time ago with some combination of canon, non-canon anf fanon info... I think everybody (see the talk page) knew it should be deleted but didn't want to because they thought it could be useful.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Karnesky. It doesn't have to be canon, in the sense of appearing on-screen, but it should at least be official, as in having appeared in a licensed product. The Bajoran ranks, since they're so obviously based on US Army ranks, could stay, but, for example, the upper and lower Cardassian ranks look like pure conjecture. In those cases, we should leave spaces for them in the chart but omit the conjectural terms. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 17:07, 14 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
