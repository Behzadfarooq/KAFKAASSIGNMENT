<li><b>Comment</b>: As politely requested by JesusSaves, I have reread the article and admit that it is now in far, far better shape than before. That's good. However, I still don't see why John Larney is notable -- frankly, I don't think that scout leaders, even well-established and popular ones, are significant enough to merit articles on encyclopedias without some other accomplishments or, as the case might be, notoriety. I am not convinced by the two references we've been given, for reasons stated very well by <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> below -- I would like to add to that that I'm quite willing to believe that Mr. Larney served aboard the <i>USS Brush</i> during the early sixties, I just don't think that's particularly significant -- if he had he been the commander of the vessel, for example, that might be another thing. That's really my biggest problem here -- the lack of significance. I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but I just don't see why he merits an entry in an encyclopedia. There are lots and lots of scout leaders out there, and the vast majority of them are not notable enough for inclusion. That's not a criticism on them, it's just that of the well over six billion people living on this planet, a very small minority make enough waves in one way or another to merit an article about themselves. Is this guy a really major mover and shaker in the scouts? If he is, providing some solid references regarding his position and authority shouldn't be that hard. I have yet to see any. My vote to delete stands. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 00:19, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just looked up the term "sockpuppet" and I am deeply offended. I am a scout (as if you couldn't tell by the article) Our first Law is Trustworthiness. Each of these users are individuals who know the topic. The reason for thier not having many edits under thier belts is that in this area of the US it is not common to be an official Wikipedia "user".

<li><b>Delete</b>. Vanity/mild attack page for - I'm guessing - somebody's Boy Scout troop leader, with some bad-faith-looking efforts to confuse the issue in this Afd page, and by adding statements like "THIS MAN HAS A SIGNIFICANCE!", and references to apparently-nonexistent books to the article. In short, not to be too harsh, go play somewhere else please, we're trying to build an encyclopedia here. —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 00:09, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have added more to express his significance such as his reception of major awards and his military service. The line in question, "THIS MAN HAS A SIGNIFICANCE!", was to combat the speedy delete thing. I gaurantee this is not vanity nor am I attacking anything with this page. Just because you have not read a book doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Also not to be harsh, souldn't you have something better to do than wait around looking for articles to delete because you have no previous knowledge of the subject matter? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a> 01:16, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'd just like to make it clear that this is not in any way a vanity article, and I'd like to cite from Wikipedia's Vanity Guidlines:</li>
</ul>
<p>"An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity."</p>
<p>So, the sole fact that the search string "John Larney + boy scouts" only procures 21 hits on Google does not consitute a valid reason for the deletion of this article.12.76.164.157 03:01, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>If so all-powerfully influential in the BSA, you'd think he'd get more than 21 Google hits, wouldn't you? In any case, <b>delete</b> as vanity. Boys, there must be an easier way to earn a Merit Badge. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:39, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think we have already determined that vanity is not a reason for deletion. If you think we are trying to "earn a merit badge" we are all over 18 and therefore considered adult leaders. We do not qualify to earn badges. I suggest that you reread the "Civility" section on your talk page, Calton. You obviously haven't got the point even though many have brought it up. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.159.182.47.html" title="User:207.159.182.47">207.159.182.47</a> 02:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agreed. I suggest Carlton read over the "Wikipedia: Vanity" article again, since he clearly doesn't understand its contents at this point in time. Vanity is an invalid reason for the deletion of this article, and I find the deprecation of theBill and myself by Carlton to be completely unacceptable.12.76.164.157 02:59, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article has been cleaned up quite a bit now, and the bad faith nonsense is gone; that helps significantly.

<dd>I am an Australian Rover Scout, and although I believe that certain members of the world scouting communities hold a level of notablilty within the organisation and their home communities, I also believe that articles on Wikipedia for these people are unnecessary, barring <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Baden-Powell%2C_1st_Baron_Baden-Powell_15ed.html" title="Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell">Baden-Powell</a> and possibly some senior members of the World Scouting Organisation.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a>, you claim that one of the Scout Laws is trustworthiness.

<dd>If a source that is in wider circulation than the one already provided can be made known and verified by other users, and a notability in correspondance with the views I mentioned above can be proven, I personally would be willing to let this article remain.

<li><b>Keep</b> first off, i would like to make it completely clear that I am unfamiliar with the puppet lingo happening and am in no such form or fashion a puppet of any kind. and on the note of blaming <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a> for using these so called puppets, can you prove that the former comments were made by puppets? probably not, so if you can't prove it stop pointing the finger at others who are innocent until proven guilty. Now, to the point. Just because you have never heard of a certain person does not mean that they are not notable within their field. For example, my grandfather was the founder and president of one of the most succesful trade show companies in the U.S. and if you asked anyone in the field about him they would most likely know who he is. However, if you were to google his name there are very few hits, maybe a family tree and a bridge club. But this does not make him non-notable whatsoever.

<li>Looking through your rules it seems that the generally accepted mark for inclusion in Wikipedia is about 5000 fans/followers. John Larney has this number.

<li><b>Compromise</b>. It seems someone has decided to clean up the John Larney page. I appreciate the help. Now that it is closer to Wikipedia standards I propose a compromise. We keep the article similar to as it is now, that is cleaned up as apposed to how it was, and you stop trying to delete it. I think this is fair as there are hundreds of pages for Indie Bands and things that no one has heard of or cares about (this from a self-professed nerd who is interested in everything).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Have a look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for the criteria a band should meet to have a Wikipedia page. We delete probably hundreds of band "vanity" pages a month. No agreement has been reached on what the notability criteria are for modern-day biographies, so those are often decided on a more case-by-case basis. Now, personally, I don't think Mr. Larney is notable enough to merit a page in our encyclopedia. That's not an insult - I am not notable enough either, and neither is anybody I know. Others may disagree about notability here (there are some who think notability isn't a criteria at all), and <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> can be a useful tool in deciding cases like this as well.

<li><b>Keep</b>. "Meteu from Team Red Fox" brings up a good point. While vanity has already been disimissed as a nonissue, I think that Mr. Larney is noteable enough to justify such a biographical article. Its true that the article needs to be cleaned up, and is still a stub at this point, but I see no good reason to delete it. Bwithh, I agree with your proposition, and I think that as the article expands, it will become clear that his inclusion is justified.<a href="../../../b/c/a/User%7EBcaff_0e95.html" title="User:Bcaff">Bcaff</a> 21:51, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I agree that being an <a href="../../../o/r/d/Order_of_the_Arrow_4491.html" title="Order of the Arrow">Order of the Arrow</a> award winner isn't enough to merit inclusion in this encyclopedia. If that were so I would have a page along with over 100,000 other people. He is a DSA recipient wich is a very rare occurance. This is the highest award given by the Order. Imagine the prestigious Eagle Scout. It is completely worthless compared to the DSA. It is like the Medal of Honor for the OA. As this article expands it will become apparent that he is very noteworthy. TheBill 22:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes there have been 500 DSAs awarded over the last 65 years. During the Second World War which started in 1941 (for the US)there were 485 MOH recipients. That was in 4 years, much less than 65. Yet many MOH recipients have pages. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to degrade the MOH or say that a BSA award is just as good. I am trying to say 500 recipients in 65 years is rare. <a href="../../../2/0/7/User%7E207.159.182.47.html" title="User:207.159.182.47">207.159.182.47</a> 23:11, 17 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hoax???!!! Have you even looked at the page recently? Now that it has been cleaned up it is not even remotely mistakable as a hoax! That is just plain rediculous.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This article was obviously started as a joke, when you look at the history that is clear to see. But it has been cleaned up to actual information. In the Order of the Arrow, which is the honor society for the boy scouts and is in all actuality is an organization of its own, John Larney is a significant man. If this article was in its original form I would say delete it. But now it is a real article, and John Larney does have significance. To those who point out that they have never heard of John Larney, Ask you average joe boy scout who the adult head of the National Order of the Arrow is, Ask them who the President of the Boy Scouts is, most won't know those names either. You don’t have to know who someone is, for them to affect policies that have an effect on your life. As for the list of names that you think we should compare the worthiness of John Larney, I have never heard of any of them, and these are the so called people you are ok with. Also, the two examples I made the heads of the organizations, who hopefully you would even concede as being significant aren't even on your list for comparison. John Larney is active in a local lodge yes, but he is also active on a National level. As for the posters who think the 500 DSAs means they must not be all that important, because there are 500 of them, I must correct you. This is 500 people since 1940. There have been tens of thousands of people who have been in the Order of the Arrow, and even more in the Boy Scouts it self that do not have the award. It is the least likely award in the Order of the Arrow that you will recieve as a member. Finaly before I am bashed for this being my first post, I might add that I do use Wiki I just never bothered to type in it before. <small>{unsigned vote by User:Oa164}</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Of course people who know TheBill are going to come on here. Gee is it so hard to believe that the same people that know John Larney and the same people who know TheBill are going to overlap in some cases. Do I know TheBill, yes I know who he is. Did he put me up to this, no. Kind of proven by his wanting to know who I was. Someone told me that this page existed and I thought cool I look at it. That someone wasn't TheBill. I then saw it was marked for deletion. I read the comments, I checked out the history of the page. And yes all on my own. If you read my earlier statement I would have dropped the article in a second do to the fact that it had a lot of stuff in it that was pure nonsense, and insulting to John Larney, but not because John Larney doesn't deserve a real mention. What is there now is a real article. A stub, yes, that can easily be expanded on.<small>{unsigned comment by User:Oa164}</small></li>

<li>That is kinda creepy that you guys are watching my every move! I merely asked who he was because in the OA there is a sense of Brotherhood. In fact it is one of our three principles. Is it wrong to make new friends? Also, as you point out in the quote you took off the talk page, I am a lodge officer and have been active with the organization for years. I know a great many people. It could be someone I already knew. We have vast networks that allow arrowmen from across the country to meet but sometimes we get lost because there are thousands of miles between us. It could be a way to rekindle an old friendship. There are many arrowmen that I would not consider "friends". Get something better to do than yell "SOCK PUPPET" every time you find out I have a friend. Maybe some of you should invest in those. TheBill 16:30, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I move to have this discussion thrown out and start over as most of the delete votes are based on things that have either been fixed or discredited. The "nonsense" has been edited out.

<li><b>Let's have a look.</b> Source One is <a href="http://www.destroyers.org/smrdd/USS_Brush.html" class="external free" title="http://www.destroyers.org/smrdd/USS_Brush.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.destroyers.org/smrdd/USS_Brush.html</a>. This appears to be essentially a messageboard where anyone can add info that they, relatives or friends served on the USS Brush. From this, we learn Mr. Larney's email address and that he is "selling real estate". This page, apparently editable by all the world, is not a reliable source for establishing facts about Mr. Larney. Source Two is <a href="http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php" class="external free" title="http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ne1b.org/aboutus.php</a>, a page about the Norheast region of the Order of the Arrow. It does establish that Mr. Larney was awarded a DSA, and that he has staffed Section NE-1B's National Leadership Seminar (NLS). So that's a step in the right direction, I have to agree. At this point, the legitimately sourced info in the article is the following: "John Larney is a leader in the Boy Scouts of America associated with Old Colony Council and in particular Tisquantum Lodge 164 (249). He has recieved the Distinguished Service Award, the highest and rarest award given in the Order of the Arrow. John Larney has staffed numerous Order of the Arrow training sessions, including Tisquantum Lodge's annual Lodge Leadership Development (LLD), and Section NE-1B's National Leadership Seminar (NLS)." Trimmed down to that little info, you have to admit that's a pretty small page for an Encyclopedia. And there's not much hope for expanding it, that I can tell. Still, good-faith efforts are being made, and if you want to trim this article down to such a level, I'll retract my Delete opinion. (I'll probably change it to an Abstain -- I still don't think the page establishes notability, which still counts for me.) —<a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBunchofgrapes_bfbc.html" title="User:Bunchofgrapes">Bunchofgrapes</a> (<a href="../../../b/u/n/User_talk%7EBunchofgrapes_2633.html" title="User talk:Bunchofgrapes">talk</a>) 23:08, 18 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The point is not whether you can find webpages that mention John Larney and identify him as a Boy Scout leader who used to be in the Navy. We could find webpages that identify me as a math teacher who used to live in Africa. That doesn't mean there should be a Wikipedia article about me. Even though, as a math teacher, I affect hundreds of people's lives, and have power over their education, grades, etc, that doesn't mean I get a Wikipedia article. None of that is the point. The point is this: AFTER other sources write about a topic, THEN Wikipedia gets to. That's the most succinct way I can think to say it. Wikipedia just isn't where the very first article written about someone should be. If some other news source does a story on John Larney and why he's interesting, then Wikipedia can cite that source, and he's in. Until then, no. The sources that have been provided (4 links so far) confirm that there is such a man, and that he is who you claim he is - great. They aren't pages <i>about</i> John Larney, nor are they evidence that some segment of the world considers him all that notable. I'm just as well documented online as John Larney is, (and much less so than <a href="../../../p/h/a/Pharaoh_90.html" title="Pharaoh 90">Pharaoh 90</a>). It's nothing against the guy, he just isn't a suitable topic for a Wikipedia article.

<li>I'm gunna go out on a limb and say they'd about break even. I have certainly never heard of this Pharoah 90 fella before now. This would be an example of someone who is well know within thier own circut (anime watchers). To tell the truth I don't believe cartoon villans have a place in this encyclopedia as they affect absolutely nothing in the real world. That being said that is my personal opinion which I shall not try to oppose here because frankly I do not have the knowledge in this field to determine whether he is a major figure within that circut. I ask that those of you who have little to no knowledge of American Boy Scouting, or the Order of the Arrow specifically, to extend the same courtesy. The purpose of an encyclopedia is to inform people of topics that they have little previous knowledge. the inclusion of this article definatly fits that descrition as none of you have this knowledge and we shall inform you if it. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBill_4afe.html" title="User:TheBill">TheBill</a> 04:15, 19 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><i>Does lack of fame make a vanity article?</i> <b>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.</b> There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). <b>Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</b></p>
<p><i>Effectiveness of vanity articles</i> Vanity posters may post with the motive of increasing their own personal fame, or recognition of some group they are a part of. For this purpose, vanity articles are relatively ineffective. Most vanity articles receive few hits per month until nominated for deletion, and are possibly only seen by the user who nominates one. A vanity poster could theoretically increase traffic to his or her page by adding more links to it, and this is sometimes done — but it may risk earlier deletion of the page.</p>
