<li><b>KEEP</b> Explain to me why this page is constantly up for deletion. There has been a LOT of work done on this page and it seems silly to constantly go after it when Wikipedia can be improved by eliminating so many other articles which are sub-standard. I agree this page needs work, but it HAS had a lot of work done on it in recent months, and the constant attacking of this page feels like a personal affront to me and the time I have spent on this page. --Dr. Floyd 14:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. This type of page is the type that scares me most on Wikipedia. The amount of effort spent by the editors is apparent, but the subject itself is not encyclopedic. A frequent caller to a radio show? Is this what Wikipedia has degenerated into? I sincerely hope not. Peer editing is the greatest strength of Wikipedia and anyone who takes it upon themselves to create articles should be informed that it may be deleted before beginning an article. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> 15:05, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, Wikipedia is not a web host. If you want to go into obsessive detail about some caller to a radio show, do it on your own site. That's what people did before Wikipedia in what I call "the good old days."

The article is full of weasel words (e.g., "Some have believed that....", "If the personality of J.C. could be described in one phrase, that phrase might be..."). The Call Details section is the among the most egregious examples of <a href="../../../l/a/u/WP%7ELAUNDRY_19a2.html" title="WP:LAUNDRY">laundry list problems</a> I've ever seen.

<li><b>Keep</b> Good heavens! J.C. is more well-known than most Coast to Coast AM <i>guests!</i> J.C. is every bit a staple of Coast to Coast AM as, for example, Richard Hoagland. When the three clips played highlighting Art's career at his award ceremony, one was the Area 51 flier, the second was J.C., and the third was Red Elk. J.C. Is much more than "just a caller." People do searches on J.C. all the time, just to find out *anything* they can about this man. I would think the unique hit rate on this page alone would be of some merit. No matter, its important that there be <i>someplace</i> where this information is compiled. A new page has been posted, hopefully resolving some legitimate problems. Peace.

<dd><b>Comment</b> @Deepspire: Please keep in mind that many of the Wikipedia participants discussing <i>this</i> AfD are aware of the sock-puppeting that went on during the <i>1st</i> AfD discussion of this article. Anonymous, first-time, 1-issue posters strongly advocating a blatantly non-encyclopedic article tend to seem suspicious. If you wish to support this article, please add new sources that support the notion that the article's subject is notable. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> 17:44, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> @<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a>: I did miss the last AfD, and from what was described, I'm glad I did. I don't think this debate should be whether or not J.C, is "notable" enough. I don't want to get into that kind of debate because that will beg every imbicile with a pulse to come in here and clutter our serious discussion with nonsense "votes," peppered with insults. So far this discussion has had some intelligent thought, and I hope not to become flamed by others, but I have reverted my position somewhat. J.C. is <i>not</i> notable enough for an article of such magnitude. However, the sheer number of times J.C. is mentioned on Coast to Coast <i>does</i> merit a mention just to give people a quick idea of "who this J.C. is." I have posted a radically shortened page that I think better demonstrates what I mean. I've stripped it down about as bare minimum as I feel is appropriate.

<dd><b>Comment</b> @Deepspire: While I think your edits are definitely a step in the right direction in some sense, I respectfully disagree with your opinion that this discussion should not be about whether Jonathan Christian Webster is notable or not. It is my opinion that this discussion should very much center on whether the subject of this article is notable, and thus appropriate for an encyclopedia. Also, while your edits to the article's length are beneficial, the few sources listed within the article remain very worrisome. The first link is the website of the radio station that J.C. Webster apparently calls. The second link is a AOL home page with an extensive log of the calls made by J.C. Webster to the aforementioned radio station, which may be the source of this article's now-removed girth. The third link is for the "official" forum of the aforementioned radio station. I would posit that none of these links help to establish that J.C. Webster, nor his calls, nor his organization passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. What this article needs in order to be viable is some other <i>outside</i> sources that can cited to build a case that this person, J.C. Webster, is indeed notable. A great example would be some newspaper articles or some links to a local news broadcast discussing the individual. Of course, these types of traditional media are be no means the only way to demonstrate notability, but they sure are more convincing than a phone log.</dd>

<dd>My understanding of Wikipedia policy is that any article, be it a stub or a featured article <i>must</i> pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> or it should be removed. If an article is nominated for deletion based on a legitimate reason (such as the subject of the article failing <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>) then it must either be improved by editors or be deleted. I fully understand that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> does not equal "famous," meaning one may be notable for the purposes of Wikipedia without being a "famous person." However, even in that light, neither J.C. Webster nor his calling deserve a Wikipedia treatment. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> 20:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. I do not say this lightly, nor hastily. I apologize to everyone who solicited my help in keeping this article. I think the "keep" argument was more emotionally based, because this page had become a sort of "hub" for J.C. fans. But here's the problem. There is nothing <b>provable</b> about J.C. other than the fact he's anonymously been on <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> a number of times, and they want him back on for a possible "debate." Everything else about him is based solely on what J.C. has said himself. And while many things he's said may be the truth, we can't possibly <i>know</i> that it's the truth. For example, he claims to be "God's general," <i>and he probably believes it.</i> Therefore, how can we assume this "CLAMP" and "compound" business isn't also just more of his dreamed-up illusion? There's simply nothing that we <i>know</i> about him in any substantial and <b>provable</b> way. <i>(We can't even prove his <b>name!</b>)</i> Wikipedia has a standard that <b>must</b> be met in order to be able to be used as a reliable and respected source of information. Thus, until any of this "information" can be substantiated, there is no way this article can be kept and yet still remain within the bounds of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. However, that doesn't mean this article is dead forever. Any notable <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and verifiable <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources will work; court records and newspaper articles on CLAMP demonstrations, etc. If there is any truth to what J.C. has claimed, then there <i>WILL</i> be evidence like that scattered out there; especially in California. It might take some digging, but that's what it's going to have to take. J.C. doesn't deserve any notation here by Wikipedia's own important rules. One final note. I also couldn't help but notice that even the <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> website doesn't devote a page to J.C. Anyway, I've said my piece. Thanks for the discussion, everyone!

<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b>, and the call log should be put back in.

<li>It doesn't matter if what J.C. says is actually true. The fact that he says it makes it notable, and Wikipedia does not claim that it's actually true, only that he said it, which is provable. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 21:40, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I think the issue really being discussed was whether or not this individual is notable. Your comment carries the implication that because you feel J.C. Webster is notable, he must be so. The problem with this line of reasoning is that none of this individual's actions are verifiable via outside sources. I don't have a grudge against the fellow, but I've been doing some digging in my free time and I can't find anything about him. The (very helpful &amp; courteous) comments of Deepspire are evidence to me that some people are familiar with the subject of this article. But is there an argument in favor of keeping this article that is objectively strong? No disrespect intended, but you state that you strongly feel the article should be kept without giving a reason why that should be the case. It would be very helpful if you could explain your position and how it conforms to Wikipedia's content policies.

<li><b>Comment:</b> @<a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a>: I think you confused definitions like I did. There are two definitions of "notable." One being fame, i.e. "A notable caller." The "notable" we are refering to here means the ability to cite in a notation. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> was kind enough to point me in the right direction: <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. For a subject to be "notable," it <i>must</i> be attributable to "notable source." Just the "truth" that he's called and said things doesn't make it notable. And ironically, something entirely false <i>can</i> be notable. For example, the article stub I've trimmed down is "basic information," and while it all may be true, just my <i>saying so</i> doesn't make it notable. However, if I were also a reporter and wrote a piece for The Sacramento Post, or somewhere "notable" like that, saying exactly the same things, then those words have then become attributable to a "notable source," <i>even if my information was wrong.</i> So understandably, establishing notability is very important not only for terms of credibility, but also for legal reasons. That would be the only reason the <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Titor_c1ef.html" title="John Titor">John Titor</a> article has a place here. Notable sources have written about him. Otherwise, the "truth" boils down to that he was just an anonymous person who wrote a few posts claiming to be a time-traveler. That is what we have here at this point. J.C. is simply an anonymous caller into Coast to Coast AM, and until any "notable" things are said or written about him, or are found from archives somewhere, that is exactly what J.C. will remain. No one is trying to pretend that "J.C." doesn't exist, or hasn't made an impact of sorts on Coast to Coast AM. The <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coast_to_Coast_AM_b201.html" title="Coast to Coast AM">Coast to Coast AM</a> page here does make a mention of him, which for now is all that is appropriate.

<p>=To Scienter, I apologize for not responding earlier, I'm pretty busy this week. I personally believe that the fact that he called into a radio show that is widely listened to, making such controversial claims, makes him notable enough for Wikipedia, even though he has not been written about by outside sources. I understand that my position is not popular at this point, and I understand that the article is likely to be deleted. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 01:04, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
