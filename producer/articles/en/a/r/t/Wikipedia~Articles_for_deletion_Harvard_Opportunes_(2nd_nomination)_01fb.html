<p>The result was <b>delete</b>, recreation possible once some non-Harvard sources show up. Although not determinative here, I agree that it is at least questionable whether the school newspaper is an independent source when covering a school band.

<li><b>Weak delete.</b> I can't find any of their albums on Amazon (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_m/002-6165681-3268061?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;field-keywords=Let+it+Play&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_m/002-6165681-3268061?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;field-keywords=Let+it+Play&amp;Go.x=0&amp;Go.y=0&amp;Go=Go" rel="nofollow">my search for their most recent</a>). While they have apparently gone on an international tour, their music has not topped any charts, their albums are very difficult to find, and there are not enough independent, reliable sources (I do not consider the <i>school's own</i> newspaper an independent, reliable source) to create an article (many of this one's claims are unverified). It also appears that the Opportunes are not the oldest college a capella group. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 13:16, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To be fair, they don't claim to be the oldest one, just the oldest co-ed one (I made the same mistake at the first AFD). Still not notable though. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 13:42, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Rashida Jones and Anne Preven are both former members of the group that went on to fame. If the group's CDs from when these two were members are used to verify the article, will that satisfy the requirements that the article fails to meet at this time?--Amsuther 18:23, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, no sources providing notability, no real claim to notability. Re the question above, IMO the answer is no. The fact that the people you mention were in the group is pretty irrelevant, they did not form the group, the group did not split when they left. They just happened to be in the group whilst at college and that makes it no more notable than the Harvard Ping Pong Society would be if someone of note had happened to join. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 19:02, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Hornplease's arguments in the original AfD, showing that the Opportunes meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Notability particularly established in <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=100901" class="external text" title="http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=100901" rel="nofollow">this article</a>; also the subject of a few reviews<a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=144890" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=144890" rel="nofollow">[1]</a><a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=234100" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=234100" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> (more articles <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=opportunes+site:thecrimson.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=opportunes+site:thecrimson.com&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=0&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">here</a>).

(A truly non-independent source would be the group's own newsletter or website.) If the article contains information that is not verified by the sources, that is a reason for cleanup, not deletion. <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 21:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Is the award described in The Crimson impressive? Note that the award moved no journalist -- <i>including the author of that Crimson article</i> -- to write a profile of the Opportunes that we could use to write a Wikipedia article. I think we have to distinguish <i>claims</i> of notability (such as winning an award) from <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">actual notability</a>, which is a totally <i>practical</i> requirement: the existence of enough sources to write a good Wikipedia article. Whenever possible clean up, don't delete, yes. But which of the Crimson articles you linked to could we use to rewrite this article? <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 22:10, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I think the idea is that the award (Contemporary A Cappella Society of America's award for "Best Mixed Collegiate Song") <i>is</i> impressive — that's what moved them to write the article. The fact that no one wrote a comprehensive profile of the Opportunes (that is readily available via Google, at least) is in no way, and has never been, a criterion for <i>disproving</i> notability. I think that <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is formulated precisely to identify "actual notability", which usually (although not always) maps quite similarly onto "claims of notability". I think that many of the Crimson articles provide plenty of information for an article; certainly not an exhaustive one, but at least enough for a stub. And who's to say that another article - like a profile - won't turn up in the (near) future? <b><a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchi_5602.html" title="User:Schi">schi</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/c/h/User_talk%7ESchi_51f0.html" title="User talk:Schi"><font color="orange">talk</font></a></sup> 02:54, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per national awards, tours, appearances at White House and on Today Show, and Harvard Crimson article. A college paper which has an independent editorial board and has won national awards is absolutely not excluded as a reliable and independent source. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:16, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> I disagree; I believe that despite the best attempts, the writers are doubtlessly partial towards their own choral groups, sports teams, and organizations, and I am sure that some of these biases make it past the editorial board. However, this is beside the point. None of the <i>Crimson</i>'s articles really speak to any of this article's non-established claims (hence, claims in violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. As Pan Dan said just above your comment, we need to source all the claims in this article, at a bare minimum... and I'm still not at all convinced that it covers a notable subject. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 02:50, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> If the paper at Harvard is "partial towards their own," surely the papers in Boston or London are partial toward their own as well, but that does not exclude them as sources to establish notability. A newsletter published by a choral society would not be independent, but the Harvard campus paper is as independent as a paper in a town toward things in the town. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 03:26, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
