I believe that this was intended as vandalism, but oddly enough I've confirmed all of the titles as true, so redirection makes sense. Please note that the VfD boilerplate on the song pages was for all but Who's next (song) (I fixed it). Also not a candidate for speedy for the same reason.

<dd>I have to take issue with some of your google hits. <i>Victim "36 Crazyfists"</i> get alot of googles, but it appears most are not about the song. "Victim" appears in the name of many other bands that are listed on the same page as 36 Crazyfists in these hits. I see nothing notable about any of these songs, and I hate it when someone decides to write godawful articles on each and every song by their favorite band. These should still be deleted, even if not speedily. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:13, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It's true, and that really can't be helped. In that one case, I think we can assume that it's the same as the other songs on that (rare) album. Keep in mind we're talking about the songs from a rare, early album from a (now) fairly well published band. I think redirection is the way to go for this. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 23:20, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I disagree. There are perhaps millions of songs in existence; I do not think it is in the best interests of wikipedia to have articles, or even redirects, on the vast majority of them. I'm sure there is at least one other insignificant song named "Victim", for instance, out there somewhere, and I'd rather not give special treatment to 36 Crazyfists by having a redirect for their version. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:42, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>To Harmil, I thank you for consulting me on this VfD via my talk page, but I still feel that this artist just isn't that important. I agree with R. fiend's thoughts on song articles, and I feel that perhaps it would be a good idea to move them into one article, but I need further proof that this band is worthy of an article, otherwise I'll just vote it deleted. I think you should go ahead and make the article, and if you prove that it is worthy, it won't get deleted. I'm kinda torn on this one, sorry. -<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysekurity_5643.html" title="User:Mysekurity"><b>my</b></a><a href="../../../m/y/s/User_talk%7EMysekurity_22b6.html" title="User talk:Mysekurity">sekurity</a> 01:03, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>As to the redirect: I think most of these song titles are common enough that they'd need disambiguation. For instance, <i>Clone</i> is by <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avail.html" title="Avail">Avail</a> (see <a href="../../../d/i/x/Dixie_%28album%29.html" title="Dixie (album)">Dixie (album)</a>, <i><a href="../../../w/h/o/Who%27s_Next_a395.html" title="Who's Next">Who's Next</a>?</i> is a <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Who_01bd.html" title="The Who">The Who</a> album, <i>Victim</i> is by <a href="../../../g/z/a/GZA_59c1.html" title="GZA">GZA</a>, <i>In the skin</i> is a reasonable mistake for <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Simpson_3f53.html" title="Jessica Simpson">Jessica Simpson</a>'s <i>In this skin</i>, <i>Daydreams</i> by <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Crawford_97ac.html" title="Johnny Crawford">Johnny Crawford</a>, <i>Voices</i> by <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disturbed.html" title="Disturbed">Disturbed</a> (currently links to Voices (song), spuriously), <i>The box</i> by <a href="../../../o/r/b/Orbital_%28band%29.html" title="Orbital (band)">Orbital</a>, <i>Wake up</i> by <a href="../../../t/h/r/Three_Days_Grace_b388.html" title="Three Days Grace">Three Days Grace</a>, <i>The truth</i> by <a href="../../../g/o/o/Good_Charlotte_7c04.html" title="Good Charlotte">Good Charlotte</a>, and <i>Represent</i> by <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chingy.html" title="Chingy">Chingy</a>. Some of the song titles are probably unique, but I don't want to spend the time to find out which and even when that's done they won't remain unique forever. <a href="../../../l/i/z/User%7ELizardWizard_a997.html" title="User:LizardWizard">LizardWizard</a> 02:27, July 11, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Great, and good job with that research. I'm all for changing some of the redirects to be or point to disambig pages later. I'm only recommending redirects to the bands as a first-pass, which I think is a good start (see my suggestion for Voices (song) which has already had its info moved to the disambig page <a href="../../../v/o/i/Voice.html" title="Voice">Voice</a>). -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 16:18, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Redirect</b> per Harmil. If anyone thinks the band(s) aren't notable, VfD the bands. Since the bands exist on Wikipedia and aren't yet contested (so presumably notable), redirects aid in searching. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 09:20, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>I agree. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarthVader_1e48.html" title="User:DarthVader">DarthVader</a> 10:01, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's not about the bands being notable (we have a very low bar for bands, you may have noticed), it's about these songs. LizardWizard has pointed out the problem with unilaterally redirecting these to a minor band like 36 Crazyfists when many other bands have songs with the same name. And even if they didn't, I don't think there's a single other band on wikipedia that has article or redirects for every one of their songs, as we're on the way to doing for this band because of a single fanboy. If 36 Crazyfists has any "hits" that are somewhat noteworthy we can address those separately, but this is ridiculous. Shall I turn <a href="../../../c/e/n/Central_Nervous_System_be63.html" title="Central Nervous System">Central Nervous System</a> into a disambiguation page because its also the name of a song by <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citizen_Fish_b4c6.html" title="Citizen Fish">Citizen Fish</a>? -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:49, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nope, but an italized sentence at the top of the nervous system article wouldn't be a bad idea. If a band is notable enough to reside here, then, presumably, it is possible that any user might search for any of their songs. A user-friendly Wiki should accomodate these searches <i>to the extent practicable.</i> Massive disambiguation pages for common nouns isn't practical, but sending off redirects when they come to our attention seems practical to me. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:21, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I think that's an awful idea. "Notable enough for wikipedia" isn't necesarily terribly notable; we potentially have an article by every band that's ever released some sort of album. That's thousands and thousands of songs, many of which are common words, terms, things, people, etc. Implementing your plan would have thousands of articles with useless headers at the top, so the first thing the reader sees when looking up a significant topic is that some band from the 70's whom no one's ever heard of had a song with that name (is <i>that</i> what you were looking for? no? Just thought we'd ask.). As no articles exist on such songs, just redirects, there's no real information to go to. In the Central Nervous System example I gave, we're talking about a rather insignificant song by what not one of the world's premier bands (great band though they are). No one who doesn't already know the song is going to search for it (it's not as if it gets radio play), so they won't gain any information out of it. While wikipedia should be (and basically is) a good resource for music topics, it is not, and should not be, a "who's that song by again?" reference. We should instead have full articles on important songs. Many headers you propose would in fact have a list of a dozen or more bands who had songs with the same name, which would particularly interfere with the article. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:55, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Right, well, as I said, I'd impose a reasonableness test regarding practicality in cases where there were an inordinate number of songs with similar names or common names. I'm no music fan, generally, but if I looked up "Central Nervous System", I might be mildly amused/marginally enriched by learning about a song I'd never dream of. Such has happened before with the song about <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_K._Polk_65bc.html" title="James K. Polk">James K. Polk</a> written by <a href="../../../t/h/e/They_Might_Be_Giants_e0f7.html" title="They Might Be Giants">They Might Be Giants</a>. I still have little idea who this band is, but I continue to chuckle that they wrote a song about our dour 11th President. In any case, little headers at the top of articles are hardly disruptive; if you have no interest, they are very easy to ignore. I suppose I support any knowledge-connections that aren't too cumbersome. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where there are many songs with the same title, here's a possible solution. Imagine there are 50 songs named <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">Highway</a> -- at the top of the <a href="../../../h/i/g/Highway.html" title="Highway">Highway</a> article, one italicized sentence could read, <i>There are also many songs with this title. For more information, see...</i> and this could link to a song disambig page. Readers who cared would have a full list, others could easily ignore the one line. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 21:23, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It might be interesting to some, but its encyclopedic value is dubious, at best. And we are not here to "mildly amuse", but to mildly educate. It might not be terribly disrputive to have a header that Central Nervous System is a song by Citizen Fish, but wikipedia does have some first impression issues, and when that's the first thing someone reads when searching for that topic, it doesn't really help. Sure, it's interesting that They Might Be Giants have a song called <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_K._Polk_65bc.html" title="James K. Polk">James K. Polk</a> (and they're a pretty good band, give them a listen sometime) but I was still quite pleased to see there was no header on the President's page stating that fact; far down in the "trivia" section is much better. On a completley different note, now that we have mentioned our 11th President, I am hoping to get him official recognition as "America's <a href="../../../m/u/l/Mullet_%28haircut%29.html" title="Mullet (haircut)">Mullet</a> President". I hope you all endorse this. I'm thinking of making some T-shirts. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:40, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
