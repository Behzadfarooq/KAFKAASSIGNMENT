<li>Thank you for explaining your reason for nominating this for deletion. As a few editors and I have stated below, we do not believe that this promotes the organization. If you believe it is POV, then by all means, edit it to remove the POV, or at least tag it as being POV. Nominating for deletion is not the appropriate way of dealing with POV issues. If this article is to be deleted because mere mention of the organization and what it stands for makes this a "soapbox", then we would have to look at deleting <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Republican_Party_faa7.html" title="United States Republican Party">United States Republican Party</a>, and <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Democratic_Party_b5cb.html" title="United States Democratic Party">United States Democratic Party</a>, amongst many others. I don't want to promote this organization that attacks my family (I am legally married under the laws of Canada to my same-sex spouse), but Wikipedia should identify public organizations and what they stand for, even if we disagree with their agendas. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 13:44, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see nothing in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Problems_that_may_require_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Problems that may require deletion</a> that applies here. If you believe the article is POV, do what that page suggests and list it at <a href="../../../p/a/g/Wikipedia%7EPages_needing_attention_a7b2.html" title="Wikipedia:Pages needing attention">Pages needing attention</a> and/or apply the <tt>{{npov}}</tt> or <tt>{{POV check}}</tt> tags to the article. Or, better yet, <i>edit it yourself</i> to remove/fix what you perceive as POV. I've no idea what that might be, as I believe the article is NPOV, but go for it. I move to delist this nomination, as it's clear that the article will be kept and that the nomination was made under a faulty understanding of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> and/or <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a>.

<ul>
<li>I see. Then the issue you have is with me not so much as to why I chose the "VfD". Why was this article introduced here in the first place? If it has such a lasting presence and it's own web site, then why repeat it here? Hey, Mr./Ms. Android79, are you trying to "VfD" me? Ariele 16:15, 22 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Nothing is being <i>repeated</i> – the article should serve as an NPOV description of the organization, its goals, and its activities. That's <i>not</i> something you can get from its website, as anything put out by the group itself would be biased. Wikipedia is an <i>encyclopedia</i>. It contains information about people. places, and organizations, among other things. That someone chose to add an article about this particular organization should not be a problem, unless it's POV, in which case the problem's solution is clear: edit the article, not delete it. And, no, I'm not trying to "VfD" you, but you clearly have some fundamental misunderstanding of Wikipedia's purpose and/or its policies. (BTW, it's "Mr.") <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 16:25, Jun 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I have added info on their activities that show their "notability" (not that non-notablity is an accepted grounds for deletion). Part of the problem with Google is their unwieldy name, that may not be accurately reflected in media reports. Googling "Tradition, Family and Property" gets you 65,300 hits, which I think should fit within everybody's definition of notable. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 19:43, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>The above notes on activities are not related to a groups notability.

<li>My google test is not false. Of the first 100 links, 98 are related to the ASDTFP or its foreign affiliates. I didn't go further than that.

<ul>
<li>Sorry, but I don't think you understand how this works. Unless we all go through all 65k hits you claim are references to this organisation then you don't have proof of notability. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 09:11, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Axon, I encourage you to re-think your comments. I do not think that they are reasonable. I think that most people would agree that reviewing 66,000 weblinks is not a productive use of an active Wikipedia editor's time. I will spend that time making new contributions, copyediting, fixing links, and so on, instead of wasting it on a hugely time-comsuming exercise like that. <b>If</b> non-notability were an accepted grounds for deletion (which it is <a href="../../../f/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7EFame_and_importance_8fa9.html#No" title="Wikipedia talk:Fame and importance">not</a>), and <b>if</b> the Google test were accepted as an fair and accurate test of notability (which it is <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html#Validity_of_the_Google_test" title="Wikipedia:Google test">not</a>), <b>then</b> it might be worth spending time to determine if there were 500 or 1000 (or however many hits were accepted as the threshold) hits linking to this organization. But telling someone that they have to investigate all 66,000 is not in keeping with the spirit of Wikipedia, in my opinion. <s>-- at this point, I must stop in order to avoid an allusion to mental illness, which, as a personal attack, would violate Wikipedia etiquette.</s> In order to meet the 1,000 threshold, only 1.5% of the hits would have to be for this organization. I took a sample in which 98% of the hits were for this organization. I think that should be sufficient evidence. What we have here is a verifiable, NPOV article about a real organization with numerous members. We do not have accepted grounds for deletion, your unreasonable demands for excessive verification notwithstanding. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 28 June 2005 13:20 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without wanting to get into a lengthy debate about wikipedia policy, notability is relevant for deciding what is and isn't simple promotion/advertising and for determining what is and isn't encylopaedic, and the google test, whilst not definitive, is a good rule of thumb for determining notability. With this in mind, I stand by my vote and my remarks here. No ammount of hand-waving, childish references to my mental state or flawed intepretations of google results will change my mind. Others are free to interpret my remarks and vote as the feel. <a href="../../../a/x/o/User%7EAxon_275a.html" title="User:Axon">Axon</a> 28 June 2005 13:45 (UTC)</li>
<li>I will withdraw my inappropriate and unnecessary remark. I still would like to know why you really think it is a good use of a Wikipedia editor's time to investigate 66,000 links on a google test. More importantly, if you're going to live by the sword, you also have to die by the sword. If you accept the Google test as a "good rule of thumb", then I think you have to change your vote. I have shown a Google test that, if only 1.5% of the reuslts are links to this organization, "proves notability". I have also undertaken a large sample that shows that 98% of those sampled did. I don't think that you can rejecting this analysis on the basis that I did not invest several days in checking every link. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 28 June 2005 17:32 (UTC)</li>

<li>Megan, if you think that the article reads like a promo, please state how, or edit the article yourself. Several people here have made that broad claim, but no-one has provided any specific reference to any part of the article that is POV. If someone were to do so, we could arress the issue properly. It really sounds like some people want to delete the article because this is a heinous organization, rater than because there are problems with the article. And please check this search: <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?biw=1003&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22Tradition%2C+Family+and+Property%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?biw=1003&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22Tradition%2C+Family+and+Property%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>, which produces 66,800 hits. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> 08:34, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Doesn't promote organization. Organization is clearly old and large. I find the VfD absurd 70.105.188.134</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, not a promo. We have no hope of building NPOV if things like this are deleted. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 22:07, 26 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> not a proper VfD candidate, it is a notable organization with POV removed.--Hooperbloob 28 June 2005 12:29 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I kept expecting it to be really POV, but it's not. If it were, it would just deserve the NPOV tag, not a VfD. I am guessing that I don't share politics with this organization. To those who invoked the KKK, remembered <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin's Law</a> and just go ahead and invoke the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi_Party_3bfc.html" title="Nazi Party">Nazi Party</a>. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 30 June 2005 15:41 (UTC)</li>
