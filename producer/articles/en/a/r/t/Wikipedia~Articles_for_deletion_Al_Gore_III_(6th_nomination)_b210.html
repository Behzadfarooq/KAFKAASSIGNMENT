<p>I believe that this article should be deleted because the subject is non-notable. <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a> is very notable, but his son hasn't really done anything himself. Right from the article: "He is best-known for being mentioned in an emotional vice-presidential nomination acceptance speech by his father during the 1992 Democratic National Convention." He was also arrested for a misdemeanor, committed a traffic violation, and worked for a non-notable magazine. If we had an article for every person who got a ticket or had a job, we'd have a lot of pages. I mean, we already DO have a lot of pages, but... I think you get my point. <a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 15:24, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

I agree with the contention that Al Gore III's notability stems entirely from his father. However, <i>events in his life have affected his father</i>, and so those events <b>do</b> have notability. Until he does enough to be notable in his own right, any information about him belongs on his father's page.

<li><b>Keep</b> I think you are confusing "historical importance" with verifiability. Notability, for inclusion in Wikipedia, means that the subject has been referenced in "multiple, non trivial sources". The article is well referenced, and non of the sources are trivial. Trivial would be a blog or a telephone directory. Also for this vote to be valid, a link must be provided to the other 4 votes for deletion. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichard_Arthur_Norton_%281958-_%29_421a.html" title="User:Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )">Richard Arthur Norton (1958- )</a> 16:35, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>merge</b> or just redirect, either will do. Clearly not independently notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> I don't know that this person warrants an article at this time, however, the information itself is reasonable to include in his father's page.

<li>Please note that the mere existence of multiple works on a subject hasn't always been enough in the past: the articles must also have something to say about the subject, and none of the articles about Gore III seem to do so. As precedent, I'd offer other AFDs for otherwise non-notable celebrity children, including <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Sean_Preston_Federline_3cc5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sean Preston Federline">Sean Preston Federline</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Brooklyn_Beckham_2f81.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Brooklyn Beckham">Brooklyn Beckham</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Maddox_Jolie-Pitt_194d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Maddox Jolie-Pitt">Maddox Jolie-Pitt</a>, etc. Gore III isn't an infant, but he seems equally non-notable outside of the context of his father (at least to my eyes). -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hmm - I don't know about that, but it seems to me that the criterion of <i>Somebody finds them notable to cover in the press</i> is a far more NPOV criterion for notability than <i>I don't think they're important</i>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 18:52, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, it's tough to decide but I side with the non-subjective notability people here, and that notability&#160;!= significance. It seems like he shouldn't be notable, but he has been. Partly that's his political-child foibles like getting arrested. Partly that's his dad's fault for constantly telling the story about the accident.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Al Gore III is notable for several reasons. He is the son of a very vocal former Vice President, who refers to his son in his speeches and movies. And the son comments on his father's future ambitions and he edits a magazine that is a advertisement for Al Gore. And finally, I vote to keep per Richard Arthur Norton and isn't this like the fifth vote on this topic and <b>keep</b> keeps taking the day?--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetaway_687a.html" title="User:Getaway">Getaway</a> 20:21, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If all it took to get an article here were public comments on Al Gore's ambitions, then <i>I</i> should have an article, and the magazine, whatever its subject matter, is a non-notable not-for-profit publication with a claimed subscriber base of 11,000. Also, this is a discussion, not a vote, and only one of the previous five AFDs on the article was closed with a consensus to keep. A second was closed with no consensus, and the other three were immediate procedural closes by an administrator. It hasn't been discussed in this venue in about six months, which doesn't seem like an unreasonably short amount of time. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 21:05, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You <b>are</b> aware that the section you quote refers to the merits of a subject changing with new information or wider prominence. That policy, come to that, addresses the situation more pertinent here, that of persistent hammering at existing consensus by dissidents who just plain don't like it: "At times, a group of editors may be able to, through persistence, numbers, and organization, overwhelm well-meaning editors ... Enlarging the pool will prevent the railroading of articles by a dedicated few. In the case of a small group of editors who find that their facts and point of view are being excluded by a larger group of editors, it is worth considering that they may be mistaken." Your constant and verbose advocacy on this AfD isn't, IMHO, doing your cause much good.

<li>I see your point, but I'm not sure that I agree with your examples. Prince Harry is a member of a royal family, and the current consensus seems to be that royals are intrinsically notable. The Hitler example is a better one, but I'm still not convinced, since Hitler is substantially more important than Gore when considered from a historical standpoint. I mean, Hitler was the top leader of his country for more than ten years, as well as the instigator of one of the largest conflicts in world history. Gore has a lot of work ahead of him if he wants to meet that standard, y'know? -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 21:54, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Why do people keep talking about continuous nominations? There have only been two AFDs on this topic that went full-term, it's been almost six months since the last one, and I wasn't the nominator for either one of 'em. If you think he's notable for whatever reason and that it should be kept, that's great. I disagree with you, but this is Wikipedia, where disagreement falls somewhere between food and oxygen. Just make sure you're basing your argument on something real instead of on some bizarre abstract point about the number of past nominations. The only real value in any past nomination comes from reading it and using those opinions to help form your own. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 17:05, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It also hurts your cause because it makes you look less than neutral in your editing and your sponsorship of deletion.

<dd>As I noted in an earlier comment, an AFD is a discussion, not a vote. What kind of a discussion doesn't include responses to other people's comments? If we're all just going to sit here and keep our opinions in little boxes, why even bother to post in the first place? If anything, discussion is needed more on this article than on the average one, since there's so little past consensus on the subject. The ancient VFD was deadlocked 5-4 in favor of deletion, the most exhaustive AFD closed without consensus, and there are reams and reams of discussion on the article's talk page since the last AFD, with people voicing basically every opinion under the sun (keep it as it is, keep the article but remove the arrests, add the arrests to Gore's article and convert this one to a redirect, delete it outright, etc.). I could've just Boldly Merged the article with Al Gore and had done with it, but I wanted to have one last go at establishing an actual consensus one way or the other. -<a href="../../../h/i/t/User%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_a176.html" title="User:Hit bull, win steak">Hit bull, win steak</a><sup><a href="../../../h/i/t/User_talk%7EHit_bull%2C_win_steak_cdd1.html" title="User talk:Hit bull, win steak">(Moo!)</a></sup> 18:42, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Re: the Jeb Bush Jr. analogy. It's not a valid comparison, since Gore's son has been mentioned in numerous media outlets and referenced, albeit in a peripheral way, in notable published books over the course of a decade or longer. Merely being in the media spotlight for a brief period of time isn't equivalent to being the subject of numerous articles, news broadcasts, etc., over the course of a number of years. Granted, all of these citations reflect mostly upon the national prominence enjoyed by his father, but I don't think that necessarily makes him less notable as an individual. <a href="../../../r/u/t/User%7ERuthfulbarbarity_f647.html" title="User:Ruthfulbarbarity">Ruthfulbarbarity</a> 05:39, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That reason is that people keep nominating it without comparing it to the deletion criterion, and it's then kept by editors who are more careful in their checking of whether the article is appropriate or not. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:20, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Hahaha. Harold Stassen reference. I like that. In all seriousness though, this is getting a bit absurd. In terms of the children of well-known politicians Gore's son is certainly notable.

A better comparison-rather than Jeb Bush Jr.-would be to <a href="../../../n/e/i/Neil_Bush_d980.html" title="Neil Bush">Neil Bush</a>.

<ul>
<li>Actually, instead of comparing to children of U.S. Presidents, you should compare to children of failed presidential candidates or of vice presidents. There is a great deal more notability in being the child of an actual president (and thus part of the "first family") than there is associated with simply being the child of a well-known politician. Maybe William H. Mondale should get an article if Al Gore III has one. —<a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoug_Bell_8398.html" title="User:Doug Bell">Doug&#160;Bell</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoug_Bell_81b5.html" title="User talk:Doug Bell">talk</a></sup> 16:38, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
