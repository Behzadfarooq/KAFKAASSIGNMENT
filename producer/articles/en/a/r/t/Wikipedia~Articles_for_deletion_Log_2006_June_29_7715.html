<li><b>Comment</b>, well, there used to be a Southeastern Massachusetts Technical Institute - it became a UMASS campus at some point. I also noticed several foreign references to MIT as Massachusetts Technical Institute - sort of a bad translation. Not that any of that helps.

<li><b>Comment</b> To be one of 100 acts at a large festival isn't really that distinctive. Have they actually had a national tour, or have they played a bunch of clubs in different places? What exactly did the magazine say about them ("have been featured in" is awfully vague)? They may be on the cusp of being notable (many bands are), but I don't see anything to say they're there.

<li>For every country, the best surf breaks are a combination of common knowledge/shared wisdom among participants in the sport. That is going to be reflected in the references (i.e. surfing guides, etc.) and seems to be reflected in the lists at present. For example, the France list now lists three surf breaks, Denmark two. It is a relatively simple matter to set some simple standards and require a decent reference for list inclusion, preferably with a short description. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 00:17, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless you can come up with a numerical formula people will always argue. Any listing of "Top Ten footballers/cricketers, etc..." will have different names depending on the critic, regardless of the "common knowledge/shared wisdom" amongst the pundits. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 00:39, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm not at all sure what you are implying by "numerical formula". I do note that WP:List, the list guideline page, makes no mention of any requirement for math or equations. These lists do not seem to be top-ten lists or rankings, so I fail to see any similarity with a top-ten list of footballers. That would be a completely different subject and approach. The lists should have set inclusion criteria supported by references (i.e. the pundits who write books and guides to surf breaks). Having said that, argument/discussion often leads to good articles. That is partly the purpose of the article talk pages. --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:01, 5 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As theoretically any piece of open water can be used for surfing, you'll need a criteria for including "notable surf-breaks" otherwise the list will be infinite and uncompletable - how can you rank them in an objective manner?<b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">rant-line</a> 01:15, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Firstly, your statement that any "piece of open water can be used for surfing" is completely false. Following that logic, any open field could be used for golfing. Or any inclined surface with snow could be used for skiing. Yet, we have guides to ski slopes and golf courses that do not include every grassy area, or every hill and trail. Secondly, as I said before, these articles at present are not rankings. They are lists of well-known surf breaks. How do we know they are well known? Because they are included and discussed in guides from leading publishers and I have already provided links to some of these reference works. As with any article, "objectivity" derives from the validity of the references used. Inclusion criteria is a matter to be hashed out among the list editors on the talk pages. Finally, neither "infinite" nor "completable" are valid objections. At present the lists are quite short and far from "infinite". Like ski slopes and golf courses, major surf breaks are not infinite. Regarding "completable", the lists are just as completable as any other article here (none of which is ever really complete). If the topic was not completable, or infinite, as you have implied, it would be impossible to write cogent magazine articles or guides to surf breaks. Yet those works are written and published. They are not prefaced with warning notices as to their incompleteness and the surf breaks discussed are not chosen at random. They reflect where surfers congregate to surf- just like our lists (whose main shortcomings, as far as I am concerned, are the lack of refs at present). --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:38, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I didn't want to put it up for a speedy because I think that there may have been possible validity to the song being notable and thus wanted a discussion to bring that out. As per the guidelines for notability of songs as per <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> I feel that this song itself would not merit it's own article and should be merged into the Shirelles article if it was, in fact, notable but I also recognize that the song notability guidelines are still in the proposal stage.

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidG_2ba7.html" title="User:RidG">User:RidG</a> I appreciate the fact that you are trying to keep wikipedia pure, but don't let your own biases keep this unique, and desperately needed article from existing. Also information is always evolving and expanding, so trying to keep information a certain size is impossible. Wikipedia needs to grow, and if a missing article exists, it needs to be created.{{--<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen414_21d0.html" title="User:Ben414">Ben414</a> 03:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)|Ben414}}</li>
<li>Ben - I don't know if I agree with your allegation of "bias," and I certainly don't agree with your statement that this is a "desperately needed article."

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't think this list is an indiscriminate list of info- it's a very specific list, one with a finite number of entries, each of which sharing an important quality (unlike "List of songs with the word 'song' in the title, or something like that, in which the shared quality is highly trivial). I think this list is quite useful- moreso than the vast majority of lists on WP. Obviously, the list has to be highly expanded (including placing the "expand" tag on the article), but it could easily become an excellent list. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:22, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but this is attempting to serve as a list for play on the <i>same</i> PS2, as opposed to online networking; in addition, instead of adding categories for 2-, 4-, 8-, x-player games, I like the idea of having them all in one place.

<li><b>Keep</b> This list is more detailed than the article for the list of ps2 network games, and I doubt will ever get as long as the generic list of PS2 games which is not contested.</li>

<p>This is a list that may not apply to those who contest it, but those who do like having gaming get-togethers would find this list extremely useful. It is more useful in that the users know immediately that these games would be beneficial for them.</p>
<p>As stated again, and again, wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and it needs to grow, and be home to items that are organized in a useful way.</p>
<p>The alternative is aimlessly reading the descriptions of all ps2 games from wiki, which only states one player, or multiplayer. Multiplayer is as much a number as over is a direction; vague at best.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> (without reservation but with melancholy, read if you care). I came across this article while reviewing the sourcing or lack thereof in the "hyphenated-Americans" lists. After reading this article it is clear that it fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I have prodded a few others along the way for same reason. The melancholy results from reviewing the lists and seeing massively long lists for some ethnic groups. The natural (and everywhere but WP, commendable) reaction would be to note and extol "heroes" of one's ethnicity, and where there are fewer perhaps elevate some otherwise non-notable people to article status. I know I felt this way growing up Latino in a predominantly Anglo society. I'm sure I wasn't alone in that feeling. So, while the result (delete) is clear, my feelings are decidedly mixed. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 16:30, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Article is not vain, nor a geneaology; we have plenty of name articles with diverse content; we don't delete stubs for being stubs; and there's a huge difference between "unverified" and the capital offense of "<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a>".

<dd>You can argue lots of things.

<p>Disclaimer: I did add content to this page, although I didn't initiate it, and I suspect that it's me that you're accusing of being POV. At the time I edited it, I was a Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems, specialising in system availability and its effect on users, so I claim some degree of expert knowledge. I do agree that the phrase has a poor google showing, and I'm somewhat surprised at that; I had heard the phrase used by a wide variety of people in the computer industry, including marketing types, at the time I first visited the page.</p>
<p>A significant use of the phrase is in a paper from Borland: <a href="http://bdn1.borland.com/borcon2004/article/paper/0,1963,32145,00.html#_Toc81733447" class="external free" title="http://bdn1.borland.com/borcon2004/article/paper/0,1963,32145,00.html#_Toc81733447" rel="nofollow">http://bdn1.borland.com/borcon2004/article/paper/0,1963,32145,00.html#_Toc81733447</a> Their explanation of the myth is rather broader than mine, but the thrust is the same, and it is significant that they are using the same phrase. Another published reference is <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/69/04714302/0471430269.pdf" class="external free" title="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/69/04714302/0471430269.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/69/04714302/0471430269.pdf</a> which seems to be part of an important textbook, although I can't quite make out which one!</p>
<ul>
<li>It appears to be from the 2nd edition (or draft thereof) of <i>Blueprints for High Availability</i>. The phrase does not appear in the same place in the 1st edition from 2000. I have a signed copy. Call me geek.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the phrase is taught in the college lecture <a href="http://www.pld.ttu.ee:81/IAF0030/lec/lec1.pdf" class="external free" title="http://www.pld.ttu.ee:81/IAF0030/lec/lec1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pld.ttu.ee:81/IAF0030/lec/lec1.pdf</a> So the phrase does have industrially significant published references and I (as an expert) can attest that it is used in the industry. I suggest that it is little known because it is an obscure corner (the intersection of engineering and user experience) of an abstruse field (systems availability management), but that doesn't mean it isn't important to those who deal in such matters.</p>
<p>I do agree that it's a scruffy article. The section on evaluating nines (did I add that bit?) is a repeat of information in several other articles, and should be replaced by a cross-reference.</p>
<p>I'd like to keep the article and I offer to take the published sources I cite above and synthesise them into a better version. I'll do that ASAP, anyway.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> In order to demonstrate notability, I've listed some of the books Ironside authored, as well as three biographies written about him, and added a little text to the body.

Keep voters - please note that Wikipedia is not a TV news channel, and that "interesting"/"human interest" is totally insufficient for notability in an encyclopedia. Regarding the relation to the "Missing White Woman" comparison - the FIRST time this comparison is made for the disappearance of a black woman is probably sufficiently notable in itself. But if this comparison comes up every time a black woman or white woman or any other woman disappears, are we to include every single one of these cases as articles just because the news media needs "talking points" each time to cover their asses? <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 01:20, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> We all agree to the following :the word "Stereotype" should be clearly defined. The American Media is widespread. Wikipedia should say (even though it's obvious) that the American media reflects social attitudes of the general public, and therefore stereotypes. Life reflects art reflects life. If we all agree on these things, this article is redundant. There should be only a page called <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stereotype.html" title="Stereotype">Stereotype</a> and each ethnicity should have it's own page filled with facts.- <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowyCaballero_078e.html" title="User:ShadowyCaballero">ShadowyCabal</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with your overall point, but part of the problem is that it's unreasonable to pin down a definition on "Stereotype" to begin with as it would only serve to reflect the bias of the editor. And the idea that art reflects life is unproven, and in my opinion, unprovable, but the article does assert that, "As art is often a reflection of society, these stereotypes can be said to represent American society's dominant view of ethnic groups." Words like "often" and "can be said to represent" seems to invalidate this whole assertion. Basically this sentence reads that "sometimes art reflects society and sometimes it doesn't." And if this assertion were more strongly worded it would undoubtedly be unreasonable as it can certainly be argued that art does not always reflect life. On a personal level, of course, I acknowledge that many of these stereotypes are real and the media does reflect (in many cases) the attitudes of the public. I just don't think these assertions can reasonably be made in an encyclopedia.--Derco 21:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - I don't think my opinion will surpise anybody, but I have to agree with ShadowyCabal. In my mind this article will never be factual enough for an encyclopedia. There is no definitive test for what is or is not a stereotype, and thus this article will by necessity always be based on the editor's opinion. The contradictory nature of many of the listed stereotypes (for example that black people are either not macho or macho) seems to illustrate this problem. Furthermore, the "references" that this article cites are not reliable (at least not all of them are - the one with in the black stereotype section at least seems to be based on some sort of study). MANAA, for example, simply lists what it deems to be stereotypes. The Andrew Ma article does the same. These articles are based on nothing more than opinion. I for one don't see how these sources are any more reliable than if I made a website and linked to it. Also, individual movies are used often in the article but make poor evidence; for every movie that follows a stereotype, another may disprove it. Even if the sources are all made reliable, I still think that it is a leap on the editor's part to decide what constitutes a stereotype and what does not. In short, I do not see a way in which this article can ever be completely factual or NPOV, and therefore I think it should be deleted. For anyone who suggests keeping it, I would ask they explain how it could possibly be cleaned up into a suitable article as I for one do not see a way.--Derco 01:11, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Stereotypes are subjective matters, true, and there will always be controversy over what is a stereotype. However, there is no rule that Wikipedia must shy away from controversies and that Wikipedia can only cover objective truths. The rule that applies, however, is that all sides of the controversy be given equal weight (<a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>). There has been plenty analyzed and written about stereotypes, the task WP places upon itself is to represent what is out there. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 05:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I understand that Wikipedia can and does tackle issues that involve controversy. My point is that I feel that the very nature of this subject makes it ill-suited to tackle in an encyclopedia. Even if it were rewritten, I do not personally feel that all sides of this issue can or will be presented. Not to mention that this subject is, in my opinion, far too broad for an encyclopedia entry and, as someone mentions later on the page, is basically an invitation for use as a soap box. As far as I can see, almost every source that can be found on this topic will involve one person's opinion, which is no more valuable really than my opinion. So either the editor will have to decide what is or is not a stereotype, or the article will have to be reduced to "such and such says that the nerdy Asian is a stereotype." The former option (as the article is now, pretty much) seems to be in violation of original research or NPOV, and the latter would seem to involve generally irrelevent assertions that do not belong in an encyclopedia either. Forgive me if that did not make sense as I am having a hard time of communicating exactly what I want to.--Derco 21:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete. Do Not Rewrite.</b> An embarrassingly poorly authored and badly referenced article given the apparent seriousness of intent. I do not normally vote for delete based on simply an article's poor quality though, and I am not doing so here. In this case, I believe that the article is not recoverable even after a rewrite. Besides Derco's concerns which I share, I would argue that the subject "Ethnic Stereotypes in American Media" is much too large and unwieldy and awkward for a reasonable encyclopedia article. In addition, the subject implies that such ethnic stereotypes are both a special category in themselves and somehow inherent to American media production (perhaps a POV assertion of inherent racism?) , when it is more accurate to say that <i>stereotypes</i> and <i>cliches</i> of all kinds are inherently widespread in media production throughout all cultures and throughout history for just about every kind of situation and character. All these stereotypes are not created by media but are reflections of ideas held socially - negative, positive, more or less accurate or inaccurate etc. but struggling and in flux - that are reproduced and circulated in media. Neither <i><a href="../../../b/i/r/Birth_of_a_Nation_3d78.html" title="Birth of a Nation">Birth of a Nation</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Clansman_6e69.html" title="The Clansman">The Clansman</a></i> are the root cause of racism against blacks in the US. Content about mass media representations of ethnic stereotypes belong in the articles on the the ethnic groups, which can properly approach the subject from the perspective of the social history of the group and identify when and where ethnic stereotypes have been really notable and important in reflecting the history of the group (and properly use media references as part of the evidence for these explanations) rather than the strange, befuddled approach of treating media stereotypes as significant in themselves and detached from social history that the afd article subject encourages.

<li><b>Comment</b> There is already a related list at List of stock film roles based on ethnic stereotypes (branched off from <a href="../../../e/t/h/Ethnic_stereotypes_in_popular_culture.html" title="Ethnic stereotypes in popular culture">Ethnic stereotypes in popular culture</a> I believe, and then merged with another list), which I think shows the problem with making this into a list. None of it is sourced, and it is completely subjective. In my opinion a simple list would be worse in some ways in that it removes even the element of explanation as to why something has been classified as a stereotype. At the very least it would be rather redundant with that list.--Derco 21:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is an extremely important topic. It's true that stereotypes and racial issues can be subjective. However, they are valid intellectual topics worthy of an encyclopedia entry. If they weren't, why do so many reputable universities have entire departments and majors devoted to such issues? I agree this article in particular could use some reorganization and a lot of work. Perhaps each ethnic stereotype should have its own page (as each ethnic group's stereotypes probably have enough content to warrant separate articles, and the stereotyping isn't always so directly nor exclusively related to media necessarily) in addition to one from a media perspective. From doing research myself, I can assure you that there are many many reputable scholarly articles and books regarding racial stereotypes, and that stereotypes are not all just random qualities that random Wikipedians thought up haphazardly and pasted on this site. As for problems about neutrality, I would like to reiterate Wikipedia's suggestion of presenting all different points of view to achieve balance. I feel that deleting this article and therefore accessable information about this entire subject would be hasty and a loss for Wikipedia; I would instead advocate for putting in extra effort to rework the article to bring it up to Wikipedia's standards.<a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrenched_2204.html" title="User:Drenched">Drenched</a> 05:23, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: I think that the page should be kept up, but it definitely needs to be trimmed down a bit and re-worked on to a certain extent (as others have mentioned). Various regions and countries portray different ethnic groups within some or most of their media through stereotypes, but the North American media is way more international than almost any other region or country around the world (this aspect has to be repeated). These representations can and do very much have a crucial impact, on how "the self" sees "the other" and how the "the other" sees themselves. This article can also provide a better understanding of how these depictions shape and have shaped ethnic and race relations, in and between American society and the rest of the world today as well as throughout history. Furthermore, considering that the US (especially) is a world superpower, how much of its media portrays different ethnic groups (both inside and outside of its borders) is of extreme significance. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilver_crescent_deb6.html" title="User:Silver crescent">Silver crescent</a> 01:52, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Further, this child is named after a <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Dickinson_Baker_1bfd.html" title="Edward Dickinson Baker">notable friend</a> of Lincoln's, which also helps flesh out the Lincoln article without adding to the main article's length. <a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJokestress_f864.html" title="User:Jokestress">Jokestress</a> 15:45, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Lotsa other presidents' family members' articles in need of removal, too-- I think Tyler alone had 15 kids (not including the disputed ones). At the very least, maybe you can come up with a precedent that would apply to all presidents, like a standardized family/genealogy page or something, that would allow these biographies a place on the project without cluttering up already overlong presidential articles. Richard Nixon's brothers are concurrently getting the axe, too, and I'll bet his mom and dad aren't far behind.

<p>The result of the debate was as follows:</p>
<p>Premature closing due to Speedy Delete criteria G7 (author requests deletion). As this is information based on a fanfiction without verifiability (and no direct google hits outside of Wikipedia itself), and the author of the material discussed is demanding deltion, I believe this falls under speedy deletion easily. Moreover, the clear concensus is delete. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 06:01, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article purports to describe a fictional planet. It cites no sources at all and gives no clue as to the work of fiction involved. I can find no sources, either.

<li>Note that it is less important, from the points of view of Wikipedia editors, how and why your brother came to write this article, and more important that the only way for readers to verify the contents of this article would be for them to burgle your house and sneak a peek at your unfinished manuscript. The reason to delete this article is that it is unverifiable, not that it may or may not be a misrepresentation. After all, the fact that it is unverifiable encompasses the fact that the rest of us are <i>unable to tell whether this article misrepresents a plot element of your book</i>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:43, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I didn't say that its nature was ambiguous. I said that the article "gives no clue as to the work of fiction involved". Remember that the <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Star Wars universe</a> comprises a rather large number of works of fiction. At the very least, an article on a planet in a fictional universe (especially one that has become a franchise) should give some indication of <i>which</i> works of fiction involve that planet.

<li>If you wish to make to make an accusation of sockpuppetry, just go to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFCU_026f.html" title="WP:RFCU">RFCU</a> to prove so. Don't get in a rough discussion over it. I have looked over this article quite a few times, and this is quite frankly one of the toughest calls I have seen on AfD. The nominator remarks that this page is about a non-notable person and possible vanity. I actually was curious about the comments made about the nominator and was quite surprised by what I had found. On Haham hanuka's talk page there are warnings regarding: personal attacks and just a bad history. Haham also accuses many users of being sockpuppets without any discussion or anything or pursuring the issue further<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Doron_Sabag&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61357472" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Doron_Sabag&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=61357472" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>.

That is my rationale for thinking that this is a possible bad faith nom. Now back in regards to this article, I do believe that there is enough notability for this person, and I really don't think that vanity exists. The subject of the article has his importance asserted and it appears that importance, albeit not a grand scale, is notable enough for Wikipedia. The article states that he directed two documentaries, helped to form an academy, and co-edited a notable magazine. That seems to satisfy notability. I believe we can look at the expandability of this article and how it can endure. It can grow, and still not be a a crystal ball since the man has appeared to done enough for notability. <b>Keep</b> per the fact that creating two documentaries that went on Israeli television and were featured, thus making subject notable. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 21:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> They are notable within one particular fed which despite its audience is still mostly a regional federation as opposed to a national one. However I do not believe that they have contributed so much to the wrestling genre that they have risen above the notability of the wrestlers themselves. Stables form some last a very longtime. Stables Like The Four Horsemen Degeneration X and the New World Order are notable because they were all defining moments in wrestling history. Stables such as the Embassy, Special K, Da Hit Squad, etc are not notable despite their longevity. They fail to make a lasting impact on the genre despite ongoing feuds. <a href="../../../n/e/g/User%7ENegroSuave_0441.html" title="User:NegroSuave">NegroSuave</a> 18:00, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The one "particular fed" is the second highest ranked indy fed in America behind TNA, and they don't even have a TV or PPV deal. RoH has been part of several famous, within the community, other stables such as Generation Next, Second City Saints, The Prophecy and the Rottweilers and all of those are notable as well within the community. This isn't a "well they weren't nWo or DX or Four Horsemen so delete it" as wikipedia chooses deletions off their own merits. While comparing to the mainstream this may seem insignificant, but on its own merits its a significant stable in a significant company in wrestling. --- <a href="../../../l/i/d/User%7ELid_b8c5.html" title="User:Lid">Lid</a> 18:15, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Once again i am not questioning ROH's influence. Many of the members of the aformentioned stables are aquaintences of mine. It is a fantastic organization with great wrestling, storylines, and the like. However I do not believe that the Embassy as a seperate entity deserves a page. Once again I am saying this as a fan and former collegue of many of the wrestlers in ROH (Many of them in Special K). ROH is fantastic to watch. However The Embassy as a group is not notable to transend the genre of wrestling and does not have the name recognition except among its fans which, despite your claims, are decidedly not as large a cross section of the average wrestling fan. The stable is not of anymore note than any of the other stables that have come and gone within independant wrestling. Otherwise I would be all over documenting the Rise and Fall of the Big Unit and all of its variations and permutations. This is not to say that this article doesn't belong anywhere, It just does not belong on its own seperate page.</dd>

<p>This article has been listed for deletion twice because of advertising content, twice removed by the original poster of the article, the only reason for it's existance is to advertise "Mexico Insurance." It would have been better to have been a speedy, but I am told that wasn't correct for advertising (see history). --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichhoncho_144b.html" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> 21:45, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I've read the article and tried to understand what the hell this "captain" is. You say he is a fictional character, but not in a movie. The article says he gives Sudoku lessons, but you say he is fictional. You say he is "explored in all Israeli big newspapers", but I can see only a trivia reportage in a minor section of NRG.

If, in future, you apply the <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> criteria when making deletion nominations for products, instead of the "I have never heard of it" criterion, you will be more likely not to go astray. The question that you should be asking and answering is whether any of those Google Web search results are anything more than company press releases or mentions in product catalogues. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:08, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Not having heard of something is an appalling reason to nominate it for VfD. For example, if I look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nobel_Prize_in_Physics_winners" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nobel_Prize_in_Physics_winners" rel="nofollow">Category:Nobel Prize in Physics winners</a>, I only see maybe four or five names I recognise out of hundreds. Yet all are obviously notable and none should be deleted or AfDed. At the very least, it couldn't hurt to check with someone who lives where the product is sold to determine if it's a household name or not. Besides that, it <i>is</i> sold in the UK, just under a different name (Comfort). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 01:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)]]
<ul>
<li>Not having heard of it was NOT part of the reason for nomination. It was part of my reponse to a response. A search for "Snuggle" on my version of Google (UK) reveals nothing on the first three pages. A search for "snuggle fabric softener" does bring up 37,000 hits. However, the first hit is nothing to do with the product, some of the next hits are Snuggle but not all. Furthermore, the the responses are for amazon or grocers rather than the an article about the product itself. On these criteria it is not getting that many google hits and more importantly it is not getting articles about the products (the hits are "sales" pages rather than "articles about" pages). On my research it doesn't seem to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and so I nomintated it as a candidate for deletion. The problem here is that the product is US rather than worldwide. So when a non-US editor searches for it, it doesn't show up. The only way to guard against this is to search all local version of google when checking any article. In this case the product is obviously widely distributed in the US (altough this doesn't meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>) - if it was described as a US product then I wouldn't have touched it in the first place. I guess the best solution is that products should be labelled with their relevant geographic region so that editors familar with that region can decide on the way forward. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkS_5f13.html" title="User:MarkS"><font color="blue">Mark</font></a><a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkS_5f13.html" title="User:MarkS"><font color="#0080A0">S</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkS_b5b9.html" title="User talk:MarkS">talk</a>)</small> 17:28, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - All of the added references made no mention of Hamsa Yoga but either Yogananda's Hong Sau technique of concentration (note, not a Yoga but a technique within Yoga), the use of Soham mantra, or Hans Yoga, which is a completely different Yoga. The titles of the references were altered (doctored) to appear that they are about Hamsa Yoga. Muktananda's book <i>I Am That : The Science of Hamsa</i>, for example, is about Hamsa (gander), a generic word with spiritual significance, and does not mention "Hamsa Yoga" at all. I have that book. - <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerminator_III_f34c.html" title="User:Terminator III">Terminator III</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - References to 'Hamsa Yoga' as a form of pranayam (see talk page). This one finds it truly unbelievable that Terminator cannot open his eyes. It is clear that Delete below is the same person. Creating user names just to boslter the voting process. The references were not 'commentary' at all. Tha original article on 'Hamsa yoga' has very LITTLE resemblance to the present article. 'Hamsa Yoga' is a very traditional form of pranayama as shown in the references and articles that show its relation to 'So Ham'.

<li><b>Delete</b> I certainly can't speak for Aeon and I don't really accept non-notable as a reason for deletion, but looking through the first AfD I don't see how What Really Happened meets any of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. There was an attempt to justify it per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#2" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#2</a>, but those awards are very minor "site of the day" type awards. In my opinion they don't qualify per #2. There also was an attempt to justify it per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#1</a> essentially arguing that WRH met the criteria per 11 published interviews. Unfortunately, these interviews were bittorrent, Google Video, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a>' prisonplanet website. None of these qualify as non-trivial. 3 more NewsMax cites were added, but none of these articles were <i>about</i> WRH, they were either mentioned in passing or linked at the end of the article. Obviously this was <i>no consensus</i> upon closing, so opinion was split, but I personally see no credible evidence or argument provided that this site meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it's in poor judgment, and, as you can read in the quote above, it actually violates the criteria for hasty renomination. Consider that last time this article was up for deletion a huge number of people spent their time (the entire debate actually made up 97kb) on it, and now you're asking all of them to repeat that exercise. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 16:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>To be fair to <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006">Aeon</a>, it only violates <i>your</i> reading of the criteria <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> based on the bolded text above. It specifically states that there is <i>no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations...</i> which essentially leaves it open to interpretation by individual editors. There is no violation here, just a difference in opinion as to what constitutes an immediate renomination. As for the effort an AfD takes, the previous AfD is linked so hopefully editors participating can read through the article, the previous AfD, and arguments here before rendering a well-thought out opinion. I don't see anything wrong with a healthy debate about an article's merits, particularly when the previous AfD ended without consensus being reached.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Considering the fact that I and many many more people visit WRH (intentionally, as opposed to redirect or Googling) - AND, after clicking on so many of the links (in the Wikipedia site) under the heading of WRH, it appears to me that WRH is actually much more "Notable" than this site with all the psuedo intellectual arguing about the nuances of the criteria for "notability" and deletion - AND, that, just like so many other things in Wikipedia (which really Could be a good idea, IF there were ANY control over the FACTUALNESS of the information - AND a restriction of the ability of axe-grinders and special interests, i.e., Zionists, as an excellent example, (and other people who have Obviously never even bothered to actually look up the dictionary or encyclopedic definition of the word "Semite" in ALL it's meanings!) to just jump in and edit and erase whatever they simply don't like.

<li><b>Keep</b>: This is ridiculous, renominating articles for deletion at the drop of a hat every month or so, and besides WRH is very notable site well known and frequently linked to. It may annoy some here who don't like the site, but well bang I don't like the US government either, so maybe we should nominate that article for deletion too??? KEEP.

<li>What in the world is wrong with Wikipedia? Have you folks gone mad? I suggest that perhaps it is Wikipedia that is non relevent, if you are too small for the likes of WRH.

<dd>Though I do sympathize with the frustration felt by avid readers of What Really Happened. I would like to express my take on the reason why this is happening (again) which I believe is threefold: 1) It is true that the article about What Really Happened lacks credible sources that would testify to the notability of the site to "someone who isn't acquainted with the site", i.e. most Wikipedia contributors. 2) Wikipedia's criteria for notability of a web site (which can be read at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) may in fact be deficient and in need of revision. 3) True, What Really Happened is shunned by most mainstream outlets which leads to it not getting the publicity other sites would have received all things being equal. Apart from that, while I have your attention, I might entice you to read Wikipedia's quite good article about <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> and urge all that come here basically to fight the nomination for deletion to become active contributors to the Wikipedia project. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 02:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Keep. whatreallyhappened has some original content as well as being a collection of the current batch of links pertinent to the views of the site editor. It is the "Go-To" place for updates on the unprecidented changes taking place in the American way of life that the neo-conservatives, and likely the fanatic zionists are bringing about. <i>The Dog that Did not Bark,</i> and <i>The Crime of the Century</i> are just two pieces of original content on the site. Have you read them? You'll have to read 1984 to know who Winston Smith is.--112358 02:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep This is a silly politically motivated call for deletion. Wikipedia has links to many similar political commentary web sites: frontpagemag.com, discoverthenetworks.org, antiwar.com. Many many such sites are documented - because they exist out there in the world and are relevant. This is part of a concerted effort by zionists and their supporters to have wikipedia reflect their POV. Its part of a project to remove not only whatreallyhappened, but also a whole list of similar anti-zionist political commentary web sites. --rafael</li>
<li>Keep Even though there was no consensus, and the last keep was a default keep, I still feel enough unique people contributed to the last discussion that we should not open this up again. 24.54.83.216 02:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may choose to do as you will but the truth is zionism is losing its battle to suppress and obscure the truth. Wikipedia is the last place I would visit to obtain investagatory information on ANY subject. This site is no different than the textbooks used in American schools. Superficial, skewed and absolutely biased. Sorta like Dragnet with a twist, "History has beed altered to protect the guity", but not for much longer.

<li>Keep WhatReallyHappened in Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex;">
<p>WhatReallyHappened is within WP:NPOV, because it is essentially a news service website which happens to include short descriptions of the meaning of the news articles linked to in the opinion of the site administrator. Like any website, there is an option for reader comments, however this option clearly isn't the primary focus of the site in form or function. The readers comments section, a tiny link on the left hand column, has no flash and little color. Obviously the administrator doesn't consider reader comments the primary focus of his site, and the reader cannot mistake the site for that purpose. WhatReallyHappened is not "blog-like" because the primary highlighted information, prominently displayed throughout the majority and in the center of home page, is composed of links chosen by the site administrator which are not found in the mainstream media, which is the stated and obvious purpose of the site: provide links to articles and information not found in the mainstream media, along with original content and characterizations of the external information by the site administrator, which the reader is free to reject or accept in relation to the article or information presented.</p>
<p>When a member of the mainstream media scoops another publication, that particular media wishes to present information not found in the other media. By consistently highlighting articles not typically found in what is considered the mainstream media, WhatReallyHappened consistently scoops that media, or any other media not reflecting the information. Further, if Free Republic isn't deleted for failure to adhere WP:NPOV, logically it isn't possible to delete WhatReallyHappened for failure to adhere to WP:NPOV, because no website violates WP:NPOV like Free Republic, and Free Republic is decisively "blog-like".</p>
<p>Next, the primary purpose of WhatReallyHappened as a significant source of unusual news links significantly disables much application of WP:WEB, because the guts of WP:WEB largely depend upon definitions fulfilled by the same media WhatReallyHappened is not designed to represent. What would the charge of the Web be then, if WhatReallyHappened were represented in claimed "reliable" media, that WhatReallyHappened is a mainstream puppet? Reliable media like The Nation or Mother Jones magazines aren't referred to in most media, heck, the Congressional Budget Office isn't even represented properly, with its accurate numbers prepared by dutiful civil servants held up in comparison to politically motivated numbers provided by private companies like the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>Yes, the move for renomination for deletion is in violation of standards of reasonableness in relation to not allowing immediate renomination. It isn't really arguable except on hypertechnical grounds, the next afternoon after the previous nomination for deletion failed could be said not to be immediate, if one wants to be hypertechnical. To a reasonable person there is obviously a campaign to remove WhatReallyHappened from Wikipedia, and, to a reasonable person, the nomination for deletion is itself in violation of WP:NPOV because of that campaign, once a reasonable person has reached the conclusion that the renomination violates the immediacy rule. The criteria for renomination for deletion should be that some change has occurred in relation to WhatReallyHappened since the last discussion for deletion which qualifies for another motion for deletion. We're entitled to hear what new information has come to light since the last discussion which qualifies WhatReallyHappened for a new motion for deletion.</p>
<p>WhatReallyHappened is a notable website, first for many references to its data in other well known and established websites, like Counterpunch, which credits WhatReallyHappened with good "detective work", because of the "11 published interviews" a detractor here tried to minimize, and because awards like "Site of the Day" is a criteria the Web uses to rate other sites. Would Wikipedia turn a "Site of the Day" award down? And why does Robert-Fisk.com bother with WhatReallyHappened, surely Robert Fisk is notable and reliable, risking his life in Iraq and Lebanon? Why did Wikipedia fail to delete WhatReallyHappened the last nomination, if it wasn't notable in the earlier determination? I don't see how, if the matter was a split decision, this split decision is anything but a failure to prove WhatReallyHappened isn't notable, it clearly was a failure to prove that, and there's no new information to say that WhatReallyHappened isn't notable. There is, however, new information that WhatReallyHappened is notable, in addition to the earlier failure to delete it as non-notable, because another nomination for deletion has occurred within a month of the last effort to delete WhatReallyHappened from Wikipedia, when no new information has arisen in the meantime to cause this nomination for deletion. That is notable in relation to WhatReallyHappened, and it has happened because WhatReallyHappened is a notable website which draws such attention.</p>

<p>O.k., this is REALLY starting to get out of hand... Wikipedia should do everything that is humanly possible to make certain that no one-sided, or unprofessional views are permitted. Having said that, these constant nominations for deletion are nothing more than malicious attempts to supress valuable information.</p>
<p>Whether one agrees with Mr. Rivero, (and/or his website), is completely irrelevant to the purpose of this website. Wikipedia was designed to allow a wealth of information to be contributed from all kinds of people, from all walks of life, from all political or religious affiliations, and from every corner of the globe. Does whatreallyhappened.com present a professional NPOV? Of course not. :P But the <b>WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE' <i>on it</i></b> <i>DOES</i>, (or at least, <b>should</b>).</p>
<p>If we start deleting articles about websites, or cult movements simply because we don't agree with them; and/or because they might offend certain groups of people, where does that inevitably lead? Would we have to delete articles on rival political parties? Would we have to delete the article on "Red Magen David" because it offends Muslims?, the article on "Huckleberry Finn" because it offends Americans of African descent?, or perhaps the article on the "Spanish Inquisition" because a recent revelation that Tomas Torquemada was a converted Jew might offend people of that particular faith? Seriously, at what point do we draw the line?</p>
<p>The reality is that there IS a site called whatreallyhappened.com . The only adequate reason for deleting this article would be said website NEVER EXISTED, and is just somebody's idea of a joke.</p>
<p>As a fountain of information, Wikipedia should do everything possible to give all people the right to speak their minds, so long as they do so in a professional way, and expressing a neutral point of view, when writing a fair and balanced article. Pine 05:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex">
<p>KEEP: A second time for deletion one month later? Get real. This is clearly politics and attempted censorship. Someone is trying to delete it because it's one of the top and most popular alternative news sites on the internet - that, by definition, makes it important and worthy of inclusion. It's also very controversial - that also makes it important and worthy of inclusion, and actually worthy of having an article with a neutral point of view. (Which so far the incorrect article has not been neutral being repeatedly reset to incorrect information.)</p>
<p>The real reason the site is being targeted is because it combines three dangerous things: controversial politics, disturbing truth (presented in the form of directly linked verifyable media reports, many of them mainstream, but under reported), and popularity. This is causing abusive interpretations of the rules hoping to cause it to go away by attacking those which link to it. Admittedly the opinions of the site owner border on abusive hate speech and anti semitism at times lashing out with cynicism and outrage, but it primarily serves as a link page to suppressed or nontrivial articles in mainstream or alternative media even for people who do not agree with the political feelings of the site owner.</p>
<p>I do not like or believe the opinions of the author, but I believe censoring the article about him would only prove his claims right all that much more. I read it to find under represented news. Both the WRH site itself and the article here on it could use some clean up, but they absolutely need to be in Wikipedia if you dont want to have a huge gaping hole which is painfully obvious because there is no article there. Deleting it would be dangerous and very counterproductive, showing Wikipedia to be a compromised and nontrustable reference source from now on.</p>
<p>My opinion of Wikipedia has dropped to about a quarter of what it was a month ago for even seeing this. The first call for deletion didnt really surprise me, actually falling for the second so soon again is approaching absurd. I've written articles for Wikipedia in the past, but I will not waste my time on it in the future if it is turned into yet another personal whipping boy due to threats forcing it into a political viewpoint. I will not waste my money on more donations either if it simply kowtows to a shortsighted minority trying to bully others into accepting their point of view.</p>
<p>Lets just be honest and say it all out in the open. Quit pretending that Wikipedia or certain people within Wikipedia are not being pressured in some abusive manner to try and quietly make the article and links go away. Stop the selectively overzealous interpretation of the rules on political grounds and let the truth stand for itself. Wikipedia's reputation has already been tarnished over this, I never even suspected rumors that other articles had been politically censored until WRH came up TWICE in this short of time. If the deletion goes through or ever comes up again it will just prove everyone right and other support may well flock away in droves after seeing the smoking gun of censorship.</p>
<p>To those saying the site is barely notable, how do you call 4-6 million page views per day of nothing other than hardcore news non notable? Considering the level of controversy and strength of opinions about it? 84.9.109.10 06:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Since there's apparently nothing good about Wikipedia, I can't imagine why a group would fight so hard to be associated with it. GassyGuy 09:27, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really believe there are WRH "fans" as such I think that every "thinking" individual is a "fan" of independence and alternative sides of the story, because that's what thinking is all about isn't it, making your own decision. now when wikipedia or people inside wikipedia appear to be trying to stop such independent sites from propagating like say...... [putting it up for deletion a second time in less than a month] people get angry, understand? The point of the comment above is to address the fact that when a human is faced with a choice between a distortion or an obvious lie, and the alternative they will take the alternative, if wikipedia chooses to knowingly digress from alternatives to the "T.V generation" propaganda then it in it's self will doom it's self to second class cheapness, just through the simple principals of the market system and competition. this is a cold hard fact, there will be in the future and already is other online free encyclopedia's if they have more [of all] information and wikipedia keeps "towing the line" then wikipedia will be known as the [fox encyclopedia] of the net.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep it. One of the few sources of reliable and unbiased news on the Internet.</li>
<li>All the verbiage is bogus. This is all about censorship plain and simple. There is an information war going on! The truth is rare and many want to squelch it. If anyone doubts Wikipedia's political agenda I refer you to the history of their AIPAC entry, which is now resolved (into a mere 75% lies).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. WhatReallyHappened.com has kept me sane in trying to understand international affairs for the last eight years or so. More than any other website I value it's daily collection of news and commentary. Yes it posts links to articles that are critical of the US and Israeli Administrations. But when you consider the evidence from an intelligent non-imperialist perspective then the criticism is warranted. What really happened with 911? Does anyone still believe that airliners and jet fuel brought down and pulverised three massively sturdy WTC buildings on 911? Burning kerosene cannot melt steel!! Does this tragedy justify invading two sovereign countries and murdering hundreds of thousands of civilians? More recently, who really believes that the IDF's shoot and burn policy in Gaza is a reasonable response to one captured POW soldier? The Israeli Administration just cannot accept that the Palestinian people would vote for a Hamas led democratic government.</li>
<li>If you follow WhatReallyHappened.com you see the reports day to day from world media that illuminate what is really going on. Unless Wikipedia editors want to distinguish themselves as guardians of Anglo-Zionist propaganda, there is no reason to delete WhatReallyHappened.com. It is a veteran giant among the alternative Internet media sources.</li>
<li>Before you decide the value of the website, try following the stories for a few weeks and look into the archives.

<li><b>Keep</b> WhatReallyHappened is one of the leading news and opinion aggregation web sites on the Internet. If you administrators who are, in effect, the policy makers at Wikipedia intend to provide yet another clear example of how Wikipedia is little more than a biased, agenda-driven web site disguised as a repository of knowledge, then go ahead and delete WhatReallyHappened. Then you can delete Rense and Raw Story Entry and who knows how many others... After you do that then you'll spend the indefinite future in what can only be a futile pursuit, trying to convince the world that deleting content aggregation web sites whose content you sometimes do not approve of is not censorship. Whatreallyhappened certainly qualifies ongrounds of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm pretty sure we decided this issue last month. Immediately re-nominating something for deletion is grounds for it to be an automatic keep I believe. I'm sure if the people interested in deleting this article keep nominating it, sooner or later they will succeed.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. . I don't know what more to say that hasn't already been said. Let me try and just reinforce what seems to be the common idea:
<ol>
<li>Grounds for non notability? Seems like alot of people are fighting for it...</li>
<li>This site and its listing here is VERY important if only as an example that there is truth out there and someone needs to show it in the light. For those of you who REFUSE to look at the deeper things, the VERY REAL things that make this world go round then I feel very sad for you and angry at the same time because you are part of the problem.</li>
<li>Yes nominating this listing to be deleted in such a short time very much sounds like a personal attack. It reminds me of a spoiled child demanding they get their way. Again...very sad. I can only begin to imagine what your political, personal and religious affiliations are.</li>
<li>Perhaps some of you think this is a conspiracy site. Let me say this. Even conspiracy theories and general stereotypes have roots in truth. Compare WRH to what can be said (no matter how very informative it is) to be a conspiracy site: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html" class="external free" title="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html</a></li>
<li>My personal opinion is that the world and particularly the United States is on fire and we are living in unprecedented times. Things have not been this bad, turbulent and corrupt since the collapse of the Roman empire. To add more to it by what really does look like censorship is a real shame. If you want to make a site molded in your opinion then why did you create an encyclopedia site?<br />

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> It looks like the notability criteria needs an amendment that takes into account the volume and quality of comments made in defense of a site. I also think that the number of google hits should be considered as well (on my count 343,000 for "whatreallyhappened"). For the time being, and as regards the<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#1</a> criteria on multiple non-trivial published works, there were indeed two articles in the Toronto Star by Antonia Zerbisias in 2002 on Rivero's site. Considering that whatreallyhappened.com focuses on highlighting news stories the mainstream media misses, it is surprising that it even achieved that distinction. If the article has flaws, it should be edited, not deleted. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:10, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<blockquote>
<p><i>Antonia Zerbisias wrote an article suggesting that people look deeper into 9-11. Her article mentioned several sites, of which mine was just one.</i></p>

Note that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>#1 states that the web-site in question must be the <i>subject</i> of multiple non-trivial published works. Without having the articles in question in front of me, I'm led to believe that WRH was <i>not</i>, in fact, the subject of Ms. Zerbisias' column, but rather linked from it as one of several possible resources. With regard to your lesser point about amending the policies to include the volume (and quality) of support, in this case the volume of support is a textbook case of <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppetry</a>, and the quality has been atrocious: blanking comments, <i>changing votes</i>, setting up soapboxes, and god knows what else. If ever the quality of the support became a criterion, I would despair for the chances of this article.

<p>It is the reaction to that initial article which generates subsequent coverage of whatreallyhappened in the Star. Zerbisias in on record stating she received over 20,000 letters in response to the article, overwhelmingly thankful or appreciative. Bnai Brith Canada, however, wrote a press release on 18 November 2002, condemning Zerbisias for promoting "anti-semitic" sites and trying to get her article removed from the paper. (It's no wonder that it's hard to provide evidence for the notability criteria! Authors of controversial subject matter find it hard to get their articles to print - and increasingly, it seems to the Internet public.) She ended up clarifying her position in a subsequent article, ("Judge not fourth (or fifth estate" 19 November 2002)<a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" rel="nofollow">[31]</a>, where she zooms in on the debate over anti-semitism specifically in relation to Rivero's site, which is not a passing mention at all. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 00:30, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have been postponing my decision on this. During the previous AfD I was strongly opposed to deleting the article.

And like them I was moved by a moral imperative that told me that this site is important and if it is deleted then something must be very wrong somewhere. I now have come to realize that the article doesn't conform to Wikipedia's quality standards which apply equally to all articles, and I particularly make a note of the fact that in the month that has passed since the previous nomination the issue that was raised then has not been addressed in earnest fashion. I also would like to comment that unsubstantiated accusations that "the Wikipedia editors" are out to get "What Really Happens" are immature generalizations. I for one believe that it is possible to find both that WRH is an interesting and important website and that this website unfortunately doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards without particularly suspecting that this is simplistically linked with the ubiquitous tentacles of the NWO machinating the Wikipedia voluntary organization. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 15:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Bold text</b>Keep, <b>Bold text</b>Continue, and <b>Bold text</b>Stop Polarazing Discussion - Wikipedia is designed to be an online encyclopedia available to all for editing and reading. To choose to no longer list a page due to political slant is contrary to that motto. If an encyclopedia wishes to gain credence through a large source of truthful public information, that information needs to reflect the public. The fact that we are even having this polarazing discussion points to that wikipedia is loosing its focus on expanding the world knowledge encumbered by political manipulation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom Line: Facts are facts. WRH exists, it's a real website and voice of an important perspective. It should therefore be kept and continued in the worlds freest and largest encyclopedia. --12.161.155.144 15:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)Private Citizen Z</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>- The site served its readers well in providing links to contextual background information on the "War on Terror" and the relentless PR campaign that led up to the Iraq invasion, something the mainstream media, for whatever reason, did not do. WRH has also linked to countless articles which purported to document anomalies in the events and official narrative of 9/11- another potentially fertile subject in which the mainstream media has shown no interest. WRH is a very notable alternative news site for those who wish to "question everything", and is a threat to those who are afraid of out-of-consensus viewpoints, even if, or perhaps especially if, those viewpoints are closer to the truth than the conventional wisdom.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Isayoldchap (<a href="../../../i/s/a/User_talk%7EIsayoldchap_88d9.html" title="User talk:Isayoldchap">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Isayoldchap_77cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Isayoldchap">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>KEEP - Of course, I'd argue "keep," this entry. Right now, however, I'm not even sure it's worthwhile to debate this argument of whether "What Really Happened" should be kept on Wikipedia anymore. I suggest this because I believe that this problem truly originates in Wikipedia's flawed notability policy which needs objectivity, transparency, and oversight.</p>
<p>To me, notability is extremely tricky; for, it suggests that there are gatekeepers of culture who decide what is popular. Who are the people that determine what is "notable?" Is it the media, the intelligensia, those with power, or the masses? Is popularity determined by an individual, cultural, local, nation or international spheres? Is it indicated if it's pop culture or historical? Is it determined by one's known professional knowledge? Is it determined by one's individual taste or preference?</p>
<p>Although one may argue that the above classifications are valid ways to determine notability, I still believe that it is flawed because there is no objectivity. Almost anyone can nominate a site for deletion on Wikipedia, and therein lies the problem. What one person determines as "notable" may not be "notable" to another person, especially if an individual has not had contact, exposure to, or prior knowledge of the subject or article being nominated for deletion. For example, there are plenty authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Gloria Naylor, or Ursula Hegi, that I am sure that quite a few people on this site have not read, are familiar with, or have heard about. Does this make these individuals non-notable because they are not known to an individual editor or Wikipedian member? They are not "notable" to these editors, but they may be known to a person who is familiar with world literature. What if a person doesn't know about a philosopher like Charles S. Peirce -- one of the founders of American pragmatism? If a person hasn't studied or isn't interested in philosophy, does this make Peirce non notable? I have had this experience myself, where articles I've written -- not so well known to some in American culture, have been nominated for deletion less than a minute after their initial creation -- without the Wikipedian editor taking the time to research, let alone taking the mere five seconds one would need to check Google's search engine to determine if a subject had prior media coverage or newsworthiness.</p>
<p>Another flaw in Wikipedia's notability policy is that there is little transparency. What if a person, organization, or institution has a dislike of a certain subject's inclusion in this "wiki" and wishes to have it removed from the public sphere to stiffle knowledge and to silence debate. One can easily cite Wikipedia's "notability" clause as a specious argument for an article's removal. I would argue that a similar phenomena is already exists and is rampant in corporate-controlled media where international and national news stories are shelved to prevent damage to their bottom-line.</p>
<p>My last argument is there is little oversight. I would have no problem if a page was deleted based on something quantifiable: Wikipedia has not instituted anything measurable in this regard. And, yes, there are ways to determine an entry's popularity - - statistics. Blog sites do this all the time. When I oversaw certain websites, I used free programs like <a href="http://www.xav.com/scripts/axs/" class="external text" title="http://www.xav.com/scripts/axs/" rel="nofollow">| AXS Visitor Tracking</a> that could do tracking. And even CPANEL has programs that can give individual statistics on which pages get the most traffic. Anyway, that's my two cents.</p>
<p>And lastly, I really object to Wikipedia's use of "meatpuppetry" and the like. It just sounds childish and meanspirited, in my opinion. All individuals have the right to their opinions and if they feel strongly about a subject, they have the right to express it, just as you do. And inspite of how we'd all like to believe we're "independent thinkers," we're all "meatpuppets" to some extent of our desires, cultures or society. American debate has sunk to the level of labelling or slandering groups of people, ideas, and/or subjects in order to "silence" the effectiveness of their opponents' argument. As a result topics, such as this one, that are in need of a serious debate are reduced to the mere superficial. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 16:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, personally I don't see this as necessarily a question of vague "notability" of the site. We do have a quantifiable guideline with which to measure web content against: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Whether or not you agree with the the guidelines is a different matter all together, and is probably a more appropriate debate at the actual guidelines. In my opinion, What Really Happened does not meet said guideline (and I've enumerated why above). As for transparency, it's readily available on userpages (sometimes) and if not you can usually get a pretty good idea about a person from their edit history. I have no agenda other than strongly defending my point that we have guidelines for this type of entry, this particular entry does not meet said guidelines base on all evidence provided (and based on the fact that I mucked around on the internet for a while looking for anything that would meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and nobody has advanced an argument explaining how it meets the guidelines.

<li><b>strong keep</b> An encyclopedia is not an item to be maintained by deletions. Obviously this site is inhabited by shills for the pro-war government. This was apparent in the Vietnam era but really unseen by the young in this decade. Think back to the War on Drugs - a propaganda war only, until the supply stopped - now NATO is the supplier/protector of over 90% of the world's opium. Wiki will sink into the same marshes of baloney after its successful hijacking occuring now. It was interesting for a while but it won't survive unopposed efforts at thought control. The internet was designed as a military system, and, as such, will interpret censorship as an outage and simply route around it. The designers knew that centralized control is a failed strategy (no not al gore). Ever think about a policy on NO DELETIONS ? Galileo and Copernicus would have loved that. After all, they were right in the beginning and won in the end, and its been the 'authorities' that first wanted G and C's work deleted, but today want their true role in thistory deleted. In the final analysis, where will wiki stand, and, by the way, what does the title 'Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia' really mean ? The truth is never decided by votes. When my children were very young watching a football game with me, they wanted to know which team I was 'voting' for ......... of course I had to tell them that votes only mattered in an election.........silly me 24.73.33.65 16:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not voting to delete this website. That's not within Wikipedia's power.</li>
<li>The website will continue to exist and plenty of people will visit it, whether it is in Wikipedia or not. The website does not have an inalienable right to be included in Wikipedia for purposes of publicity or advertisement.</li>
<li>Nobody advocates deleting this encyclopedia entry because of the content of the website or the news items and opinions there.</li>
<li>This is not a question of whether you like the website, or how often you visit it. It is also not a question of whether there exist other articles in Wikipedia which do not meet notability criteria (if there are, they should be brought up for discussion as well, but that is not a reason to end this discussion.)</li>
<li>This is a simple question of the pre-existing Wikipedia guidelines for whether a website should be the topic of an encyclopedic article, and whether this website meets them.</li>
<li>The guidelines can be read by clicking on the link <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you think this article should be Kept, then make an argument as to how the website meets these criteria.

<p><b>Comment</b> The criteria regarding multiple published works has been met. See my earlier entry above under Very Strong Keep. The policies also need to be changed. They are elitist, as is the tone of many of the posters here who made derogatory remarks about without Wikipedia user names who were posting here in support of the site. WRH is notable, even under the policies currently in place. People who want less censorship here need to get involved in drafting policy. Unfortunately, it is often those with a predeliction for power who get into that game, inscribing gobbledy gook with legalese loopholes that can be selectively invoked to discount entries on mere technicalities. I just want to remind Wiki members of one incredibly important existent guideline that mentions the importance of following the spirit and not the letter as regards the inclusion of a given page. Deletes are supposed to be a last resort. This site is clearly notable. The article can be developed, as has been since the last proposed delete. To delete now will be evidence of extreme bias and frankly counterproductive when so many new people have been exposed to Wikipedia and could form a completely wrong opinion about it based on the views of a hypervocal, rather disdainful minority. People, the policy needs to be improved! I urge those who care to join up, and get to it. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Zerbisias also mentioned whatreallyhappened.com in another article on 29 April 2003 in "Star Scoop Exposes Both Sides of the Story. <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=Star+Scoop+Exposes&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=11&amp;fromday=24&amp;fromyear=2002&amp;tomonth=11&amp;today=24&amp;toyear=2003&amp;By=&amp;Title=&amp;publications=1" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=Star+Scoop+Exposes&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=11&amp;fromday=24&amp;fromyear=2002&amp;tomonth=11&amp;today=24&amp;toyear=2003&amp;By=&amp;Title=&amp;publications=1" rel="nofollow">[38]</a>.

<dd>I am familiar with the contents of both articles, having read them when they were initially published in 2002. In order to see the full text at the links provided (the original primary sources) you have to pay for the service. But if you do google searches on the titles of the articles or on zerbisias and rivero, you will see disucssions of the articles at many different blogs and perhaps even a reprint of one them. It should also be noted that whatreallyhappened.com is is linked by over 2253 sites according to its Alexa information <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=whatreallyhappened.com&amp;url=whatreallyhappened.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=whatreallyhappened.com&amp;url=whatreallyhappened.com" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>, including World Net Daily <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22518" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22518" rel="nofollow">[40]</a> who quotes it as an important source in an article on the Oklahoma bombing, and Robert Fisk <a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com/911_initial_reaction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.robert-fisk.com/911_initial_reaction.htm" rel="nofollow">[41]</a> who finds Rivero's views on the site to be notable enough to be included with the likes of Arundhati Roy, Ralph Nader, and the Dalai Lama. In summary once again, whatreallyhappened.com has been proven over the course of this discussion to have 1) been the subject of a 18 November press release by B'nai Brith Canada accusing it of anti-semitism, 2) the main subject of at least one and arugably three articles in the Toronto Star, 3) a primary source for World Net Daily story on the Oklahoma bombings, 4) an important source on 9/11 in the opinion of Robert Fisk, and 5) the recipient of the Democratic Media Award 2005. As such, it meets two, if not three of criteria listed in the<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> policy. The resistance to recognize this despite hours of efforts from those who wish to see the page remain and documentation of the resources listed throughout this talk page is very disturbing and contrary to Wikipedia policies regarding deletion as a last resort only when efforts to improve articles have failed. Since the last nomination, improvements have been made to the article and research appearing on this talk page can be incorporated into the article to futher strengthen it. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 10:14, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b> - The site gets a lot of trafic and is used by many people of different political stripes.

<li><b>Comment</b> To note that some Wiki 'editors' desire "to protect this page so anons can't edit it for the time being, until the issue is settled?" shows that these editors fear opinions they do not agree with. That is editorial bias, and it goes against everything the idea of the Wikipedia is supposed to stand for. Your contention that the site in question does not meet WP:WEB is an outright falsehood. You are either engaging in selective censorship, or you're being pressured to delete this reference by others who fear what the site stands for.

<dd><b>Comment</b> We don't fear your opinions, It was suggested to cut down on the meat/sock puppetry that is now effecting this AfD (Which is what it is, This article was nomed for AfD and the site in question posted a link to the AfD causing the readers of said site to come over and try to save it. that is 'Meatpuppetery in a nut shell, see <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> for the details and scroll down to the bottom under heading New users working together, Offical Policy against Meat/sock puppetry on AfD's and other articles).

<li><b>Comment'</b> Inner Earth, please see my entry above on the three separate articles in the Toronto Star on whatreallyhappened.com. At least two of the articles were non-trivial, the source is independent, and being more than one, I would argue that that qualifies as "multiple". Additionally, the site, meets other <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria as the recipient of of the Democratic Media Award <a href="http://www.goodwriters.net/dmr2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goodwriters.net/dmr2.html" rel="nofollow">[42]</a> in 2005, a list whose 2006 winners include ABC News Off the Wire, Adbusters magazine, The Nation, and Mother Jones, among others. This is therefore a notable site under the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which only requires the site to meet one of the three criteria listed. The evidence cited throughout this discussion indicates that two of the three criteria are met. Additionally, there is widespread agreement, even from those for deletion of the article, that the policy needs revision. "Wikipedia is not about censorship" nor is it about rule-setting and technical nitpicking. It is as plain as day that the site is notable. A deletion would be a violation of existing Wikipedia policy, both the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the broader policy per deletion in general. I would argue that it also defeats Wikipedia's purpose. The controversy surrounding Zerbisias' initial article on Rivero's site in the Toronto Star would make an excellent addition to the article and thoroughly justify its inclusion. I will try to make those changes myself, but if anyone else feels inspired, please go ahead.<a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 22:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b> Again, your contention that the site does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria is a blatant falsehood. As has been noted and cited in any number of ways in both discussions, it clearly does. And if "anonymous comments" will always be disregarded, then your "wiki" should cease allowing "anonymous comments" to be posted. Threatening to remove such comments from sources 'outside' your 'group' because they post comments you don't approve of (or agree with) shows you have a problem with adverse opinion on some level. And that problem can, should, and will be construed as "editorial bias" in many quarters. Thus, if your policy is to remain truly "neutral" as a good "reference" site, then you shouldn't even be having this discussion. If you want to remain credible, you need to take your personality out of the discussion.64.193.3.46 23:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> On 17 November 2002, the website was cited as an example of a 'carefully considered, well crafted and very compelling' website on 9/11 in an article in the Toronto Star<a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?num=25&amp;st=basic&amp;QryTxt=Pursue+the+truth+about+Sept.+11&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/results.html?num=25&amp;st=basic&amp;QryTxt=Pursue+the+truth+about+Sept.+11&amp;sortby=REVERSE_CHRON&amp;datetype=0" rel="nofollow">[43]</a>. 20,000 letters came in to Zerbisias supporting the article that was printed, many expressing support for Rivero's website. B'nai Brith accused Zerbisias of promoting anti-semitism in press release condemning the article which referred to some of the content of Rivero's site. <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:DIOq7Nd2Gx4J:www.newsdissector.org/blog/2002/11/20/do-you-think-he-means-it/+zerbisias+9/11+2002+november&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:DIOq7Nd2Gx4J:www.newsdissector.org/blog/2002/11/20/do-you-think-he-means-it/+zerbisias+9/11+2002+november&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" rel="nofollow">[44]</a> She refused to consider having the article removed and wrote another article on 19 November totally devoted to examining Rivero's site against the charge of anti-semitism <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>.

<li>Meh, you're no fun. But let's talk about your comment, "If you suppress this site by not allowing a Wikipedia reference to it, then you are guilty of attempting to hide and obscure this content which is an intellectual crime of the first order." Would you say the same thing in a letter to Encyclopedia Brittanica, telling them why they should write an article about this website? Because you understand, this is an encyclopedia we're working on, and though we hope it will be bigger and better than Brittanica, it's got to have some standards.</li>

<dd>How would the truth be suppressed if readers of an encyclopedia missed out on a gem like "The main page of WRH is the news blog, featuring links to news articles selected by Rivero with some commentary." or "To the left side of the main blog are links to articles written by Rivero or posted on pages belonging to WhatReallyHappened.com, advertisements, links to archives of items posted onto the blog in the past, a search bar and a link to the WRH store."</dd>
<dd>Or is that just a bunch of filler, because there's really nothing of encyclopedic interest to say about this website? <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 02:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia is not the Encyclopedia Brittanica, it should not try to be the Encyclopedia Brittanica. It is however a reference point for people like myself who are researching information and opinion on current events. I don't agree with Grudge, but I would not want that site to be taken off the internet, and I would want Wikipedia to have an appropriate reference to it. You may not know this but students of contemporary events like myself, do want these type of sites to be well known and covered by other internet reference publications, even if we do not always agree with the content or perspectives of the authors we want to know what the POV is, and what views are being expressed. That is an important aspect of freedom of speech.
<dl>
<dd>You haven't answered the question; what is the critical research material or coverage that a student/researcher would be missing out on? It sounds like you think that this site has a right to be in Wikipedia just to make sure it gets as much publicity as the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a> - and that's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> what Wikipedia is for! <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 03:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I have in fact answered the question. The criteria is not and should not be that Wikipedia will only cover a site if and only if it has some entirely unique critical research material, which is the standard you are attempting to forward at this point. You should know by now that a good number of people like myself rely on that site, among others for information about contemporary events. It is unique in its compilation and it is convenient in that sense for someone researching the information even if WRH is not the original source of all of the material being researched. Again, though WRH does have some original and interesting summaries and exposition. There is no valid rational for suppressing the article on this site. And again, repeating my first comment, given the ferocity of the pro-deletion opinions being expressed, apparently those commenters are attempting to suppress the Wikipedia article on WRH for political or ideological reasons. If the site was entirely trivial in that sense, would it raise so much commentary? Obviously it would not.24.1.11.49 03:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, when I said critical research material, etc., I was just picking a few words out of your original comment. But I think it ought to be obvious to you that Wikipedia does not have the power to delete this site from the internet, and obviously WRH got along fine before someone tried to create an encyclopedia article about it, and obviously will get along fine without it. And no, believe it or not, <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">there is no cabal</a>, this is not a conspiracy, Zionist or otherwise; I'm just talking, same as you. I also didn't pick up on anyone advocating deletion for political or ideological reasons. (although there are plenty of paranoid folks <i>claiming</i> so)</li>
<li>But let's try another tact on this - if tomorrow, Rivero suddenly starts posting links to hardcore pornography on WRH, or reviews of Harry Potter books written in Esperanto - that would be out of character, right?

<li><b>COMMENT</b> to <b>finally</b> answer the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatreallyhappened.Com IS <b>VERY</b> notable, since it was the first major website, (run by a steadfast Republican), that discussed the distinct possibility that the Bush Administration's plans to start foreign wars, were for no reasons apart from providing exhorbitant profits for Halliburton et al, and preserving America's <i>Entente Cordiale</i> with fair-weather allies: Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>When practically the entire "mainstream media" and virtually all of the (supposedly) opposition Democratic Party, were swooning over Mr. Bush, and giving a verbal rubber-stamp to his Woodrow Wilson-esque foreign odysseys; whatreallyhappened.com was the <b>only</b> conservative, pro-Republican, online community that presented an opportunity for peaceful dissent.</p>
<p>In essence, the website in question provided the <b>ONLY</b> "speaker's corner" to the millions of conservative, pro-Republican, Americans who otherwise would have had no outlet; by virtue of BOTH chastisement by other right-leaning media AND reluctance to stand with left-leaning, non-mainstream, media.</p>
<p>This article should <b>not</b> be deleted, any more than any article on pro-solidarity media in 1980s Poland, anti-apartheid media in 1990s South Africa, or the Voice of America, should be.</p>
<p>I apologize, Dicty, but I must respectfully disagree. The pro-deletion side IS largely, (though <b>not</b> entirely), driven by people who wish to censor opinions that they do not agree with. As one good-faith editor addressing another, I implore you to consider how history might one day look back on whatreallyhappened.com. That is, <i>assuming</i> history is ever given that chance.

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex">
<p>MMIE: (sorry did not mean to make it look like Pine posted this) Was the Article on WRH really burning up that many of Wiki's resources to necessitate deletion? I love both websites and it causes me a good deal of dissonance to have to take any kind of sides between the two.</p>
<p><br />
207.224.92.111 07:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC) Keep.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia is not a moot court, and although rules can make things easier, they are not the purpose of the community and instruction creep should generally be avoided. A perceived procedural error made in posting anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines. Disagreements should be resolved through consensual discussion, rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures."</p>
<p>I quote the above because whether the article does or does not obey the strict letter of wikipedia's policies should not be exclusive grounds for deletion. That Whatreallyhappened is such a notable if controversial site in the alternative media community is probably justification for having at least some type of article on it, even if only a stub or less than perfect article, to avoid accusations or proof of bias. That there is high risk, if not evidence, of a desire to censor the existance/links to Whatreallyhappened should be grounds for ruling in it's favor. Being marked twice in one month is suspicious. Consensus is fundamentally unobtainable when there is sock puppetry, therefore lack of consensus shouldn't be reason for a second or third attempt at deletion. Rather it should be evidence of McCarthyism.</p>
<p>Mark the article as needing cleanup, more references, more neutrality, and other points of view. It should remain unmerged because it has a separate existance from Michael Rivero himself, just like Microsoft is a separate article from Bill Gates. Indeed it is far more likely a searcher will be searching for Whatreallyhappened the site than Michael Rivero the person. There needs to be an article here, just not a poorly written one. Let people volunteer to fix it, then move on. Nobody will waste time rewriting it if they expect their hard work and research to be deleted in a third call for removal come the end of July. 207.224.92.111 07:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'Comment' I have already voted, but I would like to address the above comment. BankIndex.com has since went down but there are archives of the article <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm</a>. Dubious or not, they meet the "criteria", which itself seems dubious because it's common sense that a website like whatreallyhappened.com is notable. The notability article first states that it is a guidline, but then becomes a set of criteria. So are they rules of thumb or a gospel to be followed? As for people who don't like anonymous comments, I'd just like to point out that just because it's anonymous doesn't mean we don't have accounts on here. Perhaps we don't want to reveal our identity in a controversial topic? 202.89.180.58 07:46, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

WRH is credited as the source that brought these issues to the attention of Free Market News. These are just three examples of multiple non-trivial published works on WRH by a third party that can be added to all the other examples listed above. Is more evidence required? Or can I get back to editing and building upon other worthy articles that require attention, rather than merely fending off attacks to delete and destroy what is a clearly relevant and notable inclusion to this online encyclopedia. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 10:04, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I cannot understand this objection. Blogs are explicitly mentioned content covered by the WP:WEB policy and rightly so, since blogs are a huge and growing phenomenon. The rights and responsibilities of bloggers as journalists is a notion gaining legislative ground in many places around the world (including recently, California). The refusal of some parties to concede that the policy on notability under which this article was nomiated for deletion has been evidentially met over and over again is simply bizarre. Wikipedia is not supposed to be a stuffy hardcover encyclopedia. It's a revolutionary format on a revolutionary medium and its content should reflect important trends in the cyber-reality that makes it very existence possible. Wikipedia is in many ways a kind of collective blog, though taken to another level, where people can interact with one another as equals, exchange knowledge and build a peer-checked resource that can cover an unlimited amount of subject matter because it exists in cyberspace; and as such, it should resist aspiring to be a dusty encyclopedic volume on an office shelf that nobody ever bothers to pull down and look into since it is so out-of-date and so out-of-touch with present realities. No one is forcing anybody to love, feature or visit this page, except those working for its deletion. Let those interested in improving it work on doing so. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 21:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I got a headache before I got to your comments, and stopped reading carefully. Sorry. As I said, I tried hard to find some way within the framework for Wikipedia to argue for keeping it. It is simply not there. The number of reviews on Amazon is essentially useless (self-selection and subject to ballot-stuffing). Possibly Alexa ratings are useful, but they are not currently part of the criteria. Maybe that should be changed.

<p><b>Regarding edits to article</b> KwH, I accept that the use of "attacking" was possibly POV and the edit that you carried out, particularly the follow-up edit, likely helped to enrich the article. (N.B. I do find it strange that you would spend time editing an article you have voted to delete. Why bother if it is so non-notable?) In your edit summary, however, you accuse me of misquoting OmBudsGod.com, when in fact I do not quote them, but rather had provided a link to the blog since it holds a direct quote from Zerbisias in her initial response to the B'nai Brith press release, that I had quite briefly and accurately paraphrased in the original edit, I might add. Please do not make baseless accusations of "misquoting." While I make mistakes sometimes, I edit in good faith and to try faithfully represent the diverse sources I cite.

<dd>Upon researching the claim, I found a link to Damien Penny's blog (which is mentioned by OmbudsGod). IIRC, the original text claimed that Zerbisias "stood by her reporting" <i>at first</i>, when the Penny blog revealed that phrase came from an open letter to WRH from Zerbisias which was sent <i>after</i> her second article criticizing the site. Zerbisias stated that she refused to retract the original story, but this was in the context of her responding to WRH readers who were furiously emailing her <i>after the second story</i> and alleging that she must have been pressured by The Star to repudiate WRH (which she denied being pressured). She stood by the thrust of her original story (that alternate causes of 9/11 should be investigated) but did not stand by WRH whatsoever other than as quoted ("the good parts are ruined by the hateful sections"). I'll give a copy of the link to Daimnation later if you like.</dd>
<dd>I apologize if you take it personally, but taken in toto the section seemed to be a misread or 'misquote' of the entire situation as I understood it from further research - I was referring to the content, not you personally. Also, bear in mind that OmbudsGod and Penny slightly misrepresent the situation themselves, since they accuse Zerbisias and the ombudsman of the paper of anti-semitism anyways, so the misquote is partially theirs.</dd>
<dd>And to the extent that I enriched an article which I favor deleting... the fact is that I researched the matter to understand why Zerbisias mentioned the site in two columns, and having done so, I have no reason to withhold that information from others. I still think that Zerbisias' mention is the very definition of 'trivial coverage'. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 14:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to review KwH, I had written that, "Ms. Zerbisias responded by standing by her reporting (See November 20, 2002 entry of the blog OmBudsGod! <a href="http://ombudsgod.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_ombudsgod_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ombudsgod.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_ombudsgod_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[54]</a>). She did, however, retract her support for the WRH site in a subsequent article [ <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1035774581010&amp;call_page=TS_Columnists&amp;call_pageid=970599109774&amp;call_pagepath=Columnists" class="external text" title="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1035774581010&amp;call_page=TS_Columnists&amp;call_pageid=970599109774&amp;call_pagepath=Columnists" rel="nofollow">Judge not the Fourth (or Fifth) Estate</a>. The Toronto Star (November 19, 2002). ]." I do not see how this is a misquote or a misrepresentation of the link I provided, but would defintely appreciate having a look at the DamianPenny link you cited, or something even more authoritative. If Zerbisias' statement was a response to WRH readers, and not the B'nai Brith press release, it would be useful to the WRH article, definitely increasing the notability of the site. It would constitute evidence of WRH being an effective rallyer of 9/11 skeptics that can pressure the mainstream media to respond to the site and its readers concerns. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:55, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Getting nasty all right. I have said this page should be locked and not updated past closure. Now we'll see why.

Fancy that, of all the edits on Wikipedia, he comes after mine. Doesn't seem to be a film expert either, based on his edit history. My first basic article. And I've written the admin of WRH describing why his entries are self-defeating, able to be construed as racist, and that he's flat wrong on a number of things, particularly history. Further, I believe in making only one comment, not bandying things about, now TedE has me making two. I don't like that. Now look here, there's a lot not to like about WRH, but the evidence for deletion from Wikipedia ain't here. And I don't usually stick my nose in any business except democracy business, which is what we got going on here. Don't drag me in personally by stalking my edits, I'm the expert on them, not anybody else. Very unprofessional, TedE. Very. About worthy of a formal complaint, the proof for arbitrariness is in the nature of your edit. Want to go for it?

<dd>I don't have a problem with Ted. Who's Ted? Any remark on this Afd after closure isn't right, and I think it was reasonable to say that Ted was cued to my article directly from here, so I responded here, because it is part of this story. If you had said nothing, Isotope, I would not write this, but when you say I have a problem with "Ted", it can sound like my problem with the edit is personal. Uh-uh. All stems from failure to lock. I have answered his answer on my talk page, taking a cue from him. I think the admin requirements he lists on his talk page are quite admirable, and after careful reading I am convinced he believes in them. This is a hot issue for some people, not much for me, frankly, as long as I get my one bit in, which is what it should have been left at, so momma don't care. Now take a cue from me, admins. Lock this page at the point when the decision was reached, so the record is not subsequently fouled by too much errata occurring outside the meaningful time frame. It starts to look like an effort to create a new paradigm, regardless what is actually happening. In this case reality doesn't matter, it's a matter of what it starts to look like. If you let it go on much more, and subsequently lock it at the earlier point like I suggest, why, anybody can say things like, hey, this isn't going our way, let's hide under Roukan's suggestion. You've got both sides to this discussion taking notice that this continues, too. Dicty and I were the first to flag it, the instant we discovered it was open. Like I said, reality of what is happening here shouldn't matter, because the decision is closed, but if you don't lock it, anything can happen, anything can be said about it, and I can see unintended damage accruing. If the discussion wasn't locked, Ted wouldn't have remarked here, he wouldn't have potentially had a commitment to a point of view in his mind doing edits a little while later, at least I'd have been convinced at that time that it didn't matter, and approached the edit with him, as we have now done. None of this would be possible if the thing was locked. And there's likely to be more damage, too. Heck all discussions should be locked once the decision is reached. It's obvious. It did take people a thousand years riding horses before somebody threw a saddle on one. Do we have to wait that long to adopt an obvious procedure?</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>.

<dd>I removed the link because the author provided no reason for notability and Google returns zero results.

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article has no references or sources, and when the "unreferenced" template has been added to the page, an editor simply removes it and says that the street information is "common knowledge". However, the street is not notable, and doesn't even have its own page on the German Wikipedia. The information may be appropriate for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikitravel.html" title="Wikitravel">Wikitravel</a>, but not here.

<li><b>Keep</b> Although not terribly important, this is a nice little article. It has information that the Reich Chancellery article doesn't seem to have such as the prehistory of the street and the postwar history. Perhaps this information is not so specific to this street and an article on the area would be more appropriate which this one could be <b>merged</b> into but I certainly don't know enough about Berlin to make such a suggestion in any serious manner.

<li><b>Keep</b> Whether or not German Wikipedia has an article about the street or not should not be relevant, as far as I understand German WP has another policy regarding inclusionism, and all the street articles <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Carr_e4fa.html" title="User:Adam Carr">Adam</a> has created are about streets that are key to German history. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlur4760_4089.html" title="User:Blur4760">Blur4760</a></li>

As David says, the trick in merging useful information is finding it, and as no-one's pointed any out specifically I'm not willing to just let this hang around with a merge tag forever (the last paragraph may indeed have external links, but the connection with <i>bioregional democracy</i> rather than bioregionalism in general seems tenuous at best).

<p>Normally I might try rewriting or stubbing an article like this, instead of coming to AfD. However, whenever I try, I can't find anything to save. I have some older detailed notes on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/Talk%7EBioregional_democracy_044a.html" title="Talk:Bioregional democracy">Talk page</a>, but here is a summary.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I'm having a hard time finding widespread usage of the phrase "bioregional democracy" to base an article on (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bioregional+democracy%22+-wikipedia+-electoral+-encyclopedia+-piclab+-tribe+-hubley+-wiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22bioregional+democracy%22+-wikipedia+-electoral+-encyclopedia+-piclab+-tribe+-hubley+-wiki&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;rls=en&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this Google search</a>)</li>
<li>The article intro claims the term describes "a set of electoral reforms, but gives no specifics of any actual or proposed package of electoral reforms". It then goes on to describe what appears to be a confused and incorrect reading of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Lakes_Commission_0857.html" title="Great Lakes Commission">Great Lakes Commission</a>.</li>
<li>The sections which follow seem to be a bit of a hodge-podge of wrapping the term "bioregional democracy" around bits and pieces of hopeful ideas.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are political discussions around the concepts of <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioregion.html" title="Bioregion">bioregions</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioregionalism.html" title="Bioregionalism">bioregionalism</a>, and perhaps the phrase "bioregional democracy" is used at times, but this article seems to be a poorly written opinion essay, with no citations of sources or uses. . <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 16:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge &amp; Redirect to Bioregionalism</b> - the concept is used in academic discussions about green politics (see f.i. Andrew Dobson <i>Green Political Thought</i> p.99-104), but this article is a mess I would advise to merge the useful information on the page with <a href="../../../b/i/o/Bioregionalism.html" title="Bioregionalism">Bioregionalism</a>. and change this into a redirect. --<a href="../../../c/_/m/User%7EC_mon_41ad.html" title="User:C mon">C mon</a> 17:16, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That section quotes a pair of linguists, and the referenced text in neither case contains the words "democracy" or "bioregion". I'd also note that some of the Fettes stuff links to his definition "<i>Linguistic ecology may be briefly defined...as an approach to thinking about language which attempts to see it 'steadily and whole'</i>. I thus suspect that the use of "ecology" in this context may not even necessarily be the normal "environmental" version. Presumably some of these interests in small communities and languages may overlap with small-scale or "bioregion" politics or advocacy, but this section is hardly an example or citation for the term "bioregional democracy", whatever that may be. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 22:38, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Please read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> carefully. That an article is about Wikipedia does <i>not</i> automatically make it a self-referential article. A self-referential article is, in essence, an article that <i>mentions itself</i> or that makes no sense elsewhere than in Wikipedia itself. These articles are, in contrast, simply articles about Wikipedia, the encyclopaedia. They are breakout articles, broken out from a section in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. The concerns with such articles that apply at AFD are whether they constitute <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a> and are <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. The existence of similar breakout articles for other topics is a function of how much secondary source material there is on those subjects to work from, and thus whether breakout articles are required, and has no real bearing upon whether these articles should exist.

<li>It is clear that this article "makes no sense elsewhere than in Wikipedia itself". This is non-notable Wikipedia cruft– how can we complain about garage bands if we let this stuff in? You can call it a "breakout article", but it is clear that such a topic is just unworthy of iinclusion in any encyclopedia.

<li>Wrong. Again, I ask you to please read <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_self-references_3b86.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid self-references">Wikipedia:Avoid self-references</a> carefully. You are not doing so. This article makes sense elsewhere that in Wikipedia itself. One can demonstrate this quite easily by reading it <a href="http://help.com/wiki/Wikipedia_in_pop_culture" class="external text" title="http://help.com/wiki/Wikipedia_in_pop_culture" rel="nofollow">here</a> and seeing that it still makes sense. <i>The article is not self-referential.</i> You do not understand what a self-reference actually is.

<li>I certainly do understand what self-referentiality is. I've never argued that the article is written in a linguistically self-refential manner ("this Wikipedia article" etc.); that would be something that could easily be repaired, and would not warrant an AfD. The problem is that the whole topic is Wikipedian vanity of the highest order, a caricature of what is commonly called "self reference" here, something there has been a longstanding policy against (though, true, it is not detailed at <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a>): the gratuitous mention of everyone's favorite internet encyclopedia.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 12:58, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep, merge into one</b>. Wikipedia is a <i>gigantic</i> site. It's one of the largest in the world. It's also unique in the way it works. Thus, it is sometimes seen in the news, which is rare for any website, and actually parodized on many occasions. This is a fact. There is more than enough information to make an article about this, and there is absolutely no question about the notability of the phenomenon. I feel that saying delete in this case is based on the assumption that one needs to not prioritize Wikipedia itself in the making of articles; don't forget about the fact that Wikipedia is an extremely important website, in daily reach and traffic as well, and that it's noteworthy enough to write about! Same goes for the jokes and parodies that have been made about it; the fact that they have means that there is a reason to document it.

She was selected for the Northwest Annual in 2004, the very prestigous Review Santa Fe in 2006, the 2006 Photographic Center NW Annual (if you are in Seattle, check it out next week), she just won the ASMPNY Image '06 award, and her work will be the subject of a feature in the August issue of Popular Photography. Would all of this information allow her past the Wiki velvet rope?</li>

<li><b>Comment by creator</b> - Like most luxury stores, St. Croix is no exception. Why do we have a page on Jimmy Choo? They have 8 stores in the US. Why do we have a Bulgari page?

<li><b>Comment</b> - the comparisons are not valid; Jimmy Choo is a designer while Bulgari have a worldwide reach of 150 stores.

In any event, a large part of the article will need to be deleted as POV or advertising. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 21:44, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. From the article, it appears as though these stores are spread out across the USA, which usually is a trait of a luxury store. Although I've personally never heard of it, I don't suppose that makes it reasonable to vote against it. - <b><a href="../../../c/o/r/User%7ECorbinSimpson_55db.html" title="User:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#003399">Corbin</font></a> </b><i><sup><a href="../../../c/o/r/User_talk%7ECorbinSimpson_68d4.html" title="User talk:CorbinSimpson"><font color="#009933">Be excellent</font></a></sup></i> 21:29, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. advertisement. Fails WP:CORP, in particular not having multiple non-trivial articles. I find catalog listings, product listing, and occasional product mentions (press releases). Can't find the articles mentioned by Shrek05. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 21:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The creator used poor examples. This brand is more like kate spade and Dooney and Bourke, both midscale luxury brands that have a decent name in the US but arent as popular worldwide. When the kate spade article started it had less than 6 stores in the US but had over 150 mill in revenue. This is exactly the same as St. Croix, which is featured in many of those articles, the reason you probably can't find them is becuase you dont have subscriptions to the magazines that the creator mentioned. I would say it isnt in Lucky as much though, most commonly talked about in GQ. But like most luxury stores, this is no exception, unless you want to go through all of wikipedia deleting lotsa articles on luxury stores (the two Ive already mentioned would fall under this category). Similarly, the only thing i see that is POV is about the clientele, everything else seems neutral--Sarasote 00:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> POV include 'leading name', 'noted for their high quality of wool' (noted by whom?), the comparative pricing etc. All may be true but need sourcing to remain. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 01:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. The fact that the article is poorly written and reads like an advert is not a reason to delete. Even one location was not listed correctly which leads me to believe that is from some company produced material. The fact that so many of the malls they are located in have articles is a plus. Probably needs a good cleanup to not read like an advert. <a href="../../../v/e/g/User%7EVegaswikian_6c22.html" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> 07:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Changed a bit, its not from a company material, only thing is what materials they used because i cant find an article the exactly says the materials and since i cant just say "if you go to the store you will see the tags" so thats the only place to source it. but the Desert Passage is inside the Aladdin Hotel, it wasnt wrong, just yours is more specified.

(A modicum of research reveals that the appellation "Chinky" certainly existed prior to the 1990s, for example.) Deletion is not the answer, however.

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is nothing out of the ordinary in rewriting an article during an AfD discussion, and in fact, it frequently happens that a discussion that leads to <b>delete</b> will, after a rewrite, lead to <b>keep</b>.

<li><b>Quesstion</b> Usually, if an article is revised and nobody challenges the new form, isn't the deletion nomination withdrawn? Why, if I may ask (and not because I doubt you have a good reason, only because I truly don't understand), do you want us to vote on an old edition of an article?

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as deprodder. I think that this is a sufficiently different concept to product placement to deserve its own article; product placement involves a definite transaction between the advertiser and the entertainer, whereas namechecking is done entirely "voluntarily" - the ubiquity, of, say, <a href="../../../c/r/i/Cristal.html" title="Cristal">Cristal</a> champagne within a certain genre of music isn't because Cristal's manufacturer has given any sort of reward to rap artists, which (as I see it) moves it out of the ambit of product placement. <i>However</i>, I agree that the article requires references to prove that "Namechecking" is the established term for this phenomenon.

<p>I'm not quite sure having a list of portmanteaux is that great of an idea. The only advantage a list has over a category is that the list would indicate which two words have been blended. However, this list is somewhat unmaintainable, is prone to bundles and bundles of neologisms/protologisms, and even has a bunch of self-references (indeed, if we were to include Wiktionary, Wikipedia, et al., we'd have to include every company name that is a portmanteau). Heck, it even includes "-cruft". Hence, I'm going to call this list, "wordcruft". <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheProject_f8b7.html" title="User:TheProject">TheProject</a> 18:40, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> or merge to <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">Portmanteau</a>. Interesting enough to keep.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Like most Wikipedia lists, this one is really, really, really, lame, but as long as we have separate articles for each of these portmanteaux, there is nothing that says they can't or shouldn't be compiled into a list. I'd like to see sources cited for the entries that <i>don't</i> have their own article, though. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> but add a truncated list to the main <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> article. This isn't an exhaustive list, it's just what people happen to have thought of / made up. It's full of suspect entries (anacronym, anecdata, blacronym and that's only from the first few lines) and they're getting more numerous all the time. There's no point in trying to list portmanteaux because they get coined constantly and fall out of use as readily as they are created. A shorter list of well known ones that are in common use and that will be around for some time to come in the main article would be much better.--<a href="../../../l/o/2/User%7ELo2u_7160.html" title="User:Lo2u">Lo2u</a> 22:34, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, because a category will serve well enough and portmanteus multiply like rabbits, making the list criteria too indiscriminate.

<li>This is a list of words whose sole selection criterion is lexicographic. It should properly belong only at Wiktionary; the Wiktionarians are much better equipped than we are to determine whether a word (as opposed to a thing) is something that was simply made up in school one day. (Such as "blaccent" currently on our list, a refugee from Urban Dictionary. Most of the other redlinks are probably similar cases.) They, in fact, have their own <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Portmanteaus" class="extiw" title="wikt:Category:Portmanteaus">Category:Portmanteaus</a>, which is much more useful than this list: if you're browsing a list of words that are interesting only because of the way they're constructed, you're more likely to want to see the histories and meanings of the words themselves, which is present in Wiktionary's entries (and generally lacking in our articles). Our own <a href="../../../p/o/r/Category%7EPortmanteaus_28dc.html" title="Category:Portmanteaus">Category:Portmanteaus</a> is just barely tolerable. This redundant and forever-incomplete, inaccurate, and original-research-prone list is not. <b>Delete</b>. —<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELamentation_sig_386a.html" title="User:Lamentation/sig">Lamentation</a> <a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELamentation_8902.html" title="User talk:Lamentation">:(</a> 10:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Just wondering, how many of the keep voters would object to the list being moved to the main <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> page? If the list were a little less open-ended, a list of notable portmanteaux as a demonstration and clarification of the substance of the article itself perhaps, it would be an even more useful tool and something more suitable for an encyclopaedia. Whatever happens to the list I don't think anyone can disagree that a lot needs to go. I imagine most people get to this page from the portmanteau article so we could add a link to the Wiktionary list in place of the old one and I think it would be a fairly seamless improvement. The existence of a list article just enourages people to add increasingly obscure, unverifiableand and silly words that are notable for nothing other than that they are portmanteaux. --<a href="../../../l/o/2/User%7ELo2u_7160.html" title="User:Lo2u">Lo2u</a> 21:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The page was never deleted. The page was merged, however, and G4 doesn't cover reversed merges. Someone could have simply redone the merge instead of bringing it to AfD, but it can't really be merged now with the tag there. As for WP:BIO, "Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" and "The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." I'll also note that, as usual with these articles, there's no real clear redirect point. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 01:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good arguments, however you trip up on "non-trivial published works." The books are fiction that bare only his name. The child himself has done nothing notable in my opinion to warrant inclusion. Simply being born isn't involvement in a newsworthy event. The merging of a page and re-directing is a deletion of the pages initial article itself. Recreating a merged or re-directed page has in the past been speedy deleted. It's a grey area of the policy, but I've seen it happen. Let me also point to all the articles for the Holmes-Cruise baby, or the Jolie-Pitt baby, all of them....who were also born under media attention, are currently parts of their parents articles until the child does something themselves to warrant inclusion. <a href="../../../b/a/t/User%7EBatman2005_c25f.html" title="User:Batman2005">Batman2005</a> 01:38, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I only trip up on them because they haven't made the article. Among the available articles include the following citations: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_3483000/3483525.stm" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_3483000/3483525.stm" rel="nofollow">[61]</a> <a href="http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2003/03/04/story90520.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingnews/2003/03/04/story90520.asp" rel="nofollow">[62]</a> <a href="http://www.fazed.com/musicnews/Brooklyn_Beckhams_25000_diamond_earrings.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.fazed.com/musicnews/Brooklyn_Beckhams_25000_diamond_earrings.html" rel="nofollow">[63]</a>. i'd find more, but i'm already bored with the celebrity nonsense, and none of these touch on his birth, either. I'm not sure they've ever been speedy deleted, as the redirects have to stay up for a reason, but there's no real speedy policy for it that I'm aware of. Regardless, I've disagreed with the consensus in the two AfDs you cite, and I'm disagreeing with people here, too.

<dd>Good point about the "non-trivial" references. I think a very good argument can be made that, aside from the actual report of the birth, nothing written about these kids can be described as "non-trivial". Four-year-old plays soccer with other kids, or has a birthday party, or gets a present? Trivial. The parents also have a lot of trivial coverage, but have non-trivial reports, too (plays in World Cup, records platinum-selling album). <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 14:21, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>neutral comment</b> I've contributed to one section this article (specifically the part dealing with scientific evidence not linking testosterone to aggressive behaviour in the simple causal method that the subject of this article, and popular wisdom assume). I think the article documents a notable view (I dislike the term "meme", but it does imply what I mean in this context) and treats it an a reasonably encylopeic manner. Since putting this article on my watchlist, I've been really surprised that it attracts such vehement, ideologically driven, attention. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 23:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is a fast growing sport I believe has a future. Wikipedia prides itself on providing information on a wide range of subject matter; many other subjects a lot smaller than Simonball have entries. I also do not appreciate your condescending tone especially since you know nothing about Simonball other than what I have written and you don't know anything about me or anyone else who plays it hence making your use of the term "kids" inappropriate since many adults as well as "kids" play it. I would accept constructive criticism as to how the article could be improved Chris_125</li>

<li>I cannot offer proof in the form of newspapers or websites that Simonball is widely played since it has only been played for a short period in recent times. I do know, however, all those who have played Simonball have enjoied the game immensly (hence having over 100 regular players as it has become an un-official college sport). This is the reason why I have spent my evening creating this article, in order to get publicity so that Simonball can spread and then maybe I can show you some proof in the form of newspapers or TV reports.

<p>My name is Adam and I feel it appropriate to concur with Chris_125. As a player of Simon ball myself I think it necessary that I put forward my judgment here. Chris has put foreword some very valid points, and I can confirm that many people at many different colleges in our area have discovered Simon ball and Staff are considering running it in schools. I don’t think you have enough evidence to disrespect the game in question as you do not know enough about the enjoyment that many "kids" AND adults get from playing it, therefore I think you should take back your criticism and put somewhere better deserved. As were on the subject of disrespect, the "Line of Tony" is named so because this is where a friend of Chris and I lost his life. This is another reason I feel it is appropriate for me to put my opinion foreword. I hope you will reconsider your words and let Simon ball takes its course.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to the comment made Mr Danny Lilithborne and say that over here in Harrisonburg, West Virginia, we also play a similar game to simonball and it has entertained the people of our community for generations. I would also like to say that this article has helped us due to the fact that we are now very clear on the different rules and regulations of the game known in england as Simonball!I think that this is a renowed sport and that it should be recognised on this most prestigious internet encyclopedia. Long Live America and SIMONBALL!</p>
<p>Howard. G. McNakey, Harrisonburg (HowardMcNackey123)</p>
<p>Hi I think that simon ball is one of the greatest sports of the modern era. There is no possiable way you can delete this. Simon ball is not just a sport played by kids in a small village but its an art. Art is not somthing you can simply just delete but is an important part of todays modern society. If you feel that it is appropriate to delete this article then mabye you should try the sport before you criticise it.</p>
<p>KEEP SIMON BALL!!!</p>

<p>Bear with me here: this was originally a CSD-A7 case nominated (above) for AfD deletion. I was about to CSD-A7 it, when I saw the middle section - about what the guy does, rather than about the guy himself - would make a servicable stub. So I moved the article (the original article name makes a good redirect), cleaned it up and stubbed it. However, the result is probably still a bit non-notable for Wikipedia purposes. Therefore I appeal for people with knowledge of NGOs and this type of charity to express expert opinion here. This is a technical nomination, <b>no opinion</b> is being expressed by me.<a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers">➨</a> <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">ЯEDVERS</font></a></b> 20:13, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Even though it's a pain, I agree we should take these on a case-by-case basis. Some of these professors only have one book listed. Does this meet the notability requirement? It's really tough to determine without the context a longer description would give. That's why I put the {{context}} tags on some of the articles (although it got to the point where they were being posted faster than I could keep up). <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 21:51, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>OK, I agree. I'll withdraw the nomination for now. I think Beta has a better idea now what is notable and what is not. That stuff you mentioned about Cronin should be put in the article and sourced. I think we should give Beta a little time to improve the articles that are notable so that we can exclude them from the ones that are not. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 21:54, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Orlin Goranov appears to stand out above the rest of the company but he does not have a wikipedia page. There are many opera singers in the world.

<li><b>Delete</b> articles need to establish notability, because encyclopedias only cover notable topics. There is no policy or guideline as to what constitutes notability for schools - <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> was rejected. This article contains a claim to notability. Is a "Specialist College" adequately notable? <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">Specialist school</a> tells us that "Currently there are over 2,000 specialist schools, over two thirds of the schools in England." That lets me know the answer - that is not an adequate claim to notability. I find no independent reliable sources among the 23 unique google hits that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Acklam+Grange+Secondary+School%22+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=+%22Acklam+Grange+Secondary+School%22+-Wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">this search</a> finds that establish anything more than that the school exists. And there were only 23 unique google hits, which for a secondary school is very minimal... so this is clearly not a topic worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> but amenable to change if some notability is asserted, but not until.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to amplify my position. High (secondary) schools are pivotal places in the community, not only for the parents who send their kids there but for parents of primary children aiming at those schools, people who use the buildings out of hours etc. If someone looked up a high school in an online encyclopaedia would they expect to find it there? I think the answer is yes. Primary (elementary) schools are a different case. They are simply not nearly as important in the community. Also, I doubt if anyone would expect to find them here. For a primary school to be included it should be notable in its own right. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:44, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Borders db-nonsense in opening techno-babble and the stumping for golf devices begins. See this talk page. Violates <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, etc. Note that author has created a number of other articles in this area, <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emergency_warning_system_for_vehicles.html" title="Emergency warning system for vehicles">Emergency warning system for vehicles</a> and Electromagnetic Golf tagged by me as as {{<a href="../../../d/b/-/Template%7EDb-empty_b1c9.html" title="Template:Db-empty">db-empty</a>}}s.</p>
<p>The latter two nominations, Real-time Intelligent Vehicle Communications, and <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intelligent_Transportation_Society_of_America_5f2f.html" title="Intelligent Transportation Society of America">Intelligent Transportation Society of America</a> are by the same author. They appear to me to an incestuous group of articles, all related to one another and to the author's site, noted above. The former is indiscriminately named, gives no context and is filled with techno jargon. May violate <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> as it appears to be out of content text for a product.</p>
<p>The latter is apparently a copy and paste job from the website (which does have a fair use notice posted at the bottom). However, it appear to still be a copyvio (as I originally tagged it) as searches turn up these two sites which between them have all the text: <a href="http://www.itsa.org/its_technologies/c9/What_is_ITS/ITS_Technologies.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.itsa.org/its_technologies/c9/What_is_ITS/ITS_Technologies.html" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> and <a href="http://www.library.ait.ac.th/ThesisSearch/showDetails.asp?id=13476" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.library.ait.ac.th/ThesisSearch/showDetails.asp?id=13476" rel="nofollow">[78]</a>. A google search also reveals that a <a href="http://www.intelligentvehicletechnologies.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.intelligentvehicletechnologies.com/" rel="nofollow">company</a> by that same name, advertizes Electromagnetic Golf <a href="http://www.intelligentvehicletechnologies.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.intelligentvehicletechnologies.com/" rel="nofollow">company</a>. I'm not sure if it comes under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> as it is a "society of America;" I have not researched if it has any official designation, but google search returns 723 unique hits <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Intelligent+Transportation+Society+of+America%22&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Intelligent+Transportation+Society+of+America%22&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=800&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>, and in present form I would say it is an <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">indiscriminate collection of information</a>.--<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 22:11, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>In order to comply with the suggestions, this article has now been edited and rewritten and sourced by statistics from the North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) as a state and also a national record. I would have to disagree with the remark that that this was an "unremarkable" event. Sports authorities say the record will probably never be broken and it was quite remarkable.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). We have 4d-2k, but I will use my discretion here and call this a "keep". The argument presented that the article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> is not substantiated. The article is a list of people with the surname Ornelas and is perfectly verifiable, and not just the random thoughts of some person. <a href="../../../d/i/s/WP%7EDISAMBIG_0cde.html" title="WP:DISAMBIG">Disambiguation pages</a>, like this one, to distinguish between people with the same surname are very common on Wikipedia, and are useful navigational aids for readers. In this case several of the people listed arguably pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines and can have biographies (for instance, the page lists an elite football player in Norway, and a Portuguese olympic athlete), even though there is only one bluelink on the list currently. (If there are names on the list which don't deserve biographies, they may be culled from the list). I find the keep arguments presented by SilkTork convincing. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 10:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not convinced that we need this dab page. Of its twenty or so links, all but one are red, and the one that isn't red is unlikely to ever garner an incoming link. Many of the listings have very questionable notability or ambiguity. We could blank it or redirect it, but I'd like links to this page to show up in red. --<a href="../../../s/m/a/User%7ESmack_b8c7.html" title="User:Smack">Smack</a> (<a href="../../../s/m/a/User_talk%7ESmack_cdf9.html" title="User talk:Smack">talk</a>) 23:44, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep</b> - The principle of dab pages for surnames is well established. Deleting a surname dab page because it has just started and is currently red links is perhaps the wrong approach. Give the page some time to develop, then see if it needs deleting. If this page had been hanging around for a year I would agree that it's not working, but it has only just started and needs supporting and encouraging not deleting. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilkTork_60ce.html" title="User:SilkTork">SilkTork</a> 11:29, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
