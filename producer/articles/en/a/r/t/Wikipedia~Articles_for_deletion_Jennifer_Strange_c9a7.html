<p>The only notability claim is that she died of water intoxication in a contest.

<li>Somehow a pun in this situation, while natural, seems a bit in bad taste. She leaves behind three children and, apparently, died in agony. That being said I would go for a <s><i>merge</i></s> to <a href="../../../k/d/n/KDND_31c9.html" title="KDND">KDND</a> as her notability I think is very short-term and current events based.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>On further consideration the case seems to have become more notable than I expected so <b>weak keep.</b> My initial reaction was that this was a one-day story of oddball death, but I've changed mt mind. Will she be notable ten years from now? I'm not sure, but <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Wood_761e.html" title="Anna Wood">Anna Wood</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/a/Leah_Betts_42bf.html" title="Leah Betts">Leah Betts</a> are apparently notable after 12 years so it might be possible.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li>I will joke about anything and everything, but that's neither here nor there at the moment. In policy terms, she fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because she didn't do anything notable other than die to try to get her kids a video game system. <a href="../../../j/u/j/User%7EJuJube_a9d8.html" title="User:JuJube">JuJube</a> 07:01, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ironically, whilst researching <a href="../../../j/o/k/Joke.html#Cycles" title="Joke">Joke#Cycles</a> I found a lot of material written by folklorists and others on the jokes that people tell after deaths and disasters, including one lengthy piece by Christie Davies that describes at length the error of commentators who complain when someone makes a joke about such subjects. We really should have that whole subject covered in depth, but do not as yet. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:28, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Much of the time I don't mind jokes about a death or tragedy, "gallows humor" type stuff either, as they're a way to deal with it, etc. For example I didn't have a problem with people lampooning <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_5d0a.html" title="Heaven's Gate">Heaven's Gate</a>. For some reason though this was a case where I didn't like it. I'm guessing this woman didn't know about water intoxication and wasn't drinking huge amounts of water purely for her own amusement. This seems like a case that could get lawyers involved too. "Funny deaths" don't work like that to me.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Why would a person writing a paper on the wii want information on a radio stunt gone wrong? The incident had <i>nothing</i> directly to do with the console, any more than <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/16225843.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/16225843.htm" rel="nofollow">Alayiah Turman's death</a> really had anything to do with the Xbox 360. And why wouldn't a person writing a paper on water intoxication read the article on, say, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_intoxication.html" title="Water intoxication">Water_intoxication</a>? Don't you think that a person writing a paper on water intoxication would be more likely to look <i>that</i> up than to randomly choose Jennifer Strange's name?

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I am not opposed to mentions of her in the other articles. I think there should be a mention to this incident on the articles water intoxiation and the Wii, however i think it should be a brief mention that she died and with all the press coverage, have the article with more details on her and her death. I think this is a fairly tragic event and is getting a fairly large amount of press coverage (e.g. not a slow news day story that was covered by some local newspaper only). If i were doing reserach on water intoxiaction and saw a blue link to <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Strange_64ed.html" title="Jennifer Strange">Jennifer Strange</a> as an example, i would most certianly follow it and read up on it, and what happened.

<li>You appear to argue that news reports should not count as an independent reliable source. If you are trying to say newsworthiness is irrelevant, then you should say so. As for whether human interest news reports are of a lesser quality than other types of news reports for setting notability, I would argue that is a distinction not present in WP:BIO altogether. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 00:03, 19 January 2007 (UTC)

Some have attempted to cite other death victimns in this debate, yet none have succeeded to cite one that was notable only for their deaths. e.g. one "keeper" cited Matthew Carrington (whose death lead to Matt's Law) and another cited the incongruant example the Columbine Killers (when a better parallel would've been the victims, only two of whom have wiki pages as books have been published with them as the subject). The keepers thusfar have not supported their case via passages from WP policies and guidelines, I suspect perhaps because there aren't any that would support keeping it.

<li>Cry strawman and red herring all you want, or whatever other high school debate foul, but it's rather clear Jennifer Strange is more notable than a common individual 9/11 victim, and <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> does not dintinguish human interest news from other "more legitimate" news. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 23:57, 20 January 2007 (UTC)

The <a href="../../../k/d/n/KDND_31c9.html" title="KDND">KDND</a> article, for example, is now very unbalanced with all the information on this incident that has been "merged" into it unnecessarily: there are four paragraphs about the station itself and a dozen about this incident. Somebody a month from now will rightly trim the article down to refocus on the station itself and the content will be lost. 70.136.255.156 00:39, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> At least for the moment. While we know the circumstances surrounding her death are not unique, the fact that this could result in a <i>criminal</i> manslaughter charge against the KDND DJs would almost certainly have a chilling effect on media outlets throughout the nation. Such a case would be highly debatable in modern communications law. Reckstei 02:51, 19 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
