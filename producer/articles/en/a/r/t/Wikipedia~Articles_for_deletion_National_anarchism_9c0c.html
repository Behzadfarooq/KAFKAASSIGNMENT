<dd>The (A) symbol is used in many ways, association with the (A) symbol does not necessarily mean anarchist. I don't think libertarian fascism is an ideology, do you disagree? I read the page on <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Valois_edde.html" title="George Valois">George Valois</a>, it doesn't say anything about national anarchism or libertarian fascism. I agree that in some cases people nominate articles for deletion as a result of <i>Ostrich</i> like behaviour and assure you that this is not one of them. As I said above, I would not necessarily have a problem with keeping the content provided it was moved to a general page about Anarchism and nationalism, or even if you like it could be moved to Anarchism, racism and nationalism. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 14:21, 14 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Personally I think wikipedia has room to comment on even the stupidest and most offensive ideas, as long as it's made clear just how tiny and marginal this bunch are, and that whatever they call themselves they're fascists not anarchists.<a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBengalski_c6f3.html" title="User:Bengalski">Bengalski</a> 13:52, 14 March 2006 (UTC) On closer inspection, we've got various scrappy pages or stubs on 'anarcho-nationalism', 'nationalist anarchism' etc., and I'm not sure there is any real difference between all these.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Anarchism has a long tradition of opposition to both nationalism and racism. This so-called ideology was created by marginal neo-fascists in an effort to attract more followers. Wikipedia shouldn't include every crackpot movement that attempts to revert the ideas of a long-standing political tendency with over a century of existence. Having an entry on "national anarchism" is like keeping one on "Satanic Catholicism."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I can't believe that once again somebody has put this article up for deletion, only six month after the last AfD. The results of the last vote were to keep the article - what's changed since then. Moves to delete this article are blatantly POV - I should remind those who keep brining this article up for deletion that just because you disagree with this ideology or disagree with the fact that they call themselves anarchists is <b>not</b> a valid reason for deletion. I'm reposting from the last AfD why I think this article is important and should be kept: "The argument for deletion is blantly POV and sectarian in nature and smacks of censorship. (Which this move entirely hypocritical coming from so-called anarchists, but I've seen worse similar hypocrisy coming out of that movement before.) It is simply an attempt by Toothebarricades to delete an article based entirely on the fact that he does not like national anarchists calling themselves anarchists. Whether or not "national anarchists" is a valid as an exponent of anarchism (and I happen to agree that it isn't good anarchism) is entirely irrelevant to whether there should be an article on this topic here on Wikipedia. The argument that the argument is too non-notable to warrant a Wikipedia article is entirely false - the long list of links on this page, the large number of websites (both pro- and anti-NA) resulting from a Google search for "national anarchist" or "national anarchism", the obvious influence it has in the neofolk music milieu, plus the very active National Anarchist Yahoo Group are all evidence that this is a topic of interest and criticism for many people and therefore well-deserving of a Wikipedia page to introduce interested people to the topic. There are plenty of Wikipedia articles on Trotskyist tendencies that are far more obscure.

<dd>Hi, thanks for your comment, I'm disappointed that you suggest that my motivations for posting an AfD for this article are different from what I have described. Is there one of those google hits that you would classify as a scholarly source? As for a very active Yahoo Group, does this mean that we should support keeping articles for all kinds of forums, after all, there are many forums which are pretty active (and probably more active than that one) without articles. Forumcruft is not something that really floats my boat so to speak. I can appreciate that I'm not going to change your mind on this, but it would be nice if keep voters actually attempted to show how this "group" (for want of a better word) is notable instead of crying loud about some kind of perceived censorship. See above for my response to "blatantly POV and sectarian". - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 20:04, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to ask, though, just what is your motivation for deleting this article, if not POV? Especially in light of the fact that an AfD for this article was up only 6 months ago and it was decided that the article should be kept. Did you even bother to review the previous arguments about the articles relevance? It seems to me that the reason this article keeps coming up for AfD over and over again is because its on the hit list of various left anarchists who really don't like the idea of a far-right and racialist ideology calling itself a kind of anarchism. I'll point out again that whether its good anarchism or not (and I happen to agree with critics who say it isn't) is totally irrelevant to its relevance as a Wikipedia article.</dd>

<dd>I have serious doubts about your criterion for dropping this article, in any event. The active Yahoo Group, plus the website Rosenoir.org, plus 596 Google hits, are quite sufficient to me to state that this is an ideological tendency with actual adherents and has an active place in the marketplace of ideas, and not just some kind of hoax that somebody made up off the top of their head. This is not to mention the controversies around national anarchism and similar ideas - do a Google search for "Anarchist Heretics Fair" and you'll see that there was a rather large controversy in the anarchist and anti-fascist press about this ideological tendency. I'll also point you to <a href="http://www.fluxeuropa.com" class="external text" title="http://www.fluxeuropa.com" rel="nofollow">FluxEuropa</a> for an example of the influence that "national anarchist" or "third position" ideas have in the milieu of <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neofolk.html" title="Neofolk">neofolk</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_music.html" title="Martial music">martial music</a>, and other "dark music".</dd>

<dd>If your criterion is that National Anarchism too small of a tendency to be taken seriously (which I think is a pretty dodgy reason for dropping an article), here's some other groups which you might want to float AfD's for: <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Bolshevik_Tendency_0cf2.html" title="International Bolshevik Tendency">International Bolshevik Tendency</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialist_Action_%28Canada%29_37d1.html" title="Socialist Action (Canada)">Socialist Action (Canada)</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/o/Trotskyist-Posadist_IVth_International_c4ff.html" title="Trotskyist-Posadist IVth International">Trotskyist-Posadist IVth International</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Communist_Party_of_Trinidad_and_Tobago_b69c.html" title="Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago">Communist Party of Trinidad and Tobago</a>, <a href="../../../t/y/p/Typhonian_Ordo_Templi_Orientis_86f1.html" title="Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis">Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/s/Last_Thursdayism_d112.html" title="Last Thursdayism">Last Thursdayism</a>.

For my part, I'd be against dropping any of these pages - one of the best things about Wikipedia is the fact that you can find good information on subjects that are way too obscure for Encyclopedia Britannica. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 16:46, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, in brief, I don't have long, yes I would vote delete to most of those (probably not CPTT), but I wouldn't AfD them as because you have mentioned them i would be violating <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. Regarding Peter Werner, you should get a page as with &gt;200,000 hits you're pretty notable&#160;:) Note on the journal article, well, you've convinced me, they are notable enough not to delete outright. Good searching. - <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisTyers_1664.html" title="User:FrancisTyers">FrancisTyers</a> 00:00, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In fact the Yahoo group is not particularly active -- a handful of individuals post there repeatedly, sometimes using different nyms (nyms are a big thing with these guys -- something to be taken into account when counting the 'keep' votes, as well as their ability to summon up large numbers of meatpuppets). Their Yahoo group is in serious decline -- the original group was attracting over a thousand contributions per month a few years ago. Now their group is struggling to reach 400. The original group was banned for TOS violations and the current one is mostly chitchat.</dd>

<dd>This is a pretty serious accusation: "a handful of individuals post there repeatedly, sometimes using different nyms (nyms are a big thing with these guys -- something to be taken into account when counting the 'keep' votes, as well as their ability to summon up large numbers of meatpuppets)." Can you demonstrate that any of the above <b>Keep</b> voters are actually sockpuppets? Put up or shut up! So far, this discussion has failed to generate anything approaching a consensus to drop - your accusation that most of the <b>Keep</b> votes are mere sockpuppets is a pretty dodgy attempt to tilt things in your direction. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_G_Werner_6b6b.html" title="User:Peter G Werner">Peter G Werner</a> 16:53, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
