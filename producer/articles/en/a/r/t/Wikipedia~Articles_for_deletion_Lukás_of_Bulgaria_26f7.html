<li><b>Comment</b> So do an article about the <b>"notable family"</b>—that doesn't make everybody with a remote connection to it notable.

<dd>Many normal, non-notable people have royalty in their ancestry if you go back far enough. Where would we draw the line? The most sensible thing to do is to only include individuals who were part of the royal family at the point in time during which the family was, in fact, royal. --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 08:51, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> or preferably <b>Merge</b> into one article about the family.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Pretenders to thrones/titles at least have verifiable claims to the titles they aspire, as opposed to the self-generated (really vanity) sources for the micronations Wikipedia treats as notable. Certainly more notable than all those those hereditary British peers who have listings, notable mostly for inbreeding and the human rights abuses their 16th century ancestors committed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 15:26, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

And frankly, I'm not even sure if the grandchildren should even get that. As everyone says, above, there is a near-infinite number of descendants of notable royals.

<dd>I don't think he was referring to throne as the physical item of furniture, but rather to the occupation. There still is such a position as King/Queen of Great Britain, etc., whereas there no longer is such a position as King/Queen of Bulgaria.

<li>Good point. Should Lukas publish 6 books and file a lawsuit to claim his throne, I would support his notability. Or if a movement backing his rights to the throne becomes notable. Until then, let's give the 8 year old a bit of privacy. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 18:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I doubt his privacy would be affected much, because I doubt that anybody knows him by the name under which his article appears—and there's not much of anything about him in any case. <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>That's setting the bar way too high for me. As for his privacy, well, he may not have chosen to be born a prince, but it's a cross he will have to bear for the rest of his life. Since we are a reference work, I don't think we should be leaving people out because of privacy concerns.-- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:47, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think the point Gene Nygaard was making regarding Edward III's descendants was that merely being one does not make a single one of those millions of people notable. If they have articles here, it's because they're notable for something else. Also, regarding GRuban's point, I agree—to a point. I agree that Lukas et al have to do something notable before they merit inclusion, though I agree with JJay that it doesn't have to be six books and a lawsuit just because that's what Henri did. Finally, regarding the boy having been born a prince—no he wasn't, he was born the grandson of someone who was a Tsar decades upon decades ago. If he's notable as a "prince", then where do we draw the line to prevent millions of Edward III's descendants from making vanity articles? --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 23:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Exactly—that is my point. I don't know whether I am descended from Edward III, but maybe I should start working on the tens of thousands of descendants of his ancestors who were monarchs in various still-existing monarchies (as well as various no-longer-existing ones such as Kiev and Italy) which I do have in my genealogy database, if that makes us all notable. I should even get to count kings of Castile or kings of Essex or whatever, since Spain and the UK are still monarchies, don't I? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
