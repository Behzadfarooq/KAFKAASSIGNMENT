<li><b>Comment</b>Wouldn't your research findings be better served in the article on Israeli apartheid than here in the AfD. Isn't that what Wikipedia is for?

<li><b>Comment</b>Ben's point is definitely well-made, but I do want to commend Viriditas in any case for having spent time to research the article and the concomitant AfD; too often we (I include myself) participate in discussions here without having done the research we ought to have done, and it's always good to see one be pensive and moderate (and, of course, consistent with Ben's note, if the article is kept, Viriditas will surely be able to contribute content and add sources, which is always good). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:14, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> as a phrase that, even as it expresses a POV, is notable (toward which proposition see, e.g., <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Religion_of_Peace_%28second_nomination%29_7740.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religion of Peace (second nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Religion of Peace (second nomination)</a>). Were we to be using the terminology as descriptive in an article, I'd object; here, though, our article is apropos of a trope that is increasingly common (to be sure, if the article is not/cannot be properly sourced w/r/to the frequency with which the term is used/the prominence of certain users, deletion would be in order). The article oughtn't to include original research, of course; instead of attempting to prove the correctness of the phrase, it ought to detail the arguments of others who make claims for and against the phrase. We don't take <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, but we can compile opinions recorded in secondary sources, even where the primary sources are individuals who undertake original research or push a POV (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlie_Sheen_87eb.html" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>'s conculsion that something other than an airliner hit the <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pentagon.html" title="Pentagon">Pentagon</a> on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11%2C_2001_attacks.html" title="September 11, 2001 attacks">11 September</a> is original research [or derived from the original, largely unsubstantiated research of others] but nevertheless notable). Our article <i><a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_dead_than_red.html" title="Better dead than red">Better dead than red</a></i>, about another notable tendentious locution, provides a fair examplar around which this article can be developed. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 00:25, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Question:</b> There may be a better place for this, but I don't know where. Homey has now re-titled this article so "phrase" is no longer in the title. I moved it back, he moved it back again. During the period this article is being considered for deletion, wouldn't it be reasonable for the title to at least remain the same? It is even more objectionable without "phrase" in the title. Homey also says it is "non-standard" to have "phrase" in the title.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Characterization contained in title may be disputed, but the phrase itself is undoubtedly in notable usage. Having seen some delete votes, <i>every single one</i> seems to be on the basis of factual/political opposition to the analysis done using the term; no delete voters actually even tries to deny the notability of the term itself (or really, the NPOV of the article as a whole). <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkgreen">LotLE</font></a>×<a href="../../../l/u/l/User_talk%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_7fd3.html" title="User talk:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters"><font color="darkred" size="-2">talk</font></a> 01:20, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think it's fair to say that the concept of Saudi apartheid exists, and that concept can be dealt with in several articles. I distinguish the two by noting that this phrase is notable not solely for the message it conveys, but also for its prominent and frequent usage, as against the Saudi phrase, which yields only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Saudi+apartheid%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Saudi+apartheid%22" rel="nofollow">115 Google hits</a>. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 02:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point is that the phrase is in wide usage, not that it is being used to demonize Israel. As <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> notes, the phrase "Saudi apartheid" is not widely used (I would note that the comparison of Israel with South Africa partly arises from its historically close relations with SA during the SA apartheid years). Just because you disagree with the politics of a phrase, this doesnt change the significance of its wide usage. Wikipedia is not censored in that way. Anyway, it is also used in contexts where the phrase is refuted and debated - [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Ahaaretz.com+israel+apartheid&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=site%3Ahaaretz.com+israel+apartheid&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">400 hits on the website of the leading Israeli newspaper</a>] <i><b><a href="../../../h/a/a/Haaretz.html" title="Haaretz">Haaretz</a></b></i> (and most of the hits are to do with Israel, not South Africa) (corrected previous 26400 hit result due to typo.

A thought experiment for you; would you object less if the article were renamed to something you found less derogatory, but with the same content? --<a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 21:04, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Guinnog, I understand that you want the article to stay. There are multiple reasons various people quoted for deleting this article (using wikipedia as soapbox, POV, pov fork, use of derogatory terms, etc.) You can see my reasons by my vote. As far as your name/content change thought experiment goes, if the article did not have the same name and had its content changed to avoid POV and soapbox issues, it would be a different article, wouldn't it? Likewise, if <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Pinto_13a6.html" title="Ford Pinto">Pinto</a> were designed like Lexus, I'd say it's a good car, but that wouldn't say much about Pinto at all. --<a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7ECommonGround_b696.html" title="User:CommonGround">CommonGround</a> 21:37, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<p>I restored this discussion from the talk page as it seems germane to the debate. Apologies if this offends anyone. Humus, I think we could compromise with the right rename. Common, I can't see any POV or soapboxing in the article. If you agree it is a valid subject for an article, but have criticism of the content of the article, that clearly isn't grounds to delete the article.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> it is not our job to determine whether a topic belongs based on whether we personally like a term or phrase but rather to determine whether that term or phrase has entered either the academic or popular lexicon. Like it or not <i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a widely used term with a specific meaning. A google search of the phrase returns 258,000 hits <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22israeli+apartheid%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22israeli+apartheid%22&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> we also have "Israeli apartheid week" on many campuses and the phrase has been used widely in the media. Our job therefore is not to censor a phrase we do not like but to ensure that the article on that phrase is balanced and NPOV. Merging this article with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-occupied_territories.html" title="Israeli-occupied territories">Israeli-occupied territories</a> as some have suggested is not viable since the phrase has also been used to describe Israeli policies within the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_line.html" title="Green line">Green line</a> as well as in the Occupied Territories (even though some reserve the phrase for the latter. Merging with <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier_e188.html" title="Israeli West Bank barrier">Israeli West Bank barrier</a> is also not viable as the term "Israeli apartheid" predates that project by at least a dozen years and is intended to address much more than that. Instead of trying to ban the term opponents should be working to improve the article and make sure it's balanced and NPOV. Some who hate the term realise that that is not enough to justify deletion, <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">User:IZAK</a> for instance, no slouch when it comes to defending Israel, has posted the following on <a href="../../../i/s/r/Talk%7EIsraeli_apartheid_%28phrase%29_7beb.html" title="Talk:Israeli apartheid (phrase)">Talk:Israeli apartheid (phrase)</a>:</li>

<dd><i>To Zeq: This phrase exists and is very "popular" today (in my view it's unfortunate, but what can you do, we cannot control the universe). The phrase is coming up more and more in the media, academia, and in political debates, so it is a valid Wikipedia article, no question about it. It can present all the views in the body of the article. There is nothing to fear. I think it is too early to ask that the article go to "Request for Comment". If you and Homey can calm down and debate it rationally then it can be resolved here. Let us ask other more seasoned editors to give their views here first. Stay calm, everyone.

<dd>Homey: Your point is well-taken. Yet, I do not see the need for stridency. Israel is a democracy that allows freedom of speech and is mature and strong enough to allow people to voice their views, even when they are repulsive. So far, the only person they banned in Israel was Rabbi Kahane, because he was too "racist", but it seems that many Israelis can live with being tagged "apartheid this-and-that" by leftists and Arabs, so be it. Let's see what Arabs can live with in their "democracies". <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 23:12, 30 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not saying that it is correct to use the term "Israeli apartheid" to describe the treatment of Israeli Arabs, personally I think the usage is problamatic. My point is that it is widely used in this way meaning that a merger wouldn't work. It's not for us to dictate how the phrase should be used though I think an article should be NPOV and not act as if the term is correct or accurate. Homey 23:16, 30 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Viriditas. "WHAT?!", you say? The fact that there are articles in the Jewish community that attack and denounce this phrase is evidence enough of its notability. If this phrase were dealt with in a NPOV manner, as all articles should, then it will not become a soapbox. WP:NOT a soapbox was intended to guard against people enforcing their own viewpoint on an article. In addition, Other phrases have been included in Wikipedia, as other editors have mentioned, and they have not become soapboxes for <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamofascism.html" title="Islamofascism">anti-Islamism</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Better_dead_than_red.html" title="Better dead than red">anti-Communism</a>, etc. POV Magnet or POV Warring is not a reason to delete. All articles have the potential to become POV magnets, it only depends on the ferocity of the editors to push their own pov. "POV Title" does not apply because the phrase itself is POV, not the article. Policy says, "All Wikipedia articles must be written from a neutral point of view, representing views fairly and without bias." However, one must realize that certain titles will result in POV articles. POV Title is simply a simplified way of saying, "the article is POV because the title is POV." In this case, the title is POV but the article can be NPOV. The phrase was coined by a Jewish person, Uri Davis, and used by Desmond Tutu.

The words you mentioned above are stable common 1-word slurs found in dictionaries. The 2-word combination <i>Israeli apartheid</i> is a neologism slapped together and [ab]used as a political epithet in Cold War and antisemitic propaganda. What's next? Arab intransigence? French promiscuousness? German cruelty? (FTR, I have utmost respect to these and other peoples). I am sure you'll find a bunch of google hits for these. BTW, why is <a href="../../../s/o/v/Soviet_Canuckistan_87ee.html" title="Soviet Canuckistan">Soviet Canuckistan</a> a redir?

<li>Because the article is showing the phrase as the object of discussion, not the elements of apartheid supposedly apparent in Israel's domestic policy. There needs to be a distinction between the phrase itself and the policies. They are two separate things to be discussed, and I think some of the editors here don't understand that. However, if a discussion about the elements of apartheid supposedly apparent in Israel's domestic policy were created, then I would support merging Israeli apartheid (the phrase) into a section in the larger article about the elements.

<dd>Umm Homey: Regardless if you are right or wrong -- you should NOT have made a change to the title of this article in the MIDDLE of this heated vote and debate as presumably people who have been voting, particulalrly in the early stages, did so with the original title "Israeli apartheid (phrase)" around. Your actions, as with blocking <a href="../../../z/e/q/User%7EZeq_aaa9.html" title="User:Zeq">User:Zeq</a> whilst you were having a discussion with him, are unbecoming of an admin and could be <i>interpreted</i> as both serious POV-pushing and an unfair power-play (having the buttons to switch around redirects and titles of articles) by an admin.

<dd>Izak, see my "Question" above. After Homey changed it, I changed it back, but he reverted it. Now, there is a discussion (mostly between me and him) on the article's talk page over what the name should be, at the same time as there is this discussion here over whether the article should exist or not. It didn't seem right to me, either. However, for the moment, I am leaving it as is, otherwise, it is heading toward a mutual 3RR violation. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 04:34, 31 May 2006 (UTC) (Edited own comment -- <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 04:36, 31 May 2006 (UTC))

<dd>Homey, I appreciate the action that you took here on the name (although I have since had to move it back since someone else changed it), but I do not agree with your intended action if the deletion request fails. I have read and re-read <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_policy_7dd3.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming policy">Wikipedia:Naming policy</a> and there is nothing in there that prohibits a parenthetical to indicate that the subject of a title is a phrase as opposed to an actual thing, process, phenomenon or whatever. As I said on the article's talk page, the fact that parentheticals are discussed only in connection with disambiguation pages, does not mean that is the only time they can be used. Therefore I suggest that if this article is not deleted, you initiate a discussion of renaming the article, including your opinions about what the naming policy is or what it should be, <i>before</i> moving the article. Maybe that needs to be the <i>next</i> vote created by this ill-advised article. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:12, 1 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>So why do you think that the procedure advised in <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_b839.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming">Wikipedia:Naming</a> of proposing a change of practice at <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia_talk%7ENaming_conventions_b869.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions">Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions</a> should not be followed in this case?Homey 19:16, 1 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because as far as I can see, no change in policy (probably a more applicable term than "practice") is being proposed. You have not shown me anything that says that this parenthetical in the title is contrary to current policy. (And you don't need to refer to my quip about "maybe it's time for a new standard," that was based on <b>your</b> representation that the parenthetical was against the rules, which I believed at the time, but which upon actually reading the rules, does not appear to be correct.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 19:43, 1 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: Earlier in discussion, it was described as a 'rabid, polemical, revisionist fringe term'. If this is true (and it may well be) It is perhaps inevitable that any article on the Arab-Israeli politics will attract controversy. But what is important is that we do not react to the clamouring of one group or another - down this route lies the dangers of revisionism and the erosion of Wikipedia as a valuable source.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>: For my part, I think apartheid has little in common with Israel and is grotesque oversimplification being used for dramatic effect, but enough notable people find some value in the term that is definitely deserving of an article. Besides which, it's well sourced and balanced. If you feel it is a purely propaganda term, this article would be the perfect place to debunk it using lots of sources. It will be a hotspot for vandalism and edit wars, but as long as everyone sticks to the facts (and doesn't delete any) we should be fine.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Taking a propaganda expression and put it as a title of an article, will only make it another constant battlefield.

Using Wikipedia as such a platform will only lead to polarization, which this page accounts for. Hence, BLANK VOTE!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the phrase has been established as notable. There is absolutely no reason this cannot be a neutral article.

<dd>As such, I cited Viriditas' argument in that it expresses that this term is merely part of a targeted propoganda campaign. As such, the article is about a neologism (see <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>), and consequently, it violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> in that it makes WP into a publisher of what Wikipedia policy considers original thought.

<dd>Bwithh's links in the comments below go to notability, well established in my view. Neologisms are frowned upon because they are seldom notable. Reporting on something is certainly different than promoting it or from publishing it as original thought. This thought is quite well-established outside Wikipedia.

<dd>To be perfectly clear, without the word "(phrase)" in the title, it would be unacceptable. An article about the use of the phrase by others is fine and constructive.

<li>OK, <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_conventions_%28slogans%29_d6de.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (slogans)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (slogans)</a> is basically what I was looking for but could not find, I suppose that is because it is archived and not linked directly from the main "conventions" page. It says an article title "may" be tagged "slogan" (or by extension, "phrase") on grounds of offensiveness. What I cannot figure out is whether this statement is "in force" at this time; but since there is no rule that says this is <b>not</b> the case, I don't see why an article title cannot include "phrase." Ironically, as noted elsewhere on this page, the inclusion of "phrase" in the title evidently convinced at least one person that it is <b>not</b> POV!

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> It is a legitimate POV and a notiable phrase that represents the POV. It is only offensive to critics. There are critical of every possible POV and every POV is offensive to someone. If we are going to start to delete articles on this basis then this is tantamount to censorhip and suppression of certain POV's. There are many other articles with titles that represent a notable term or phrase, some of which are very offensive. Someone pointed out one such article is <a href="../../../t/a/r/Tar_baby.html" title="Tar baby">Tar baby</a>. Are you going to delete that article too? This is a strong Keep and its a good, balanced article that is informative for the debates on both sides of the fence, and more imprortantly it passes the notablity requirement. I studied Pol. Sci. and the term is widely used in academia. The phrase is even widely used in Israeli political discourse. Take a look at the book by the title of <i>Israel: An Apartheid State</i>, which argues for the correctness of the term. There is in Israel a Committee Against Apartheid <a href="http://www.geocities.com/NoApartheid/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.geocities.com/NoApartheid/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, and the Movement Against Israeli Apartheid in Palestine <a href="http://www.maiap.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.maiap.org/" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>. Infact it seems it just becaues the slogan so effective in capturing the image of this POV that critics wants to censor it all together. This is unacceptable. We report on all views and issues, provided they are notable. The articles on any subject should be balanced and present all sides of the articles subject given the same criteria.<a href="../../../g/i/o/User%7EGiovanni33_8064.html" title="User:Giovanni33">Giovanni33</a> 13:57, 2 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, certainly notable, certainly a sensitive topic. There are verifiable sources to use and scope of the term. While there can be discussion, the article is written carefully to avoid strong POV. In fact, as of the version I read, it is very close to NPOV, unless the readers have very strong POV themselves. As for merging, it is too early to tell. It may very well become a subarticle for a more comprehensive look at modern apartheid. <a href="../../../t/e/d/User%7ETedE_dbe1.html" title="User:TedE">Ted</a> 17:09, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Humus sapiens, please don't hijack my edits and present a false impression of my intentions and the content of the articles . Those were direct quotations from the articles - hence the quotation marks, not "made up headlines" (isn't obvious that lengthy sentences are not headlines?). You're the one who is soapboxing by hijacking edits. I'm merely showing the notability of the term in the media. Yes, the first quotation is from an article criticizes/condemns the term while acknowledging that it is being widely used. The second article actually criticizes <i>Israeli</i> euphemisms. Here is the paragraph before the excerpt I originally used:<a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=344378&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" class="external text" title="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=344378&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=14&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y" rel="nofollow"><i>"To handle the settlement controversy politically, legally and ethically, Israel has developed a unique word-laundering system. To avoid the value judgment connoted by "occupied territories" or "liberated territories," Israel invented the term "administered territories."</i></a>]. The article then points out Israeli alternative phrases for "apartheid" as more examples of what the Israeli writer is calling "word-laundering". But the key thing is that both Haaretz articles cite the term as widely accepted, not whether they are for or against. My point is the notability of the phrase, not whether the term is wrong or right. And here is my original comment before it was hijacked, for the record:</li>

Google hits may be indicative of something, but I am not sure what, and the other question is, where do you draw the line? How many Google hits are "meaningful"? Just as a little experiment, I decided to plug various terms followed by "apartheid" into Google and see what happens. All of the phrases I put in were in quotation marks, for example "israeli apartheid," "islamic apartheid," etc. (I think the absence of quotation marks is what results in statements on the main AfD page that a certain search revealed millions of hits.)</p>
<p>Please be assured that by "testing" any particular term I did not mean a slur against that group, religion, or whatever. I just typed what popped into my head. So don't anybody be offended. It's just a little experiment.</p>
<p>Here are the results, which are grouped together in what seems like some logical order and in numerical order within the groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>"israeli apartheid" 247,000</li>
<li>"american apartheid" 84,700 (note, "u.s. apartheid" got 2,250)</li>
<li>"arab apartheid" 334</li>
<li>"palestinian apartheid" 270</li>
<li>"indian apartheid" 117</li>
<li>"serbian apartheid" 37</li>
<li>"chinese apartheid" 23</li>
<li>"russian apartheid" 5</li>
<li>"bosnian apartheid" 1</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"jewish apartheid" 2,010</li>
<li>"islamic apartheid" 735 (note, "muslim apartheid" got 458)</li>
<li>"christian apartheid" 24</li>
</ul>
<p>And here is one I was surprised by because I thought I was making it up, but obviously I wasn't:</p>
<ul>
<li>"sexual apartheid" 17,100 (apparently most refer to bias based on sexual orientation)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what does all of this prove? I am not suggesting it proves anything, other than that you can find just about anything on the Web. So, where <b>do</b> you draw the line? "American apartheid" sure does get a lot of hits, so why isn't there a Wikipedia article about it? (At least, I did not find one.) I am not suggesting that there should be such an article, but does that mean that there is some "magic number" between 247,000 and 84,700? Or, does it mean that 247,000 hits, by themselves, do not justify a separate article? (Somewhere a lightbulb turns on of its own volition.)</p>
<p>Maybe Wikipedia should not aspire to be a reflection of the informational chaos of the Web, but rather an oasis from it. (Hey, that was pretty good, can I copyright that? Not if I post it here, I guess. Oh well.) <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 00:30, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Maybe because Israeli apartheid is around 3x more than American apartheid. Also, note that people use Google Test in addition to the Scholarly Article-test and notable person test. Desmond Tutu, presumably a first hand experiencer of apartheid has used the phrase. I think he would konw about apartheid. <a href="../../../c/o/p/User%7ECopysan_6de1.html" title="User:Copysan">Copysan</a> 01:11, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for the link. I find the author's introductory paragraphs interesting and correct, and his conclusion laughable. What he is saying is, the use of this phrase is intellectually lazy except when <i>he</i> thinks it is applicable. And then, by denigrating the use of the phrase for any purpose other than what <i>he</i> wants to use it for, his use of it as an epithet becomes that much more powerful. I think a similar attitude went into the creation of the article we are talking about on this page. Fortunately, some people can see through things like that. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 03:31, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder if we should have an article on: "Palestinian Death Cult Lynchings" . After all much like Homey took a web apge from "globalexchange.com" one can use this as a source&#160;: <a href="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only" class="external free" title="http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only" rel="nofollow">http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=20829_Palestinian_Death_Cult_Lynchings&amp;only</a> .</p>
<p>after all the argument of google hits is a two edge sword - this search give 720,000 (6 times more than "Israeli aparthide":</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search" class="external free" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Palestinian+%22Death+Cult%22+OR+Lynchings+OR+Lynching&amp;btnG=Search</a></p>

<li>Again, I must say that the term is definitely common enough.

Maybe the fact that <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> is so poor, for unknown reasons, has lead to the creation of this article. In any cases, I tend to agree that this constitutes a fork, but I'm curious about what prompted the creation of this article in the first place? It might be undue speculation (in this case accept in advance my deep apologies), but it may just be that some users have been discussed by a certain type of control on some Israeli-Palestinian conflict related articles &amp; decided to create this fork to be able to edit (see <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamas.html" title="Hamas">Hamas</a> for constant controversy about very simple things; many users seem intent on only writing "Hamas are a bunch of baby killers evil fanatics" instead of neutrally explaining the creation of this terrorist group (which lift very important questions: can a terrorist group lead a state? so that's now a "terrorist state"? But if we accept "terrorist state", are they the only one?... My withholding of the question is not hypocrite but genuine doubt). <a href="../../../t/a/z/User%7ETazmaniacs_ae79.html" title="User:Tazmaniacs">Tazmaniacs</a> 16:19, 31 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
