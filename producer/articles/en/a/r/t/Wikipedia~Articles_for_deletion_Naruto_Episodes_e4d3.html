<li>Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. An encyclopedia catalogues knowledge. Each of the articles speaks solely to the content of the episode. There may be times when the article is more of a note than an article, but it still contains information. I have read through the articles; I have read Volumes 1 through 11 of Naruto. These articles are fairly accurate -- barring some translation issues yet to be completely cleared up. I believe some articles may need to be combined and/or clean-up, but none of them should be removed. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by SalvatoreRichardGomes (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SalvatoreRichardGomes_2073.html" title="Special:Contributions/SalvatoreRichardGomes">contribs</a>) 2006-09-24 02:25:32 (UTC)</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per above for now. Currently, (as I am aware of) there is no policy forbidding episode articles. Personally I think only notable episodes should merit their own article (like those who create considerable hype/controversy). But like <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobabobabo_0615.html" title="User:Bobabobabo">Bobabobabo</a> pointed out there are countless other shows with individual episode articles. If you (<a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFrenchman113_bb46.html" title="User:Frenchman113">Frenchman113</a>) want to tackle this issue I suggest you propose a policy and discuss this issue with the community. <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> talk page would be a good start. <a href="../../../t/u/t/User%7ETutmosis_35ea.html" title="User:Tutmosis"><small>- Tutmosis</small></a> 02:37, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>The relevant policy is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>. If individual episodes of television shows have not already been documented individually outside of Wikipedia, they may not be documented individually in Wikipedia. Some examples: There are plenty of people who have documented individual <i>The Simpsons</i> episodes on the World Wide Web, and people have even published <i>books</i> about <i>Babylon 5</i> episodes (e.g. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1590920376</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1590920392</a>); whereas most soap operas do not have episode guides. For this series, you can find people publishing episode guides outside of Wikipedia <a href="http://www.tv.com/naruto/show/18558/episode_guide.html" class="external text" title="http://www.tv.com/naruto/show/18558/episode_guide.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.animetique.com/animeepisode.asp?pID=40" class="external text" title="http://www.animetique.com/animeepisode.asp?pID=40" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.narutofan.com/index.php/content-episode%20guide,episode%201-10" class="external text" title="http://www.narutofan.com/index.php/content-episode%20guide,episode%201-10" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.nextnaruto.com/nextnaruto/php/public/home2.php?mod=anime" class="external text" title="http://www.nextnaruto.com/nextnaruto/php/public/home2.php?mod=anime" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.projectbag.com/naruto/ep_guide_complete.html" class="external text" title="http://www.projectbag.com/naruto/ep_guide_complete.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> and many other places. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:29, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please do not say that using an episode itself is original research, as it's not. The episodes themselves are the source. In addition, Naruot is a pretty notible show. Is it Pokemon, The Simpsons, or Star Trek? No. But is has spawned things in Japanese youth culture, among other things; that said, I agree with Tutmosis that the best thing would be to have singular articles of only the most notible ones. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Like anybody wants to read the summary of a saga. Maybe they would, but it'd be better to look for the episodes and points in the timeline you care about. The reason these pages should be kept is for the reasons that the plot pages are too huge. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Slammenhousa (<a href="../../../s/l/a/User_talk%7ESlammenhousa_9b26.html" title="User talk:Slammenhousa">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Slammenhousa_f5d9.html" title="Special:Contributions/Slammenhousa">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Delete some</b> Ok, there are some viable episodes in there. There are others that consist of the title and almost nothing else. i.e. "<i>I want to fight you! Finally they clash, Sasuke vs Naruto (Japanese: オマエと戦いたい！ついに激突 サスケVSナルト - Omae to tatakaitai! Tsui ni gekitotsu Sasuke tai Naruto)</i> is episode 107 of the anime series Naruto. The episode's storyline is the first part of the Sasuke Retrieval manga arc." Some editors love to create pages just to fill in series boxed. (I know! I do it on an outside fandom wiki.) I do not think every individual episode of a TV show is notable enough Wikipedia, but we have no one but <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Wales_abf5.html" title="Jimmy Wales">Jimmy Wales</a> to blame for their inclusion. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 15:36, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep all</b> for two reasons. First, <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_Television_episodes_d747.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion/Television episodes</a> recommends merging instead of deletion (although at least some of these articles could probably stand on their own and don't need to be merged). Second, there's far too many articles nominated here to be able to research the encyclopedia-worthiness of every single one. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 15:57, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep; merge as needed, relist particularly problematic episode articles individually</b>. This is a <i>massively</i> overbroad nomination; I've always said "AfD Isn't Cleanup", and I say for emphasis that "AfD Isn't the 20-Megaton Nuke to Level Tons of Cruft at Once" either. There's limits to what's sensible to bundle in one AfD, and one just <i>doesn't</i> nominate entire category of 200 articles up for deletion at once! Just look at what's happening with the esoteric programming language stuff right now: massive AfD that got reversed and is now being carried out again really slowly, <i>as it should.</i> And that was far less than 200 articles! --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 16:13, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Individual articles for each episode is a way of condensing the main article about the series without omitting data. If these articles are simply cut-n-pastes of parts of the main article, then the main article can be precised with impunity. In my opinion, deleting the individual articles is not an appropriate response to the duplication. And I share the reservations about the scope of this nomination; it is de trop. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 16:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for now. I agree that some of these articles are useless for now, but still... I mean, over 200 articles. There's bound to be at least something in there of encyclopedic value. Also, if you'd notice, some of these are not done. Rather than complain about them, why not expand them until they <i>are</i> of encyclopedic value. Or, perhaps, we can merge by arc if the articles are small enough... <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 03:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> And I forgot to mention: True there are appropriate plot summaries that already exist. However, if that was a viable excuse, well, Wikipedia wouldn't have any articles would it? Everything on Wikipedia is a compilation of information from appropriate sources. Anyone can go onto google and find an article on President Bush, stem cell research, immigration, the Revolutionary War, tuberculosis, Mario Tennis, and the like. Including the topic at hand: Episode Summaries. Though I have to say, it's much harder to find plot summaries for specific episodes of a television series taking place in a fictional universe than any of the other topics listed above. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYou_Can%27t_See_Me%21_320d.html" title="User:You Can't See Me!">You Can't See Me!</a> 04:01, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Definitely Keep</b>: We should definitely keep the episodes!! For one thing, I spent hours writing some of those articles myself!! Wikipedia is an international forum and there's those who can't watch the episodes for whatever reason!! It's not like we're posting episode downloads here and the summaries don't really have episode images!! I think if Naruto fans knew what were going on in the episodes it would encourage them to buy the DVDs!! So I say we keep the articles!!
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: Wikipedia doesn't exist "to encourage people to buy the DVDs". Images or lack of them aren't the issue here either; nor does the fact someone spent a lot of time on an article make it a valid reason for keeping them. As I said above, my opinion is that the best thing to do is keep the most notible episodes, but this particular AFD isn't the best way of going about a consensus toward that. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelodia_4ad5.html" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> 11:44, 26 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Someone "spending a lot of time on an article" is not a valid reason to keep. People spend lots of time writing fanfiction or concocting lists of left-handed Star Trek characters. Those articles are usually removed. In the case of TV episodes, even though they may be non-notable, they're usually kept because of precedent. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 12:40, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The precedent is rather ridiculous. Aside from South Park, there are Friends, Seinfeld and the list goes on. The fact that people have written so extensively about it proves that the show is notable enough to merit this. Mergers or expansions are called for, not deletion. An episode summary logically offers an opportunity for a more detailed and specific synopsis than an overall plot summary. If the episode descriptions were specific than the Plot of Naruto and Naruto II sections which some people have called too long could be reduced without a great loss of information, though reducing the plot pages may not be possible in any event simply because Naruto has a long and fairly intricate plot.Rayfire 18:07, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Bad reason to be deleting. All this needs is a little cleaning. Jerwong 21:26, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, but clean up</b> It seems that some, if not most, of the episodes in question, primarily those in the beginning, have enough information to warrant individual articles. However, two or three episode long filler arcs should be merged into one article. As for the ones that basically have a name and an episode number, more information needs to be gathered. However, if we were to delete every episode from the list in favor of a brief summary, we could in theory delete every stub here in favor of a massive compilation of related, yet vague, information. The individual episode descriptors expound on the information given in the summary, but to actually add that information to the summary itself would make it too unwieldy. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterRadius_dcfd.html" title="User:MasterRadius">MasterRadius</a> 05:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><font color="#CC0000"><b>STRONG Delete -- Wikipedia is a <i>general</i> encyclopedia</b>.</font> The fact that it is on computers doesn't change that.

<dd>I just realized that Frenchman113 is voting to delete ALL of the articles in question, not just the less-notable ones. It actually seems to me that Frenchman is voting on this not out of concern fo bandwidth and space, but out of personal bias against the show. Think about it: Frenchy used a bot to list every single episode under AfD, meaning he didn't even check them for content- he just deemed them unworthy, offering was that it was "Tons of fancruft, non of which as new info" as his justification. It has been clarified that most people who voted on this want to keep it, albeit with minor changes in some cases, but the few who claim deletion a definite edict have or can have their views disproved, save for their dislike of anime. Furthermore, the Frenchman rersorts to personal attacks on a regular basis, even referring to those who vote against him his "foes". Truthfully, if this really warranted such an extreme clause of deletion, we wouldn't be talking about it; it'd be gone already. The fact that this "conversation", if you can call it that, is being held means it needs to stay. If you feel we should clean it up, don't vote here; start a new discussion regarding its reorganization. However, under no circumstances should we delete over 200 articles just because some french guy labels them as "fancruft".<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterRadius_dcfd.html" title="User:MasterRadius">MasterRadius</a> 19:44, 28 September 2006 (UTC), and the horse you rode in on

<li><b>Keep</b>: At worst, this is a work in progress. Yes, a print encyclopedia would not have detailed summaries of every episode, but WP is better as an encyclopedia for having them, and its hardly a huge burden in terms of K. The plot summaries may contain some of the same information, but a history of WW2 may contain reference to battles that have their own pages. I also vote that we end this now, seeing that the keep vote is overwhelming. Note also that while a plot summary is not enough for a good article, "A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger article, or as part of a series of articles..." I would say that the episode pages are most certainly aspects of the larger Naruto articles. Plunge 21:21, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
