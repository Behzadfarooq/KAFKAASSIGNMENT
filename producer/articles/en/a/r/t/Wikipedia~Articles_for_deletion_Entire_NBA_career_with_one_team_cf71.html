<p><b>Delete</b> – I'm sorry, as big an NBA fan I am, I fail to see why this type of information warrants its own article. What happens if, say, Paul Pierce is traded? Then what? Considering not many players last "six or seven years with one team", it can never be that large of a list, therefore, I'm sure this information can be incorporated into the individuals' own articles. --Downwards 03:58, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: This article is in the works - give it a chance. Right now, it is not close to completion. I hope people can incorporate a list of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team. And yes, this list will change, but I and others will be here to update it when it does so I dont see how that is a problem.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, "<i>Considering not many players last "six or seven years with one team", it can never be that large of a list</i>" is exactly a very good reason for keeping. We vote delete for possibly-<i>infinitely big</i> lists. If what you say is correct, it'd be significant enough if one player manages to stay in his team for his entire career. Note that if kept, this should be moved to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_former_NBA_players_who_have_spent_their_entire_career_with_one_team_50a6.html" title="List of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team">List of former NBA players who have spent their entire career with one team</a>. <a href="../../../k/i/m/User%7EKimchi.sg_959a.html" title="User:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi.sg</a> | <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">talk</a> 20:42, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator. Too speculative and a wee bit of crystal ball gazing. Besides, if you're an "active" player, it's not your entire career - it's your entire career <i>to date</i>. Such contradictory criteria will naturally result in a list of all rookies, a lot of sophomores, and a few players who buck the current long-term trend. A list of former NBA players who have been with one team sounds like a good idea, but it may well end up including everyone who played back in the day when this was a common thing. The same thing would apply to NHL players. <a href="../../../f/l/u/User%7EFluit_5f4e.html" title="User:Fluit">Fluit</a> 21:41, 27 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Rookies, Sophomores, etc. would not apply here. This is a list of players who have played at least eight years with only one team. It is a solid list that will probably always hover around 5 to 15 players. As players such as Garnett, Pierce, etc. change teams, other players (i.e. <a href="../../../d/e/v/Devean_George_4f05.html" title="Devean George">Devean George</a> or whoever else) will surely replace them on the list.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick81aku_221b.html" title="User:Nick81aku">Nick81aku</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENick81aku_a800.html" title="User talk:Nick81aku">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nick81aku_6fcf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nick81aku">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Keep: Well Hirudo, what is wrong with a trivial fact? Wikipedia is full of trivial facts.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The article is not at all <a href="../../../l/i/s/Listcruft.html" title="Listcruft">listcruft</a>. It is easily maintainable and there is hardly a "severe" limitation of those interested in the list. Also, im not sure why this harmless, innocent, uncontroversial, and factual list is causing so much grief? If people feel that it is unverifiable, I can easily explain the rather simple process of producing this accurate list. Also, since this is a quality list, why do those in favor of a delete wish to LIMIT Wikipedia by not including this article? - <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick81aku_221b.html" title="User:Nick81aku">User:Nick81aku</a></li>
