Also note the absence of Japanese genocide (atomic bomb et-all), German genocide (various allied bombings), French genocide (various allied and german bombings), American genocide (various attacks - especially on several islands), Chinese genocide (Japanese attacks), Greek genocide (Soviet invasion in WW2) and how they are not redirecting to <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a> even though mass number of people were indeed killed (some even classified as massacres or even genocides by some communities but not vast majority).<br />

The Turkish pov-push in (their) Armenian Genocide is not "relevant and plausible way for connection" to the current Turkish (again) pov-push for (their, again) Kurdish Genocide? And to think there are books calling Anatolia "a modern Zone of Genocide"... Or did you mistype Armenian for American (which first <i>you</i> brought up as comparable)? Is there really a point when such lame arguments start to bring the feeling of shame, or is this hopeless? You also removed my citation and my quotes on false grounds.

<li>Are you guys voting as a 'revenge' for something in the past. Also, are we supposed to take the following one as a joke: "To vandalise and add Greek POV: This section lists articles that we dont really like. Please change them the way you want. Turkey, Istanbul, Turks, Turkish military." I cannot believe how you guys can agree to have a disambiguation page of a genocide with one of the items being Human rights in X.

That section used to be an independent article called <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdish_Genocide_%28Turkey%29_a861.html" title="Kurdish Genocide (Turkey)">Kurdish Genocide (Turkey)</a>, but after a Turkish outburst it was merged into that article even though the relevant AFDs did not result in such a consensus (an unprecedented move, to my knowledge at least) and it was agreed that the redirects and/or a dab page should remain. This was later affirmed at this <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2006_December_22_12f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 22">RFD</a> which is how this disambiguation page came about.

I am trying to make Wikipedia the most academic as possible, it has nothing to do with "elimination".

<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the AfD of "Kurdish Genocide" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> - I think that it is shameful that so many Greek editors are showing up one after another in some sort of a pie-throwing contest. I completely second what Deniz said above. Closing administrator should also note that the real deal behind this is a debate going on at <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greek_Genocide_85b7.html" title="Pontic Greek Genocide">Pontic Greek Genocide</a> which has been going on for months.

<li>Actually the relevance of Greek opinion on Kurdish issues is well-known. Hell, Ocalan was actually hiding in the Greek Embassy in Kenya when he was caught.

<ul>
<li>Conspiracy theory? Vote-stacking was proven in that AfD - as I said, to keep this AfD focused, it was only a note to the closing admin to check the AfD of the article "KG" (this one was created afterwards, and as such this AfD is the first one for the one with the small "g") <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:40, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Any editor of any nationality can edit here. Anyway, the (ir)relevancy of Greeks is not important. I think you guys should not vote with anything other than the article in your mind. Please once again take a look what you are voting for, a disambiguation page for Kurdish genocide with one of the items being Human rights of Kurdish people in X. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 22:38, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>(edit-conflict) Of course you can vote - but Domitius's suggestion and implication in his vote is also shameful, trying to discredit the Turkish users with words like "TR POV-pushing" and "we have seen this before", when the <i>original AfD was proposed by an admin who is British</i>. As I said, vote along - but I would like the closing administrator to take a look at the vote-stacking that was done in the last AfD and the debate at the PGG article. I invite any of the keep voters to show a press release from any major news organization or et al which refer to the human rights of Kurds in Turkey as "Kurdish genocide" - if not, it is WP:OR and undue weight.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:28, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Im sure the article will get a lot of attention if let be and thus improvement, but that is not a reason to delete it.

<dd>But being a serious encyclopedia is. There are no "agressors" Aristo, as I have stated before, the original AfD was proposed by an admin who is British, not Turkish. That report you have just cited was the only one present in the article to begin with, and this was discussed before - it is not about censorship, but it is also making sure that Wikipedia is not a platform to propogate minority opinions. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, Undue weight and most common name are definitely applicable in this case. I have asked all of the keep voters to show even one major news media release calling the human rights of Kurds in Turkey as "Kurdish genocide", and it has yet to happen. And nobody is fooling anyone Aristo, the only reason why there is such a debate here and why certain editors are interested here are because of the debate at <a href="../../../p/o/n/Pontic_Greek_Genocide_85b7.html" title="Pontic Greek Genocide">Pontic Greek Genocide</a>, thus my comment above to the administrator about this activity bordering on disruption and the turning of Wikipedia to a national battleground. Again, it is really not cool people. How many Turkish editors show up at Greece-related AfDs and consistently vote in a way that would be perceived as "getting one over the Turks"? Come on, I had really thought that we were past this between TR-GR editors in Wikipedia.. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 14:30, 31 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Baris, I really don't agree with the logic that it is not "cool" if Greek users vote here, and that Greeks are "getting over the Turks". I think we already had that discussion, and I really don't think it helps reopening it. I believe that we should focus on arguments and on the dab itself, which I see was also a subject of discussion <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_discussion_Log_2006_December_22_12f2.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2006 December 22">here</a>. Therefore, both the article's AfD and the dab's RfD have a long history where not only Greeks and Turks but other nationalities' users have been involved.

<p><b>Keep</b> - This is merely a disambiguation page at present, and can usefully remain such. I express no view as to whether the Turkish-Kurdish civil war was (or involved) genocide.

<dd>But by having Human rights of Kurds in Turkey in that disambiguation page, we are asserting that "Human Rights of Kurds in Turkey" is a "Kurdish genocide". That does not make sense, I guess what is meant is that there was a genocide against Kurdish people in Turkey. So there is an assertion about that. Also is this any different than making disambiguation pages "X genocide" with items like Human rights of X in Y, where X can be Indian, aborigines/natives in Y, many peoples in Africa and Americas, Y, you name it, US, UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, etc? Do we have such disambiguation pages? Why do we have this? I am not saying that Kurdish people have had no problems in Turkey, but they had presidents, prime ministers, many ministers, many many MPs (probably overrepresented) in Turkey, as well. This is not true in the cases I just mentioned. The problems stemmed in earlier years because of the abolishment of caliphacy and sultanate. Nowadays, it's because of Kenan Evren junta and Turkey-PKK conflict, and also the prevalent feudalism in the region. I don't know much about Anfal campaign, I cannot state whether it can be called a genocide or not. Currently we have basically only Desmond Fernandes who calls what happneded in Turkey a genocide. Unfortunately he does not have a Wiki-article yet. A Google search shows us that "Desmond Fernandes is the Coordinator of the Institute of Tourism and Development Studies, De Montfort University, Bedford, England"</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Complete BS, this is a soapbox article, go to Turkish Republican Library (TBMM Kutuphanesi) and see primary, PRIMARY documents. Any person dying in Turkey is -for some reason- classified as genocide by western scholars. Actually, only 2 scholars just say that Turks killed kurds while the World Genocide Foundation (or whatever) does not recognize this at all. <a href="../../../k/o/r/User%7EKorrybean_3c4f.html" title="User:Korrybean">Korrybean</a> 02:13, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> Clearly there is consensus that there was genocide under Saddam, but I'm not sure if it is appropriate to link Turkey to this. Turkey denies existence of Kurds (calling them Mountain Turks), but unless mainstream sources connect Turkey to actual genocide, it is inappropriate. Nevertheless the title is most often used in connection with atrocities committed by the Saddam regime, so a redirect is proper. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 03:37, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Turkey does not DENY existence of Kurds. As far as I know, Kenan Evren is the only (ex)government official who referred to Kurds as Mountain Turks, and he hasn't been a government official since 1991. I don't think there is a government policy of labeling Kurds as Mountain Turks. All the ethnicities are under one umbrella term, Turkish, which refers to being a citizen of Turkey. You might be referring to that. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenizz_0c80.html" title="User:Denizz">deniz</a><sup><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenizz_ee75.html" title="User talk:Denizz">T</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Denizz_917f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Denizz">C</a></sub> 03:54, 1 April 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are probably right about the lack of government policy on "Mountain Turks", but from what I have read (and I am far from an expert on Turkish matters) government of Turkey does recognise the existence of Kurdish (and Armenian?) ethnicity, so they are only "Turks". This would be similar to French policy in France for immigrant populations, with the exception that Kurds are obviously not immigrants. But also in France there is no official recognition of <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breton_language.html" title="Breton language">Breton language</a>, but in <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brittany.html" title="Brittany">Brittany</a> the French government does not stop the use of the indigenous language. But anyway, I am not saying that "Kurdish genocide" should be used in connection with Turkey. I only suggest a redirect to the Saddam genocide of Kurds. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhorshid_8642.html" title="User:Khorshid">Khorshid</a> 04:08, 1 April 2007 (UTC)</li>
