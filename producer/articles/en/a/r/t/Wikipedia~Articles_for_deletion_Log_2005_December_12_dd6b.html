<p>The result of the debate was <b>redirect</b>. Actually, from a strictly vote-counting POV, that may not be the case. But the redirect argument is strong, the delete argument is not ("non-notable"? May as well say "I wanna delete!"; at least one person should explain <i>why</i> it's non-notable), and the keep argument is really very sad indeed. Okay, so a redirect still appears to get rid of the content, so the deleters will be happy nonetheless, but I felt like making a point. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkGallagher_204b.html" title="User:MarkGallagher">fuddlemark</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarkGallagher_92c6.html" title="User talk:MarkGallagher">fuddle me!</a>) 15:02, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is a strange one. It seems to be a discussion of two different ethnic groups, and then purports to prove that they are the same.... so can probably be deleted as it's not impartial. However, not all the words are familiar to me, and the locations mentioned certainly aren't, so a second opinion from someone who speaks Malaysian rather than Indonesian might be helpful.</dd>

It doesn't really give any futher information about them though. I'll do a proper translation if people think that would be worth doing, but I suspect it would be deleted anyway.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I <i>really</i> don't like 'notable alumni' claims of notability, particularly when there's nothing else there. Everyone starts out somewhere, which means that, IMO, to be unique a place has to produce more than the usual number of notable people and/or should have had a unique importance in their career development. We don't, for example, have articles on every junior football club which had a few boys go on to become famous, because most notable footballers played when they were young and most notable DJs had crap gigs at NHS radio stations at some point. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:58, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I only recently registered an account (I have edited for some time on an ip address), so it might not be appropriate for me to vote on an AfD, but Porno Graffitti does meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. They have released multiple albums on Sony, which is a certainly a major label. (See this <a href="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/eng/" class="external text" title="http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/eng/" rel="nofollow">website</a>.) On the other hand, I would totally agree that the song lyrics ought not to be included in the article. There is also a fair deal of information on the band <a href="http://wiki.theppn.org/PORNO_GRAFFITTI" class="external text" title="http://wiki.theppn.org/PORNO_GRAFFITTI" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Just because Porno Graffiti isn't American and you may not have heard of it, I assure you it's big in Japan. Hell, their song was the first theme music for <a href="../../../f/u/l/Full_Metal_Alchemist_90fb.html" title="Full Metal Alchemist">Full Metal Alchemist</a>, which was the premier anime at the time of its airing.

If the spirit of the wiki is "come, let us add stuff to this stuff to make it good stuff instead of just stuff," then leave it alone, tell people, "Hey, we don't know much, perhaps y'all could help us out," and watch the article blossom?

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I knew that would probably get suggested. I just think it is incredibly unlikely that anyone will be looking up this organization. As you say, though, redirects are cheap.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: There is another reason why I would argue a redirect is preferred/required here: you say that the information has been merged into another article. Because of the GFDL, a merge requires a redirect - we can't delete the old page because the page history for the merged information goes with it. <a href="../../../e/s/k/User%7EESkog_db4a.html" title="User:ESkog">ESkog</a> | <sup><a href="../../../e/s/k/User_talk%7EESkog_7643.html" title="User talk:ESkog">Talk</a></sup> 05:46, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>The main problem with the article is not neutrality. It is the simple fact that the cited source is a book whose publisher is listed as the author himself. Checking, I find that the book was in fact published via a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html" title="Vanity press">vanity press</a>. Whilst it is present in the author's book, on the author's web site, in the author's web log, and on the web site of the vanity press company, there's no evidence that I can find, and (as usual) no evidence provided in the article, that this concept has gained any traction in the world at large outside of its author. Thus, the article is original research, plain and simple. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 03:41, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>--Image77 15:43, 14 December 2005 (UTC)from the author of this article: I will amp up my entry with the logical argument I offer in my book and link to the sources, such as St. Augustine and Stephen Hawking, from which I derive my alternative to Creationism and the Big Bang. I will remove the link to my blog. Today, many authors have to self-publish in order to get their ideas out there. In my case, I also want to keep the rights to my work and not sell them. It isn't always valid to state that a self-published book has no merit on a priori basis, though of course I can understand the perception. If anyone here wishes, I will e-mail you a free PDF of my book for further review. I do work in science. I am not a Ph.D., but I do work in plasma physics. Let me have a few more days before destroying my article with asteroids, foreign objects, etc. My e-mail is secretsoflight@gmail.com</p>

<p>I came across this while scrubbing for unsourced images. While I'm sure there are mask fetishists out there, with sites on the internet to cater to their tastes and everything, I'm also sure there are fetishists who like to strap chicken livers on their chests, too. I did some googling for this and found 148 references to the phenomenon, many of which were wikipedia mirror sites. Fetishes almost by definition are unusual, but this particularly seem to me to be a sufficiently widespread fetish (compared to, say, <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foot_fetishism.html" title="Foot fetishism">Foot fetishism</a>), and I am always aware of the likelihood of commercial trawling with this sort of thing. So I'm bringing it here. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 03:02, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>My vote is <b>delete</b>, for now.

<li>What I find fascinating is that if you add "-site:wikipedia.org" to the query, you lose about 55,000 of those hits. Which is a pretty scary number. If you also exclude the word "latex" from the search, you lose another 40,000 hits ("latex mask" fetishism is apparently a specific, different thing). <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 04:51, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't wanna accuse you of dishonesty, so assuming good faith, you apparently made some error in your search. When you eliminate all results from wikipedia.org you only lose around 3,000 out of the total of 138,000 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Mask+fetish%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Mask+fetish%22+-site%3Awikipedia.org&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 06:27, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

From the results page: <i>"Results 1 - 10 of about 83,800 for "mask fetish" -site:wikipedia.org. (0.09 seconds)"</i>.

<li>PS - Do you have any evidence that "latex mask fetish" is not just a subset of "mask fetish"??? <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 06:33, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good point. I think that it would be a subset of both latex fetish and <a href="../../../m/a/s/Mask_fetishism.html" title="Mask fetishism">mask fetishism</a>. Kind of a combination perhaps?

<li><b>Delete</b> Gimme a break. I think it is a nonsensical argument that because this activity exists in pornography it should have an entry in an encylcopedia. Not every sexual fetish deserves an unique article (complete with drawing). C'mon people. Maybe this should be a brief description on a sexual fetish page or something. It cant be an article by itself. Consider that there are no articles on "squeezing zits". This is an activity that many teenagers and adults do too. Would anyone think that is a worthwhile encyclopedia entry?</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically though, cum fart is more dicdef than anything else. Moreover, it is a made up term used by the pornography industry to market particular types of porn. This term cannot be cross-referenced. It is more of an advertising gimmick than anything else. Dec 19, 2005</p>

<li>I am going to hazard a guess here. But someone who is looking at porn and sees one of the strange words that they use and goes "What the hell is this?", and then realises that typing "Cum fart" in to a search engine leaves them with nothing but spam so they go to see if Wikipedia can help them out. "Ah thank god I finally know what that means", they say. Of course, if you're not looking at porn, you're probably not going to worry about this kind of thing.

<li>Personal tastes really shouldn't dictate what articles are kept and what are deleted.

<li>The article cites no sources that can be used to verify that this is indeed what a cum fart is. I've looked for sources, but I'm stymied by the fact that searches turn up reams of <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keyword_stuffing.html" title="Keyword stuffing">keyword stuffing</a> web pages (some even on U.S. government web sites) that are filled with long lists of pornographic keywords and no actual content. As such, the article is unverifiable. There <i>may</i> be something known as a cum fart, and this <i>may</i> be it. (Conversely, this may be just a meaningless phrase that the keyword stuffers in the Internet pornography industry add to their lists simply because people search for it.) But without sources it is impossible to verify. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 09:59, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, I am not sure that a cum fat is the same as a creampie. A creampie is when a man's semen is left inside a vagina (or anus), while a cum fart is the act of squirting it out. Therefore they are complimentary, but are not the same term, and hence a redirect is inappropriate. I will see if I can look it up. By the way, creampie is much more commonly used. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I know this is a bit disgusting to some, but here is a review of the title "Cum Fart Cocktails", which I think describes the topic: <a href="http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/reviews/read_review.dlt/sku=10637/cum-fart-cocktails.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adultdvdtalk.com/reviews/read_review.dlt/sku=10637/cum-fart-cocktails.htm" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>. In other words, yes, it is a real term. You also might be interesting in reading Adulf Friend Finder's definition of what a cum fart is <a href="http://adultfriendfinder.com/intgroups/in30/sp62275340_54573/tymember/acmember_article_search_by_handle.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://adultfriendfinder.com/intgroups/in30/sp62275340_54573/tymember/acmember_article_search_by_handle.html" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. Also, here is a whole range of "cum fart" porn videos: <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/browsecat.asp?style=ice&amp;cat=8655&amp;cart=292187998" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cduniverse.com/browsecat.asp?style=ice&amp;cat=8655&amp;cart=292187998" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> (i.e. it is a category of pornography). The question should be whether to keep or merge with <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creampie.html" title="Creampie">creampie</a>, since many people seem to use the two words interchangeably, but not everyone does. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:21, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment</i> -- but the article doesn't say that it's limited to non-Muslims mentioned in the hadith. The title, and the article, could refer to any interactions mentioned in any historical source. Nor is it clear how you're going to perform the gargantuan task of combing the many thousands of hadith in the six Sunni collections, and the various Shi'a collections, to pull out the names you want. As for limiting it to hadith -- what about sira? Ibn Ishaq, Tabari, Waqidi, and Ibn Sa'd all mention non-Muslims -- mostly Arab non-Muslims who were either inhabitants of Mecca before the Hegira, or those killed in the course of the ten years of warfare that occupied Muhammad's last ten years of life. Are you going to mention all those names? That's thousands. If the article is only going to mention the <i>notable</i> non-Muslims, then there's no need for the list, as anyone notable is going to be mentioned in the various articles on early Islamic history. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 09:07, 13 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I said nothing about excluding non-hadith literature. If you find anything outside it, then please add that as well. If the list is geting to big, then it can be either split into sub-articles or trimed by notability. Standard wikipedia procedure, in other words. Im personaly not going to sift through hadith literature with the specific aim of finding names, rather, when i make a article or stumble on a notable name, i link it to that list. The list of schools. Also, even if we only had a few notable names, it still would merit a list, lists are useful for finding information, much more than doing timeconsuming searches that are bound to be less complete than a list. I cant belive i need to justifie the reason to creat lists or explain how wikipedia handles large ones...--<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 13:56, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I've got to out myself here as a wrestling fan, obviously -- everything I said above was off the top of my head, as I didn't think the same exacting standards applied to a discussion like this as would apply if I were actually editing the article. (I am not, by the way, particularly a fan of Meltzer, but everybody who's plugged into the wrestling world knows at least a fair amount about him.) Anyway, let me elaborate and see what I can dig up right now.
<ul>
<li>Meltzer's newsletter is self-published and exact circulation figures aren't available, but this message board <a href="http://wrestlingclassics.com/cgi-bin/.ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=5;t=005308;p=" class="external autonumber" title="http://wrestlingclassics.com/cgi-bin/.ubbcgi/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=5;t=005308;p=" rel="nofollow">[20]</a> puts it at anywhere from 6,500 to 7,500 -- which falls well above the minimum-circulation guideline -- and says Meltzer makes more than $200,000 a year from it. Indeed, I've heard it's been his full-time job since 1988. Meanwhile, his latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582618178/qid=1134425247/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-3747685-7391124?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582618178/qid=1134425247/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-3747685-7391124?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> was published by Sports Publishing, whose website <a href="http://www.sportspublishingllc.com/index.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sportspublishingllc.com/index.cfm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a> reveals it has also published autobiographies by <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Tarkanian_2473.html" title="Jerry Tarkanian">Jerry Tarkanian</a>, <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Rodman_c3a9.html" title="Dennis Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/k/Mike_Ditka_2b0c.html" title="Mike Ditka">Mike Ditka</a>.</li>
<li>Meltzer is often referred to as something like "the world's foremost authority on professional wrestling," often by respected media sources. I base my estimation -- which, again, I would not put in the article itself, as nobody can really say who's the world's foremost anything -- on the simple fact that he is the individual most quoted by the media about wrestling. (This is largely because <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wrestling_Entertainment_4940.html" title="World Wrestling Entertainment">World Wrestling Entertainment</a>, which has a virtual monopoly on big-time wrestling in the U.S., maintains tight media control.) A Google News search for "Dave Meltzer" sorted by date <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dave+meltzer%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=pn&amp;scoring=d" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?q=%22dave+meltzer%22&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tab=pn&amp;scoring=d" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> reveals dozens of quotes from Meltzer in non-wrestling media in December 2005 alone. Something I thought was very telling was a Google Books search for Meltzer's name <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dave+meltzer%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" class="external autonumber" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22dave+meltzer%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">[24]</a>. On the first results page alone, there are mentions of Meltzer in no fewer than four wrestler autobiographies published by WWE. Considering that WWE as a company has a very negative attitude toward journalists like Meltzer who are critical toward them, this is a very big accomplishment. WWE doesn't publish many autobiographies, either, so Meltzer -- who has never been employed by WWE or any other wrestling organization -- appearing in four of them is a somewhat staggering number.</li>
<li>A "cult following" is hard to nail down, but nearly every person on the Internet who reviews wrestling matches -- some of whom have, with some success, published their own books <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806524375/qid=1134426432/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-3747685-7391124?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806524375/qid=1134426432/sr=1-3/ref=sr_1_3/104-3747685-7391124?s=books&amp;v=glance&amp;n=283155" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> -- consciously borrows from Meltzer, the man who essentially invented reviewing wrestling matches. You can't really find a wrestling message board in which Meltzer's name isn't lovingly bandied about, usually stated simply as "Meltzer" or even just "Dave." <a href="http://the-w.com/thread.php/id=27823" class="external autonumber" title="http://the-w.com/thread.php/id=27823" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> I've personally heard people tell me about trading copies of Meltzer's newsletter with others, but I can't seem to verify that with any online sources. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterofzen_45b5.html" title="User:Masterofzen">Masterofzen</a> 22:41, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>By the way, from that aforementioned Google Books search, here's a great quote about Meltzer's significance that would be a fine addition to the article. It's from the New York Times No. 1 bestselling autobiography of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Foley_9e70.html" title="Mick Foley">Mick Foley</a>, the former WWF world champion:</p>
<p>I was at Brian Hildebrand’s in the early summer of ’88, when I saw him reading a strange publication called the <i>Wrestling Observer</i>. I had heard about these “dirtsheets” (inside newsletters) that “exposed” wrestling to its readers, but had never actually seen one. At the time, these sheets were probably read by fewer than a thousand people, but nonetheless carried a lot of weight in the business. Men as important as Bill Watts were known to change the company’s direction if the sheets didn’t like what was going on, while many others swore they’d kill the guy who wrote it if they ever found him. In 1990, the guy, Dave Meltzer, introduced himself to be in Greensboro, North Carolina, and I was shocked that he actually appeared in public. I thought he was like Salman Rushdie of <i>The Satanic Verses</i> fame.</p>
<p>“Hey, Brian,” I said, “could I take a look at that thing when you’re done?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” he replied, “you’re in it.”</p>
<p>“I am?” I asked in disbelief. “For what?” Before he could answer, I changed my mind. “Never mind, I’ll read it myself.” When Brian handed me the sheet, I took it to a place where I could concentrate, and it was there, on the bowl of the Hildebrand house in Pittsburgh while squeezing out a solid Snow, that I read the biggest compliment of my young career. “Cactus Jack, who many consider to be the best no-name independent in the country.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it—as much as the <i>Observer</i> was maligned by people in the business, a wrestler getting a favorable write-up was like an actor getting a good review in the <i>New York Times</i>. Whether it was coincidence or not, I’ll never know, but interest in Cactus Jack picked up immediately. --<a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMasterofzen_45b5.html" title="User:Masterofzen">Masterofzen</a> 22:56, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Extremely Strong Keep</b> Dave has an influence on the way wrestling is portrayed to the average fan today. The rise of the internet and along with it the breakdown of <a href="../../../k/a/y/Kayfabe.html" title="Kayfabe">kayfabe</a> all helped tear down the wall of "hiding the fake." The knowledge of this type of lingo and news was often brought forth to the fans by Meltzer in the early days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is some further info from sportsbyline.com which is a sports-talk radio network "heard on nearly 200 radio stations and by 2.2 million listeners per week" (<a href="http://www.sportsbyline.com/history.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.sportsbyline.com/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportsbyline.com/history.htm</a>) on which Dave hosts a weekly wrestling show on Sunday's.</p>
<p>The show, which was the most listened to internet-generated talk show from late 1999 through 2001, moved to radio in March of 2002 and is the place where the most serious wrestling fans in the world talk about the unique sports entertainment form and its incredible popularity. Meltzer is considered the pioneer of pro wrestling journalism. A lifelong fan, Meltzer began writing about wrestling at the age of ten in various newsletters and fan club publications. While attending San Jose State University and reporting for the Oakland Tribune, Meltzer started the Wrestling Observer Newsletter in 1982. It was the first publication that covered pro wrestling that made no excuses about the industry being entertainment as opposed to sport, including coining the term "athletic entertainment" to describe pro wrestling, a term later changed to "sports entertainment" by Vince McMahon. The Observer remains the publication of record within the pro wrestling industry, read by nearly every serious fan and student of the game around the world.</p>
<p>Meltzer is joined every Sunday night by Alvarez, an independent pro wrestler who puts out the newsletter Figure Four Weekly, the most hilarious weekly look at pro wrestling around the world. In recent polls, the Observer and Figure Four were rated as the two most popular pro wrestling weekly publications in the world.Meltzer is considered the leading independent expert on pro wrestling, and has been featured in Sports Illustrated and on Entertainment Tonight. His book, "Tributes," was the best selling pro wrestling book in late 2001 and early 2002. He's been on every major network newscast as well as the Phil Donahue Show, numerous specials on pro wrestling from A&amp;E, Court TV and the Discovery Channel, quoted in publications such as TV Guide, Rolling Stone, New York Times and Newsweek and appeared in the two leading documentaries on wrestling, Wrestling with Shadows and Beyond the Mat. Alvarez adds tremendous insight to the show as well as humor, making the two hours fly by every Sunday night.

<li>I bet that half of Wikipedia articles are not documented according your criteria, so why pick on this one in particular? Furthermore, if a radio show compiles a list of worst songs, then in all probability there ain't gonna be no "page number" or "publishing company"!

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article is encyclopedic and has plenty of potential, and meets none of the criteria for deletion.

A fair length of time is required between nominations. For example, I'd love to nominate Category:LGBT criminals, Category:LGBT murderers, and Category:LGBT serial killers for deletion this minute, but because two of them somewhat recently survived VfDs, I'll wait until a safer amount of time has passed. And it's even worse in this situation, where the circumstances <i>haven't</i> in any way changed since the last nomination. Where's the justification for attempting to defy a clear consensus like this? Even if you honestly think an article shouldn't exist, you must work <i>within</i> the system to seek its deletion, not try to bend the system to your wishes and force things to go your way through sheer persistence. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 16:12, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> My apologies, I cleaned up "list of painters" yesterday (standardised the entries, renamed it to "list of painters by name" and made "list of painters" the master list (redirecting to other lists)). The former "list of painters" contained a quick list of famous painters, so I thought I'd make a seperate article on that.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I have no strong view on whether the article is of encyclopedic importance, but it certainly should not be deleted on a language basis. The "Indian" words (all <a href="../../../s/a/n/Sanskrit.html" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, I believe) look correctly transliterated, and none have English equivalents. If worth keeping, this may call for either links or for expansion by way of explanation, but those words should stay. The article is about a (quite long) line of succession among (presumably Hindu) monks.

<li><b>Keep</b> While there has been some recent vandalism I have been trying to keep the article as accurate as possible with non-POV material. For some reason, people are saying I'm vandalizing (might be a bot) by reverting the damage. The fact is Allied Precise Gunmen has been around for 5 years and in games such as America's Army is fairly well known. While by no means is it a famous gaming organization, it exists and for all interested bodies, should be researchable in Wikipedia. As long as all information is accurate (mind you the recent vandalism) and written in a non-biased perspective, I see no problem. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.37.248.150 (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.37.248.150.html" title="User talk:69.37.248.150">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.37.248.150_0efd.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.37.248.150">contribs</a>) 16:33, 12 December 2005.</small></li>

Otherwise, come back after you win some big tournaments or expand into hundreds of members over 5 more years.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Not very many Google hits, but deffinately notable and verifiable. He was a part of the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Lufthansa_heist.html" title="Lufthansa heist">Lufthansa heist</a> (which happened way back in 1978 - likely why so few Google hits). From the article: "About $5 million in cash and $850,000 in jewelry was stolen from the Lufthansa airlines cargo terminal, making it the largest cash robbery in U.S. history. Most of the stolen goods were never recovered. The planning and aftermath of the heist was depicted in the 1990 film Goodfellas." Sounds pretty notable to me! Also found this interesting link <a href="http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters/lucchese2/" class="external text" title="http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters/lucchese2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I'd say at the very least (if it's not kept) then redirect and merge into Lufthansa heist, but I'd think it'd make more sense just to keep the stub and let it expand. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 08:31, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Del</b> for now. It was i who tagged it as speedy (&amp; maybe i need to raise my threshhold under A7). If you can't extract 5 words that are more convincing than the article &amp; what you've said from your BBC report, i'm not going to consider going &amp; reading it. There's been no indication of notability other than being arrested, and unless i am mistaken about the chaotic and enormously repressive internal politics of Algeria (where it's claimed rightly or wrongly that the country was saved from One man, one vote, one time) that would make enough Algerians notable as to overwhelm WP. I won't consider him notable if they kill him, if that and "notable IMO" is all that can be said abt him.<br />

<li>Hmm... a good number of the results appear to be context ads as cached by Google.

<li>Wavering between neutral and weak keep. The company is neither public, nor multi-national; however, AFAIK they basically invented a new service that similar existing service companies then had to match, which does seem somewhat noteworthy.

<p>There are inconsistencies in the Bibles. So what? Only a fundamentalist of some kind would deny this, or try to explain it away, and only somebody polemicizing against fundies would need to stress the issue. For the rest of us a well-referenced, critical treatment of the Bible is no different from a well-referenced, critical treatment of Homer, Icelandic sagas or any other old literary works containing a mixture of mythology, legend and some actual historical events. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 14:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Well, applying that logic, if I look up your name on google and it gets less than 1000 results, you should be deleted? Also, Chef Brian, with " before and after, scored 78 000 hits on my google...<br />
Maybe there should simply be an article about all the characters in CAD. That would make a bigger article and not have to delete anything.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b>. The hell does that even mean, "you should be deleted"?

<p>Vanity Page. Page advertises a very expensive holiday. At this point there is a very short track record and an entry here would be seen to be promotional in the furtherance of extending the short life span of this trip. As a general rule a cycling event should have a minimum track record of at least 10 years before being considered for an encyclopedic reference. For example Boston-Montreal-Boston has been running since 1988. This is a randonnuer challenge event which is similar to Paris Brest Paris - PBP. PBP is included in Wikepedia however BMB is not and that latter event now has a high profile within the cycling world because it is run annually while PBP is quadrennial.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The event has a reasonably high public profile in Southern Africa, and gets a more than respectable 35,000 hits on Google.

<li>Both Google and Guiness Book of Records are dubious references for an encyclopedia that takes itself seriously. That hit count referred to on google searches for all phrases Tour d'Afrique, including tour d'Afrique de George Bush. A significant portion of the references on google are to the use of that phrase in a context that has nothing to do with this trip. As for the Guiness publication, let's not lose sight of the fact that this book was originally designed as a promotion to sell beer. What measures do you have to gage its popularity in Southern Africa? As far as I can tell this trip is largely a vanity exercise by well-to-do people from first world countries and not from Southern Africa. ATA Girl 17:14, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes this is my first proposal for deletion. I have made contributions before but a profile was never required as is the case when proposing a deletion. And I take this quite seriously. The rebuttal doesn't deal with the issue raised about google, nor does it deal with the vanity issue. The M and G article is quoting the company's press release when it says 8 of the 51 (not 60 as is misquoted) participants are from South Africa. The reference to 60 is the maximum they can take so obviously the intent of the article is to sell spaces. The M and G itself describes it as pretty much what it is, a sight seeing trip. . ATA Girl 19:16, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am aware of no definition of "sightseeing" that includes 150km a day by bicycle from Cairo to Cape Town. The entrant limit probably represents the resources of the organizers to provide water and possible emergency care across the length of the Sahara desert. The event also provides bicycles as transportation to health care workers and promotes ecologically conscious transportation methods. Whether one views this as a distance race or a charitable tour, analogous events in my own country are noteworthy - and cover only a fraction of this distance. Just to make sure I checked several South African sightseeing tours. <a href="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10591" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10591" rel="nofollow">[48]</a> <a href="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10928" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10928" rel="nofollow">[49]</a> <a href="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10589" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bicycletour.com/BTmain.asp?Option=Detail&amp;Detail=10589" rel="nofollow">[50]</a> Whatever you've been smoking, you should sell it in Amsterdam. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 08:52, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There are lots of sightseeing trips around the world of that daily distance. That is not a particularly grueling distance nor are the conditions when you compare it to riding in other regions. The living conditions are likely quite gruelling but that is not about a bike race. The fact of the total distance is interesting (for the few who complete it), the location is interesting.</dd>

<dd>The article quoted above in the M and G says "Cyclists will witness amazing sites on their journey and travel past game reserves and ancient temples, across the foothills of Mount Kilimanjaro, and along the ancient landscape of Ethiopia’s Simian mountains and the edge of the Botswana’s Kalahari.". This is a travel promo. There is no emphasis on the competitive element in that article. The article explains the range of participation methods, racers, non racers, part way participants. In reviewing the company's web page (which now links to another vacation)it's clear that only a few participate are racers and even fewer complete the whole distance. It is described as a charitable tour and and promotion of ecological transportation (by you and others). The only qualification for participating is that you be over 18 and pay the freight. There appears to be no standards, disqualification rules etc. And it's not cheap. The racing component is minor. The fact that it is included under cycling race is not in my view appropriate. Frankly I don't know where it would belong which is why I proposed it for deletion rather than suggesting a move. If there is no home for it then it seems to me to be a vanity article.</dd>

<li>Nope, not convinced, sorry. To my mind this meets Wikipedia's inclusion criteria; don't forget that our definition of encyclopaedic here includes almanac-style material such as this. As regards the potential for this list to get out of date, most lists of information have the potential to change over time; I don't understand what marks this list out as special. Your objection re: unstated date can be dealt with by the citing of the source as per Wikipedia policy; I find the argument that the arbitrariness of the date of sourcing invalidates this information curious; most information in Wikipedia first appeared on an arbitrary date, to some extent, and if it goes out of date, we update it.

<li>I think you are confusing two issues - whether the information itself is encyclopaedic, and whether presenting it in list form is the best way to include it in Wikipedia. DUNS numbers sound like pretty encyclopaedic things to me, but a page of 2.7 milion of them just wouldn't be practical. The telephone number comparison is just muddying the waters; most telephone numbers belong to non-notable private individuals, so why would we want to list them here? There is most definitely argument by assertion going on in the top part of this page. There is also some more detailed reasoning, true; however, we should be able to audit our deletions back to policy, and just giving reasons which are, or appear to be, plucked from thin air, is just as bad, IMO. <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 10:11, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no confusion in my mind at all. The existence and usage of SWIFT numbers in unquestionably encyclopaedic, a list of them is not. The difference is the same as that between <a href="../../../y/e/l/Yellow_Pages_f2fd.html" title="Yellow Pages">Yellow Pages</a> and the contents of the Yellow Pages. Bear in mind, too, that the December 3 <i>update</i> (changes and additions only) runs to <b>16 pages</b>, and the full list is available only by subscription (read: original research). What we have here is a small and random sample of SWIFT numbers allegedly correct as of an unstated date.

<li>Yellow Pages is a good analogy, thanks for bringing it up. I think that not only is the existence of the Yellow Pages encyclopaedic, so is much of its content. How we include that content in Wikipedia is the issue i.e. presentation. I don't see anything in the original research policy which says that material which is best obtained through subscription doesn't count as a valid source. Almost all scientific journals operate on a subscription basis, for instance. Where would we be if we deemed articles based on material in scientific journals to be original research?! <a href="../../../s/p/-/User%7ESP-KP_2816.html" title="User:SP-KP">SP-KP</a> 16:15, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>There is no confusion in my mind either. Individual bank branches are not considered encyclopedic by most (see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>), so their phone numbers are not either. Nor are lists of their phone numbers. Small banking companies are also not typically considered encylopedic (see <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> again), so their DUNS numbers are not either, despite your assertion, even though DUNS numbers as a topic, are. I feel this proposed deletion (should it happen) is "auditable back to policy" or at least back to guidelines, CORP is just that, a guideline. You may not agree which is fine but hopefully this discussion will help other editors formulate their thinking and comments. NB, I am pretty inclusionist and I STILL think this ought not to be included. Also, were I to stipulate your assertion that SWIFT numbers were encyclopedic I would still argue that your second issue/question: "presenting it in list form is the best way to include it in Wikipedia" is answered "no". This list is large and changes rapidly, and the fragment here is out of date and not amenable to keeping up to date.++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a> 16:19, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Borderline speedy (nonsense). Blargh is a made-up onomatopoeia. Some currency for "an exclamation indicating that one has absorbed or is emitting a quantum of unhappiness" (emanating originally from MIT and/or a blogger by the looks of it) but this definition is (a) apparently spurious and (b) a neologism which is unlikely to be welcome at wiktionary. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the guy that wrote the article.

We get a million pages like this a day on wikipedia (most of which are admittedly put up by the page's creators looking for attention, which is why I assumed the same motives for this page).

<li>Comment: I actually thought it was funny because, not only is this being discussed in the Village Pump news (with 4 different articles about it - that's more coverage than the Seigenthaler story got), there is actually now a project to respond to it, and this project is massive. So the choice really should be whether to call this Wikipedia Class Action or Wikipedia Class Action org. That's it. The fact that someone has put up a spoof web site on Wikipedia Class Action .com suggests that org is the right name, but otherwise no. Also, remember that Quake Aid has a valid reason to want to sue Wikipedia as they feel that their charity was misrepresented by Wikipedia (the fact that IRS and FBI haven't closed them down suggests that outside of Wikipedia they are actually believed to be a real charity!). Not only that, there's a lot of people (at least 15) who are individually threatening to sue Wikipedia. So even if this is just a joke (which seems somewhat unlikely to me), the reality is that wikipedia is going to be sued in the future. Whether that's class action or just regular individual law suits I don't know. But this does need to be included to aid in discussion. If we wipe this, how can Wikipedia hope to answer the law suits? Wiping this could mean the end to Wikipedia. I know, that's all doomsday-ish of me, but you know, it might. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 12:58, 19 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Fran's was a chain of 24 hour diners, something like the Golden Griddle. Used to have about half a dozen restarants around town. I remember at least Yonge &amp; College, Yonge &amp; St. Clair, and Yonge &amp; Eglinton branches.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Fran's is a very well-known institution in Toronto, and is a piece of local history. It went bankrupt a few years back, and was reduced to one location. When a second location opened last year at Shuter and Victoria, it received a fair amount of media coverage. The chain has a lot of local notariety -- people either love it or hate it. The article right now is just a stub, but could be made into something quite worthy. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:36, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
<p>I just noticed that the external link in the article (which links to a piece in Eye, a local paper) even says the following in the first line: "For 52 years, Fran's Restaurants has been a Toronto landmark, as much a part of the city as the Leafs or High Park." <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:37, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>When I was nine years old, growing up hundreds of miles from Toronto, I already knew what Fran's was. It <i>really</i> is <i>that</i> famous. To have <i>lived</i> in Toronto without ever having heard of Fran's, when I'd heard of Fran's before I'd ever been here for a <i>day</i>, frankly suggests that someone — either the nominator or me — is living in an alternate version of reality that doesn't even faintly resemble the one most people live in. I'm not entirely sure that things of purely local notability <i>really</i> deserve articles, but when an article is nominated for deletion based on reasoning that's so wildly out of accordance with my own understanding of things, a <b>keep</b> vote is really the only thing I <i>can</i> do. If I'm the one living in a weird mirror universe, so be it. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 23:19, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> To suggest that its as much of a cultural institution as the Leafs are is pure patent madness - doing a quick survey of a half a dozen friends who all lived in Toronto for 15+ years, not a single one had heard of it. I just made the natural assumption upon seeing a random looking article about a restaurant I've never heard of that's in the city I grew up in and live in - that it was a vaniety article placed there by someone affliated with the restaurant. With a number of Torontonians (and non-Torontonians!) having at least heard of it, it may be worthy of an article, though it'd be nice if the article somehow distinguished its importance compared to say, Hollinger's or Ted's Restaurant. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilyD_17e3.html" title="User talk:WilyD">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WilyD_d35f.html" title="Special:Contributions/WilyD">contribs</a>).</small> <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 16:16, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I find the comments that Torontonians haven't heard of it to be suspect. <s>Keep in mind that these comments come from an anonymous editor, and the nominator, who seems to be new to Wikipedia.</s> Fran's is a Toronto institution, and anyone who has lived here for any period of time will know of it. New arrivals may not know it because the chain was shrunk down to one location recently. It is the sort of place that I take out of town visitors to for a diner breakfast because of its heritage. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 16:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'll withdraw that comment on the basis of WilyD's comment below, which show that the nomination was made in good faith. I don't think that it is unfair to point out that a nominator is new because a new user may not be familiar with the deletion process. Furthermore, new users may, in some cases, be sockpuppets. In WilyD's case, however, I am sure that s/he is legitimate. I will point out, however, that notability has <b>not</b> been accepted by the Wikipedia community as grounds for deletion, no matter how much people keep using it as their reason for deleting an article. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 17:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but I haven't found any mention to notability on the first article you indicated. Could you please point it to me? Thanks for providing the link to the poll, I wasn't aware one had ever ocurred. However, Wales' opinion, with all due respect to you, is a) irrelevant, since I don't work for him and neither follow his guidance in any way; b) not suited to this occasion, since he talks about fame and importance, and we were talking about notability, which is a diferent concept. What is being discussed here is not wether Fran's Cafe is famous (ie, lots of people from Toronto have heard about it), but wether it is notable (ie, it stands out from all the other hundreds or thousands of Toronto restaurants). I don't mean to be rude, Ground Zero, and I hope you don't take offense on what I have said. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 22:56, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

Another way of putting it is that lack of notability is not an accepted grounds for deletion -- it's not in the policy on deletion. The Jimbo Wales thing was for interest only, and not intended to be for guidance. "Fame and importance" and "notability" were being used interchangably in that debate, I think. I don't see how you've been rude, and I haven't taken offence. If you'd be so kind as to point out how you've been rude, however, I'd gladly taken offence since I am so accommodating.&#160;;-) Regards, <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 23:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Actually, the unsigned comment was my bad Ground Zero. It is true that I'm fairly new to Wikipedia, having joined only a couple of months ago. This is, in fact, my first nomination under AfD. It certainly seems fairly certain the consensus will be to keep, and I'm not particularly opposed to it, given the large number of opinions that it has significance. However, multiple users making the assertion that one can't live in Toronto and be unaware of the place is awfully strange - maybe it's a generational thing? I'm 23, and no one I asked about it was older than about 27 - mayhaps I should ask my grandparents if they've ever heard of it? If it historically was a somewhat big deal, but is just faded into obscurity, that would make more sense to me - but to claim is as much of a landmark as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_bc61.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> or the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Maple_Leafs_%28baseball%29_9728.html" title="Toronto Maple Leafs (baseball)">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> is pretty absrud - I'd even find it tough to believe it has as much cultural significance as the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Lynx_5f88.html" title="Toronto Lynx">Toronto Lynx</a>. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 16:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You could ask your parents, too. They should know. If they don't, they should get out more. The Wikipedia article makes no claim to Fran's being on a par with either Leafs. The <i>Eye</i> article calls it a landmark, and "as much as part of Toronto as the Leafs". This may be an exaggeration, but I'm not here to defend <i>Eye</i>. The <i>Eye</i> reference serves only to support the claim in the Wiki article that Fran's is a "historic restaurant chain". <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 17:42, 14 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seeing as how Fran's has been at Yonge + College for ages, just a block or two away from Maple Leaf Gardens, hockey fans likely filled up Fran's before and after the Leafs games for decades. As much of an exaggeration as the <i>Eye</i> reference might be, I am sure that there are thousands of older hockey fans in this city who think of Fran's when they think of the Leafs. So, the reference might not be as absurd as some people are suggesting. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 22:31, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mild Keep</b> I have been going to restaurants in Toronto for upwards of 30 years, and I have not been to Fran's, but I do know of it, however it's not famous to suburbanites. I've been here so long, most of the great restaurants of Fran's age have all closed down leaving me in the lurch. I would guess downtowners would make more of a historical fuss about it. I've had to move on to the newer restaurants, very few of which are here on Wikipedia.

<li><i><b>Keep</b></i> I hate Fran's, but it's definitely a cultural landmark. Speaking of the Maple Leafs, my memories of Fran's are intertwined with Hockey. My dad used to take me to Frans for a milkshake after taking me to a Leafs game at Maple Leaf Gardens.

<li>NIMTO is not a neologism as it has been in use since at least 1999 when it appeared in a learned journal published by the UN (IAEA). IF anyone wants it I can dig out the exact reference. Also in the waste disposal community it is already well known, <a href="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/LEACentral/Acronyms/Part2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/LEACentral/Acronyms/Part2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/LEACentral/Acronyms/Part2.htm</a>.
<ul>
<li>Added above site as reference on NIMTO page. <a href="../../../d/-/r/User%7ED-Rock_0358.html" title="User:D-Rock">D-Rock</a> 23:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, I'll assume good faith and remove the neologism claim. <a href="../../../d/-/r/User%7ED-Rock_0358.html" title="User:D-Rock">D-Rock</a> 23:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In some ways I would say that terms like NIMTO and CATNIP are part of 'gallows hummor' which exist in some parts of the waste, chemical and nuclear industries. <a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 22:58, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Also the NIMTO page brings together several ideas which together make something which I think will be interesting<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 22:58, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> article has one reference (which I added), and espouses theories-- it is still original research. <a href="../../../d/-/r/User%7ED-Rock_0358.html" title="User:D-Rock">D-Rock</a> 23:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say that the article is not original research, NIMTO might be a new word to many people but it sums up something which many people have experienced in their lives. I have added an anylisis which considers the possible origins of NIMTOism, the anylisis is based on S. Freud so prior art exists. Hence it is not original thought being presented here.<a href="../../../c/a/d/User%7ECadmium_6e55.html" title="User:Cadmium">Cadmium</a> 12:16, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

You should note that most <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic.html" title="Psychic">psychics</a> are considered to be propheteers, since they ask you for money in return for your fortune. The phrase, which is a combination of "prophet" and "profiteering" is a way of describing a false prophet who makes money out of it. Sometimes it is used to refer to people who are real prophets but make money out of it anyway. For example, someone who can read tarot cards might well be real, but they are still making money out of it when they perhaps shouldn't be. This is actually a HUGE debate in the <a href="../../../p/a/g/Pagan.html" title="Pagan">pagan</a> community as to whether or not people should charge for their "gift". Propheteering is, obviously, a derogatory term. The term is usually used to refer to Christians, but the meaning is used to refer to pagans a lot more than christians, and indeed Christians use the meaning of it as a derogatory way to be dismissive of pagans generally. There was a movie which went in to this concept quite well, and used the word "propheteering". The movie, now, I have to remember it. It had <a href="../../../s/e/a/Sean_Connery_c5ee.html" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a> in it and was about a dragon. Ah yes, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragonheart.html" title="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</a>.

<li>I assure you that this is not "meatpuppet/sockpuppetry." It is true that BWW is being primarily supported by the Willamette Student body, but each student is acting on their own accord. Also, look to the fact that people from other schools have even stated that they know of BWW.158.104.76.254 07:50, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a recognized tradition at Willamette University. As for your comment about the IP being the same as an edit to Willamette University, our University only has a certain number of external IP addresses thus many users operate under the same IP for Wikipedia <a href="../../../a/h/i/User%7EAhimsa52_e7fd.html" title="User:Ahimsa52">Ahimsa52</a> 10:09, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Why is this a cause to delete the article? Almost all wikipedia articles about universities and colleges feature segments that are not "notable" outside the instition's own community. Your vote delivers two messages: 1) BWW is a tradition, just not a "notable" tradition. this contradicts the reason earlier stated for the deletion of this article, because BWW is, in fact, not a "hoax." 2) If BWW is "non-notable outside a small University community," then the easy answer would be to move the article to the Willamette University article; but your reasoning does not justify the deletion of this article. with respect. 158.104.76.254 10:24, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s></b> and to the chorus of comments below, have a look at Wikipedia's policies. Personal testimonials don't help to keep the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Objections base on Wikipedia's policies are unfounded. The only complaint that could concievably be levied is that of original research. Especially now that Willamette's Residence Life department is patrolling the internet and busting students for what they post it is understandable that there is no news coverage. Things that shape the lives of more than a fifteen hundred college kids at Willamette and countless more at other universities mentioned below, add UCSC to the list should be apart of wikipedia. When was the last time you saw beer pong or kings cup in the New York Times. Newspaper coverage is overrated. Long live BWW 158.104.76.84 19:51, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> BWW is a popular event and those who have not heard of it directly or participated in it soon will. For consistency, if wikipedia is going to delete this, it must delete every reference to all traditions, because not all traditions are practiced by everyone. 158.104.76.9 20:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC) (Seconded by "Patstaboo")</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Are you guys kidding me? This is a big deal at willamette and i hear at other colleges as well. I think its ridiculous that you would limit something just because you don't partake in it. I think this would say a lot about wikipedia and what types of speech are censored. BWW recognizes those that are less fortunate. If wikipedia takes this away, it is saying "impoverished people are not worth our consideration and there is nothing that we, yuppy computer owning, internet surfing people, can relate to them on."

Additionally, even if only at Willamette, it is still of cultural importance. Only two more days to BWW and you know I'll be there. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.76.84 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.76.84_572b.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.76.84">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Honestly what kind of encyclopedia nazi's are these people, is this not a site to inform people on all topics all over the world. just because you dont participate in or you frown down upon something does not make it cease to exist. Maybe there is no huge cultural significance behind bum wine wednesday that shapes the greater american society, but does that mean that there is not a group of people in this world who every wednesday drink a bottle of bum wine? yeah there are, your stuck up snobbery doesn't change that. so do me a favor next time you feel important about yourself for doing some lame tradition you participate in, just realize i very easily could think your customs are a hoax. dont think for a second that just because main stream society may participate as well that it justifies your actions, hiding among a group is for cowards. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.77.77 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.77.77_ff88.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.77.77">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I too oppose the deletion of the Bum Wine Wednesday article for a multitude of reasons. It must be realized that BWW is in no way a "hoax." BWW is a growing tradition at Willamette University and is spreading quickly. The tradition first began in the smaller WU dorms and houses but is now a wednesday night tradition that is practiced in almost all dorms and now, frats. BWW is also a drinking tradition with a heart. A major part of being a "Bum Wino" is giving to the needy. after buying bum wine at a local store (or what have you) participants are encouraged to give their change to the homeless. Further more, because of the Bum Wine Wednesday article more students are becoming aware of the tradition and as a result it is growing more (for example, students are now starting up "BWW Chapters" in Michigan, Montana and other schools around the northwest. I assure you, this is no "hoax." <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.76.254 (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.104.76.254.html" title="User talk:158.104.76.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.76.254_e425.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.76.254">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I would like to address the "Author" of the Bum Wine article. Your article, while entertaining, does not make you an expert on college drinking habits. Simply because you know what kind of brands are considered "Bum Wine" does not mean that you are an expert in Willamette University's drinking traditions. The fact is that BWW is a Willamette University drinking tradition. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.76.254 (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.104.76.254.html" title="User talk:158.104.76.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.76.254_e425.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.76.254">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It would seem that the only reason that people can "justify" deleting this article is because they cannot find references to it anywhere else. This, of course, is to be expected. I find it very hard to believe that every "certifiable" tradition has a web-site in its honer or is referenced in articles and journals. Do you think it would be very likely that Bum Wine Wednesdays would be featured in a local paper? Probably not. Is it likely that a drinking tradition would have its own web-site? Probably not. Is it likely that a drinking tradition would be talked about all over the web, etc? Again, probably not. I think a much stronger case needs to be made in order to justify the deletion of this article, and the people who want to delete this article (for some muddled reasons that have yet to be fully explained or justified) must also refute the case that has thus been put forward. Additionally, I find the sudden urge to delete this article as random and unwarranted. A few simple searches reveal that much less substantiated claims about other universities and colleges around the US are made on Wikipedia and go unattacked. Examples are: "Rumor has it they have pretty good curly fries too (disputed fact)." - Lewis and Clark College, or "Famous on-campus myths claim there exist an intact MG under the concrete foundation of the college library, an underground primate lab working exclusively with snow monkeys under the Psychology building (the legend states that the presence of this lab was discovered when a snow monkey escaped into the Canyon and necessitated the closing of the facility), and a four-story lab/habitation arcology under the Physics building. There are many other such stories, often referred to as Reed legends." - Reed College... the list goes on, of course. Have any of these "myths" and "facts" been thoroughly checked by those people want to delete this "hoax?" I sure hope so; if not, then it seems that there is yet another reason for why this article should not be deleted. And lastly, if this article is in fact a "hoax," then why are so many people willing to say that they go to Willamette and know that BWW is a true tradition? And why is someone willing to actually do more research and contact alumni about the matter? It would seem that BWW is a Willamette Tradition and there seems to be no evidence to the contrary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.76.254 (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.104.76.254.html" title="User talk:158.104.76.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.76.254_e425.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.76.254">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>"I was the original author of the article. I've received messages warning me to stop "vandalizing" pages. I apologize for the miscommunication. I was unaware creating wikipedia entries on college traditions was somehow bad. After all, wikipedia happily hosts articles on drinking games like beer pong, kings, quarters, and even dartmouth pong, a derivative of Beer Pong unique to Dartmouth. Surely BWW, spread through several schools around the country (now including the University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, and the University of Georgia), is more deserving of webspace than the equally unconfirmable "dartmouth pong". It's natural that BWW would not occur in other mediums. After all, college administrations are not likely publicize the drinking habits of their students. Wikipedia should be the proud host of the first articles on BWW and other growing cultural phonomenon. However, the extent of the debate on this page ought to justify the continued presence of the article. If this many people feel compelled to speak on the issue, there must be some degree of veracity. Veracity to which I, as one of three cofounders of BWW, can personally attest." &lt;nicholas r&gt;158.104.72.33 10:05, 13 December 2005 (UTC)&lt;/nicholas r&gt;</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Oddly enough, all of the 158... addresses are from Willamette Univesity. How coincidental.

<li><b>Comment</b> You seem to be suggesting something sinsiter Zoe. We are not denying that 158... is at least the Salem/Kaizer area and includes Willamette. We are Willamette students who wish for a tradition which started here and is at least present at other universities in the western United States to be allowed by a website that also allows such traditions as &lt;Dartmouth Pong&gt; which has no relevency outside the university at all. On a side note, feel free to email John.

<li>No one has claimed that every college student everywhere takes part in BWW. You are simply attempting to create a stick-man that you can discredit, but you seem to misunderstand what BWW really is; BWW is a drinking tradition at Willamette University that is gaining ground around the country. Look the the post from the U of Montana student who says he has heard of BWW. I think that proves the BWW is a growing and well-founded tradition. If your only complaint is that BWW is not celebrated by every college student in the US, then why not just move the article to fit under the Willamette University article and have a segment explaining that BWW is rapidly growing. And finally, Google is not the only source of information that exists. Please provide another reason, other than a simple Google search, that explains why the BWW article should be taken done. Then look to the fact that Alumni, WU students, and college students from around the country have come forward to say that they know that BWW is a tried and true tradition.158.104.76.254 00:51, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I wish to respond to the comments made by "Zoe." First, Zoe, it is silly to suggest that the Bum Wine Wednesday article is "advertising." Is Willamette University in the pocket of bumwine.com? I doubt it. In fact, that's just not true. To the extent that this is your only reason you give for wanting to delete the article, I would ask you to reconsider. Secondly, your "comment" about how WU computers are being used is offensive at best. First, your analysis is flawed because, as stated above, students all over campus and in the area share IP addresses; not every student is using a WU computer, most are using their own, private computers. Second, even if students are using WU computers, it doesn't matter. There is no policy at WU that states that students can't use school computers to edit, etc. wikipedia. Third, your claim that BWW is a "hoax," but you fail to explain why; you fail to refute any of the claims made by people who oppose this article's deletion, and you fail to explain why a "hoax" would be defended in such great numbers. Lastly, I am both offended and disturbed that you would, in effect, threaten those of us who are trying to have a reasonable ant thoughtful conversation on why we believe the article should remain. I find it hard to believe that you would try to stiffle discourse with petty threats. Please, in the future, try to make a point instead of threatening people with threats that, in fact, have little or no backing.158.104.76.254 00:41, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems BWW is even practiced in little old Helena, MT. Yes, it is growing. And I think the fact that "Dartmouth Pong" stays should mean this ought to stay also. BWW even has an activist element to it. Give change to the poor. Patstaboo 02:29, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> So after 24 hours I see: 7 <i>delete</i> votes (including my nomination); 2 <i>keep</i> votes from registered Wikipedia users at Willamette; and 4 <i>keep</i> votes from anonymous users on the Willamette University network. But I still have not seen any source for the claim that this is a widespread tradition. I have no doubt at all that it is a Willamette University tradition, but as such it belongs on the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willamette_University_0dd4.html" title="Willamette University">Willamette University</a> article, not in its own page. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 05:11, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks Tim. At least some progress has now been made. I think that it is very important that BWW has now been recognized as a WU tradition and as such is a a true tradition. We know now that, at least, the BWW article should not be removed from Wikipedia. I think that most of us would be content to see the article moved to fit under the Willamette University article. I would still contend that BWW deserves its own article, though; simply because of the fact that numerous people from around the west and north west have come forward to say that they too participate in BWW. I hope that i do not come accross as asking for too much, but I just feel that I should voice my opinion. But, I would be happy if 1) the article was moved (for the time-being until more proof comes forward that BWW is more wide-spread than simply WU) to fit under the WU article, and 2) BWW was allowed a link to the Bum Wine article since it is a related subject. I just want to state, again, how happy it makes me that there is now some signs of progress and compromise. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 158.104.76.254 (<a href="../../../1/5/8/User_talk%7E158.104.76.254.html" title="User talk:158.104.76.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_158.104.76.254_e425.html" title="Special:Contributions/158.104.76.254">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Honestly, I don't think there was ever a real question of whether this information belonged in the Willamette University article. Please feel free to move the information there and redirect Bum Wine Wednesday to <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willamette_University_0dd4.html" title="Willamette University">Willamette University</a>. But I recommend including at least one independent source for the Bum Wine Wednesday tradition, or some other editor may think that it's a hoax and revert it as well. <a href="../../../t/w/p/User%7ETwp_3cd5.html" title="User:Twp">Tim Pierce</a> 19:38, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, the notability requirements laid out in the discussion on Webcomics are still in flux and not accepted by everyone. More to the point, even if this webcomic could be considered notable (which I doubt), the author is entirely nn outside of this (she lost her job, she writes a comic), which means this should be either userfied or redirected to the webcomic in question. With respect to the webcomic criteria, I think the gist of concern is that there is an extremely low barrier to entry for webcomics, like podcasts and blogs. As a result, the standards for inclusion as worth encyclopedic treatment need to be correspondingly high. Obviously, however, I understand if you disagree and choose to take a more inclusionist line. Since I have been outvoted on this one, it doesn't make much difference anyhow. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 15:49, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

It's not notable, and doesn't warrant including in <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, as it's not actual criticism. It's exhortation of others to criticise. Within Wikipedia, we have a policy regarding legal threats; it's counterintuitive that external legal threats towards Wikipedia should warrant their very own article. At the very best, it should be merged, but this isn't a merge vote.

The ONLY reason some might consider it 'notable' is because it involves Wikipedia, but generally articles aren't kept on another subject's coattails.

If it was "Disney Class Action", and still had ZERO coverage like this does, I can't imagine anyone voting to keep. Anyone can register a similar website and make similar claims. I have a registered domain www.{nameofstatewiderabblerouser}sucks.com, but that doesn't make it as notable as {statewiderabblerouser}.

<li>If this is truly a "Message From God", then what God said cannot possibly be anything but what he really said. And saying what God said cannot be plagarism. Are the Bible author plagarists for interpreting what God said, even if what God said has been taken out of context for years? It is not possible to plagarize God. - Paul

<li>You stole this material from another source and inserted it into your "urban legend" hoax. Whether the material is true or not is irrelevant. It's still plagarism. --Mensanator 06:01, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since God created it, it cannot be plagarism. It is impossible to plagarize God. We don't even know God exists. Plus: The bible writers wrote things that God said. That's plagarism, but I don't see God coming down from the sky with a big lightning bolt or anything. -Paul</p>

<li><b>Don´t delete</b> What about trying to reproduce on a running PDP-8? Rainer</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, Rainer, if it was an urban legend and God wrote the message, it might be an example of EVP, except relating to a computer. I have heard of events whereby God has communicated to people over the old BBC Micro computers in the 1980s, so if it really happened as suggested by the urban legend, then compiling the "@" symbol would not be viable because God himself wrote the message. I am assuming it is not an easter egg left by a PDP-8 programmer, nor it is something a Fortran IV creator would have left in the source code for the compiler. The only explanations which cover this are: Either Gustav was hallucinating (PDP-8 programmers were known to be overworked/taking drugs) or God really did communicate with Gustav. We cannot be certain, however, because his diary of the events has since been lost. Unfortunately, this is just computer lore. - Paul</p>

<li>The votes for deletion are supposed to be a discussion about the merits (or the lack of them) of keeping an article. When someone votes without stating any basis on their vote it seems that the votes are...well... baseless. What is the value of a baseless vote? Therefore, what's the point of voting without stating any motive behind it? So, in the next time you vote please consider taking some time to reflect on the subject instead of mindlessly jumping the gun. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 23:09, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>read parent comment above. If someone participates on a public vote and discussion about a change in a community, it is expected that the voter bases his/her/its vote on logical arguments and therefore fundaments his/her/its vote. If the voter doesn't vote based on any logical argument, why is he/she/it voting in the first place? The objective is to induce positive change and that can't be achieved with users casting mindless and baseless votes on the elimination of content. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 03:21, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus keep</b>. While I found the arguments for deletion strong (and struggled to find any arguments for keeping at all), there is clearly a strong contingent of people who feel the article should be kept. It can still be merged with <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_impersonator.html" title="Elvis impersonator">Elvis impersonator</a> or similar at a later date, mind you. Before saving this edit, and getting on with finishing the procedure for closing an AfD, I thought it would be appropriate to clear up some misinterpretations of the AfD process. Ready?</p>
<ol>
<li>AfD is <i>not</i> a vote.</li>
<li>You <i>are</i> obliged to explain your "votes", otherwise they may not be counted.</li>
<li>A vote tally at the top is inappropriate and silly. It gives the people discussing the article (not all of whom will be experienced enough with AfD to realise it's not a vote) the wrong idea, and puts undue pressure on the closing admin to count votes without engaging his/her brain.</li>
<li>Well done to <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">User:Just zis Guy, you know?</a> for eventually pointing out the exact policy-based reasons for nominating the article for deletion.

<li>I think there are valid grounds for deletion - this is (to my mind) an indiscriminate collection of information, and unencyclopaedic in concept. It's trivia. But it's more that there are no valid grounds for <i>inclusion</i>, as far as I'm ocncerned. As to "objecting to my approach", I don't know what that is supposed to mean, other than an assumption by you of bad faith. I'm sure that's not what you're saying, so please clarify. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 18:20, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I see a list that's been around for 15 months with numerous contributing editors. They evidently saw some significance for the info. Then you show up and nom for AfD, without any preliminary message on talk page, without looking for a possible merge for the info or new direction for the list. This was not a vandal page or hoax, which might justify that type of rush to AfD. I strongly oppose this approach, because it insults the intelligence of certain contributors and drives them away from Wikipedia.

<li>I see your point. On the other hand, there is a large community of people who seem to view Wikipedia as a place to store trivia. Out of interest, have you ever tried persuading the contributors on a list-of-fictional-trivia to do something else with it? I'm curious. Personally I could not see anything much which <i>could</i> be done with this, but then I am very much in favour of "real" information and I'm not a fan of WP being primarily an encyclopaedia of teenage male fiction and pursuits.

<li><b>Delete</b> - certainly has claims of notoriety. I just read what <a href="../../../l/27/%C3%A9/L%27%C3%A9minence_grise.html" title="L'éminence grise">L'éminence grise</a> means. Influential in government circles? Woah. But then, let's see, born 1985 - surely he'd have to be at least mid 20s, but more realistically mid 40s to have that kind of power. And the only 3 references to him on the net were these 2 photos: <a href="http://www.kuca.co.uk/node/257" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kuca.co.uk/node/257" rel="nofollow">[77]</a> and <a href="http://www.kuca.co.uk/node/258" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kuca.co.uk/node/258" rel="nofollow">[78]</a> and this review by him <a href="http://animalreviews.zelica.net/reviews/weasel.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://animalreviews.zelica.net/reviews/weasel.htm" rel="nofollow">[79]</a>. Whilst the undercover influence might not be in google, if he was linked to presidential campaigns (especially at the age of 14 or 15, as he would have been in 2000), I would have expected them to be in Google. They aren't. So this is, quite obviously, a hoax. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZordrac_cad8.html" title="User:Zordrac">Zordrac</a> <a href="../../../z/o/r/User_talk%7EZordrac_4e96.html" title="User talk:Zordrac">(talk)</a> <small><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD" class="extiw" title="m:AWWDMBJAWGCAWAIFDSPBATDMTD">Wishy Washy</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Darwikinism" class="extiw" title="m:Darwikinism">Darwikinian</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="extiw" title="m:Eventualism">Eventualist</a></small> 11:11, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
