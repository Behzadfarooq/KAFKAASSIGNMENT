<li><b>Delete (as nominator):</b> I forgot all about getting back to the AFD I was about to start, so here's my reasoning, there is no commonly recognised "Eighth Wonder of the World". Anyone can call themselves an "Eighth Wonder", heck even <a href="../../../j/e/r/Jerry_Springer_2f00.html" title="Jerry Springer">Jerry Springer</a> is introduced as so at the start of his show. In comparison, articles on the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World_704c.html" title="Seven Wonders of the World">Seven Wonders of the World</a> refer to lists compiled by notable <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">people</a> or <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">organisations</a>. "Eighth Wonder" is simply a <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a> label often self-applied and an encyclopedia shouldn't be acknowledging everyone or every place that's been described as so. -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 08:57, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for reconsidering. About the declarers thing, a lot of the citations I found were rather vague -- a lot of "considered to be the eighth...", "called the eighth...", "known as the eighth," which allows inclusion on Wikipedia, but not as having been declared by a specific person. I'm not sure that many of them even have a notable historical figure that used this particular appellation (the list's entry for the Thames Barrier originally claimed that Elizabeth II called it the eighth wonder, but I couldn't find a citation for it, so I took it out). I'll keep checking around, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 04:53, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> "the rule of inclusion will always be subjective" -- it isn't subjective at all. The rule for inclusion, like everything else on Wikipedia, is whether a reliable source has identified the subject as an Eighth Wonder. This isn't Wikipedia editors deciding what ought to be on the list. I agree that the reliable source calling it an eighth wonder is somewhat subjective, but that doesn't at all make it inadmissable at Wikipedia; if it did, we wouldn't be able to quote album reviews or editorial remarks because they are POV. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 12:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per Robert West. This isn't an encyclopedic list, it's a list of X with unassociated value Y where the unassociated value is a purely subjective phrase, a cliched advertising slogan. Use of the phrase Eighth Wonder is possibly notable by itself as a well-known 19th century slogan but this article isn't about the Eighth Wonder concept, it's just a list of uses of the publicity. <a href="../../../m/l/a/User%7EMLA_c48d.html" title="User:MLA">MLA</a> 09:36, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

You're both right, the list would indeed be inexhaustible, and the phrase is even now simply used to flaunt tourist traps in the article. The phrase is notable, but the alleged Eighth Wonders themselves aren't, and any mention of the phrase itself could probably be better made on the <a href="../../../s/e/v/Seven_Wonders_of_the_World_704c.html" title="Seven Wonders of the World">Seven Wonders of the World</a> article. --<a href="../../../s/0/u/User%7ES0uj1r0_a0cf.html" title="User:S0uj1r0">S0uj1r0</a> 10:50, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Robert West. Hopelessly POV and/or vanity. The fact it has citations fails to give it meaning or encyclopedic value.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see your point, but your friend isn't a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>. Citing the <i>New York Times</i>, ESPN, and the Catholic Encyclopedia is a lot different. I also fail to see how citing reliable sources in support of the article makes it POV or vanity; indeed, it prevents those things by creating a strict guideline of inclusion. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 12:35, 11 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Au contraire, my friend is an excellent source with great credentials. You see the problem with this list, yes you do. It's never-ending, always somebody's POV no matter how ponderous his/her resume may be, and you probably even see the irony in having 50,000 (or even a dozen) "Eighth Wonders of the World"! <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 04:24, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that you're confusing the POV issue. Yes, it's an inherently POV statement to call something the Eighth Wonder of the World, but our <i>sources</i> are not held to <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>; only our editors are. As editors, we can't state categorically that X, Y, or Z <i>is</i> the Eighth Wonder, but we <i>can</i> say that A called X the eighth wonder, assuming that A is a reliable source. Consider, for example: <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_considered_the_worst_ever.html" title="Films considered the worst ever">Films considered the worst ever</a>, <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_deities.html" title="List of people who have been considered deities">List of people who have been considered deities</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_incidents_famously_considered_great_blunders.html" title="List of incidents famously considered great blunders">List of incidents famously considered great blunders</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_who_have_been_considered_avatars.html" title="List of people who have been considered avatars">List of people who have been considered avatars</a>, <a href="../../../p/l/a/Place_names_considered_unusual.html" title="Place names considered unusual">Place names considered unusual</a>, and I could list dozens of others. I'm not implying that this article should be kept merely because there is a precedent, but that all those articles display other people's opinions. As long as they are reliable sources -- and I hope that comment about your friend was in jest, otherwise you severely misunderstand <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> -- their characterization of a particular subject is admissible. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 14:57, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - no, I understand <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> quite well, thank you, but it is clear that irony does not communicate well. The fact we can admit to the inherent POV and RS problems here, yet people look away at the end result, bespeaks to underlying problems. <a href="../../../t/y/c/User%7ETychocat_4dd9.html" title="User:Tychocat">Tychocat</a> 11:44, 13 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Again, I disagree that there are any POV or RS problems; citing someone's opinion is a perfectly reasonable thing to do and falls right in line with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. Saying "The <i>New York Times</i> has called this film 'a masterpiece'" is perfectly fine to state in an article if it is sourced, just as is "The <i>New York Times</i> called the Thames Barrier the Eighth Wonder of the World." Yes, that's the point of the view of the <i>Times</i> writer, but I defy you to show me a policy page that says we don't include other people's published opinions on Wikipedia. What are these "inherent POV and RS problems" you claim to exist? <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 13:55, 13 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for noting that. National Geographic has used the "8th Wonder" tag for King Tut's tomb, the pyramids at Teotihuacan and the Great Wall of China, as well as the Escorial. Either the sources are self-contradictory, or the term conveys no real information. For this reason, <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_peacock_terms_1e8b.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid peacock terms">Peacock terms</a> should be avoided, even when they can be cited to a normally-reliable source. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Other_comments" title="WP:V">Verifiability is a necessary, not a sufficient condition for inclusion</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_A_West_5940.html" title="User:Robert A West">Robert A.West</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_A_West_1984.html" title="User talk:Robert A West">Talk</a>) 03:08, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In theory, a good article about the metaphor might be appropriate, but that is crap. Plus it has become such a buzzword, that famous instances of the metaphor being used are just background noise nowadays. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 15:02, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting article regarding a commonly used phrase. It's a list of places that <i>refer to themselves</i> as the 8th Wonder, and as that I don't see any problem whatsoever with it. They don't have to "be" 8th Wonders (who decides that?), the claim itself is interesting in explaining the common usage of the phrase. I was actually reading about Wonders of the World here a while ago and spent a lot of time following links from that page. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 12:51, 13 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> By your argument, we could also have a "list of models who refer to themselves as beautiful". See the problem? -- <small><span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><b><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></a><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:#003333; color:White">&#160;►&#160;</span></a></span></small> 05:06, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. There is nothing interesting about that variant though, beautiful is a very commonly understood notion applied to an almost infinite number of things. In the case of the Eighth Wonder, there actually is no Eighth Wonder, despite it being a proper noun and a title. Obviously comparatively far fewer things exist that people would assert are the Eighth Wonder compared to things asserted beautiful, meaning the list is not only much more manageable but much more useful because of the rarity of the phrase. If you wanted to sort the page into things called the Eighth Wonder by third-party print media (ooh, let's) and those that merely claim themselves to be, fine. But I think both are useful for illustrative purposes. --<a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERankler_6eec.html" title="User:Rankler">Rankler</a> 01:56, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. Netsnipe, though "list of models who refer to themselves as beautiful" is obviously a pretty dumb article to create, it can still be verifiable and NPOV and all the rest. The only difference between that article and this is that "models who refer to themselves as beautiful" is a pretty useless and unencyclopedic topic -- who would ever need it? -- whereas "Eighth Wonder" is such an obviously commonplace expression (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-26,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22eighth+wonder+of+the+world%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2006-26,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22eighth+wonder+of+the+world%22" rel="nofollow">300,000 Google hits</a>) that its inclusion on Wikipedia would clearly facilitate encyclopedic understanding of the common phrase. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 03:16, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Rankler is incorrect in stating that the citations are only from the subjects themselves. The only times when the subjects' official sites are used is when they are quoting <i>someone else</i> (e.g. Akshardham), or when they make a broader statement like "X is widely known as the eighth wonder of the world," and in those latter cases, there is an independent citation backing the official one up (e.g. André the Giant). <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 12:43, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
