<li>The opinions of people have <i>already</i> accrued two "you're gonna get blocked if you keep that up" warnings, when their first-<i>ever</i> Wikipedia edit was less than 24 hours ago, kinda sorta tend not to be taken as seriously as the opinions of people who've been around here for a few years, and know how things work, and have established relatively trustworthy reputations.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Being a candidate does ot amount to notablility. However, incumbant people do a lot of work, which if notable, should be documented. Stress is on the notability of the work done by them. Candidates can't do much with respect to notability in being a candidate unless they are engaged in some historic battle, which does require notability out of candidature. -<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbuj.saxena_5aa8.html" title="User:Ambuj.saxena">Ambuj Saxena</a> (<a href="../../../a/m/b/User_talk%7EAmbuj.saxena_92b0.html" title="User talk:Ambuj.saxena">talk</a>) 07:25, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I just wanted to bring to everyone’s attention that <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Greer_3d7b.html" title="John Greer">John Greer</a> a candidate for councillor in Toronto posted his own article in Jan. (which he admitted in the talk page). Soon after he posted it someone put it up for deletion. Even though he posted it himself the article won the debate to stay an article since he is a current candidate for councillor in the 2006 municipal election. With all do respect to Greer he really has not accomplished enough in the past to be an article and is pretty non-notable. His won the debate to stay so shouldn’t Ruffolo’s also? --Eyeonvaughan 09:01, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It hasn't won any debate — there hasn't <i>been</i> one. Somebody <i>suggested</i> on the talk page that it should be listed on AFD, but as of today nobody's ever actually listed it for deletion. Frankly, I sincerely doubt that it <i>would</i> survive an AFD, but being here because nobody's nominated it for deletion in the first place is hardly the same thing as actually surviving an AFD. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 09:11, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
