<li><b>Comment</b>The writer has won three Palanca literary awards (not one as mentioned by the anonymous complainant) and he has also won 5 times in the Catholic Mass Media Awards in three years for his columns. The CMMA is the most prestigious mass media awards in the Philippines, testament to a writer's integrity and quality of writings. The Philippine Star is a major newspaper, and he writes a column here. It is strange that a person would complain about this entry, because this Wikipedia is only for reference purposes and the Wikipedia is not a "Who's Who" of celebrities, but a source of useful informations.</li>

<p>It is strange that someone is spending time to erase this entry on Wilson Lee Flores for seemingly invalid reasons. I do not think a person should be mentioned in Wikipedia just because he or she has the most number of yahoo or google entries, this is not wholly rational. He is an interesting and a major newspaper columnist nd multi-awarded writer. I agree, the complaint seems quite out of place and unnecessary.</p>

<p>In the rules of Wikipedia for inclusion of biographies, one of the criteria stated includes--- "Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work". Wilson Lee Flores has authored five (5) books published by De La Salle University Press, which is part of one of the top universities in the Philippines. He had published thousands of newspaper columns, essays, articles in local and international publications which help shape public opinion.</p>
<p><br />
In my casual research of Google, there are 714,000 hits on the name Wilson Lee Flores. But since I don't have time to go over the entire contents, I didn't have time to verify how many are "unique" hits. However, there was never any mention in the criteria for Wikipedia biographies that an entry should have the most number of google hits of whether a million or ten million. I also read that Wilson Lee Flores is President of Anvil Business Club, a major business organization in the Philippines whose induction of officers in July 2005 was hosted by Philippine President Gloria Macaopagal Arroyo in the Malacañang presidential palace at a 3-hours formal dinner. Among the guests included foreign diplomats such as the Singapore Ambassador, cabinet officials, legislators, heads of foreign chambers of commerce such as the British and Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce and others. This event was on primetime television news and reported in major newspapers such as Philippine Daily Inquirer and Philippine Star. He is not only a multi-awarded writer, but a leader of a major business organization. <small>The above comments were all generated from the same IP address.</small></p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - this is exactly why I listed the entry here for community-wide input on a keep/delete decision. I did not, however, anticipate this apparent <a href="../../../s/o/c/Sockpuppet_%28internet%29.html" title="Sockpuppet (internet)">sockpuppetry</a>. Votes are coming into this AFD from anon IP editors whose only contributions are here and at the Flores entry. One anon editor entered his first comment down at the bottom, then went back up near the top to stick a second vote – four minutes later – in an attempt to vote twice. Musicloverasia has only one edit (at the time I wrote this), and it's the "keep" vote just above this comment. (New editors, all your edits are tracked and kept pursuant to the GFDL license.) There's absolutely nothing wrong with the Palanca Award - but I had never heard of it before reading this entry, and I still don't know much about it other than it's a Philippine award. Flores won his three all in the same year, 1987, and they were all for essays, not books. He won 1st and two other essays tied for 3rd place that year.</dd>

<dd>I listed this here because I just don't know if he meets the notability threshold or not. If the man is indeed notable enough to include in an encyclopedia, let's keep the entry, by all means. On the other hand, I have trouble keeping it if most of the votes here are from meatpuppets. I hope we get more unique votes. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 22:49, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> ...This is blatantly a vanity page. Information seen here only seems to laud the said person. Google search shows 281 hits since the person is a columist of a newpaper wherein he is a contributor, these topics were simply written by him. Secondly those voting to retain or keep the said articles are from the same ip in which User|124.106.237.43 has several comments &amp; votes to keep or retain. Others are anonymous and unsigned. I would surmise that the author of this topic ( or probably Wilson Lee Flores himself) is the one defending and giving positive comments on the topic since the comments seems to be very detailed. Whereas most unique votes has voted to have it deleted.I have read the said article and I feel it does not deserve to be retained. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 58.69.18.27 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_58.69.18.27_3913.html" title="Special:Contributions/58.69.18.27">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The five books authored by Wilson Lee Flores are publicly on sale in Philippine bookstores, and those were published by De La Salle University Press. This fact can easily be verified by any person because De La Salle University Press is connected to one of the best universities in the Philippines. It is possible that the entry on Wilson Lee Flores was originally written by others, but the said subject had perhaps edited it himself in more details and probably over enthusiastically without fully knowing the rules of Wikipedia which correctly states that the point of view should be neutral. In objective assessment of this subject, he is an award-winning writer and author who merits mention in Wikipedia. A mention in Wikipedia is not to praise or to laud a person, that is why the point of view should be neutral and the entry should be edited in its point of view, but to delete it for wrong reasons is also wrong. That is just my honest and unbiased opinion. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by MusicLoverAsia (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MusicLoverAsia_485d.html" title="Special:Contributions/MusicLoverAsia">contribs</a>) .</small>

<li>Thanks. So he did win three prizes, but in a single year and in the fairly minor category of Essays.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is becoming utterly hilarious. We are not nominating this writer for a Nobel Prize for Literature. Isn't his having won five times in the most prestigious Philippine journalism awards---the Catholic Mass Media Awards---enough to merit this article? The way some naysayers are so vehemently nitpicking makes this seem like a deliberation for the Nobel Prize or Pulitzer Prize. First there was a claim the books are non-existent, then those are now being criticized...there was an earlier claim that he won one Palanca award, when there were three awards...but now this is questioned because they were all won in one year...this discussion is becoming too hilarious, don't you think? I suggest we be objective and less trivial, let this article be and move on to more important things.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Pathetic excuse to let the article remain, as mentioned WP is informative, just put his name in the Palanca link (which is already the case) and thats it. Why does the article have to mention so many other events of this authors life which is hardly worth mentioning and quite ordinary to say the least. I would rather the author just reveal himself to the discussion group and not use anon ip and pseudonyms. I think this is an ego matter. So lets end this articles misery and as what the comment above says move on since if we leave this in other administrators who sees this article will nominate it for deletion again.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree that editing be done to ensure a neutral editorial point of view, perhaps that's the main problem of the complainant. The writer's having won 5 times in the Catholic Mass Media Awards seems to be noteworthy, not just his Palanca Awards, since it is without doubt the most important journalism honor in the Philippines attesting to integrity and excellence. I suggest that this fact not be ignored. I had already checked the credibility of the Catholic Mass Media Awards, and the Philippine media had reported his wins in recent years, and those awards should not be belittled even by the complainant against this article being in Wikipedia. The writer or his friends might be wrong in over enthusiastic descriptions of the writer before---and I agree those should be properly edited---but it would be equally wrong to be biased and to personally attack the writer's credentials or his works. Let us also not be guilty of being biased or frivolous in our criticisms. Thanks for allowing me to share my opinions.</li>
