I would appreciate your comments on the new article's talk page on whether you think it is a good idea. However, I now think that I may have been looking at the internal link issue from the wrong angle. Instead of creating new articles about each SI, wouldn't it be better to link to the <i>subject</i> of the SI? For example, I have now added links from the commencement orders to their associated Acts where the orders can be mentioned in a new section. As you will now see by looking at the 1996 List, the number of relevant internal links has increased markedly. This should improve even further once we begin to identify other relevant pages the remaining SIs can link to. <a href="../../../r/o/a/User%7ERoad_Wizard_b7b6.html" title="User:Road Wizard">Road Wizard</a> 21:01, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</font></dd>

<dd><font color="#FF0000">The author doesn't understand categories either. There was precisely this argument when categories were first created. What JzG does not seem to understand is that categories are for existing articles. Lists are often more comprehensive and cover things that haven't had articles written about them yet. Sometimes they also cover things that as individual items do not necessarily justify their own articles but that collectively it is useful to have listed. This is one of those cases in that there are many SIs which amend earlier SIs and do not in themselves deserve articles, but the whole list of SIs is a useful resource. There are some SIs which do deserve their own articles since they cover significant areas of legislation. The <a href="../../../e/n/v/Environmental_Information_Regulations_2004_ffd5.html" title="Environmental Information Regulations 2004">Environmental Information Regulations 2004</a> are a case in point since they define a very important information access regime in the UK. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Newton_8a3b.html" title="User:David Newton">David Newton</a> 08:22, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</font>

<dd><font color="#FF0000">Yes, the author uderstands categories. They are self-maintaining. If a Wikiproject wants to make an article in Project space on the notable SIs which need articles until they are done, that's just great. This list is never going to be filled in more than a very small percentage of cases (they are not even redlinked)) and adds nothing to the list of SIs at the linked sources from whihc it was copied and pasted (hint: if you find yourself copying and pasting a substantial chunk of text into an areticle, that is almost certainly a sign that what you are doing is wrong). OPSI can be relied on to maintain an up to date list, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a mirror or directory.

<li>Tentative <b>merge</b>. Pembrokeshire seems to suffer the same problem as <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancashire.html" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>: tons of "village in ..." stubs. However, much of the <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire.html" title="Pembrokeshire">Pembrokeshire</a> coast is the property of the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Trust_for_Places_of_Historic_Interest_or_Natural_Beauty_8a06.html" title="National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty">National Trust</a>, part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park and/or on the Pembrokeshire Coast Path. If you poke around on the national park's webpage about the <a href="http://www.pcnpa.org.uk/website/default.asp?SID=1109" class="external text" title="http://www.pcnpa.org.uk/website/default.asp?SID=1109" rel="nofollow">coastal path</a> the interactive map thing yields up (reluctantly - I imagine it works better with IE) a fairly sizeable article on Newgale Sands which says nothing about surfing but instead explains its geology, a drowned forest (no self-respecting west Wales beach lacks a drowned forest), a washed-away pub, and describes it as the western end of the Landsker Line. Okay, so skip the pub and we have the bones of an article there. This isn't the only Pembrokeshire article we have which is barely a stub: <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barafundle.html" title="Barafundle">Barafundle</a> is probably more well-known, but <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penbryn.html" title="Penbryn">Penbryn</a> is another, and we don't even have a <a href="../../../b/r/o/Broad_Haven_b063.html" title="Broad Haven">Broad Haven</a> yet. But if it's not possible to expand this article much further than the notes above, I think it may well be better to merge it into <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire_Coast_National_Park_78c7.html" title="Pembrokeshire Coast National Park">Pembrokeshire Coast National Park</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/m/Pembrokeshire_Coast_Path_7c26.html" title="Pembrokeshire Coast Path">Pembrokeshire Coast Path</a>, or National Trust property in Pembrokeshire (currently doesn't exist), depending on which of those it fits into. <a href="../../../t/e/l/User%7ETelsa_283c.html" title="User:Telsa">Telsa</a> <a href="../../../t/e/l/User_talk%7ETelsa_ea14.html" title="User talk:Telsa">(talk)</a> 06:33, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This brings up a point which I'm not entirely clear on. I've seen similar hoax articles speedily deleted as patent nonsense. However, I'm curious if they really qualify as such. The guideline states that patent nonsense is not to be confused with a hoax <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_nonsense" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_nonsense" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. My reading of the guideline is that patent nonsense is essentially junk text or any sort of text which just makes no sense. So, as long as you can read and understand an article, it's not patent nonsense, no matter how clearly false the content may be. Am I correct on this, or am I missing the point? <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 17:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Hoax is generally not considered a CSD, no, for the reason that plenty of things seem to be hoaxes but aren't--a hoax requires investigation.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It was funny how in the original series they got knocked unconscious all the time without brain damage. Also, the book made sure to mention that the car or boat they were using had been recently serviced allowing them to go fast, since they needed a lot more maintenance back then. If they are copied from the back of the books, then I would think that they are copyrighted. Taking copyright violations to copyright problems is preferred because it takes less effort and accomplishes the same result, even if the topic does not deserve an article. As for deserving articles of their own, I would say that it is borderline based on precendent. <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Hardy_Boys_8476.html" title="The Hardy Boys">The Hardy Boys</a> article already lists the books. As a compromise, an article could be made that lists them with a short summary instead. So that list doesn't get too big, it might be good to create a separate article for each series. There seems to be five of them glancing at The Hardy Boys article (The books in the original series already have articles, though. Some of the other are blue links, but it appears that most or possibly all are links to different books or movies with the same name). If it is decided that they are not to have articles of their own, the lists on The Hardy Boys article should be delinked. Finally, I don't think that redirects or disambiguation pages should be created for the book names if they are simply summarized. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:10, 15 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Nothing beyond book 12 has an article. The others book titles that are linked are, as you suspected, simply linked to other articles that happen to have the same name as the book. Not surprising given the cliched titles most Hardy Boys books have. I didn't nominate the first three books since they seemed to have at least some encyclopedic content in there, although those are borderline deletion-worthy as well. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 19:15, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I'm tempted to vote "keep" just because we have articles on individual episodes of television shows, but, then, I'm not entirely happy with those being in an encyclopedia, anyway.

<li>Well, I think it's borderline. I did leave the first three books in the casefiles up there since they had content other than what these nine had. But barring a rewrite, I think these articles need to be deleted if only for the fact that their only content is the teasers taken from the backs of the books. <a href="../../../a/p/l/User%7EAplomado_dba5.html" title="User:Aplomado"><font color="maroon"><i><b>Aplomado</b></i></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../a/p/l/User_talk%7EAplomado_2940.html" title="User talk:Aplomado">talk</a></sup> 00:44, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> All over wikipedia we have articles on books and TV episodes, most of which can be argued to be non-notable. These books are very notable books, which many people have heard of including myself. I read one. This is far more notable than some other articles on books we have. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobyk777_9e17.html" title="User:Tobyk777">Tobyk777</a> 01:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree that the books are notable enough to warrant their own articles, but notability is not the issue. If the summaries are lifted directly from the backs of the books (and I have no reason to doubt Aplomado's word), then this is clearly copyvio. Remove any infringing material, and what's left? If it's something people feel strongly about, perhaps the publishers could be contacted for permission to reproduce? Failing that, deleting the articles won't prevent anyone from writing original copy along the same lines. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadBaron_f496.html" title="User:TheMadBaron">TheMadBaron</a> 10:11, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Delete, Per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> - wikipedia is not a cookbook for suicide methods. It can list them, but not explain details how to kill oneself, any more than list instructions how to make a bomb, kidnap a plane, commit terrorist attack or cook a cake. ShockedUser 07:05, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. You could propose the article <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide.html" title="Suicide">Suicide</a> for deletion for very similar reasons. Suicide is something that is fairly unkosher to talk about, but wikipedia is strictly not censored. <a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMyNameIsNotBob_b89a.html" title="User:MyNameIsNotBob">MyNam</a><a href="../../../m/y/n/User%7EMyNameIsNotBob_Esperanza_03ef.html" title="User:MyNameIsNotBob/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../m/y/n/User_talk%7EMyNameIsNotBob_1fd2.html" title="User talk:MyNameIsNotBob"><font color="blue"><b>IsNotBob</b></font></a> 07:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is not correct. There is a diference between an article about a bomb, and <b>instructions</b> how to make a bomb. In the same way, there is diference between article about suicide (which can mention diferent types of suicide, just like a bomb can mention diferent types of bomb), and article with <b>instructions</b> how to commit suicide. Do you, in the name of same principle, argue that article containing instructions to make a bomb, belongs to encyclopedia.? ShockedUser 08:54, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>: the article has been around for about a year and a half, has been edited hundreds of times by a variety of editors and the result of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Suicide_methods_503f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Suicide methods">last nomination</a> was a speedy keep. The methods are not so overly detailed so as to became a suicide manual instead of an encyclopedia article. A person researching suicide, depending on which aspects he or she is focusing on, may find the information to be useful. For example, the person may be writing about how to prevent suicides by specific methods, like netting or railings around bridges or restricted access to certain chemicals. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 07:46, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Is this a description:<b>Horizontal position. This is usually done when conditions do not allow for other means. The person puts a noose around his neck and attaches the other end to something that sticks out (e.g., a doorknob or water tap) and then uses his own force to push away from it, or establishes himself in a position where gravity can help. Due to prolonged asphyxiation, blood may pool in the eyes before death. Note that a violent seizure might occur causing unexpected disturbance</b>. Sound like instruction for hanging to me. They even go into such detail as to suggesting doorknub or water tab. Also, you may turn any instruction into description how people do it. You can sell anything as a description.

<li>I think it's an astonishingly pointless article, hamstrung no doubt by the violent passions on both sides of the debate (freedom of information vs protection of the vulnerable). However, there is no detailed information on here that compares different methods or suggests the "best" way to kill oneself, so it is emphatically not a "how-to" and is therefore not covered by the guidelines you have cited. Moreover, the page does not seem to take a point of view on whether suicide is justifiable or not, and therefore is not in violation of the POV guidelines. I do think that it has problems, not least in the lack of sources, lack of detailed information, and the fact that I don't need an encyclopedia to tell me such things (three minute's thought is surely all it'd take to come up with most of these methods, maybe excepting <a href="../../../s/e/p/Seppuku.html" title="Seppuku">seppuku</a>).

<li>Sure. <i>Description</i> of how to make a shoe bomb might be also handy for researchers, for instance those interested in sociological aspects of shoe-bomb terrorism. <i>Descriptions</i> of how people cook different meals are also good when one researches technological aspects of cooking, as a sociological phenomenon. But yet wikipedia does not allow such wonderful <i>descriptions</i> of recepies to be posted in articles, impairing scientific research. ShockedUser 19:34, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><font color="#FF0000">This appears to be a walled garden. Demigodz is a so-called "underground hip-hop supergroup" but its members appear to be members only of this group and have no other claims to notability. A couple have already been speedied. The group has released one album, according to Allmusic, but there is no evidence of significance. All the band members appear to have Myspace pages and little else. Lots of links, but most of them turned out to be music the band heard or was influenced by, rather than any actual firm relationship. Website contains "mostly dated information". There are some links to other groups, but they all seem to go round in circles: A is notable because it includes B, who is notable because he was in C, wich is notable because it contains B, who is notable because he was in A. How notable is an underground hip-hop crew anyway? <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 09:42, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</font></p>

It's absurd to think that the numerous references in pop-culture pertain to something else. It should be noted also that badly written articles about notable subjects should be improved, not deleted.

<li><b>Hold On</b> this is an article about a real person, a comedian from Nottingham, but someone keeps changing the information and attacking the person in what seems to be an attempt to get it deleted. I understand that some of his jokes and material may have been offensive to some but I don't understand this vendetta. I have added the real information again but I'm not that big of a fan and I'm getting tired of adding the same stuff over and over.

The AFD notice was never listed on the article. (I have added it now.) But the nominator doesn't say that he actually wants it deleted.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> Keep the page as people looking for the history of neopaganism in the uk would find it of value.

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> This article has been here for years, by a longstanding wikipedia contibutor. The article is well researched and has some substance to it. For instance, the explanation of the Ophidian current. Its an interesting read. TK might not be 'famous' in terms of a numbers game on google but they have a unique contribution and viewpoint that I haven't seen elsewhere, and Tony Steele is a published author and I believe creator of the Ordo Anno Mundi. They have followers on an international level. Don't be swayed by an anonymous person (who those of us pagans in Birmingham have the misfortune to be well aware of.)</li>
</ul>
<p>TK are well known and respected by those who have been in paganism for any length of time. Please bear in mind the strength of the writing of this article. I think it has intrinsic value.<a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">Acropolis now</a> 18:38, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> TK are not a well known group within the UK at all, and is basically comprised of 1 man and a few women who spend most of their time spamming Pagan forums and slandering the other groups in the Birmingham area (and most of the rest of the UK). TK is about 2 years old, so is not a well established group and is certainly not 'older than the internet'. I have been active in the UK Pagan Community for over 20 years and hadn't even heard of these people until last year, and that was via a forum comment by the group leader. They are of no intrinsic value whatsoever. WW</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> As the author of the article I shall add my vote here. TK is notable and quite famous in a number of different ways. The OAM for example (one of TK's magical training orders) - which utilises the seven-degree Ophidian structure derived from the late Bob Clay-Egerton - is believed by many to have formed the inspiration for J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series - specifically, the magical curriculum of Hogwarts. See <a href="http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_d.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sfaturiortodoxe.ro/orthodox/orthodox_advices_d.htm" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>, <a href="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:Sq0ghqMBb1IJ:remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Spiritism%26Occult/Dark-World-Occult.pdf+%22ordo+anno+mundi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=20" class="external autonumber" title="http://66.249.93.104/search?q=cache:Sq0ghqMBb1IJ:remnantprophecy.sdaglobal.org/Librarypdf/Spiritism%26Occult/Dark-World-Occult.pdf+%22ordo+anno+mundi%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=20" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>, <a href="http://www.stnicholas.org.au/Contact/Aug2003.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.stnicholas.org.au/Contact/Aug2003.htm" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>, <a href="http://www.ninetyandnine.com/Archives/20020930/cover.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ninetyandnine.com/Archives/20020930/cover.htm" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>, <a href="http://www.apostle1.com/pascha_2006/religion_of_the_future.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.apostle1.com/pascha_2006/religion_of_the_future.htm" rel="nofollow">[20]</a>, <a href="http://www.holy-transfiguration.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.holy-transfiguration.org/" rel="nofollow">[21]</a>, <a href="http://www.ninetyandnine.com/Archives/20011112/cover.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ninetyandnine.com/Archives/20011112/cover.htm" rel="nofollow">[22]</a>, and <a href="http://www.inplainsite.org/html/harry_potter_introduction.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.inplainsite.org/html/harry_potter_introduction.html" rel="nofollow">[23]</a> - there are many other examples, including foreign-language ones that I have not listed here. For proof that the OAM long predated the publication of the first Harry Potter book in 1997, see p.57 of the July <b>1985</b> edition of Prediction Magazine, which not only mentions the OAM by name, but also Tony Steele, its chief instructor (and author of two books outlining the Ophidian training programme). It's true that TK is unpopular and perhaps misunderstood amongst some members of the UK Pagan community, as the previous post attests, but this is mainly because of slanders and lies originating from a specific individual within the Birmingham Pagan scene, who is presumably jealous of their longevity and standing (and who, incidentally, placed the original delete notice onto the article). Be that as it may, "unpopular" does not equal "obscure" - usually quite the reverse in fact - and it is not Wikipedia's job to take sides in such petty disputes. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 13:18, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have to say that my disdain for TK has come directly from the arrogance with which Tony Steele and friends treat anyone who dares to question the fact that the tenets of TK are based on a poorly researched and incorrect premise. I am aware that there is bad feeling between the Pagans of Birmingham, but as I do not come from Birmingham and have never actually visited I can state that anything going on there has no bearing on my request for deletion. The fact that the few members of TK I have come across online have been rude, dismissive of other paths and have slandered and libelled people they haven't even met for pointing out the faults in their cult makes it easier for me to state that this is a part of paganism that shouldn't be promoted in anyway whatsoever. Let them mutter to themselves on their own forums. Wikipedia should be for subjects that are worth researching. WW</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>reply</b> ermm, how can people who have never met them point out the faults in their "cult"? Surely they would then be the ones who 'slandered and libelled people they haven't even met.' This is simple logic and common sense. You are accusing people of the very things of which you yourself are by far the most guilty. It's called projection.<a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">Acropolis now</a> 21:12, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b>- strange that those arguing for a delete are using ad hominem arguments. Does an encyclopaedia entry require a character reference? As for TK only being 2 years old, they were formerly called Talras as it says in the article. Apart from Tony, no other foremost members of TK are online at all, so you can't say that they are nasty online. You could perhaps use the search term 'projection' on wiki or google, you might find it very enlightening. I feel loath to stoop to your level, so I will only say that you are making yourself look silly, "WW" aka 'anonymous who originally prodded this article.' Even for you, your standards of debate have slipped to say the least. I know you are capable of reasoned discussion, at least occasionally. Could do better.<a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">Acropolis now</a> 21:30, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Wikipedia should be factual. This group are not notable and have little to no influence on modern paganism (or Harry Potter) despite claims to the contrary. Quoting several Christian evangelical websites which are all using the same source does not support the supposition that Rowling has heard of the OAM. Indeed the supposition is laughable. Self promotion and/or aggrandisement is not a correct use for Wikipedia. Ad hominem attacks would be easy but vulgar. All google hits seem to be self-written and promoting articles. Is every coven going to waste space advertising on Wikipedia?Catkinsmunch 07:32, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>The article is not an advertisment, it goes in depth into the history and meaning of the Ophidian current and the various elements that have gone to make up Templi_Kalendae. Unlike for instance, the 'Martin Williams' or 'Pagan Association' entries which were deleted, it is a thorough well written article about issues pertinent to the history of the traditional craft. It doesn't just say 'everyone loves Martin' and a paragraph advertising the organisations moots and handfastings. There's no advert anywhere in here. This is because TK don't run any moots, do handfastings etc- it can't possibly be an advert, due to them not trying to sell or drum up numbers for anything. At no point in this article do they imply they are even open to new members<a href="../../../a/c/r/User%7EAcropolis_now_d92f.html" title="User:Acropolis now">Acropolis now</a> 03:54, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> I never believed the Harry Potter claim which is why I didn't put it in the article - I quoted it above simply to show that by attracting such stories the group is indeed notable. It is not true, however, that TK has had no influence on modern Paganism. Not only is it the only surviving Ophidian lineage group derived from the Clay-Egertons - it has also, though the OAM, spread these magical techniques to four continents. Incidentally, do you know what a sockpuppet is? It's when the same person poses as two or more people on the Internet in order to register more than one vote, for example. This whole campaign against TK is driven by your own personal animus and jealousy. You really are pathetic. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 09:28, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> You should check with people who actually worked with the Clay-Egertons and find the truth from them.Catkinsmunch 10:03, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I have. Namely, the members of TK. Wendy worked with the Clay-Egertons for <i>eight years</i>, and was one of the last people to see Bob alive in 1998. In 1994 they asked her to take over the running of their coven, but she had to decline because of the birth of her second daughter. You really should check both sides of a story before making a judgement you know. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7ETharkunColl_4046.html" title="User:TharkunColl">TharkunColl</a> 12:04, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. A "lost" distillery sounds potentially noteworthy given the interest these days in whisky, and threatened by a new road may get more prominence.

<li><b>Delete.</b> We don't just put something into an encyclopedia because it exists. I can support the verification of the existence of the telephone pole in front of my house using public city hall and/or phone company plans. This does not mean I would be correct to place an "article" in Wikipedia on "Telephone pole #19845032349-595-0". An encyclopedia article is a distillation of accumulated research and study of a subject, previously reviewed and reported in reputable, reliable publications. I am not seeing that here. —<i><a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><span style="font-family:Times;color:navy;"><b>Encephalon</b></span></a> 04:28, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</i></li>

<p>Completely unsourced, and Google is no help here at all. It's possible that this article actually deals with a real and important topic, but I was unable to confirm anything about it, and since it doesn't provide any references or a time frame or the names of any of the people involved, and is so short as to be almost devoid of context, there's a good chance that the information contained in it is either false, misleading or perhaps even entirely fabricated. Who knows? I can't even confirm that they exist. Unless someone can provide some sort of references here, I'd like to <b>delete</b> it. Note that it's not hard to convince me otherwise here, really -- I don't hate the subject of this article, and in fact I think it <i>should</i> be included even if it's just a minor political party, but I'd just like some confirmation that it, y'know, <i>exists</i>. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 22:58, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> It appears to be a roughly-translated article about Pandektis, an upstart political party in Greece also known as the "Greek Union for Democracy". It is primarily active in the seven prefectures of the <a href="../../../p/e/l/Peloponnese.html" title="Peloponnese">Peloponnese</a>. It is not yet mentioned in the article <a href="../../../p/o/l/Politics_of_Greece_45f9.html" title="Politics of Greece">Politics of Greece</a>. Their <a href="http://www.pandektis.gr/" class="external text" title="http://www.pandektis.gr/" rel="nofollow">Web site</a> (careful, crashes Firefox) is only in Greek so I'm not sure if that's a valid reference for an English article, or if it will satisfy you of its existence. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 23:31, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, it doesn't hurt any, at least! It's a start. I don't read Greek, though, so I have no idea if anything in the Wikipedia article is valid. Is "Union for Democracy in Pelopennese" even a valid English name for this party? I mean, can we be sure that the Wikipedia article is even talking about the same party...? Anyway, this is a step in the right direction; I hope we'll at least get a decent stub out of this one. Thanks, Aguerriero. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 23:38, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>One of the pages I went through on the way to discovering this is <a href="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" class="external text" title="http://www.mfa.gr/english/the_ministry/ministers/stylianidis.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where it refers to the party as "'Pandekis', the Greek Union for Democracy and Law-Making". Do we want to make a judgement that all of these are the same thing? If so, the article should probably be renamed "Greek Union for Democracy". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">contribs</a>)  02:48, 10 May 2006.</small>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, that's my point. Can we say that they're the same thing? I mean, <i>I</i> don't know; I'm hardly an expert on Greek domestic politics, so I personally don't feel qualified to make such a judgement at all. Basically, anyone who demonstrates a reasonable knowledge of the subject (as you have) and is willing to make that definitive judgement call gets my support; if you can do that, I'll be happy to withdraw the nomination. It's kind of hard to make these calls when the original article on Wikipedia is so vague... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 03:12, 10 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>After doing some more research today, I can't definitively say they are the same thing. Even if they are, there are notability issues since it is practically impossible to find information on this party. They are not listed in any reference of Greek political parties, and I come up blank doing a library search of journals and periodicals. So, I vote <b>delete</b> unless the author is willing to clarify and provide sources. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">ţ</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aguerriero_3586.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aguerriero">ć</a>) (<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Aguerriero_1e4f.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Aguerriero">ë</a>)</font> 19:04, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I left a message on the original author's <a href="../../../b/e/n/User_talk%7EBenekos_e1ac.html" title="User talk:Benekos">talk page</a>, but as he's only got eleven edits and he apparently hasn't been active for about a month now, I think there's a good chance that we won't hear from him... but here's hoping that he sees the message and lets us know what's what.

<ul>
<li>Well, so far, nothing. I very seriously doubt that we're going to hear from the guy. It also seems to me that we are not able to confirm much of anything about this article, so let me just make it clear that my original vote to delete still stands, and I would personally infer that Lakhim's and Kchase02's conditional votes don't really count here, as we don't have that confirmation, but obviously determining that is up to the admin who ends up closing the AfD. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 20:31, 12 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - these coincidences have been the subject of at least a few documentary shows and articles, usually relating to the assassinations.

<li><b>Keep:</b> I dont agree with a renaming of the article. The civilian casualties caused by the PKK refers to a very specific and extreme part of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict, something which deserves its own topic. We have to remember that the violence instituted by the PKK is not supported by the majority of Kurds, therefore it would be misleading to rename it the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. It would be akin to renaming Al-Qaeda articles the American-Islamic conflict. I feel many people here dont understand this, because they think the PKK represents all Kurds, and therefore is part of a greater Turkish-Kurdish conflict, when in fact is the very most extreme end of it. It is a kind of western prejudice which Wikipedia always suffers from. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 13:00, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hi Ozgur, the existence of the PKK doesnt prove prove popular support, just like the existence of Al-Qaeda is condemned by the majority of Muslims. The fact is the PKK was not a popular uprising, but a rural insurgency, fought in the mountains. If we had armed Kurds roamming Kurdish citys then we would have a truly Turkish-Kurdish conflict, but this has never been the case. Renaming the article Turkish-Kurdish conflict signifies a popular uprising, this is my gripe. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 13:38, 17 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hello Garnet, I don't think PKK is condemned by the majority of the Kurds and its existence does tell us something. You may be correct with the conflict definition but what ever the case it is notable that the Turkish military has killed ordinary Kurds and just because it is an independent country it shouldn't mean that we cannot mention the casualities of the country's Armed Forces. <a href="../../../o/z/g/User%7EOzgurgerilla_c1aa.html" title="User:Ozgurgerilla">Ozgur Gerilla</a> 01:14, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge and delete.</b> The contrast between Sunni and Shi'a views on <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abu_Bakr_b9a5.html" title="Abu Bakr">Abu Bakr</a> properly belongs within the Abu Bakr main article, similarly to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary%2C_the_mother_of_Jesus_3bac.html#Religious_attitudes_towards_Mary" title="Mary, the mother of Jesus">this section in the article on Mary the mother of Jesus</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As I've tried to explain elsewhere in the present sudden eruption of nominations for deletion of articles generically titled "(Muslim denomination)'s view of X", this is not anymore POV than for example <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_view_of_Jesus_e834.html" title="Jewish view of Jesus">Jewish view of Jesus</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christian_views_of_Jesus_2f92.html" title="Christian views of Jesus">Christian views of Jesus</a>, but instead legitimate article spinout (see <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#Article_spinouts_-_.22Summary_style.22_articles" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#Article spinouts - "Summary style" articles</a>).

<dd>Well, that's always a problem with AfD discussions that result in <b>merge</b>. Who is supposed to actually perform the merge? The closing admin? In general it requires some expertise on the topic to do this right. In the present case there is a very simple implementation of a possible merge outcome, and if I was the closing admin I'd take the easy way out and let the normal Wikipedia collective process take care of hopefully restoring the balance.

<dd>There are other cases of this in the page history, ultimately Striver sees that he can not get his way in the article and creates this page.

<dd>I recommend reading the talk page, in particular Archive 1, where you can see that Striver may be awkward as an editor but is not particularly uncooperative and very definitely willing to argue with (whether you agree or not) mostly reasonable arguments for a Wikipedia editor. You can also see a recurring confusion between Striver's desire to include a report on what the Shi'a view is (which in and by itself is or should be a neutral issue) and the desire of some others to report "what actually happened" (which almost certainly leads to POV texts, one way or another). In light of the present discussion this contribution in the Archive – a perfect example of the confusion referred to – is interesting: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Bakr&amp;oldid=41314361#For_brevity.2C_simply_present_both_perspectives" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Abu_Bakr&amp;oldid=41314361#For_brevity.2C_simply_present_both_perspectives" rel="nofollow">[30]</a>. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:24, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I apologize if anything can be considered an "attack" on my edit, all I am trying to do is show how these articles are not articles that started in the main articles and became to large to the point where a new page was created but rather because the user did not get his way in the original article he created these pages to avoid reverts to his edits which is the very definition of a fork article. I also find it remarkable how Lambiam stating I am on a "crusade" everywhere I go is not considered an attack. Furthermore, to Lambian, no he is not "reasonable" if you actually see the page history you see that he continues to revert regardless of the fact that the clear consensus is against the content that he puts in the article.--<a href="../../../j/e/r/User%7EJersey_Devil_9d25.html" title="User:Jersey Devil">Jersey Devil</a> 02:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> as Lambiam pointed out, i participiated at lenght in the disccusion in the main page, and it all boiled down that having the Shi'a view fully represented in detail would give it undue weight, in short, all informatinon does not fitt there.

<dd>As for Zora's comment regarding that this article was not developed in the Abu Bakr article, and then broken out of it, it is not a valid arguement for deleting this article as is now, a articles history is never grounds for deleting, what matters is how it is now.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I found <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_Buses_route_474_4218.html" title="London Buses route 474">London Buses route 474</a> just by chance, noticed it had a category of bus routes and didnt look any further. I've noticed a few in the list had been nominated before recently. Had I known about the history of some of the bus routes, then I would have thought twice about it. But still, some articles are riddled with POV, OR or look a bit like buscruft, and would definitely need a cleanup. Therefore, I am going to be <b>withdrawing the nomination for all articles</b>, however, anyone may re-nominate some or part of the route articles that doesn't comply with WP:NOT. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnzy_60da.html" title="User:Arnzy">Arnzy</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/r/n/User_talk%7EArnzy_d126.html" title="User talk:Arnzy"><b><font color="green">(whats up?)</font></b></a></sup> 22:34, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Well, this looks a lot like buscruft. Yup, it does. On the other hand, buried among the pictures of buses is some actual information of genuine merit - the histories of some of the bus routes dating back a fair time, when the routes have been extended and so on. And of course some original research and some gross POV (disabled passengers are quite glad that routes have "succombed" [sic] to low-entry buses). I will need to read each one in detail, it's probably a delete but for once this cruft has saving graces. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 14:30, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Riddled with POV and OR, as JzGuy points out, and just the teensiest bit crufty. However, in among the commentary are hard data that might actually be of use and cannot be easily incorporated in any other article. Some of these routes have been used for 50 or 60 years and must have carried tens of millions of passengers; others (such as the #15) have historical significance because of their use of <a href="../../../r/o/u/Routemaster.html" title="Routemaster">Routemaster</a> buses. I am reassured to see that some of the older articles have strong edit histories, which infers that they will continue to be edited and maintained by a number of different editors. <a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumansdorpie_a9a9.html" title="User:Humansdorpie">Humansdorpie</a> 15:31, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Hmm...</b> — incredibly well done articles, I must confess... but nothing I would look for in an encyclopædia. They shouldn't be deleted, but maybe rather moved to somewhere else.

<li>There should be seperate articles on different topics of interest. An encyclopedia is there to give information about these. There are articles about different train routes and vehicles.

<li><b>Keep all</b> as per Web kai2000. The nomination says "Wikipedia doesnt need a article on every non-notable bus route in London" … but these routes <i>are</i> notable (although some do not assert notability clearly enough in the opening para). Most of them are older than some tube lines, and they are as well known to generations of Londoners as the tube. I am also very unhappy about the repeated re-nomination for deletion of these articles, which does not seem to me to be an appropriate use of the AfD process, since the nominator does not explain what has changed since previous discussions were concluded.

<li>The list was created just for the sake of having such a list</li>
<li>The list is of interest to a very limited number of people</li>
<li>The list is unencyclopaedic, i.e. it would not be expected to be included in an encyclopaedia.</li>

<li>This article does refer to something began in August 2005 at Johns Hopkins University's Bologna Campus. Although it is not on a clearly academic topic, it is something that became a norm of this campus of the university. If you ask any of the 180 students at the Bologna Center about this term, they will know what it refers to exactly. The source is the creator of the Standard, but of course he is the one who came up with this norm that the rest of this campus of the university began to use and accept as a norm. Therefore it should not be deleted, but rather it would seem as students from this campus disperse it may become a widely used Standard. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedro223_ed69.html" title="User:Pedro223">Pedro223</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Pedro223_7419.html" title="Special:Contributions/Pedro223">contribs</a>) 18:14, May 15, 2006.</small></li>

KEEP!!! this fits all of the wikipedia standards and when has wiki fought against the inclusion of term developing in pop culture? if pages like those for nobel prize winner Bob Mundell includes things like his appearances on Letterman then surely this is equally worthy. just because the term hasn't spread to your area of the world yet does not mean you should shoot it down. even terms like hetero-normativity and flexual had to begin somewhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 85.18.136.74 (<a href="../../../8/5/2E/User_talk%7E85.18.136.74.html" title="User talk:85.18.136.74">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_85.18.136.74_fccc.html" title="Special:Contributions/85.18.136.74">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<dd>Wikipedia is not an advertising platform. Its an encyclopedia. I was referring to the Miss Canada Wiki Article, it does NOT link to this artilce and thus doesn't qualify as a sub article. If it was a valid sub article it should be linked. Not to mention the page you cited as a reference only mentions the competition it doesn't even link anywhere, let alone this article. Its easy to say keep if you just make stuff up.Not that we should expect less from the creator of the page.

<dd>Ultimately, articles for all the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_World_Canada_2e4c.html" title="Miss World Canada">Miss World Canada</a> regional pageants will serve the same purpose as the <a href="../../../m/i/s/Category%7EMiss_USA_state_pageants_98a7.html" title="Category:Miss USA state pageants">51-state/district pageants</a> serve for <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_USA_f31f.html" title="Miss USA">Miss USA</a>. But, for now, there's just one regional pageant, so linking to (or merging) just one, makes <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_World_Canada_2e4c.html" title="Miss World Canada">Miss World Canada</a> seem somewhat unbalanced. Of course, we can't get to the full proper use as a sub-article, until more are made (without deletion).

<dd>And until they gain notability they don't deserve to be separate articles. Simply creating them in the hopes that they gain the notability necessary is pointless, and if that is how you want things run, I could create a lot of articles on speculation. And technically speaking in my original post which this referenced I was referring to the alleged parent article of this as it was said this was a sub-article. The parent article doesn't even link to this article. That's proof positive how non-notable this is, not to mention the traffic stats. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:23, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>We want notability, not necessarily not notoriety. "notoriety" is "ill fame". We need neither the "ill" nor the "fame" (though fame is obviously welcome).

It made the news many times. It was noted in country-wide newspapers (albeit far off the front page).

I also wouldn't call a mention in the Globe and Mail or The National Post the qualifying factor as to whether or not something is notable.I've mentioned it more than once, and no one has bothered to explain why this "notable" article isn't even linked back from <a href="../../../m/i/s/Miss_World_Canada_2e4c.html" title="Miss World Canada">Miss World Canada</a>.

<dd>Well notability requires that its known outside of a small group. I'd just like to see some evidence that there is really interest outside the people who are directly or indirectly involved with the pagent (e.g. friends and families of the contests/organizers as well as the people in the town where its held/going to be held). A national newspaper article that is more than a couple lines consisting of "xxx was chosen as Miss BC Coast on such and such a date" with a picture, would be a good step towards establishing notability. --<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 19:54, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

sorry this was an accident - didn't mean to remove it. New to uploading stuff to wikipedia.</p>
<p>The album title is self released and available by digital download when requested to the artist direct. she is an evironmentalist who is making music available in a new way - not about economies of scale - the success of an artist should not be about how many records they sell. She is currently undertaking her MA in Music Business Managment and her thesis in on 'Music and its Impact on the Environment'.</p>
<p>I am not sure what false positives mean&#160;?</p>
<p>I feel moodkiller is a worthy artist who has been working under this name for sometime - she is about to trademark the name as well - she owns the domain name and myspace name.</p>

<dl>
<dd>False positives means that most of the Google hits were not for this person, so that the actual number is something significantly less than 600. <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">Band notability</a> doesn't depend on number of albums sold, or we'd only have articles on people who make the Billboard charts. Anyone can get a trademark, domain name, or myspace name - myspace is very popular for self-published musicians, so that's not really "making it available in a new way". Also the article was created by Moodkiller, which indicates it may be a <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vanity</a> article (though that's not in itself criteria for deletion, if other editors come along and improve it; sometimes that happens as a result of the AfD process)--<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 18:08, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>ok that all makes sense - but what does google hits have to do with her credibilty as an artist and the worth of her creative contributions - she is an established artist in her own right. I am her Manager Mazen Murad we keep everything under the same user name.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It's not so much the number of hits (though that's a factor) it's that they didn't turn up anything that would establish <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">band notability</a>. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 19:00, 15 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Deletion has nothing to do with <i>"her credibilty as an artist and the worth of her creative contributions"</i>. You should not feel this is based on that. It is based on her lack of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. Wikipedia does not document little-known artists. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:02, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>really&#160;? I am aware of other 'little known' artists on wikipedia - also I wanted to say distributing music by consumer request is a new thing to do - mp3 for widescale use has been around for about 6 years - before that it was all physical sound carrier format - going way back to good old Thomas Edison and the phonograph. So I would dispute this is still a new and developing means for distributing music - especially seeing the actual music industy is still relatively challenged by it.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Distributing mp3's for download is routinely done by every teenager with a garage band and a myspace page. Realistically, Wikipedia has to set standards higher than that. Try reading the guidelines at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:11, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I don't think the fact she distributes mp3s has anything to do with her credibility of being on wikipedia - feature films, composing music that wins awards, having her work used by MTV UK is not notable enough? Nor is the fact that Terence McKenna requested to work with her on his Australian tour - I am intrigued by your definition of higher standards.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This certainly needs more documentation than you've provided. First of all, you claim she has credits under two totally separate names other than this one. That can raise some red flags on verifiability. She "collaborated with" someone who had a song featured in a film. What does that mean? She wrote backup music for a travelling speaker. Kind of iffy. Can you provide some documentation on the Pavo Cristatus album? Google returns results on the bird. It may be that she does meet the standards, but we need more than a website and a myspace page for verification. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:34, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, we could always just take everyone's word that they're a famous musician. Of course, that way, we'd end up with an article on every teenager who's learned to play three chords. The fact is that, in 2006, if you're not being talked about on the internet significantly, then you're probably someone playing local clubs and haven't yet broken out. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:18, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>my question as to why other 'unknown' bands who are still playing local clubs are on wikipedia - has not been answered. I never said Moodkiller was famous - she is a very accomplished musician .</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Many unknown musicians are still on Wikipedia because no one's noticed the article and targeted them for deletion. If you've seen some who don't satisfy <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> please let us know. It is about <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>. If someone's a very talented musician with no significant releases, that practically nobody's heard of, they don't meet the standards. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 23:28, 15 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

Surely social networking counts&#160;? that's very internet 2006 - moodkiller's 780 fans online with over 152 direct comments - that is internet activity is it not? Myspace isn;t just utilised by the unkown either - every band uses it to connect and get internet activity happening around their music.Her myspace profile grows by the day.</p>
<p><br />
I will reiterate - evidence presented shows Moodkiller is certainly not 'practically nobody' playing local clubs. Her work is international and at a sophisticated level. She is 'heard' of and her work is 'known'. She has had a significant release with Pavo Cristatus - the print sold 1500 copies and the duo have been on many compilations that have also sold well. She has been on national and international radio. She has been reviewed in notable print music press. She has been a guest co writer on Australian Dance Act of the year in 2000 with Endorphin and the track was used on a recognised Australian Feature Film. She has worked with MTV and had her music used nationally on the TV Lynx Click Superstar series - promos which are around every bus stop in central London. Again something I would consider beyond a 'practically nobody playing around local clubs'. But hey I only work as a mastering engineer for London's premier recording studio the 'metropolis group' with clients like Pink, Iron Maiden, Jamiroquai etc - so what would I know about notable musicians? I would also like to say that during the course of this discussion the article has been edited and improved to meet the wiki standard.</p>
<p>A point to note- while the above mentioned google search does not reveal an acceptable number of site this does not mean the artist in question is not "notable". I have spent many years in Australia involved with other bands and from past experience know that much of what is published in print media never makes it onto the internet. I am also aware that many radio staions including the major national youth network triple j, do not always publish playlists. As a typical Sydneysider I was definitely aware of Pavo Cristatus and could guess that for every CD purchased, several were copied.</p>
<p>From where I am in Japan I am also familiar with Moodkiller and know she has a growing following among underground gothic-type scenes here. It must also be noted that on certain Japanese peer to peer sites such as "mixi", Western names are often written in Japanese, sometimes using several different spellings based on pronunciation, and therefore would not come up in a google search. While I understand Wiki endeavours to maintain certain standards, soley basing the basis for publication or deletion on google hits seems to be quite limiting.</p>

<dd>It's not just based on google - that's why we have this process. AfD isn't just a vote, it's a discussion process that exposes a questionable article to a larger audience so that it can be improved. The article as originally written set off several warning flags - and most of the time the articles like that disappear uncontested because they really are just vanity by garage bands on myspace. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 13:47, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Based on what I see, I don't see enough to justify keeping. An album that sold 1500 copies? 152 posts on her web forum? Sounds pretty minor league to me. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 02:47, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>According to a comment from Jamoche (please read above) 'Band notability doesn't depend on number of albums sold, or we'd only have articles on people who make the Billboard charts.' So Fan1967 - what exactly is your point? Apart from the fact it sounds like you only have commercial music tastes.</p>
<p>She actually has over 1601 profile views on her myspace profile with 2016 total plays - currently has 786 friends - not every one leaves a comment on a myspace page. That number grows organically - numbers which are significanlty higher than the 'unknown' bands that still remain listed on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>note further article editing has taken place.</p>

<dd>Make that "only on number of albums" - someone could be influential without being a top seller. It's a contributing factor, not the sole criteria, but there is a point at which the number is so low that it really is non-notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamoche_0708.html" title="User:Jamoche">Jamoche</a> 18:53, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

yes I have and according to criteria listed she meets it under the following: As a lyricist who wrote and performed lyrics on two tracks on an album that chartered in Australia and won best album in 2000 at the Australian Dance Awards - Skin was released by major label Sony. Of which Anguish was featured on the Australian Feature Film Looking for Alibrandi. Moodkiller is Tammy Brennan. The chain of events proving this have already been presented.</p>

<p>success or notoriety of an artist needs to take into account all album sales - so if you factor in tracks appearing on the compilations she has appeared on (4), the Pavo album, being a writer on 'Skin' etc, along with the EP downloads that take place off her myspace - significant numbers. Oh and the UK MTV Airplay with the Lynx Click Series - three tracks used - that is national broadcast is it not?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Myspace downloads are worth basically nothing. The 1500 copies of the Pavo album, not much more. What's left seems to be entirely supporting work on other people's projects. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 04:11, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_Perfect_10_models_b75b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of Perfect 10 models">first AfD</a> ended in no consensus; this second AfD was prompted by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=53342160&amp;oldid=53302385" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMel_Etitis&amp;diff=53342160&amp;oldid=53302385" rel="nofollow">message</a> left for me by <a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBastique_e135.html" title="User:Bastique">Bastique</a>, who reports an e-mail from one of the people listed: "This young woman is non-notable, doesn't wish to be notable, and apparently her picture was published without her permission.

<b>Further comment</b>. The claim that the list is encyclopædic because some of the names on it are notable is, of course, absurd. A List of people who have shopped at Harrods would doubtless also include many notable names, but wouldn't be in the least encyclopædic. It's the list that's being considered here, not the members of the list. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 10:07, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I didn't compare the magazines, I compared the magazine model lists, which is appropriate. I believe I also mentioned the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Playboy_NSS_models_9b06.html" title="List of Playboy NSS models">List of Playboy NSS models</a>. Actually, there are three or four of them. Second, if the argument is that many of the models listed don't have seperate entries, then it's only reasonable to point out that the Playboy (six or seven of those), Playboy NSS, and Penthouse lists include a <i>great many</i> models without Wikipedia entries. The precedent for such lists is clear, and shouldn't be ignored. --<a href="../../../a/l/s/User%7EAlsayid_cf2a.html" title="User:Alsayid">Alsayid</a> 16:12, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Unfortunately, the first time around this entry was quickly nominated and voted against by some due to a lack of familiarity with the magazine title "<a href="../../../p/e/r/Perfect_10.html" title="Perfect 10">Perfect 10</a>" (thinking it a POV).</li>

<dl>
<dd>Regarding notability, whether the models are listed alphabetically by first or last name is an issue of format, not merit. As of today, over 40 models on the list have Wikipedia entries of their own. Rather than judging by those who don't have articles, we should judge by those who <i>do</i>. They include supermodels, Miss Universe contestants, Pets, Playmates, and mainstream actresses.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>If the <i>real</i> problem is that <i>one</i> of the models doesn't wish to be listed, then why not address her specifically rather than the entire P10 model entry, which includes so many notables, and ties back in the same way as other lists to the magazine entry? --<a href="../../../a/l/s/User%7EAlsayid_cf2a.html" title="User:Alsayid">Alsayid</a> 20:39, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Based on my 11+ years of study of Scientology and other pseudosciences including what paradoxers call Remote Viewing, I can state with high certainty that almost all, if not all, of the Scientology propaganda in this article is not only false but well-known to be false. The article also completely violate's Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View mandate. Also, almost all, if not all, of the Scientology propaganda in this article does not even belong in an article about Remote Viewing. The article should be deleted. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDesertphile_0910.html" title="User:Desertphile">Desertphile</a></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> The article is well-researched, but tends to go off-topic. There are some salient entries regarding Scientology's influence on the SRI work, and these should remain (and perhaps be augmented to show the direct connection). The conspiracy theory entries (i.e. US Gov vs Scientology) should be removed as off-topic. Having a timeline showing the origins of RV though, including the Scientology influence, is valuable. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreatGatzby_2fd4.html" title="User:GreatGatzby">GreatGatzby</a> 00:47am, 18 May 2006 (PDT)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Rewrite</b> An accurate and succinct timeline of remote viewing would be completely appropriate, and a useful aid to the <a href="../../../r/e/m/Remote_viewing.html" title="Remote viewing">Remote viewing</a> article. But glancing briefly at this timeline it seems to me that a) there is an incredible glut of information either too detailed for a general timeline or only tangentially related and b) any attempt to verify the multitude of questionable statements would be stopped simply because of the massive number of references (not that references are bad, but this amount harms more than helps).

<p>It appears that this page should be deleted due to not meeting notability with sufficiency.

Although there were a number of hits on the name, it appears that many of them are from discussion pages around the internet and that there are a number of individuals with this name.

<li><b>Keep</b> I really hate to keep an article of this variety, but 1) It's Alexa rank is around 6,550, which is certainly high enough; 2) "College Fuck Fest" gets 421,000 G-hits, so if even a fraction of those relate to the site, that's far more than necessary for passing the Google test; 3) The article is <i>in no way</i> written like an advertisement- hell, it's actually kind of critical of the site, and the stub is generally written quite well.

<p>This article has very little content, and does not explain why out of the 16 chapters of the epistle, this one stands out enough to be significant in an encyclopedia. Surely we could create articles like this one for every single chapter of every single book in the bible, but previous consensus seems to suggest that that isn't a good idea. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 00:15, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

Subject seems notable to me, and I think there's plenty of verifiable information about it, even enough for its own article eventually. But for now, <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians</a> has more than enough room for discussion of the individual chapters. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 01:20, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In expanding Wikipedia, subjects must have a transition from a stub to a well developed article. This article, and all the chapters of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> are in this stage. True, there isn't much content here and many other chapters of <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First Epistle to the Corinthians</a> deserve their own articles, but this will come with time. I'm currently working on expanding the content of this page. It would become too specific too merge with <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians_a231.html" title="First Epistle to the Corinthians">First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians</a>. Merging until more content is written is a fine alternative too, but unneccessary work. Further, 1 Cor is a better known and used book, both in pop religion and theology. --<a href="../../../e/p/h/User%7EEphilei_3ebf.html" title="User:Ephilei">Ephilei</a> 03:58, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Bible is, arguably, the most important or at least most influential book ever written. We have articles on every album by bands that most people have never heard of and even articles on songs from those albums (I'd say a song in an album roughly equates to a book chapter). We have articles on characters so minor in Star Wars and Star Trek that even devoted fans are hard pressed to indentify them. If in this mass of information and our more than one million articles we do not have a place for articles on biblical chapters, then we a lot of other pages need to go. Despite apparent previous consensus, I would support the writing of articles on every chapter of every bible book. Yes we are not a Bible wiki, but this is some of the most notable writing in the history of mankind. <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7EShootJar_e8e2.html" title="User:ShootJar">ShootJar</a> 21:01, 16 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Comment. I apologize for referencing the larger issue of whether bible chapters are significant enough for encyclopedias. The issue at hand is that this is a stub article that basically says (now after JzG's changes) that this is a chapter about two topics already discussed elsewhere on wikipedia. Perhaps everyone can imagine a well expenaded article about this chapter sometime in the future, but my point is that whatever we have in our imaginations does not exist yet in this article. I guess a AfD is a little premature, but I hope that this article does get expanded.--<a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_c_e9c2.html" title="User:Andrew c">Andrew c</a> 21:52, 16 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have no doubts about the notability of the subject, largely agreeing with ShootJar above. The article is a little weak, but many good articles began as stubs and later were expanded. So, let's keep it and hope for expansion. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool3_2ec0.html" title="User:Cool3">Cool3</a> 20:33, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Appears to be stub with possibilities for expansion. I'm not convinced about whether we should have articles for individual Bible chapters rather than entire Bible books, but until there is a decision that this is inappropriate, this chapter is notable enough that it could warrant an article. <a href="../../../p/a/d/User%7EPaddles_deb2.html" title="User:Paddles">Paddles</a> 23:08, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
