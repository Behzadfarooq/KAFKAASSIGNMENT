<li><b>Extremely Strong Delete</b>, because <b>this suburb does not exist!</b>:
<ul>
<li>There is a state government body that defines suburbs called <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Geographical_Names_Board_of_NSW_35ee.html" title="The Geographical Names Board of NSW">the Geographical Names Board of NSW</a>. You can <a href="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" class="external text" title="http://www.gnb.nsw.gov.au/name/search" rel="nofollow">search their database</a>, and I encourage you to do exactly that, because it will reveal there is no suburb called "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>There is a federal government body called Geoscience Australia, which is "the national agency for geoscience research and geospatial information", and it has a database on place names of Australia, which <a href="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" class="external text" title="http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/" rel="nofollow">you can search here</a>, and I encourage you to do exactly that, because it will reveal there is no suburb called "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>Local knowledge: I have lived less than 200 metres from Ashfield <b>for the past 9 years</b>, and I have never heard of this suburb called "Ashfield North".</li>
<li>Street Directory: The definitive Sydney street directory is called the UBD, and it contains a comprehensive list of "Suburbs and Localities". This list does not contain any entry for "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>When I asked the person who added these suburbs about this, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html#Sydney_Suburbs" title="User talk:Nickj">they indicated there was "a bit of gunk"</a> in the data they were using.</li>
<li>The <a href="../../../m/u/n/Municipality_of_Ashfield_05fe.html" title="Municipality of Ashfield">local council</a> which would cover this suburb (if it existed) <a href="http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/council/profile.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/council/profile.htm" rel="nofollow">defines the actual suburbs</a> it covers, and it says "the Municipality includes Ashfield, Summer Hill, Haberfield, the eastern part of Croydon and the fringes of Croydon Park, Hurlstone Park and Ashbury." Note that there is no mention of "Ashfield North" or "North Ashfield".</li>
<li>The current <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a> should be fairly complete and definitive (errors and omissions can happen of course, but I'd venture to say it's now &gt; 95% accurate), and myself and others have put a lot of effort into making it as accurate as we can, so if something is not on that list then it's most probably not a suburb.</li>
<li>For all of the above factual reasons, if you do not delete this entry, then there is something very seriously wrong. In fact, when I mentioned that there was to be a vote over whether to delete a ficitional suburb to my partner she burst out laughing, and proceeded to ruthlessly mock the Wikipedia, and in all honesty she's got a very valid point. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:02, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Howzabout we rewrite the article to NPOV, so it would read: "Ashfield North is an alleged suburb in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Those who believe in its existence frequently suggest that it is part of the Municipality of Ashfield. Critics, however, deny the existence of such a suburb, pointing to the absence of any mention of it by <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Geographical_Names_Board_of_NSW_35ee.html" title="The Geographical Names Board of NSW">the Geographical Names Board of NSW</a>.

<li><b>Comment on the comment</b>:
<ul>
<li>That's a stamp or envelope from 1957, which is 48 years ago. For all I know there may have been a place called that then, but there sure isn't now.</li>
<li>It clearly says "POLLING PLACE" on that page. Other polling places in the same electoral division of Low include <a href="http://results.aec.gov.au/PollingPlaceResults-12246-1539.htm" class="external text" title="http://results.aec.gov.au/PollingPlaceResults-12246-1539.htm" rel="nofollow">"INFANTS HOME"</a>. Are seriously suggesting that "INFANTS HOME" qualifies as a suburb?</li>
<li>Same as above, it's the name of a voting station. The paragraph above refers to "Stanmore Public School" in the same way. Are you proposing that "Stanmore Public School" is a suburb? The paragraph below that refers to "Marrickville Town Hall" in the same way. Are you seriously proposing that "Marrickville Town Hall" qualifies as a suburb?</li>
<li>They're spammers! They're trying to make a link farm to push up their google rankings, so you already know they can't be trusted. In fact, if you go to <a href="http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/" class="external free" title="http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sydney.communityguide.com.au/</a> you'll see that they also consider "Hmas Kuttabul" to be a suburb of Sydney! Are seriously proposing that "Hmas Kuttabul" qualifies as a suburb?</li>

<dd>&lt;rant&gt; Please, enough with the silly arguments. Google is not a substitute for using your brain. It's not a suburb, OK? I should know, because I've spent much of the past week cleaning up the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Sydney_suburbs_28df.html" title="List of Sydney suburbs">list of Sydney suburbs</a>, plus I live right next to it. Moreover, there is a government body that exists to define what is and is not a suburb. They say no. You can't just randomly make up new ones up whenever you feel like it! Jeez, I'm dealing with morons! I really cannot believe I'm seriously wasting my time having this discussion - for me, it defines everything that is wrong with the Wikipedia, in which people with knowledge backed up with references aren't given more credence than people who don't know what they're talking about, and in which getting the most useless crap deleted becomes an extended political process! &lt;/rant&gt; -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 02:20, 12 September 2005 (UTC) P.s. sorry for the rant - but it was that, or kick the cat.</dd>

S. I was trying to determine whether this was a case where there are neighborhoods that have informal names that are not officially recognized, together with strongly-held but <i>varying</i> local opinions on the validity of said names. It is sometimes hard to distinguish between the rightous indignation of someone truly well informed, and the simulated authority of a POV-pusher. Sometimes the name of a post office or a polling place is an administrative convenience that is all but ignored by locals, and sometimes it is the neighborhood's "real" name. People who live in Boston <b>never</b> say "I live in Boston." They say "I live in Jamaica Plain" or "I live in West Roxbury" or "I live in Roslindale." Not a parallel case, because these are not just post office names; the neighborhoods—which are <i>officially</i> called neighborhoods—do have official existence. Anyway, there's a reason I made a <b>comment</b> rather than a vote... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:16, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm sorry, I apologize, I overreacted in my response. You are fully entitled to play devil's advocate and ensure that there is merit to the proposed deletion. I was frustrated with the Wikipedia's process (in particular the asymmetrical nature of how quick and easy it is to unilaterally get content added, but how hard and slow it is to get multilateral consent to get bad content deleted), but that does not just justify my response, and I apologize. -- All the best, <a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENickj_5f86.html" title="User:Nickj">Nickj</a> <a href="../../../n/i/c/User_talk%7ENickj_9875.html" title="User talk:Nickj">(t)</a> 00:01, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
