As previously mentioned, the pending TotallyRE website and forum itself are well recognized and affiliated throughout the Resident Evil community.

<li><b>Keep</b> Totally Resident Evil is a large forum in the Resident evil fan community. Information provided is to show any reader the light hearted side of the forum, as well as give information about the forum, prominent members and website itself. Currently a work in progress among the users of the forum. Biographies are just a part of the overall whole.2,035 registered members, 140 Active Members, and an administration known throughout the Resident Evil community is far from Obscure. -Dek</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> There is no valid reason to delete Totally Resident Evil. Even if it was just a list of members, I don't see how that's a reason to delete it. The members of the forum are what make up the forum itself. Without the members, there is no forum. Beside that, the forum itself has a huge online following and an important part of the Resident Evil online community. - Bio</li>

<li>Unfortunately, Wikipedia has to consider the notability of the things it has articles about. It is difficult to claim notability for a website that does not yet exist and which has only a hundred-or-so active members. There are many fora out there with many more than that. Once the site has become properly notable, the article can be recreated. You may also want to read about what <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a> — specifically, it's not a webdirectory. I've marked the votes above as a common practise to point out to whoever closes the VfD that these users <i>may</i> have been created specifically to support this vote. See <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets and meatpuppets</a>. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>TRE has made a community effort to preserve its place on the internet for web history, and several members have taken an active part in that effort by making accounts and contributing. Now you seem to have some sort of vendetta against us. We aren't Meatpuppets. However, if you are so inclined, I would be more than happy to introduce you to a Meatpuppet of an entirely different sort, Mr. "Splash". Who names an account after a sucky Tom Hanks movie, anyway?</b>--Encyclopediac 03:28, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Wikipedia has to consider the notability of the subjects of its articles"? That sounds like an excuse to keep the scope of the wikiproject as small as possible. Notability is purely relative. Within its own sphere, TRE is most definitely notable, and I'm amazed by the fact that any informative, non-biased, well written article would be so widely opposed just because a few of you cling to rules. Wikipedia is a very promising outlet for education, perhaps even better than a library, and to think that you would discriminate against something solely because it's "not-notable"? What if no one was interested in Quantum Physics either? Would you stamp an nn on it and give it a delete too?--Encyclopediac 02:25, 15 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
