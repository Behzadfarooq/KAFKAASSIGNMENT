<p>An article about this person was previously speedy deleted as a non-notable biography (A7) and it was tagged A7 after being recreated several months later. However, the article makes assertions of notability and I think that an AfD discussion should determine whether they make the subject notable enough for an article. My opinion is to delete. If the article is deleted through this AfD, it can be speedy deleted if recreated, as long as it is substantially similar. If the article is created a couple of more times, I would suggest that it be protected against recreation. The author said that he saw his name here and decided to add content. I'm guessing he meant a red link, but the only link to the article is from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_male_mixed_martial_artists.html" title="List of male mixed martial artists">List of male mixed martial artists</a> and he added it himself. Perhaps there used to be another link or he forgot that he added it in January. If the article is deleted, then I suggest <b>deleting the entry on the list</b> to discourage recreation.

Since I have had several fights in Rage in the Cage, one of the longest running MMA shows in the United States, I would say that is noteworthy. Also I was one of the last to compete in the event before it became completely sanctioned.

<font color="#FF0000">So you're discounting my participation in a MMA promotion that's existed for 10 years? I'm sure if I hadn't been more dedicated to my education I'd have participated in a lot more bouts. Also <a href="../../../s/h/e/Sherdog.html" title="Sherdog">Sherdog</a> isn't the most reliable database either. 3 of my fights aren't listed there. Many smaller events results were sent in, but never put up on Sherdog. Full Contact Fighter's database is more comprehensive. Also my participation in MMA has extended me into to coaching as well. I also continue to referee at local <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian_Jiu-Jitsu_8a36.html" title="Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</a> and submission grappling events. I've done a lot more in the sport than a lot of people who just talk about it. Maybe you don't deem it important, but I feel I've earned my stripes.

Rage in the Cage is an established MMA promotion and <a href="http://fcfighter.brinkster.net/eventsearch.asp?EventID=136" class="external text" title="http://fcfighter.brinkster.net/eventsearch.asp?EventID=136" rel="nofollow">FCFighter</a> lists events from it since 1998, but it is regional in character and is probably the MMA equivalent of Single A or AA minor league baseball. <a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a> 06:30, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FF0000">It is a regional promotion and started off as such, but many fighters have moved on to the bigger events. It's become the 3rd longest running MMA event in the country, behind the UFC and I believe Extreme Challenge. Many fighters from out of state compete, and have competed, as well as several ex UFC fighters. It would be fair to be called around AA or AAA minor league baseball. I only would think that the article should stay to show that people involved in the sport on that level are actual people. I included personal stuff, like about my career, that I felt would help humanize the article. Plus I am still looking to fight again and would like to be able to expand on that. I also fought in Combat Zone in Massachussetts which is a very good show that is similar to Rage in the Cage in the sense it's helped propel many to greatness.</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#FF0000"><b>Comment</b>. As per a note I placed on the WP:MMA talk page: "I'm currently marshalling my thoughts on this one, but I'm erring on recommending delete on this one and expanding our notability standards section. When comparing RITC to my "regional" promotion, <a href="../../../c/a/g/Cage_Rage_8676.html" title="Cage Rage">Cage Rage</a>, I can't think of a fighter with 4 (or even 6) fights who I would write an article on who is not also, or has been, a champion at his weight class. I can think of several Cage Rage fighters who have more fights but no championship that I would consider notable. I also consider Cage Rage to have a higher (i.e. national/international level) profile than RITC."</font></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><font color="#FF0000">Jon, whilst I agree that many notable fighters have fought in RITC, that does not in itself make every fighter who fights there notable; it makes the <i>promotion</i> notable. I think this is a debatable case that I suspect we'll use to help refine the WP:MMA notability standards, but I think it's probably going to be a delete.
