</dl>
<p>Short and simple: these articles are original research, are speculative, and have no clear definition against which their claims can be weighed. I urge <b>deletion</b>.</p>
<p>The first inherent problem with the articles lies in their namespace. Each article discusses the countries in the context of becoming the next "superpower". Superpower is a political science term usually used to talk about the two powers in a bipolar system (USA &amp; USSR in Cold War), or the one power in a unipolar system (USA today). In essence, a superpower is defined by the polarity of the international system--that is, a calculation of <i>relative</i> power--not by the absolute material, political, economic, of cultural factors it possesses. These articles catalog the absolute material etc. factors possessed by these countries, but provide no definition for what constitutes a superpower, or discuss when and how China/India/EU might finally become considered a superpower. Moreover, if the international system does not move from unipolarity to bipolarity, but instead moves from unipolarity to multipolarity (if China, India, and EU all rise concurrently, for example) than no state will be considered a superpower, because the term isn't used for the polar powers in a multipolar system ("great power" is generally used). The namespace, right off the bat, makes a rather large assumption about how the world is going to turn out. It's speculative at best, but really it's simply misleading. Superpowers are not superpowers because of absolute capabilities, but because of relative capabilities. One could write an entire article on why China will be the next superpower based solely on American decline, with no facts about China at all, simply because superpower status is relative.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relative power is defined by political scientists in myriad ways--most academics and politicians define power using different relevant capabilities (e.g. most use military, some include population, some include political system, some include economic, some include manufacturing output, some include urbanization, some include energy use, some include territory size, some include global reach capabilities, some include sway over international opinion, some include cultural influence, etc. etc. etc.). Measuring some of those factors leads one to different conclusions about relative power than measuring other factors. If the articles stick only to military and economic factors, then they are presenting a view biased towards Realist IR theory; the they use economics, political system, and international influence, then they are presenting a view biased toward Liberal IR theory; if they present the view that "superpower" status is a socially constructed term, then they are biased toward Constructivist IR theory, etc. Even if they present research on all the possible factors, they are still advancing original research.</p>
<p>This leads me to the second, and more serious, problem with these articles, is that they are original research. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> specifically states that the following is to be considered original research:</p>
<ul>
<li>It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source;</li>
</ul>
<p>What we see in this collection of articles is not a discussion of various published sources and their views on China/India/EU's potential to become a superpower. Few if any authors are directly mentioned in the text at all. What we see are a number of sections asserting something about China/India/EU -- it's big, wealthy, growing, has social problems, has economic problems, etc. Mostly primary sources are cited. But since there is no standard for what constitutes a superpower other than relative power, there is no way to cite primary sources without the articles becoming an argument-advancing synthesis.</p>
<p>If the articles only cited and discussed secondary sources (i.e. experts discussing their theory or criterion about China/India/EU's rise), the article would still be unencyclopedic. No other Wikipedia article would be allowed to have a {{Template:Speculation}} and {{Template: Future}} on them, knowing full well that the expected event may not come to pass for <i>at least</i> 15-20 years, if not 50 years. Especially an article about social or political issues, which are subject to the most extreme and unpredictable vagaries and vicissitudes of nearly any subject covered by Wikipedia. But these articles, by their very nature, would need such tags, because even the secondary-source authors are engaging in speculation about a future event that may or may not come to pass.</p>
<p>Let's do a thought experiment: if Wikipedia had been invented back in the 1980's, there would have been a strong temptation to write an article on Japan as an emerging superpower. We look back on this as silly now (evidenced clearly by no attempt ever having been made to start one for Japan in the current series of emerging superpower articles). But in the 1980's Japan was kicking the USA's butt--huge growth, special cultural advantages, high technology, etc. There were scads of articles coming out predicting the Japanese century ahead, and Japan as the next superpower competitor for the United States. Fast forward to today--if that article was still around, what would we do with it? Japan clearly hasn't lived up to the predictions from the 1980s. We would most likely delete the article once it became clear that Japan wasn't going to live up to the hype. But what would the criteria for deletion be? We could still have such an article, listing all the demographic, economic, cultural, military advantages that Japan has today, just like the articles we currently have on China/India/EU. Arguably Japan has better qualifications currently than India does, if you measure by certain criteria (economy) and not others (population). There would be no structural difference between a Japan article and the articles we currently have.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of an article on XYZ country as an emerging superpower is inherently flawed. The articles are based on absolute capabilities rather than relative systemic capabilities, they assume a bipolar rather than a multipolar world to come, they synthesize primary sources to build a case not attributed to reputable authors, they will remain speculative and future-predicting for <i>at least</i> 15-20 years, and in light of historical predictions of superpower status they clearly aren't encyclopedic. <b>Wikipedia articles should not be written about predictions of future events, it's that simple, no matter how many primary sources are used to back up one side or the other side of the case.</b></p>

<dd>I don't think one can say that political scientists are working on a "china as a superpower" theory. A theory in political science would be more like <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_international_relations_theory.html" title="Liberal international relations theory">liberal international relations theory</a> or <a href="../../../d/e/m/Democratic_peace_theory.html" title="Democratic peace theory">democratic peace theory</a>. Talking about China/India/EU's rise is more like conjecture, or prediction based upon application of theory, rather than a distinct theory in itself.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Not to get into a battle over nomenclature here, but that would be a hypothesis. The difference between conjecture and (empirical) theory is mostly the quality of evidence provided in support of the claim. Closer to the matter at hand, this is quite excellent material, but sadly completely out of place on Wikipedia, <i><b>unless</b></i> we can find authorities who support the conjecture/theory/whatever. What are the inclusion requirements at <s>Wikisource</s> Wikinews? ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:52, 1 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's no doubt that a great deal of work went into assembling all the data. That's why I urge merging relevant data in relevant articles (China's economic info into <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economy_of_China_c1d6.html" title="Economy of China">Economy of China</a>, etc). There are certainly authors, both academic and popular, who predict the rise of these countries. Those predictions belong in the articles about those authors and books. Collecting them together under the nomenclature of "emerging superpower" is misleading and original research. But, even if we found those articles and authors, the subject matter would still be unsuitable for a wikipedia article. Classification of a country as a superpower or even as a great power is a holistic, relative, and subjective affair. We have articles about economic miracles--but those are quantifiable and based on objective, absolute measures of material facts. "Superpower" status is not nearly the same--it depends not only on the country in question, but upon all the other major countries in the international system. Like I said above, one could write an article about the rise of China to superpower status written entirely in terms of U.S. decline, with nothing at all about China in the whole article--because superpower status is relative. Moreover, different criteria are relevant to different authors: some are realist, some are liberal, some are constructivist, some are marxist--all pick different factors reflecting international power--thus, the whole project is subjective in a way that Chile's economic miracle is not. The article would remain speculation and predictive of a future event for at least a decade if not several. I know of no other Wikipedia articles given that kind of leeway in discussing speculation. (AFAIK: wikinews deals with breaking events, not long term historical processes).—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 23:08, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><i>Those predictions belong in the articles about those authors and books.</i> — Not necessarily, if the authors can be linked in some form so discussion of their work <i>in context</i> makes sense. If they are just a bunch of isolated scholars all working on the same problem linkage might be original research, but as soon as you have, say, an edited book or a colloquium "Will China be the next superpower?" there is good reason to discuss the research in one article. Btw, you should also correct your nomination. You can't merge and delete per <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. It might actually be that <b>move into project space</b> is the best short-term solution. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:20, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>With all respect, there are edited books and colloquiums on all manner of speculative subjects. Cruise the think tanks in DC or academic fora and you'll see meetings discussing nearly anything. This does not mean that Wikipedia ought to have articles on every speculative subject discussed, even if there's an edited volume published about it. The articles themselves do not use secondary sources, do not cite authors and experts, and do not present each author and expert's opinion seperately--it's all merged together, synthesized into one large argument-advancing piece, with no attribution. Just look at the talk pages to see what a honeypot these articles are for nationalists and racists adding completely unfounded material to these articles. There is no way to salvage these namespaces based on verifiable, non-speculative sources that solves the problem of the inherent assumptions made in the namespace alone, much less the article text.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 23:38, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you on the content of the article. The talk page is really irrelevant, that's not what the public sees. On the issue about whether there is a strong subfield of IR or even IB that discusses those issues, that's really an empirical question (You might want to join us at <a href="../../../s/c/i/WT%7ESCI_e311.html" title="WT:SCI">WT:SCI</a> about those meta-questions). I'm just trying to probe what to do with an article called "Next superpower X" and under which conditions it can be a feasible WP article. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It's an interesting question, but inherently a presupposition. It preassummes that the world will become bipolar instead of multipolar. So it's an article not only on what country is likely to gain relative to all others, such that only it and another country have enough of the relevant capabilities within the international system to be considered superpowers (a subjective standard, as political scientists will admit), but it's also an article that bases its speculation upon another speculation about how the world will turn out (i.e. that the world <i>will</i> change from unipolarity, and that it will go to bipolarity not multipolarity). While articles on speculation are explicitly disallowed (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>, point #3), articles on speculation based upon a speculative, unspoken presupposition are <i>clearly</i> out of bounds. That being said, there are numerous articles discussing structure in the international system, by realists, liberals, and marxists alike. They discuss historical structure, current structure, and how structure might change in the future, or whether structure is even a worthwhile way to think about international relations. They further discuss what criteria ought to be used in determining a great power (not surprisingly they almost all disagree), and whether the number of poles really has much of a determinant effect on the behavior of states at all. Because such classifications (great power, superpower) are based heavily on these types of assumptions (relevant criteria, necessary share of capabilities, relevance of structure, IR theory school, etc), it's a very very bad idea to label specific countries unless you are explicit about who exactly is labelling them (e.g. <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kenneth_Waltz_4e3e.html" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a>) and why (e.g. Waltz notes that country X had a big army relative to other countries in those years). Trying to compare countries as great powers or potential superpowers is a guaranteed disaster, because you'll be mixing authors, theories, criteria, and there will be no standard upon which you could cross-compare the countries. In sum, it ought to be avoided.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 00:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>(Reset indent)</i> Well, here is a hypothetical example that would be acceptable under our rules:
<dl>
<dd>The question whether China can be the next superpower has attracted significant academic and popular attention. A <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superpower.html" title="Superpower">superpower</a> is defined as ... In his book "China, the Superpower of the 21st Century", Prof. Prefect writes "China has the human and natural resources to become the dominant player in Asia within 100 years, second only to the U.S.A. in global influence". This conjecture is critized by Prof. Hallmonitor who writes: "Despite its size and human capital, China is at least 50 years away from creating the necessary political and social institutions to allow a rise in regional prominence", etc., etc.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>That of course has nothing to do with the article right now, but a perfectly acceptable article for Wikipedia, <i><b>if</b></i> the sources exist. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 01:12, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Interesting example. More likely it would feature "Prof. Prefect defines a superpower/bipolarity XYZ", "In his book he talks about how current trends relate to the criteria for superpower status: example 1,2,3,4...", "Prof. Beeblebrox defines a superpower/bipolarity ABC", "In her book she talks about these other current trends and how they relate to the criteria for superpower status." One structural problem with such an article is that there are very few books or papers written specifically against such a point, i.e. there are no journal articles with the title "Why China Won't Be a Superpower", even though a number of people do not believe China will be the next superpower. As such, the article would most assuredly be one-sided, and run into potential NPOV problems. Finally, there would need to be some way to resolve the namespace problem, such that it doesn't presuppose a speculative outcome.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 01:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Rename and repurpose articles... maybe?</b> Without having more time to thoroughly review these articles, I have to say they appear at least on the surface to be well written and generally well referenced, at least for purposes of verifying individual facts. I agree with the nominator that the overall theme of whether or not a country will become a "superpower" is original research, though, and quite speculative. While I do think these articles need to be altered to remove the speculative properties, I also suspect there is quite a bit of useful, verifiable information about these countries within these articles. And since the articles are quite large, merging that information directly into the main article on each country might be problematic. I'm guessing that the ideal solution would be to rename and repurpose the articles so that they discuss various significant geopolitical and economic factors about the country, and link it as a subarticle to the country's main article. Also, if possible, locate a few more secondary references that contain similar analysis to whatever original analysis is contained in the articles so that those bits of potential OR can be backed up by published analysis saying similar things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Worst case, I would suggest deleting the articles but copying and pasting them into user space as draft articles. That way all the text of these articles can be preserved and modified as desired, and hopefully the above issues about OR and author speculation can be properly addressed and a modified set of articles without those problems can be speculated. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:29, 1 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wouldn't advise transferring the information to the main article for each country. Each of these articles breaks down evidence into military, economic, political, social spheres. Thus, I think that raw data might be transferred to the Military of China, Economy of China, Politics of China, Demographics of China, Culture of China articles.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Another thing to note is that the articles don't provide <i>why</i> those various factors will help or hinder China's predicted superpower status.

The article is literally a collection of factoids that various editors deem important to future development, but without the glue to hold it together.

<li>I'm curious as to why you <i>strongly</i> favor keeping it when you acknowledge that there are a lot of unclear factors. The problem is not necessarily with content--most of which is cited. The problem is whether such an article can avoid being inherently original research, when based on a speculation about a long-off future event, and with a built-in assumption that the world will become bipolar rather than multipolar (an event that has little or nothing to do with the absolute material capabilities of one country, but is related to the relative capabilities of all countries in the international system). In this sense, the article not only speculates about the future power of one country, but in the namespace alone makes an assumption about the power capabilities of <i>all states</i> 15+ years into the future.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 04:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I've said on my talk page, I think the solution here is to tack an OR tag on and comb out the sludge. There's no question that there can be (and should be!) an article discussing the different answers people have given to whether or not China's going to be a "superpower." As long as we <i>report</i> on speculation, it's fine. If you have a namespace problem, AfD is not the way to go. It's a "strong" keep because these are AfDs on very highly developed articles worked on by many (and I think a fourth nomination for AfD is excessive.) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:27, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I put these articles up for AFD because I didn't think an OR tag would be enough--the articles are defective in their fundamental premise. I appreciate that they are highly developed, and the raw data used can be used elsewhere profitably, but the premise of the article is one that cannot avoid OR and is inherently based on speculative presuppositions. There's a reason why these articles keep getting nominated for AFD.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 06:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The problem is not whether or not the term is used widely. I don't think anyone disputes that there are a number of news stories discussing these countries and their tremendous growth. The problem is whether an article based entirely on speculation of a distant future event ought to be included in Wikipedia. Checking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a>, point #3, indicates that articles about distant predicted events are not acceptable, even if they are widely used terms.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 04:41, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Per the exact point you reference: "we do and should have articles about notable artistic works, essays, or credible research that embody predictions." I think this is the crux here: are there enough essays or credible research on the question of China's superpower status? (I believe the answer is trivially "yes" -- am I mistaken?) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 05:32, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are essays trying to predict how the structure of the international system will change, certainly. But they are essentially speculation--speculation based on theory and trends, but speculation nonetheless. Point #3 states that extrapolation and speculation are disallowed, and that's what this article is: extrapolating current trends to speculate on China's rise to superpower status. Point #1 states that future events are permissible "only ... if the event is notable and almost certain to take place." Certainly, China's rise would be notable, but it is not at all certain to take place. Moreover, that it rises specifically to become a superpower (in a bipolar system) rather than as one of many great powers (in a multipolar system) is even less certain to take place.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 06:39, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't get it. P#3 explicitly says that we should have articles covering speculation about future events if the speculation is credible and notable. Period. (?) <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 06:56, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes it does. But the articles are not about credible research. They are mostly primary source material about China's GDP, military size, demographics or China's social problems, etc. I have a valuable discussion above with <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> regarding what an article based on credible research might look like. However, I still maintain that such an article would be inherently misleading because of the built-in assumptions about systemic polarity (that the world will become bipolar instead of multipolar). Further, they are speculation about an event proposed to happen at the very least a decade into the future. Point #1 says that an article about the "2016 U.S. presidential election and 2036 Summer Olympics are not considered appropriate article topics because nothing can be said about them that is verifiable and not original research." The same would apply to China because of the long time span regarding its potential rise.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:08, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have a bunch of complaints that you have confused. One is that the page as is has lots of OR. Solution: comb out OR or add OR tag. The next is that you think that people who ask if China is going to be a superpower are wrong to do so. Solution: find credible sources that say same and create "criticising the question" section. Finally, you repeat the claim that P#3 does not apply and P#1 does, which we've already discussed. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> <small>(<a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_advice_4921.html" title="User:Sdedeo/advice">tips</a>)</small> 16:45, 2 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are not my arguments. I argue that the concept of the page itself leads to OR: all the facts are well cited, but the facts are synthesized (chosen, placed together, justified) to make an original point. The facts are not there to back up a published expert's claim, they are there because the <i>editors chose</i> those particular factors as important. That is original research. You can't comb out OR when the whole concept of the page is OR. Second, I don't think it's wrong to ask if China will be a superpower. What I'm saying is that China becoming a superpower is not dependent on China--superpower status is based on relative not absolute power. So listing a bunch of facts about China is meaningless, no matter how well cited, because China as a superpower is dependent on two things: its power relative to every other powerful state in the international system, and whether the system changes from unipolarity to bipolarity or multipolarity. Neither of these things can be examined by listing the attributes or issues facing China. Finally, point #3 says that we can have articles about credible research that is predictive, but these essays are not <i>about</i> credible research, they <i>are</i> research. Where are there any authors discussed who put forward research on China as a superpower, not simply speculation? Are any china-superpower theorists given a section or even named in the text? No there aren't. The only people named are those cited for specific facts used to support the broader points <i>being made by the editors.</i>—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:22, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I wouldn't go so far as to say "should". For instance, articles on books or authors who put forth such theories are certainly viable, as long as those articles describe and summarize the argument rather than finding facts to buttress it. If we eventually amass a collection of such individual articles, I would not be against a survey article that overviews all of the individual articles and provides links back to them.

The problem is we don't know the final outcome and calling it "emerging superpower" is drawing conclusions about an unfinished game. The United States as an emerging superpower is already an article... we just call it <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_United_States_%281918%E2%80%931945%29_8d7f.html" title="History of the United States (1918–1945)">History of the United States (1918–1945)</a>.

<li>The problem with rename all is that there is no standard by which to judge "international power". Realists judge military capabilities and economic production, Liberals judge regime type, economic development, weight within international institutions, Marxists judge on a core-periphery analysis of the state and by the character of its economic system, etc. Which capabilities are the relevant ones for international power in that case--do you choose one theory (an bias the article) or choose all theories (and make a bizarre synthesis of all the theories together)? Moreover, which capabilities are international capabilities and which are domestic capabilities? These articles discuss a lot of things that are essentially domestic --internal social instability, national culture, etc. International power of Foo would be just as much original research as these articles.

<dd>Nobleeagle, it's not about the articles being sourced. Anyone can see that every fact presented has a source, sometimes multiple. The problem is the inherent assumption contained in the article's premise, and the synthesis of these primary sources which advances an argument. 1) There is no commonly accepted criteria for superpower status - so listing all the material and cultural factors for a country's rise is meaningless, and there is no clear point at which China could be said to be a superpower. 2) Superpower is a label applied to bipolar or unipolar powers, thus it is not a measure of absolute capabilites, but of relative capabilities within the international system. Thus, presenting a list of factors in one country's rise has nothing to do with whether it will or will not become a superpower. What matters is the relative growth and decline of all powers within the international system, and which capabilities/factors are considered relevant to the measure of a country's power. The article does not and cannot provide that relative context, and provides no criteria on what factors are relevant to a state's power (a subject upon which there is wide disagreement within IR theorists, as you should know). 3) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#CRYSTALBALL" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#CRYSTALBALL</a> does not allow articles speculating on events that might possibly occur in several decades maybe, based on extrapolation of current trends. It's original research, plain and simple. 4) The primary source data can easily be used on the relevant country subpages (Culture in China, Demographics in China, Economy in China, etc), so none of that research will be lost. 5) The articles are not about current theories on China's rise--no authors or their theories are cited by name, no sections are devoted to individual authors and their criteria or definitions. These articles present primary data synthesized to argue one side or the other, and the primary data is assembled not based on published theories but on the editors' whims.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:23, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep or rename</b> This article covers a referenced and notable intilectual concept. This article should stay. Perhaps it should be renamed and given a less speculative title. The article is relatively well-referenced and provides the reader with information on China's current world-power status. <b><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../b/r/e/User%7EBrendelSignature_e03b.html" title="User:BrendelSignature">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 06:51, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> These kind of speculative articles are very un-encyclopedic and annoying. Just because they source other people who state their predictions of the future doesn't make this a real topic; an encyclopedia doesn't have a list of oracular speculations by different people. Who goes to an encyclopedia searching for an article on "_____ as an emerging superpower" anyway? Besides, the articles are always at risk of selective referencing that emphasizes a certain view. The POV emphasized is in support of the country becoming a superpower. <b>These articles are like POV forks except that there are no articles for the other POV. They are inherently dedicated to a POV.</b> And honestly, could anyone here get away with an article about <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China as a Doomed Nation</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India as a Failing Failure</a>? Of course, those titles are exaggerating the concept, but my point is that people would find the other half of the POV fork unacceptable, and so this half should also be unacceptable. Even if there were opposing POV articles, the obvious action would be to integrate these into a neutral whole, assuming that the "oracle" problem is resolved. In sum, these speculative compendiums of carefully selected trends and quotes have no place in an encyclopedia that aims to be a neutral repository of verifiable facts taken from reliable sources. They are antithetical to the encyclopedia's goals. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 07:29, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, and there's no bright line, preventing anyone from writing an article about any country.

Someone, somewhere is willing to write about it--and then we'll have a multiplication of these articles on nearly every big country, because every nationalist wants to have their country represented in Wikipedia as the next emerging superpower. They'll fill it up with all the primary source information on GDP growth and military power that the current articles on China/India/EU have. But there remains no standard upon which we can say yes to India but no to Brazil. Moreover, where does it stop? Next we'll have Uzbekistan as an emerging regional power, Argentina as an emerging regional power, Indonesia as an emerging regional power, and on. This is the problem with speculative articles--there's no way to say no once you've opened up the floodgates to articles about what might possibly happen decades from now maybe.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 08:37, 2 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>In all it's deletion debates, the same point has been raised. Where does it stop, note that in a year of this article being present, the others are not. The issue is of notability, while China and India have notable speculation on its rise. Iran does not.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This material should be merged into relevant super topics like "Economy of China", "Foreign Relations of China" et al, sans the original research, which a lot of the article currently consists of. I was originally going to say weak keep or rename, but after reading the article a bit more carefully and really thinking about it, I changed my mind. My basic problem is this...an encyclopedia is a catalog of "things that exist". "Things" can be concepts, ideas, phyiscal objects...blah blah. Wikipedia is the same, except the medium allows it to track changes in those "things". That's where it get dangerous. Some things do not change over a relevant time scale, like the size and composition of a planet, and on the other side, some things change rapidly. The very title of the article, and most notably, the word "emerging", suggests the latter. Look at it this way, if this were the title of a book or an article, its corresponding encyclopedia entry would be to describe the book, not to present the underlying material to the reader that is engineered to advance that books argument. That is what this article represents...a thinly veiled attempt to advance an argument based on a vast collection of sources taken together. Sounds like an essay, not an encyclopedia article. Most of the content here is well organized, and possibly useful. However taken together, with the title, and the content, and the way that it is presented, it is clearly original research by synthesis.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 23:09, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I do not deny that the articles need changes and possible chopping down, they use primary sources too often and would be better if every source referred to the nation's actual superpower emergence. but I would like to draw an analogy. There is an article called <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html" title="Effects of global warming">Effects of global warming</a>, which details future effects that may or may not occur relating to global warming. Much of the article is well written and is attibuted to particular people, which is what this article needs. However, the concept is the same: <b>Effects of global warming is speculation over a future event that may or may not occur, but the speculation itself is a very current event. Similarly, emerging superpower hypotheses are speculation over a future event, but the speculation itself is a very current event.</b> The articles tend not to say that "The Chinese military will become better than the United States by 21 May 2014", it says stuff about the recent military rise that is currently troubling the United States. Both articles are well sourced, both possess the same premise. <b>The emerging superpower concept is similar to the future global warming impacts concept, if the latter belongs to Wikipedia, so does the former. Thus the concerns don't relate to the concept and their validity (unless Perceval wishes to nominate Effects of global warming for deletion), the concerns relate to the OR and Primary Source use which is presented in the article.</b> To fix these things, you use a TALK PAGE, not an AFD, Perceval hasn't even bothered touching the talk page and telling everyone his concerns so that the articles can be helped. If you say delete because of the concept of the emerging superpower doesn't belong to Wikipedia, then what are your views on the global warming hypotheses on Wikipedia, if you say delete because the article is OR, then that's not the way to go, you instead should tag the article and place messages on talk pages. <b><font color="#000080">—</font> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="#000080">N</font><font color="#12098A">o</font><font color="#120ABA">b</font><font color="#2015E3">l</font><font color="#1364EA">e</font><font color="#2BA4EC">e</font><font color="#1364EA">a</font><font color="#2015E3">g</font><font color="#120ABA">l</font><font color="#12098A">e</font></a></b> <sup><a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">[TALK]</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nobleeagle_dfb1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nobleeagle"><font color="#2015E3" size="0.2" face="Arial Narrow">&#160;[C]</font></a></sup> 23:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nobleeagle, I respect your opinion on this and other deletion candidates, but I don't believe your comparison to <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html" title="Effects of global warming">Effects of global warming</a> is valid. There are lots of articles on Wikipedia that mainly concern future events. Video games and movies with an impending future release dates are good examples, but some of the more prominent ones are: <a href="../../../r/i/s/Risks_to_civilization%2C_humans_and_planet_Earth_178e.html" title="Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth">Risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth</a>, <a href="../../../e/s/c/Eschatology.html" title="Eschatology">Eschatology</a>, and <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe.html" title="Ultimate fate of the universe">Ultimate fate of the universe</a>. These articles have one thing in common in terms of structure: they are all primarily summaries of documented, sourced <b>theories</b> relating to a number of topics. The difference between these (and the global warming article) and the article under discussion is that the latter is a collection of <b>facts</b> (figures, statistics...primary sources) combined in such a way to present a unified theory <b>OF ITS OWN</b> that does not appear anywhere in the source material. In other words, the articles I mentioned all present documented theoretical information relating to a central topic whereas this article presents a collection of seperate facts as one theory, the theory that China is "emerging" as a superpower. If the article instead presented theories from political scientists, historians, and such, it would be acceptable, but as it stands, it is problematic and original research.--<a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIRelayer_de15.html" title="User:IRelayer">IRelayer</a> 08:22, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

However, it is leagues better than the emerging superpowers series. #1, it is not inherently predicated upon an assumption: the superpowers series assumes that polarity will shift from unipolarity to bipolarity, while it is just as plausible that polarity will shift from unipolarity to multipolarity (in which case there would be no superpowers, but simply a set of great powers). #2, it discusses individual authors' theories one by one and attributes those theories directly in the text. Take a look at the first major section: <a href="../../../e/f/f/Effects_of_global_warming.html#More_extreme_weather" title="Effects of global warming">Effects_of_global_warming#More_extreme_weather</a>. Each paragraph begins with the particular theorist/paper/book/etc and discusses their particular contention. The article, for the most part, does not marshal primary source data chosen by wikipedians and assembled by wikipedians as evidence, unlike the superpower articles. #3, the relevant indicators chosen by scientists are scientific, and thus not nearly as arbitrary. Indicators chosen in political science are far more arbitrary, and rely principally upon the author's theoretical school (realism, liberalism, marxism, constructivism). While there is an objective measurement of global temperature and climate change, there is no objective measurement of what constitutes a superpower much less what constitutes state power within the international system."—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It would be interesting to try deleting "Global Warming", since it <i>is</i> essentially a position paper backed up by a bunch of scientists. Perhaps the science allegedly involved prevents the deletion from happening. Science tends to be whatever description of reality that is agreed upon by considering the known information, and is usually the conclusion that every logical scientist will reach if they look at the evidence. On the other hand, the same cannot be said of "emerging superpower" opinion pieces. People usually have to put this forward, and then select specific evidence to back it up. It is a POV; others could select different evidence to show that the country is going down the tubes. There isn't a 'scientific' way to make these assertions. And while I could perhaps make, as previously mentioned, an <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India as a Failing Failure</a> article, or have certain Pakistani people make it for me, this wouldn't be tolerated because it would attempt to defame and insult that country, and imply that the country is headed nowhere. And yet there is the opposite article, that serves to puff up a country based on a few editorials on the internet! Hopefully, these halves-of-a-POV fork will be deleted to stop this unscientific silliness. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:47, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>However, clearly your "half of a POV" statement crumbles under the fact great pains have been taken to include opposing opinions - both POV's are clearly present and no conclusion is reached, to the fury of the nationalists and the detractors alike (apart from in, possibly, the title. Gramatically it does not invite a conclusion but describes an argument. Practically, it seems to. Perhaps it should argued for it to be changed to perhaps "Probablity of China pertaining superpower status" or something similarly long-winded, but that does not require an AfD). The reader is, throughout, invited to make their own judgements on the basis of the facts and the opinions of the media, but only the information is provided; a la an encylopaedia. 88.104.185.62 19:23, 3 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Even the token criticism added is editorial. It communicates that the country will be a superpower once it addresses a few certain problems. Besides, the "emerging" idea is favored here; the criticisms added simply signify why the country is not yet a superpower. These types of articles are unworkable, un-encyclopedia opionion pieces. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 22:59, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>That doesn't make sense. So pointing out the problems the country faces in becoming a superpower is <b>supporting</b> the view that it will become one? The problems signified are the hurdles that must be overcome. I'm sorry but I don't understand the point you're trying to make. Criticising China's human rights record, India's troubles with Pakistan and the EU's fractured nature is certainly not something I'd have in the article if I was trying to make it one sided!! 88.104.185.62 00:04, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename and keep all</b> These are obvious signs that are already changing, not just predictions. China's rapidly increasing GDP is not a prediction. This is also true with their technology as well. Factors that keep China from becoming a superpower are agreeable too. Its political troubles with Taiwan and human rights accusations, etc etc are all true. This article has been nicely written with a lot of data and much effort put into it, as well as the other articles. I think a change in the title is fine. This article is overall very informative for anyone who wishes to learn about China becoming a superpower. <a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGood_friend100_562e.html" title="User:Good friend100">Good friend100</a> 12:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm sorry, but one could write an article on the discussion of countries becoming superpowers, surely? <a href="../../../c/o/m/User%7EComputerjoe_570e.html" title="User:Computerjoe">Computerjoe</a><a href="../../../c/o/m/User_talk%7EComputerjoe_0094.html" title="User talk:Computerjoe"><span style="color:red">'s talk</span></a> 18:54, 6 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A country becoming a superpower is a prediction or presupposition of the structure of the international system. Superpower is a term indicating relative not absolute power. That means that China could become a superpower without growing at all--all that would be required would be the decline of its rivals (the U.S., Europe, Japan, Russia, India, etc). Writing a story about China becoming a superpower filled with facts about the country's material advancement is inherently confused and misleading, because it demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of relative power vs. absolute power. Moreover, suppose all potential challengers to the U.S. grew quickly, not just one. Then the world would not move to a bipolar system (with two superpowers), but to a multipolar system (in which the term superpower is not used, but "great power" usually is). Thus an article about China becoming a superpower also presupposes that no other countries will grow quickly enough to become a challenger. You can see why writing an article about a country becoming a superpower is therefore inherently problematic: it misunderstands the concept of a superpower on two levels (relative power vs absolute power, and bipolarity vs multipolarity). Wikipedia articles should not be premised on an erroneous speculative prediction.—<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerceval_c015.html" title="User:Perceval">Perceval</a> 22:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The nomination is not very clear, it seems to have a general difficulty with the term "emerging superpower". But we hear the term and these topics practically everyday on radio nowadays. The articles are well cited, many references directly discuss the emergence of these entities as superpower. Reading the China article, I find it well-written, accurate, and balanced. I don't see an "advance of position" because both sides are equally presented. I will however consider changing my vote if someone could point out <i>specific examples</i> of significant factual errors or original speculations in these articles. --<a href="../../../v/s/i/User%7EVsion_cd35.html" title="User:Vsion">Vsion</a> 05:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
