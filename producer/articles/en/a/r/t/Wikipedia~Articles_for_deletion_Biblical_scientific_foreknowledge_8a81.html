<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I've stumbled across the article when it was very fresh, and was apalled by unencyclopedic style (look in the history), but this can be cured.

<li>The following are examples of allowable claims, research, and views (as long as they are verifiable and sources are cited):</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>listing well-known claims which have few (or possibly just one or two) adherents (e.g. Shakespearean authorship theories or Linus Pauling's advocacy of Vitamin C);</li>
<li>listing notable claims which contradict established axioms, theories, or norms (e.g morphogenetic fields or conspiracy theories);</li>
<li>including research that fails to provide the possibility of reproducible results (e.g. theological or philosophical theories);</li>
<li>citing viewpoints that violate Occam's Razor, the principle of choosing the simplest explanation when multiple viable explanations are possible (e.g. Phlogiston, Aether).</li>

<li><b>Keep, but rename</b>. The title <i>Biblical scientific foreknowledge</i> implies an endorsement that such foreknowledge exists. It should be called something like <i>Claims of scientific foreknowledge in the Bible</i>, or better yet, <i>Modern Science and the Bible</i>, which could also discuss the instances were the Bible <i>contradicts</i> modern science. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECOGDEN_1efc.html" title="User:COGDEN"><i>CO<small>GDEN</small></i></a> 23:30, July 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep only if rewritten and renamed.</b> IT needs to be copy-edited and it needs some more citations, especially from some more neutral sources.

<li><b>Delete</b> This is NOT <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>, because by definition it must be, "...any new interpretation, analysis, or synthesis of published data, statements, concepts or ideas that, in the words of Wikipedia's founder Jimbo Wales, would amount to a 'novel narrative or historical interpretation'..." Since other fundamentalists hold this position, it is not a "new/novel interpretation". It is obviously not encyclopedic, however, as it cherrypicks material which supports a contention (persuasive), both within the Bible and within the scientific literature. This particular user, as it has been shown, has ignored the substantial proof that the OT was compiled at a much later date than he purports, and that it relied heavily upon well-established practices throughout antiquity, such as burying waste and avoiding blood. Not encyclopedia material, this would spread ignorance and confusion rather than enlighten. Only way to preserve this page is to present theories of the origin of information in the OT, and compare to synchronous information in the ancient near east, which would make this a huge page...untenable--skiddum12:19, 2 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>re: re: alleged neologism</b>: volume of usage of a neologism does not preclude its being such. you must prove that, according to Wikipedia's definition, as a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>, "Biblical scientific foreknowledge" is not, " word, term, or phrase which has been recently created ("coined") —often to apply to new concepts, or to reshape older terms in newer language form. Neologisms are especially useful in identifying inventions, new phenomena, or old ideas which have taken on a new cultural context. Neologisms are by definition "new," and as such are often directly attributable to a specific individual, publication, period or event. The term "neologism" was itself coined around 1800. It can also refer to an existing word or phrase which has been assigned a new meaning." I think this title definitively falls into "reshape older terms in newer language form..."; specifically, you have repeated a neologism created by, "...They are often created by combining existing words (see compound noun and adjective) or by giving words new and unique suffixes or prefixes. Those which are portmanteaus are shortened. Neologisms can also be created through abbreviation or acronym, by intentionally rhyming with existing words, or simply through playing with sounds."

<p>I did a search through PubMed and other sources and found some additional material. Unfortunately I have only time to put it in the Pro Bible scientific foreknowledge link section. Also, there appears to be a article which was written in medical journal in another language which I wish to have translated via friends. I also found other material which I did not want to put in the link section until I did more fact checking. Please be sure to examine the link section.</p>
