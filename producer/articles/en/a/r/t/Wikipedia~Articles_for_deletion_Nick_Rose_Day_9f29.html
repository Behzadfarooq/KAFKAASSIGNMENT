<li><b>Keep</b> - I too go to Harvard Law School. This day is real. This is the second year it was celebrated, and this year it was bigger than ever. Nick had nothing to do with the entry at all. The entire point is that he is so nice he would never do something like this. This was about everyone else recognizing him, and his holiday. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.61.41.95 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.41.95_e3d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.41.95">contribs</a>) 14:28, 14 December 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm one of the women who wore red last year in support of Nick Rose day. It's a nice idea, and, while it might still be a small holiday, we really did celebrate it, and it's existence was documented on blackboards throughout the school last week, urging people to celebrate. The whole school also got two emails (at least) urging everyone to celebrate by thanking the nice guys in our lives. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.61.42.254 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.61.42.254_b7d5.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.61.42.254">contribs</a>) 13:19, 14 December 2005.</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Why is this so hard to believe? Do you really think that Harvard announcements would be open to the public? Do you really think we want the unwashed masses, the riff-raff that populate Cambridge, attending our events? Forbid it almighty God! As should be clear by now from the voluminous response from Harvard Law students, this is a real event. The Nick Rose Day Happy Hour was held at Tommy Doyles in Harvard Square. This celebration occurred immediately following the Nick Rose Day party, an event that was heavily attended. Perhaps if those of you who doubt this holiday’s existence try very hard and pray fervently to your gods, you too can attend Harvard Law School and experience this deeply significant cultural event. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.128.136.63 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.128.136.63_866c.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.128.136.63">contribs</a>) 16:13, 14 December 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I do not attend HLS, but I am a lawyer, I do know several people who currently attend HLS, I interview applicants from HLS, and I am well aware of Nick Rose Day. First person accounts should be allowed for a Wikipedia entry; any suggestion about 'standards' not allowing first person accounts is absurd. You can contact any number of HLS students (or me - bpashler@gmail.com) to verify - if after that you feel that this is all part of an elaborate conspiracy to invent a tradition out of whole cloth, then feel free to edit the section to include that commentary. But to delete the content in the face of first person verifiable accounts (and no verifiable does not require a web link - check your definition of veracity) is not consistent with the standards of Wikipedia, so get off your high horse...<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 38.117.182.130 (<a href="../../../3/8/2E/User_talk%7E38.117.182.130.html" title="User talk:38.117.182.130">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_38.117.182.130_1b53.html" title="Special:Contributions/38.117.182.130">contribs</a>) 20:14, 14 December 2005.</small></li>

<li><b>KEEP</b> Though I know the wikipedia holier/nerdier/somehow-better-linked-to-a-general social and intellectual-conscienceness-than-thou "community" will nix it. HLS brethren, look at the discussion for (the ultimate) deletion of [D-bag football]. It is quite enlightening to see what others think they know about this school, its students, or even what a reasonable argument to keep a page looks like. Again, the anti-HLS bias present in this "community" ranges from innane contempt to outright animosity. Know that comments like "I fear for the future of American jurisprudence" and "if you're a law student, shouldn't you....(wow, whoever wrote that, just wow)" reflect a larger issue with the people on this site ... considering the number of undeleted, horribly written pages on this server that have little to do with anything of importance (by any definition ...even the mighty Wikipedia's, which you will find means <b>nothing</b>). Seriously, look at this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/D-Bag_Football</a> and see where well-articulated, logical, and, frankly, CORRECT arguments will get you. See the SAME BS COMMENTS? .............................The irony is simple; the better you defend your site, <i>the more they will go after you</i>. Make a broad argument? You are too dumb for law school, much less Harvard. Mop the floor with a Nozickian deconstruction of their flimsy premises? Well now you are simply being pretentious, and hey, you aren't that smart anyway you over-privileged snoot. Point out their OBVIOUS prejudice? What are you talking about you elite ass -- get out of your ivory tower and taste the real word (for a change). Now for the record, I am bitter and angry at Wikipedia, but not for the loss of the d-bag article .... it is for the hypocrisy that seems more than apparent by this alledged community. Just remember HLS folk, even after they delete this article (and they will, take my advice and save the html now) you can peruse Wikipedia for MUCH more important celebrations like, say, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linucon.html" title="Linucon">Linucon</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is a real holiday celebrated by students at the Harvard Law School, with defined rituals (wearing pink/red) and a real-life inspiration (the actual Nick Rose).

<p>NB on "sock puppet" votes. As it turns out HLS is expensive, and as such we students like to get what are called "roomates" in the parlance of our times. this being the case, myself and my 2 roomates (as well as other apartments i might add) share the same wireless connection and (lordy!) the same IP address. Thus, any claim of "sock puppet" votes is in fact re-tahd-ed as people here would say. good day. 24.61.41.250 00:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC) (no idea what "24.61.41.250 00:53, 15 December 2005 (UTC)" means.</p>
<ul>
<li>And how does anyone external to Harvard verify that there's a procession of people using the same IP and not one person attempting to sockpuppet? We don't. Regardless, the long procession of anon-IP votes is not helping to keep the article. As I previously noted, it is in fact harming it. If you want this article to remain, then provide some externally verifiable proof. How about scanning an article about the holiday from The Harvard Crimson and tossing it up on a web server somewhere? Better yet, reference the article on their website. I searched their website though, and there's nary a peep about it. If it's such a big event, how come the Crimson doesn't even cover it? Look, all of these assertions by the anonymous IPs are meaningless without verifiable sources.

<p>Wow. It appears that Wikipedia is overrun by people with way too much time on their hands, something which I do not have. I can no longer fight this battle. If you want verification, I will forward you emails from a harvard law school account. I can take pictures of stuff for you. whatever you want. I can not change that fact that Harvard Law School protects that part of its site. I dont know what else you want from me. That article was written by a few students here. We are in the middle of finals here, hence the lack of careful attention to editing etc. I cant defend this anymore. If you are so nuts about deleting it then just do it. Maybe some day I wil re-post it and try and work this all out. Everything here can be verified. And no, this is not done by Nick.</p>

<li>I'm not going to undo the changes I made to unsort logged in and non-logged in votes. If you feel there is a need to do so, then feel free to go through the ~hour of work to do so. Personally, I don't see there being a reason for doing so. There is no de facto marginalization. The votes for anon-IPs exist and have not been removed from the page. They've been sorted by IP in an attempt to quell the apparent sock-puppet attempts and allow the admin that closes this AfD to do so more easily rather than having to contend with the mess this AfD was in before I did the sort. I invite you to review <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#AfD_etiquette" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion#AfD_etiquette</a>, in particular the 4th bullet.

<li>so you have "~hour" to support one point of view but 0 time for the other. Interesting. That seems pretty unbiased to me. ... Right. Also, if you think your little effort to help the admin is unbiased, either you are a liar or a fool. I really don't care which, but I am leaving your biased edits for the admin. to judge.

<li>My changes did not support one view or another. My changes organized the AfD in an appropriate manner. It was horribly formatted before my changes, and very difficult to follow. I don't particularly care if you think I am a liar or fool. I acted in good conscience, and my conscience is clear. Rather than spending so much time attempting to rebuke me and others for all sorts of perceived sins, why not spend the time to find some externally verifiable information regarding this supposed holiday?

<li>I don't think you are a liar or a fool, and I apologize if you found the comments above to imply as such. I was strictly speaking towards the "percieved sin" of biased organization. I (and others) found these "housekeeping" edits to be so obviously slanted that the only avenues of denial appeared to be deceit or ignorance. Well, that plus my perception of you and others harboring a healthy bias against HLS. But that is not how a discussion should run, and I apologize to all for nudging it off track. However, I took your advice and refocused my efforts. With some cross-checking (verifying some "long pointless text" posted above), I found cause for some reorganization of my own. I have re-confirmed a source <i>and</i> participated in some clean-up. Thank you for the sage advice. --<a href="../../../d/g/a/User%7EDgaston_8334.html" title="User:Dgaston">Dgaston</a> 08:47, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I edited the entry to remove some of the personal refernces (not put there by me to begin with), in hopes that this will make the entry more palatable to the censors here. I dont know what else to tell you - the primary source is protected although I can forward the email that the administration sends to everyone each week with the weeks announcements. 140.247.238.138 22:01, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
