<p>A long, rambling play-by-play of the minutae of an episode of a television show, riddled with gramatical errors and misspellings, which would require a complete re-write to be useful. I cannot imagine a reasonable person expecting this kind of poorly written quasi-stream-of-consiousness drivel to have a legitimate place in an encyclopedia, and strongly believe that this kind of "article" reflects poorly upon Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/a/l/User%7ESalad_Days_cbd9.html" title="User:Salad Days">Salad Days</a> 22:48, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As Peregrine Fisher mentioned, the existence of these articles has already been debated, with a consensus of Keep. However, I do agree that the rambling "plot summary" nature of the article needs to be pared down. It should be condensed down to 500-1000 words, and more attention should be made to the non-plot elements of the episode, than just the storyline. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 20:00, 3 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but stubbify quickly</b> - I am <i>not</i> generally in favor of episode articles but I won't fight their spread. However, someone who has seen this episode should delete this text and write a 2-sentence plot summary asap.

<li><b>Keep</b> but simplify. AFD is supposed to be a place to discuss articles that due to their subject matter are believed inappropriate for Wikipedia; I think it's been pretty well established that articles on episodes of major TV series are appropriate given past AFDs and <a href="../../../e/p/i/WP%7EEPISODE_008d.html" title="WP:EPISODE">WP:EPISODE</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> per past precedent of keeping GG episode articles. I have no idea how to get individual episode articles beyond the level of crap and/or stub, but previous discussions indicate it is possible. Subject passes <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> criteria (reviews, etc). --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 04:57, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you know of any reviews of this episode, please point them out. But if you mean reviews of the series, those wouldn't help here. This article isn't about the series. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per the reasoning of Extraordinary Machine and Steve block. WP:NOT is policy. The article violates that policy. And there is no sign that there are any reliable, independent sources that we could use to add "real-world context and sourced analysis" to the article as required by WP:NOT. No need to redirect (unlikely search term) or merge (what information is there to merge?). Responding to folks above who cite "precedent" as a reason for keeping: Wikipedia is not a court. Each subject is treated individually, on its own merits, i.e. are there enough reliable sources independent of the subject to write an article. Even <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> emphasizes that "This page is not policy." If people find <i>arguments</i> made at past AfD's convincing and relevant to this AfD, then repeat those arguments. But <i>outcomes</i> of past AfD's have nothing to do with this one. Anyway, precedent is not uniform on episode articles, see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Merry_Fisticuffs_%28Gilmore_Girls%29_7775.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Merry Fisticuffs (Gilmore Girls)">this</a> (cited by Salad Days) or <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Pieface_%28The_Buzz_on_Maggie_episode%29_c5f4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Pieface (The Buzz on Maggie episode)">this</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Dan_c19c.html" title="User:Pan Dan">Pan Dan</a> 15:22, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> and restore the plot summary. Deletionist extremism and misinterpretation of policy have been at work here. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Care to expand? I'd appreciate an explanation of how you believe policy is misinterpreted.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. With the plot summary it's a violation of Wikipedia policy and possibly U.S. law. Without the plot summary (i.e. as of this writing) it's completely devoid of information. If anyone rewrites the article to describe the episode from an out-of-universe perspective <i>without</i> a detailed plot summary, drop me a line and I'll take a second look. —<a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngr_862c.html" title="User:Angr"><b>An</b></a><a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngr_5690.html" title="User talk:Angr"><i>gr</i></a> 21:28, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Notability isn't the relevant criteria for episode articles. This one fails NOT and EPISODE in that it is an overly long and detailed plot summary with nothing else. I'd support keeping it if it had some analysis or other real world context, but as nothing but a plot summary, it's not encyclopedic and a potential copyright issue. I'd have no objection to merging a much shorter summary into an episode list, and I'd reconsider my vote if this article was improved to address these issues. "Per previous AFD/precedent" isn't a valid argument as wikipedia doesn't operate on precedent - consensus to keep some episode articles doesn't imply that there's consensus to keep all of them. Nor does policy say that all episode articles are inherently worth keeping - it says they should only exist if there's good reason, specifically that they are needed because there's sufficient info beyond the plot summary that it would be too much for an article on the season or the show. --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 16:27, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
