<dl>
<dd><a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> defines original research as "material placed into articles by Wikipedia editors that has not been previously published by a reliable source." Almost every song now has a link to a reliable, mainstream news source. It seems more like source-based research. It doesn't fall into the seven categories of original research either: no new or irrelevant theories or thoughts (i.e. "Player A should play this song because...) are being proposed. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 13:13, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure a category would help, though. In a list, the player and song can be matched up together. Categorizing them all wouldn't show who uses what song and it couldn't link to an article explaining why that song is used. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 21:38, 27 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1. The "original research" policy can be satisfied by eliminating the footnotes and explanations, which were superflous anyway. 2. The claim that music changes rapidly is incorrect for the much of the music listed on the page. Players with rapidly changing music are omitted. 3. This seems like a strange place to enforce the idea that Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Consider the Wrestling entrance music page? What about the vast lists of interstates? This page belongs here as much as those. Not worth the time deleting this one, when there are many better areas to direct our attention towards. 04:13 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>How can the original research policy be satisfied by <i>eliminating</i> the footnotes? Furthermore, just because there are similar articles doesn't mean that this one should be kept ("two wrongs don't make a right" is what I'm getting at). Those articles' problems simply haven't been addressed yet. <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 00:52, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The footnotes are where the "original research" is -- ie "player x uses song y because he's friends with the band" and such. The point of the other examples was to counter the charges above and to illustrate that the suggestion that this article be deleted was misguided. 07:13 26 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I have done a lot of work on this article and, obviously, would rather not have those contributions go for naught. I am willing to improve the article to satisfy the concerns of some of the other Wikipedians, such as verifying and citing music and deleting the lesser, anecdotal contributions (mostly of non-registered users who add songs that have come out in the last couple of months). I have done some verifying as a start, which I hope is a step in the right direction. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 03:25, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I suggest saving the information on your computer and then posting it on a baseball message board where your work will be able to be displayed and appreciated. Also, feel free to userfy this article and recreate it once verifiability has been established.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> 1. Yes, this article contains original research, but it doesn't contain personal views, political opinion, interpretation, or any of the other elements that are stated to justify excluding original information. It's a collection of facts that so far as I can tell don't exist elsewhere. And I've been looking. 2. It's also not "an indiscriminate collection of information." It's a very specific list of baseball players and the songs played when they come to bat. 3. If, however, your policy forces you to exclude this information, please help the creator find a Web site that will host the information. Fans want this info.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If we have an entire category about football/soccer culture and all the minutiae that goes along with that sport (don't get me wrong, I love that category), I fail to see why a single article about a facet of baseball culture that has been around for decades and shows how some players choose to present themselves to their home fans is problematic. It is not a catch-as-catch-can grab bag, as <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> has noted, but rather a list of the players and music that have made themselves notable in the sport over time.

<dd>There is an encyclopedic merit to music in baseball. Baseball, for 150 years, has been a major part of American (and Caribbean and Asian) society, something that has been reaffirmed by thousands of essays, museum exhibits and movies. The game has constantly come in contact with various aspects of daily life -- <a href="../../../b/a/s/Baseball_films.html" title="Baseball films">film</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/r/Ceremonial_first_pitch.html" title="Ceremonial first pitch">politics</a>, etc. An article about one of these connections is encyclopedic and relevant, even if it is a more modern phenomena. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliceNYC_999d.html" title="User:SliceNYC">SliceNYC</a> 16:08, 29 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree. The list is has little to do with baseball as a game. Furthermore, while baseball has been around for a long time and is "America's Pastime", entrance music is quite new and rather trivial. A list of entrance music is nowhere near on the same level as articles on baseball films or a list of ceremonial first pitches (which have relevant historical and encyclopedic contexts outside of baseball). The list is irrelevant trivia about a minor aspect of player's tastes and ballpark atmosphere and as such, unencyclopedic <font color="#008000"><span style="cursor: w-resize"><b>hoopydink</b></span></font><sup>Conas tá tú?</sup> 16:16, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
