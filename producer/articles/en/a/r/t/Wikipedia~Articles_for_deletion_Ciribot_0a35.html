<p>By mageknight53: I love this page, I put time into it. What do you mean "non notable"!? Play the game and see for yourself. And it's not vanity either.

<p>By Mageknight53: The game was released in October of 2005. Ludamad created Ciribot in 1999. That's why I changed it.</p>

<p>Ciricreator.:I don't know why this may be believed to be a "hoax", if you use a search engine and type in ciribot, u will find ciribot forums like <a href="http://forums.gamemaker.nl/index.php?showtopic=141602" class="external free" title="http://forums.gamemaker.nl/index.php?showtopic=141602" rel="nofollow">http://forums.gamemaker.nl/index.php?showtopic=141602</a> , <a href="http://www.ciribotforums.xpt.net/" class="external free" title="http://www.ciribotforums.xpt.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ciribotforums.xpt.net/</a> the ciribot website at <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/ciribotgames/index.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.freewebs.com/ciribotgames/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/ciribotgames/index.htm</a> and the site for the game download itself @ <a href="http://www.64digits.com/games/index.php?cmd=view_game&amp;id=424" class="external free" title="http://www.64digits.com/games/index.php?cmd=view_game&amp;id=424" rel="nofollow">http://www.64digits.com/games/index.php?cmd=view_game&amp;id=424</a></p>

<dd>Ok, I believe that Ciribot is not a hoax. Still, those sources do not assert any notability. Furthermore, forums aren't the kind of sources we rely on.

<p>Wtf, this page is weird...O_o</p>
<hr />
<p>"Wikipedia is not for novel things you and your friend come up with in school or in your garage one day." - [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] Seriously, this article is a waste of space, I say that if less than 5 people care for its existence, it deserves to be deleted. Sorry if it hurts, but you can make your own website about this. Oh wait, you already have. - Kulinsj007</p>
<hr />
<p>If you don't get it, read Ludamad's blog. Or play the game. -MK53 PS: What do you think about the game?</p>
<p>The page has been vandalized now, all well, it would be deleted anyway. For the record, this is the third time a ciribot article has been attempted, the third time it is being deleted, and the third time it was not anyone who made Ciribot making the article. Many things this page could be condemned for, true. But do not call it vanity, that insults me. - Ludamad</p>
<p>If it was already made and deleted two times, then you should have already learned your lesson. - kulinsj007</p>
<p>Quoted from you:"<strong>"Wikipedia is not for novel things you and your friend come up with in school or in your garage one day." - [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NFT" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>] Seriously, this article is a waste of space, I say that if less than 5 people care for its existence, it deserves to be deleted. Sorry if it hurts, but you can make your own website about this. Oh wait, you already have. - Kulinsj007"</strong> Well, in fact, there are <strong>AT LEAST A THOUSAND</strong> people who care about it. And Ludamad came up with it in <strong>1999</strong>, and created a videogame for it in <strong>2005</strong>. So what do you mean "in school or in your garage one day"? That doesn't mean "over the course of 7 years". You just got <strong>OWNED!</strong> -Mageknight53</p>
<p><br />
Kulinsj - it was not me who made it! So there is nothing to be learned. Mageknight, you DO realize you are saying that to the guy who came up with the idea of ciribot, right? (which I have mentioned is not me, but rather the person you just "owned"). In addition, as if you aren't clueless enough, he made the videogame along with me. This is just silly.-Ludamad</p>
<p>Kulinsj-i would like an explaination for who is using my name (kulinsj007) in this debate, I am the one who invented "ciribot" many years ago and since then, it's concept has been taken far by ludamad and I believe that it is worthy of an entry in wikipedia. More work is being done in the ciribot games and will likely gain popularity at it's release.-kulinsj</p>
<hr />
<p>Sorry, I was busy laughing uncontrollably after reading those statements. All of them. Over 1000 people care about Ciribot? Yeah right. Come on, I see the forum on your ciribot site, theres 318 posts from 272 users. 92 of which are from the creators. An average of 0.83 posts from non-creators. And outside of the top 5 posters, there's an average of 0.54 posts per user. I guess they REALLY care about ciribot. And also, if its 7 years old, don't you think you'd grow out of that kind of thing by now? Come on. And for the record, mageknight (nice name, are you a level 72 dungeon master?) I didn't "get owned." Whether you've been obsessing over it for 7 years or not, it's still something that you made up in school or in your garage one day, and is still useless information to the world. This is an encyclopedia, not a worldwide diary for things you do with your friends. You have your own site, get over the fact that just about nobody cares about ciribot. More people care about this rock [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helis_Nunatak" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helis_Nunatak" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>] than your little ciribot.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wait a sec... Luda didn't make Ciribot? And besides, more than a thousand people DO care. Try 64Digits. =P Owned, -Mageknight53</p>
<hr />
<p>Once again, mageknight, I tried 64digits, and theres 109 downloads and 33 comments. 1000&gt;109. Stop saying that over 1000 people care if only 109 downloaded it, and theres about 20 of those people that actually bothered to comment (most of the comments are responses from "ludamad" who I prefer to call adam). I downloaded it myself too, and got bored in a couple minutes. I went to play games on my SNES, much more entertaining. Anybody can make a little game like that with a gamemaker program. And stop saying "owned" when you are just making yourself look like an idiot by saying things that are obviously not true. I still think it's funny you call yourself "mageknight" too, what are you going to do, blast me with a fireball spell? Please, you are doing nothing to help defend the game, you don't even know who created Ciribot. Making invalid, untrue and exaggerated comments doesn't help win an argument, especially if you back them up with something as stupid as "owned."</p>

<p>Well, just the idea of deleting this topic just destroys the purpose of the game itself. without this to support it, it shall be forgotten and will be left to rot in the internet junkyard, along with many others.</p>
