<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. In general, I am quite OK with articles about major party candidates in one-on-one candiate races such as the 2006 house race. A good biography adds to our coverage of races which receive widespread media attention, and are useful to people interested in politics. The problem with this article is not one of notability, but that it looks like a political advert and not an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If the article is poor, it needs to be beefed up, not deleted. He was certainly notable enough to <i>win a primary election</i>, and thus is a major party candidate for the US House. Perhaps the info would be better suited in an article on the election itself, but, until such time there is one, this article ought to be kept. -- <a href="../../../s/h/o/User%7ESholom_b2c6.html" title="User:Sholom">Sholom</a> 14:05, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. A massive 29 Google News hits on "John Russell" Florida; all local press, no nationwide media coverage; local news coverage indicate it's not a close race<a href="http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB8U45Q3TE.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB8U45Q3TE.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, not competitive, and not among even the 50 most closely watched <a href="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/lake/orl-5cong0906oct09,0,7254993.story?coll=orl-news-headlines-lake" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/lake/orl-5cong0906oct09,0,7254993.story?coll=orl-news-headlines-lake" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> races nationwide; Yahoo returns his own site, local press, and other John Russell's; and tying notability to the Mark Foley scandal via the opposing candidate is a stretch.

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b>: No one seems to be listing this race as competitive, and the campaign website seems to have nothing biographical about the candidate. So building this article into a semi-objective one seems far-fetched. I don't think the article is useful as is, and it seems unlikely to ever be.</s> <b>Keep</b>: I didn't realize that Russell's opponent had learned about some of Mark Foley's behavior and failed to act on that.

<dd>Specifically what part of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> are you basing this position on? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:16, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I think it violates the spirit of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> for Wikipedia to feature one major party candidate for election and not another. In this instance, it reflects a pro-incumbent POV by default. Moreover, deleting a candidate's bio less than a month before the election could have a measurable effect on the outcome. On a Google search for "John Russell Florida," the Wikipedia page comes up at the top, even ahead of the candidate's own website, and it is entirely conceivable that the general public would come to this site for NPOV biographical information on this person.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 20:22, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not asking for your opinion on what violates the "spirit" of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, I'm asking you to quote specifically what part of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> supports your statement. Wikipedia is not a news outlet that is obligated to give "equal time" to two candidates. In any encyclopedia (not just Wikipedia), there is bound to be more articles about incumbents than challengers because obviously, incumbents are inherently notable and not all challengers are. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 20:28, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Well, it, obviously in my view violates the prohibition in <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> of "political bias." I'm not asking for equal sized articles or equal time in an election article for less-competitive candidates. Nor am I suggesting that they will remain notable following an election. But I think failing to mention their existence is an expression of a POV. As for notability, I think Wikipedia is especially ill-suited for judging the political notability of candidates. In the United States, each state has a notability test of its own, namely ballot listing. Additionally, major parties have primaries or caucuses to determine notability. I will bring this up in Wiki C&amp;E, but I think ballot listing by a major party in a federal election constitutes de facto notability, even if the candidate is not otherwise notable.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 20:49, 12 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not questioning anybody's good faith here and even though I'm also a Democrat, I'd like to think I'd make the same objection were a Republican's bio on the line. I just think this is a bad road to go down, with WP members deciding by a vote a candidate's viability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBio_639a.html" title="WP:Bio">WP:Bio</a> as I read it has a significantly less strict bar for notability than the State of Florida has in determining who gets to sit on their ballot.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 22:14, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> To be clear, this isn't a bias for incumbents, it is a "bias" for people who are have been in office as opposed to people who have not. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 21:04, 13 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Isn't that the same thing? <a href="../../../d/w/i/Dwight_Eisenhower_f660.html" title="Dwight Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> might not have gotten his own wikipedia article in 1952, had Wikipedia existed then, since he never held elective office before running for President. Bias for people who have been elected is still bias, and it still inappropriately favors incumbents -- people who already benefit from enhanced name rec. In fact, I think WP articles on little-known challengers are especially deserved, precisely because they are little-known. WP doesn't exist to level the playing field, but it does exist to provide a valuable source of NPOV information that would not otherwise be available to readers.--<a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrancisx_7e51.html" title="User:Francisx">Francisx</a> 21:09, 13 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Have you even read Eisenhower's article?? He was notable BEFORE he ran for President. He was Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe during WWII, and headed NATO in 1949. To say that "I think WP articles on little-known challengers are especially deserved, precisely because they are little-known" is completely contrary to Wikipedia policy. Nobody "deserves" an article for being little-known! <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 11:51, 14 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
