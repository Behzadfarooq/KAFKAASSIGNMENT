<li><b>Keep</b> Personally I feel that the Huxley family being notable is a given and there's no need to explain why they're notable. To ask why is about like asking why the <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_%E2%80%94_Wedgwood_family_fd83.html" title="Darwin — Wedgwood family">Darwin — Wedgwood family</a> is notable. Anyway the Huxleys have produced a Nobel Prize winner, one of the most known names in 20th century literature, etc.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 10:02, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The family isn't notable, some members of the family are. These members of the family already have their own entries, the family one is superfluous. <a href="../../../q/u/i/User%7EQuiteUnusual_1e3d.html" title="User:QuiteUnusual">QuiteUnusual</a> 11:14, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are joking, right? This article is <b>not</b> trying to turn Wikipedia into a genealogical database, it is merely showing family relationships between notable people. There are lots of family trees in Wikipedia, but they have to involve notable people. This family tree clearly does involve notable people. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is not about being a geneological site. There is already a <a href="../../../h/u/x/Category%7EHuxley_family_1adc.html" title="Category:Huxley family">Category:Huxley family</a> and this family is significant as a family. It's not just a family that happened to produce some famous people. For many to most of the people named their being Huxley's had some impact on their history. For example many Leftist critics of <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brave_New_World_b07b.html" title="Brave New World">Brave New World</a> cited that <a href="../../../a/l/d/Aldous_Huxley_db2b.html" title="Aldous Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> was of the "Huxley family" and therefore dismissed his criticism of a future that was dull/overly-clean as the whinings of a child of privilege. (This was either in Rai's "Orwell and the Politics of Despair" or possibly Hillegas's "The Future as Nightmare") There's other cases too.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T. Anthony</a> 19:16, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. They are not <i>notable</i>, they are a very important family. I can't think of a more noteworthy family in science and literature. It also shows relation to Arnold fam. I agree with above statements generally, but suspect users do not understand Huxley and Arnolds significance or believe their relationships to be an odd coincidence. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFred.e_41e8.html" title="User:Fred.e">Fred.e</a> 14:10, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> whether the individual members are notable or not is irrelevant. The question is the family name, in its own right? And the answer is no, or at last it has not been made obvious in the article. <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDev920_f8f8.html" title="User:Dev920">Dev920</a> (Tory?) 14:29, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If notability has not been made in the article, the answer is to add notability, rather than delete!

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> sure, SOME family members are notable but they are listed invidually. Why is a listing for the entire family necessary?

<dd><a href="../../../h/u/x/Huxley_family.html" title="Huxley family">Huxley family</a> does <b>not</b> list all the Huxleys.

<dd>In fact, there <i>is</i> precedent on Wikipedia for this sort of article. See my examples listed below. And listing the entire family is what a family tree does.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> - the alternative is to have a family tree template in each of the articles on the notable members of the Huxley families. This article should be considered a sub-article of each Huxley article, and it survives on the notability of the individual Huxleys. As T. Anthony pointed out above, family articles are acceptable, as shown by <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darwin_%E2%80%94_Wedgwood_family_fd83.html" title="Darwin — Wedgwood family">Darwin — Wedgwood family</a>. Having said that, the family tree image is at some of the Huxley articles, and is at <a href="../../../h/u/x/Category%7EHuxley_family_1adc.html" title="Category:Huxley family">Category:Huxley family</a>. However, there is massive precedent for family articles on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../e/n/g/Category%7EEnglish_families_4452.html" title="Category:English families">Category:English families</a> for other examples, such as <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redgrave_family.html" title="Redgrave family">Redgrave family</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mander_family.html" title="Mander family">Mander family</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pease_family_%28Darlington%29_8bab.html" title="Pease family (Darlington)">Pease family (Darlington)</a>, <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynes_family.html" title="Keynes family">Keynes_family</a>. This article needs improvement, and the notability needs to be made explicit, but deletion is not the answer. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:06, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - another example of a family article, though rather different, is <a href="../../../p/t/o/Ptolemaic_dynasty.html" title="Ptolemaic dynasty">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>. Returning to the present day, this sort of geneaological information allows people browsing <a href="../../../k/e/y/Keynes_family.html" title="Keynes family">Keynes family</a> to see that one of the child actors in the recent <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Lion%2C_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe_6b9c.html" title="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i> film (<a href="../../../s/k/a/Skandar_Keynes_2a97.html" title="Skandar Keynes">Skandar Keynes</a>) is a great-great-great-grandson of <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Darwin_74f3.html" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 19:25, 8 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>You are right. Subjective opinion as to what fails to interest different people is not a good way to decide what should be in an encyclopedia. Master Keynes (a namesake of <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexander_the_Great_5bb4.html" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a> incidentially, for the trivia fans) when asked about this, said <i>"yeah, but there are a lot of them"</i> (great-great-great-grandsons of Charles Darwin, that is). Smart kid. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 00:13, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Carcharoth as having half-a-dozen closely related notable individuals calls for such an overview article. Genealogical information of non-notable persons is one thing, this is showing the relationships. It would be cumbersome and confusing to point out all these relationships in the individual articles, but here we can include a family tree and show the relationships. This is not possible merely with a Category (theoretically the tree could go on the category page, but who would look for it there?). --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 21:17, 8 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is essentially a <b>List of members of the Huxley family</b>, only presented in non-list form. How many lists are inherently notable? They are lists of notable individual topics, and they simply provide an alternative entrance to the data. Categories do this, but lists serve different functions from categories. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 20:35, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm confused now. Lambian and Dhartung, you have both voted keep, but seem to be arguing about something. I can't quite work out what though! <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 23:05, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>They seem to be arguing about whether this should be deemed a list or an article. I tend to feel that lists are articles of a kind so that's not important to me.

<dd>I got confused by Dhartung's comment. If this stubby article is doomed to remain "just" a list of the notable individual members of the family, well, then for this case I don't see an advantage in the list form over the category. It is the potential of a full-fledged article that makes me recommend it to be kept. &#160;--<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 04:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>My reply was to Dev920, not Lambiam. Sorry for the confusion -- I thought the indent was enough! To clarify my point and this unintended tangent: I believe it is a potential article, which is why a category is insufficient. I wasn't arguing against expansion, simply noting that a list, like a category, is an organizational tool. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 01:47, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
