<p><b>A hoax</b>. The article claims that the 28 years old Asser Harb is Egypt's State Solicitor. The article was created by User:Captor (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Captor_aa7c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Captor">contribs</a>)who joined wikipedia just to edit this article and its images and was later expanded by <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAsserHarb_10ae.html" title="User:AsserHarb">User:AsserHarb</a>.

He claims that there are several google hits for Asser Harb in Arabic. He also admits that he is both <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAsserHarb_10ae.html" title="User:AsserHarb">User:AsserHarb</a> and User:Captor.

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I reviewed the history of the article and the pages of Xaosflux and Wedian and I found out that both of them are not legal professionals and thus they should not and could not be aware of the validity of the content of the article. As an Egyptian legal professional, I ensure that it is undisputed that Asser harb is a well known and a distinct State Solicitor in Egypt and thus I confirm that all the content of the article is true and NOT a hoax. Please proceed to save the article from deletion.</p>
<p>Ahmed Hassan</p>
<p><br />
It seems that <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> is not a legal professional. She can not defferentiate between the Attorney General and the Solicitor General. In Egypt, the Title Attorney General is misused before the name of the Public Prosecutor, however, the title Solicitor General is used before the name of the President of the State Lawsuits Authority, another judicial institution that is in charge of representing Egypt before national and international courts.</p>
<p>Indeed, Asser Harb was a bank lawyer one day ( and the article itself says this), but he is currently Egypt's State Solicitor, i.e. he is currently a member within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority. He is also well known as an eminent international legal practitioner on behalf of Egypt in complex international arbitrations.</p>
<p>As a legal professional working in Egypt, I ensure that although all the comments of <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> can possibly be true, however I confirm at the same time that all the content of the article Asser Harb is true and valuable to the legal wikipedians.</p>
<p><a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> is not a legal practitioner but a pharmacist, who should not and could not judge a legal article like Asser Harb.</p>
<p>BY THE WAY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR (OR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL) IS NOT A JUGE BUT AN ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE IN CRIMINAL CASES. TAKE CARE USER BEFORE MISLEADING THE OTHER WIKIPEDIANS TO MIS UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT OF A VALUABLE ARTICLE. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 82.201.207.248 (Talk) (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_82.201.207.248_%28Talk%29_49ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/82.201.207.248 (Talk)">contribs</a>) 23:54, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP</b> Following the history of the article in that way does not lead necessarily to the deletion of the article. It seems that <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> improperly confounds between two different Egyptian Judicial institutions, the Public Prosecution النيابة العامة in one hand and the State Lawsuits Authority هيئة قضايا الدولة in the other hand. The members of the aforementioned two judicial institutions are not judges but counsel for the state. Google hits can not possibly be a criterion to evaluate the credibility of the article, since most of the members of judicial institutions in Egypt and other countries are not popularly known, however they are just famous and well known among the legal practitioners. I worked closely to Honorable Asser Harb and he is really an exceptional legal faculty that should be recorded by Wikipedia. It is not the author's fault to have non-legal wikipedians unware of the famous legal practitioners in Egypt, but it is the fault of <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> who is obviously legally ignorant.--Save Data 13:24, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

No Asser Harb in any of these lists, right?

The 28 years old Asser Harb can't even be a judge or councel (moustashar).

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear <a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a>, I purden you for your misunderstanding because you are not a specialist. The website Arab Decision that you have cited do not comprise all of the members of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority. Moreover all the names included therein are not updated. For instance the current President of the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority is not H.E. Counselor Hossam Adel Azim as you have just contended, but he is H.E. Counselor Milad Sidhom and you are invited to read the content of this link <a href="http://www.emigration.gov.eg/AllNews/DisplayNews.aspx?CatId=8&amp;NewsId=56864" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.emigration.gov.eg/AllNews/DisplayNews.aspx?CatId=8&amp;NewsId=56864" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Furthermore, you have to know that the word "counsel" does not mean مستشار in Arabic but means نائب and مستشار in English is "Counselor". The State Counsel or نائب الدولة in Arabic is normally so much younger than the State Counselor or مستشار الدولة and thus Honorable Asser harb, who is Egypt's State Counsel, should be so much younger than H.E. the President of the State Lawsuits Authority, who should be, in accordance to the governing law of the Authority, the oldest Vice President in the Authority. As regards the number of members in the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, it is not 28 as mentioned in the Arab Decision website but more than 2000. Moreover, youy have to know that Asser Harb was appointed as State Counsel within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority by virtue of the Presedential Decree No. 133/2003 and you can easily get a copy from the Formal Gazzette الجريدة الرسمية . Also, you can simply know more about Honorable Asser Harb from the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority at the 10th floor, Mogamaa Building, Tahrir Square, Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, Department of Foreign Disputes. You will learn that although he is one of the youngest members of the authority, he is currently recognised for his extensive international legal practice on behalf of the Arab Republic of Egypt. Because you set out an in depth research, you have to complete it to the end. Go on and I am sure you will not delete the article but you eill try to enhance it. My last advice to you is that you have to take care you are currently insulting a judicial member within the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority, the act that constituites a crime in accordance with the Egyptian penal law, which you can possibly be accused of ( even in Mansoura).

<dd>I would consider these last threats as a very serious offense toward <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> if they were not so laughable. Look if you have documented evidence of what you're saying then it should be easy to actually provide that evidence. Please stop wasting everyone's time with your lectures and give us hard facts. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:37, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am not in a position to file evidence against anyone here, but I am just talking from a legal point of view in accordance with the applicable Egyptian law. It does not matter with me personally to have the article kept or deleted. I am just drawing the attention to a fact that is well-furnished. To provide a hard fact ( as you have just requested)&#160;; I simply invite anyone who can understand Arabic to review Article 6 bis of the law governing the Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority <a href="http://smsma4law.com/vb/showthread.php?p=16570" class="external text" title="http://smsma4law.com/vb/showthread.php?p=16570" rel="nofollow">here</a> and he will learn that I am right. As regards filing evidence, it can possibly be filed under the Egyptian applicable law which you do not know anything about but I do.--Save Data 22:57, 14 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is my last comment. I'm not engaging anymore into this. The author of the article tried to convince the readers that Asser Harb is the chief state solicitor. <a href="../../../a/s/s/User%7EAsserHarb_10ae.html" title="User:AsserHarb">User:AsserHarb</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_AsserHarb_b208.html" title="Special:Contributions/AsserHarb">(contribs)</a> and User:196.205.176.54( <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_196.205.176.54_b953.html" title="Special:Contributions/196.205.176.54">contribs</a>) - another <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accountwho</a> only adds Asser Harb related content- have created <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_State_Lawsuits_Authority_5e33.html" title="Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority">Egyptian State Lawsuits Authority</a> and the <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html#Egypt" title="Attorney General">Egypt section</a> in <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney_General_303a.html" title="Attorney General">Attorney General</a> with the sole name of Asser Harb in both articles. But, if you are certifying that Asser Harb is one of the councels in the Egyptian lawsuits authority, then <b>he certainly fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></b>. This actually ends it -at least for me-. No offense intended, but the article Asser Harb lists no special achievments except for his job. I guess we have first to write articles about all the current and previous presidents, vice presidents, judges and councelors of all <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html#Courts" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian_Judicial_System#Courts</a> of the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian_Judicial_System</a> and then we can turn to counsels and prosecutors. How many articles would that be? If you are - as i assume- Asser Harb yourself or one of his friends, then please read <a href="../../../a/b/_/WP%7EAB_9fd9.html" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>. Instead , why not use your legal knowledge to help wikipedia by expanding articles like the <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Judicial_System_1689.html" title="Egyptian Judicial System">Egyptian Judicial System</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Constitutional_Court_of_Egypt_5894.html" title="Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt">Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt</a>, <a href="../../../e/g/y/Egyptian_Civil_Code_16b2.html" title="Egyptian Civil Code">Egyptian Civil Code</a> or <a href="../../../a/b/d/Abdel-Razzak_Al-Sanhuri_cd73.html" title="Abdel-Razzak Al-Sanhuri">Abdel-Razzak Al-Sanhuri</a> who wrote the first version of the Egyptian civil code. Another thing, <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">User:Pascal.Tesson</a> was asking you to provide evidence to verify your statements about Asser Harb and not evidence that i might be punished if i insult a judicial member. BTW, how serious are these threats? Should i be afraid and disappear from wikipedia before anybody discovers who really i am and make me really disappear?&#160;:)--<a href="../../../w/e/d/User%7EWedian_2daa.html" title="User:Wedian">Wedian</a> 03:10, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
