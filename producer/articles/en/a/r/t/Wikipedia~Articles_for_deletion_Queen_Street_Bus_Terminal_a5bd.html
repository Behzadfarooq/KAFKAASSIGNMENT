<li>It is not a bus stop it is a bus station or terminus. There are two other Queen Street bus stations on Wiki already, as weel as countless others, including the entire system in Perth, Australia, which includes Park and Rides bus stops. I thought Wiki should be all inclusive (ie as a paperless work, it can be exhaustive in scope). <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStamford_spiney_6c6c.html" title="User:Stamford spiney">Stamford spiney</a> 13:20, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. "Wikipedia is not paper" does not mean that useful, encyclopedic information can not be overwhelmed and diluted by the presence of unencyclopedic trivia. One of our responsibilities as editors is not only to write material, but to use our judgment in terms of deciding whether that material makes the encyclopedia <i>better</i>, or just makes it <i>bigger</i>. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:50, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>IMO the "dilution" argument makes no sense at all. If people look up <a href="../../../f/r/a/France.html" title="France">France</a>, they will get an article about France, not a minor article. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalsicol_c774.html" title="User:Calsicol">Calsicol</a> 14:21, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You haven't thought it through. There's the obvious dilution of "give me a random link" being more likely to return a useless stub on a dumb subject — like this one — but let's put that aside. Part of the value of an encyclopedia is in the selection and ordering of material, as well as the inclusion. Inclusion of a main article on a subject is an implicit assertion that the topic is notable. If Wikipedia becomes known as a place that asserts that random bus stations with no distinguishing characterics in Singapore are important main topics, then our credibility is diminished accordingly: we become known not as an encyclopedia, but as a garbage dump. This article is, essentially, the geographic equivalent of a dicdef. Unless there's some actual aspect of this bus station that is encyclopedic, let wikitravel or some other more appropriate site catalog it. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 16:28, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, there seems to be precedent for including bus stations.

<li>Hi Theresa. Is there a reason for the qualification in your first sentence? I'm just wondering because I'm unsure how your stated reasons for keeping a bus terminal/station would make a bus stop any less worthy of keeping. For example,</li>
</ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>"Keep, it's a bus stop. It's not something that particulaly interests me but it interested the anon enough to write it so it will probably interest some others enough to want to read it. Many of our articles started life as crappy stubs..."</i>

<dd>If we base our decisions only on this reasoning, and not criteria such as, say, the availability of multiple independent reputable sources/studies on the subject that may be used to write an encyclopedic entry (WP:V, WP:RS, WP:N), how do we decide if anything can (or should) be deleted? Why not,
<ul>
<li><i>"Keep, it's a phone booth. It's not something that particulaly interests me but it interested the anon enough to write it so it will probably interest some others enough to want to read it. Many of our articles started life as crappy stubs..."</i> Or even,</li>
<li><i>"Keep, it's a public garbage can used by quite a few people. It's not something that particulaly interests me but it interested the anon enough to write it so it will probably interest some others enough to want to read it. Many of our articles started life as crappy stubs..."</i></li>
</ul>

<li>It's not immediately apparent to me how the above reasoning might distinguish between these (or even whether it is intended to). Perhaps we should keep them all?
