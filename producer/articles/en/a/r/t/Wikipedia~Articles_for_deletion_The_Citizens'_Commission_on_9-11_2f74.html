<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>9/11 Truth Movement</i>. There is little well-argued support for retaining a standalone article. Much of it is "but we have Pokemon articles". Well yes, we do. That doesn't have a great deal to do with <i>this</i> article though, which is largely unrelated to Pokemon. The 'merge to' arguments are well-enough supported, with the supposition that deleters will grumble but live with a merge as a compromise position that I reckon there's a reasonably consensual position on this. That said, a merge is an editorial decision. Fuddlemark's point about right's to express POVs is on the money, by the way. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 23:42, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

Maybe you didnt even bother to read the title, "The <b><i>Citizens</i> Commission</b> on 9-11",&#160;? IF you even bother to look at it, you will see that it is a very good description. Even if it was a bad description, you should fix it, not delete the whole article.

<dd>No offence taken, bro *smile*. Thanks for being so polite to me. Bro, the event was about the most prominent researchers in the 9/11 truth field getting together to have a commisson about 9/11. Now, as it turned up, they choose to mimic the congressional variant. That does not make them a Congressioan hearing congress, neither is the article claiming any such thing. I will edit the article to clearify that. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:31, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Im not sure what you meant, but if you questioned wheter Cynthia whas there on her own, or sent by someone, you only need to look trough the recording to see clearly that nobody in politics would "send her" to that Commission. Her point of view in that Commission is not far from being politica suicide. Further, she was no a congresswoman at that time, she had been fired, but she was re-elected not much later. Politicians hate her, the people love her. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I dont understand why people like to repeat things i have proven false. The article DOES NOT claim that it is a United States Congress hearing, and the evidence of it being notable " in the circles of 9/11 conspiracy theorists" is that the follownig people where among them:</p>

<p>Guys, it can be argued that it was non-notable for everyone else, but it is notable for those in the group. Its like saying that the religious festivite of a minor religion is non-notable, only since you never heard of it. I clearly showed that the most prominent people holding that view where present in that event. Notability does not mean whether <i>you</i> care, rather, if the <i>relevant</i> people care.</p>
<p>Is doing <i>"the report of the theorists"</i> not what wikiepdia is about? How can you vote delete for doing what wikipedia is about, <b>reporting</b> points of views?</p>

<dd>Whether the people in the group care is irrelevant. Whether the world at large cares is. The discussions I and my friends had in the pub last night were important to us, but they still aren't encyclopedic material. Can't find notability in this conspiracy theory report or the proceedings that created it. It has nothing to do with agreeing with the views, it has everything to do with <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Some conspiracy theorists calling themselves "a commission" is not automatically notable.

<ul>
<li>No, everything that doesn't have enough content that it should be a separate article should be merged there. Salat should not be merged into Islam because there's more than enough content to discuss Salat in great detail on its own page, but still give a general overview of it in its parent page, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a>. I don't see that there's enough material here that this shouldn't be merged. My reasoning is, if someone wants to get an idea of what the 9/11 Truth Movement is all about, they shouldn't have to run all over the Wiki to find information. If this is worth saying, it's small enough in content that it's worth saying on the 9/11 Truth Movement, rather than putting shards of this topic all over the encyclopedia. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>A commision with a congresswoman participiated in it is nn and POV? Could you expand on HOW it is POV?

<li>It's my understanding she was not a Congresswoman at the time... though who can tell? The article has no dates. I do have to agree with Striver that "POV" is a rather weak reason to delete this article, as the article is about a <i>group</i> (and maybe an event? Who can tell?) with a POV, but that does not make the <i>article itself</i> have a POV that cannot be, you know, N'd. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 17:48, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Yes, Media coverage, World premier of a movie, former and future congresswoman participiated, great oppurtunity to spread the message...

<li>Still delete. From the article: <i>The commision was modeled after <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> hearing</i>. So both a congressional hearing and this commission have a bunch of people asking questions from another bunch of people.

<p>I have answered that, why do people keep ignoring the issues that make this relevant, and keep repeating things that DOES not make this relevant? Why dont you delete this sayng "they drank <a href="../../../w/a/t/Water.html" title="Water">water</a>, that does not make it notable"?</p>
<p>This was the bigges things that happened to the 9/11 movement then, ONLY that makes it notable, even if you ignore that:</p>
<ul>
<li>There where VERY prominent people among the 9/11 truth movement there.</li>
<li>One of them got into congress a few month later.</li>
<li>A decade long Canadian mainstream journalist was present.</li>
<li>Media was there.</li>
<li>Families of the vicitims of 9/11 wherer there.</li>
<li>A world premier of a movie happened.</li>
<li>The whole event was recorded and is still distributed for download.</li>
<li>Notable writers where there</li>
</ul>

<dd>The red links are there because not every single person is notable, for example the families of victimes are arguebly not notable in themselves. If they are, ill be happy to create a article about them. Not all blue links are upp for AFD, and those that are will make it. In my view, they are bad faith nominations, driven by a desire to stop articles about 9/11 truthmovement to be writen. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 23:58, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The Citizens Commission was one of the most unique, important and key historic events of the early public response questioning the official story.
