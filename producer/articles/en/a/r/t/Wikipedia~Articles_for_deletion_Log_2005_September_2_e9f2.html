<p>Close to being {{nonsense}}. Concept is described as a theory, but no details of what that theory is are given. Esoteric discussion of chaos theory and strange attractors without describing relevance to subject matter. Final sentence "This wisdom ought to be taken for granted in the same way is gravity is" offers no supporting evidence as why this theory should be taken for granted. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillC_d650.html" title="User:BillC">BillC</a> 00:10, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeostasis.html" title="Homeostasis">Homeostasis</a> and add a brief note somewhere giving the title of Cannon's book. Cannon's book is famous, as is <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cannon_c660.html" title="Walter Cannon">Walter Cannon</a>, and the phrase "wisdom of the body" is frequently mentioned in conjunction with <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homeostasis.html" title="Homeostasis">homeostasis</a>. The present contents of the article is more or less nonsense and original research. I don't think there's anything that can needs to be said under the heading "Wisdom of the body" that would be separate from <i>Homeostasis.</i> The book itself could conceivably be worthy of an entire article but if anyone wants to write about the book the should start by writing a section in <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Cannon_c660.html" title="Walter Cannon">Walter Cannon</a> and breaking it out if and when it grows big enough. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:31, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wisdom of the Body is a broadened version of the metaphor conceived by Starling and adopted by Cannon. It provides a common framework for seemingly unrelated concepts e. g., equilibrium, steady state, and strange attractor, and is applied to interpret health and disease in a new way. In other words health and disease can be expressed by these disciplines in different ways.

<li>Delete: Verification of notability? Referred to by what? In fact, this is the English Wikipedia, meaning that topics are supposed to be encountered by English-speakers. When the title remains in Polish and the article's claims for notability are only that it was popular within Poland, we're looking at something similar to a local TV show: it hasn't sufficient context in the English written world. It may be the greatest TV show ever, might have had a big audience in Poland, but will the anglophone reader require it, under this title, in this location, and learn sufficient amounts from this? It doesn't seem that way to me, although I would be happy to see citations in English to the show that would make it an English-language topic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't know if outright deletion is key here. It looks like there is reference to a second source (the first being The Bible).

<li>Leaning towards <b>Merge</b> -- After an exhaustive investigation (I think I exhausted Google), I would recommend to keep this article (for now). It justs needs more research. The Deluge is in reference to the flood that Noah and the animals rode out on the Ark. Noah's name in Hebrew becomes "Noach." Noacniari may be a corruption of Noachian, a word sometimes attributed to the Great Flood.

<li>This article is a cut-and-paste of a single paragraph on page 39 of <a href="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/kids/wsb/pdfs/9121.pdf" class="external text" title="http://www.epa.gov/safewater/kids/wsb/pdfs/9121.pdf" rel="nofollow">this document</a> (which is probably public domain since it's from a US Govt website). In the context of the full article, this appears to be an attempt to make a parenthetical comment about groundwater and mentions the "Noacniari Deluge" in passing. It is clearly not a discussion <i>about</i> the "Noacniari Deluge". That section of the full article is also nearly incomprehensible (proving that government-sponsored gibberish is still gibberish). I don't see anything worth keeping and except for this one article, I can't find any other verification of the use of the title "Noacniari Deluge".

<li>I mean that any articles that do deserve an article but are not in good shape should go to cleanup, not to AFD. AFD is to get articles <i>deleted</i>, not <i>fixed</i>. While it is a good way to bring more eyes into the picture and start discussion, it is not the recommended way. AFD is too large and we've been trying to make it smaller for quite a while. These nominations just clog an already clogged process.

<dd>If I did that, then I'd vote what you vote (delete), which is highly unlikely. And to quote the AGF page: <i>Of course, there's a difference between assuming good faith and ignoring bad actions. If you expect people to assume good faith from you, make sure you demonstrate it. Don't put the burden on others. Yelling "Assume Good Faith" at people does not excuse you from explaining your actions, and making a habit of it will convince people that you're acting in bad faith.</i> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> Interesting cultural tidbit. Isn't really the sort of thing that can be merged anywhere, though I'm open to suggestions. I know it goes back at least to the mid-80s (in Pennsylvania). If the comment above is correct, it's a part of human culture for at least 60 years and at least 2 continents. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 02:58, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I clearly remember being told about this by my 4th grade teacher when I was a kid-- long before anyone ever thought of Nickelodeon. She explained that was the reason that the first day of the month is known as "rabbit day." If I remember rightly, she also told us that forgetting to say "rabbit rabbit" could be undone by saying the word backwards while hopping on one foot and rotating counterclockwise.<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:17, 2 September 2005 (UTC) I did a quick check using ProQuest, this superstition is mentioned in the June 4, 1997 issue of the Boston Globe at page A18 as an example of a common superstition. And according to the May 13, 1992 issue of the Los Angeles Times, it is in a book about children's superstitions called "One Potato, Two Potato," by Mary and Herbert Knapp. Maybe that's where Nickelodeon got it?<a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:34, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> I have completely rewritten the article, added a lot of material as well as references. This took a huge amount of research (I was almost surprised to find it in actual reference books) but hopefully the concerns about this article have been addressed...it is certainly nothing to do with any kids' show, and is at least a century old, possibly much more. I still consider the article a work in progress, and I plan to add more and possibly move it to Rabbit superstition or similar, as "rabbit, rabbit" is just one of many key phrases for this folklore. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:52, September 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>

The page's claim that Nales is a member of the Martial Arts Hall of Fame is doubtful, since I didn't find him listed among inductees, and many of his other claims are difficult or impossible to verify. This page seems to be vanity; however, there remains the possibility that his work as a newsanchor could cause some to feel he is notable enough to merit an entry. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeadsalmon_0aca.html" title="User:Deadsalmon">Deadsalmon</a> 05:02, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep/Cleanup</b> Pedro Rosa Nales is an important investigative reporter in Puerto Rico.

<li><b>Comment</b>. This page struck me as strange, so I decided to look into it in detail. It was created 2005-08-09 by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.122.37.209_7895.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.122.37.209">219.122.37.209</a>. On the day it was created, Jtkiefer SD-tagged it as nonsense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=8888&amp;diff=20602586&amp;oldid=20602314" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=8888&amp;diff=20602586&amp;oldid=20602314" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, probably while on NP patrol. However, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_219.122.37.209_7895.html" title="Special:Contributions/219.122.37.209">219.122.37.209</a> removed the tag, and it apparently went unnoticed. The only article that was linked to the page was the <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> article, in reference to a violent repression of Burmese citizens that took place 17 years ago. It turns out that the title, <b>8888</b>, is the way that date is remembered by those in the region (it happened on 8.8.1988). It was a pivotal event in the bloody tragedy that has marked that country all these years. The entire content of the article space was taken from a website <a href="http://www.irrawaddy.org/res/88final1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.irrawaddy.org/res/88final1.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, which appears to be that of an organization devoted to Myanmar's troubled history. It is copyrighted material. I have done the following: Edited the <a href="../../../m/y/a/Myanmar.html" title="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> article to delink it from 8888, and placed an in text external link to the original website. Placed a copyvio tag on 8888, and blanked the page. With the technical conflict of AfD and CVio rules I wondered whether to leave it, but I'd say the copyvio takes precedence, and the history is available in any case. I listed it on the eternally slow copyvio, but if Zoe or another closing sysop decide to go ahead and delete the page, this can be delisted. I don't think I've ever felt this sad in blanking &amp; copyvio tagging a page.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">Encephalon</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="red"><sup>ζ</sup></font></a>&#160; 09:21:33, 2005-09-02 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Bhadani. I agree with you that they're obviously not the same (I'm sure everyone who voted agrees too). However, the idea behind the redirect vote is that the spellings are often confused, and people looking for <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confucianism.html" title="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> will often type in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confusionism.html" title="Confusionism">Confusionism</a>. A redirect will send them to the correct article. Creating redirects for common misspellings is <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Sea_anenomes_4558.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sea anenomes">apparently done fairly often on WP</a>.

<p>He is an official staffer at Shacknews.com who has a certain lore about him that is well seperated into a seperate section. Maybe the article should be LOCKED but not deleted. Since he does have a history of good stuff at idle thumbs, since it wasn't put up by shacknews officials, and since it is pretty clear what is goofy lore about Remo as it is seperated and what is fact, deletion would be wrong. Some of the related articles are junk and could be deleted, thats for sure. But the actual Chris Remo part should stay the same.</p>
<p>If anything, the now re-branded 'lore' section should be deleted and the article locked for a period.</p>
<p>I think the fable's of Chris Remo should be kept for future reference about the great man that is Chris Remo.</p>
<p>Yes he is a great guy but that is not the point of wikipedia. We don't need to infest this part of the internet with our diseases.</p>

<li>It is a one line article, and no one yet has found any information to expand it sufficiently. (Of course, the avenging might of Tony Sidaway may.)

<li>To a certain extent I must disagree. No rational argument can be made to support the idea that all schools are unimportant, yet there are people voting delete regardless of how well things such as notability and importance are conveyed within the article. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 21:21, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>While that is true, again look at prior VfD's, we've had people who desire to keep any school, just so long as it's a school (some of them even voted to keep a local grocery store just because it existed). By that logic my house should be kept as an article as learning takes place there and it's multicultural. I'm not defending the 100% deletionists by any means, but I'm also very much against the 100% keep people as well. Neither position is tenable. <a href="../../../g/a/t/User%7EGateman1997_fc90.html" title="User:Gateman1997">Gateman1997</a> 23:50, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm going to concentrate my efforts for a few days on cataloguing the current rate of growth of school articles on Wikipedia. I've a feeling that when we all get a clear picture of the raw growth rate we'll all agree that any efforts made on AfD, except those that result in improvement of articles during a discussion, are unlikely to be effective in restraining the growth rate of relatively low quality school stubs.</li>
<li>I don't decry the listing of articles on AfD, at least at the reasonable rates that have pertained since the mass nominations of mid-May, but neither do I believe that it's possible to represent the AfD process truthfully as posing a quality control on school articles insofar as it deletes articles of poor quality.</li>
<li>I support school AfDs (although I nearly always vote keep) for a different reason: the discipline of the five day discussion followed by a life-or-death decision is useful in focussing attention and driving the research and expansion process of school stubs. Without that process, I don't think so many articles about schools would have attained of good quality in so short a time--some of them only days after first creation. I'm convinced that school articles will nearly all converge to a good quality as the decades pass, and that the number of school articles on Wikipedia will continue to increase for many years to come, but the AfD process has been useful in driving the process and pushing thw quality up early in the game. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:34, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Most of the most relevant papers were published in <a href="http://www.harcourt-international.com/journals/mehy/" class="external text" title="http://www.harcourt-international.com/journals/mehy/" rel="nofollow">Medical Hypotheses</a>. This journal is published by the well-known publisher Elseviers, and has an editor, but describes itself as follows:
<dl>
<dd>"<i>Medical Hypotheses</i> takes a deliberately different approach to peer review. Most contemporary practice tends to discriminate against radical ideas that conflict with current theory and practice. <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> will publish radical ideas, so long as they are coherent and clearly expressed. Furthermore, traditional peer review can oblige authors to distort their true views to satisfy referees, and so diminish authorial responsibility and accountability. In <i>Medical Hypotheses,</i> the authors' responsibility for the integrity, precision and accuracy of their work is paramount. The editor sees his role as a 'chooser', not a 'changer': choosing to publish what are judged to be the best papers from those submitted. Papers in <i>Medical Hypotheses</i> take a standard scientific form in terms of style, structure and referencing. The journal therefore constitutes a bridge between cutting-edge theory and the mainstream of medical and scientific communication, which ideas must eventually enter if they are to be critiqued and tested against observations."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Our ban on "original research" is usually taken to apply to material which has not been published outside Wikipedia. I would describe this as material that <i>has</i> been published, and has been been published in a "medical journal," one significant enough to be indexed by PubMed... but a rather odd "medical journal." I think it is accurate to say that it is not peer-reviewed. "Medical Hypotheses" seems to be intentionally set up for the exposure of <i>not-yet-accepted</i> theories. If so, that material would not yet be ready for inclusion in an encyclopedia.</dd>

<p>Gentlemen, it seems to me that your arguments are not serious. The Streaming Organism theory is based on reliable experiments which were published in peer reviewed journals. You may not like it which does not mean that you may censor it. Such an act would undermine the free spirit of Wikipedia.</p>

<li>LOL. Yes, fair point. The squirrel article, however, does mention them, and in so far as there's mention of something in a legitimate WP article, it may be more helpful to be able to direct interested readers to that article rather than make it somewhat more difficult (that was my reasoning anyway). It is likely that the mention of the society in the squirrel article is the work of one of its members (although not the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.191.220.14_c97b.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.191.220.14">creator</a> of the ASPS page), but since the editors of the squirrel article do not object to its mention, and it has remained in that article, I don't see why a redirect to this information is a bad thing. There should not be an article in this space, however; with that I agree.—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 09:25:26, 2005-09-09 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>: But only if it can be kept as a separate line of events. Rename as "The President's Activity During Same Time Frame" or something like that. Being named as his "response" doesn't allow the article to fairly include activities not directly related to Hurricane K. Rather, it forces an implied non-response which I'd rather not see in the Wikipedia. By renaming it, the same details could remain and the reader could decide for her/himself the relevance to Hurricane Katrina. Wynote.blogspot.com 08:16, 8 September 2005</li>

<p>This is fundamentally a [POV] issue, not something worthy of academic or encyclopaedic record. So long as the "occupation" continues, one side will insist on pan-Irish nomenclature. So long as one "Ulster loyalist" lives (in Derry, Glasgow or the farthest reaches of Antarctica), the other side will insist on nomenclature to reflect its belief that the counties are at the heart of the English suburban sprawl. Politics will solve this, not rational argument. The answer may also lie with EU decress, since both England and the Free State have joined the Union, and therefore have abrogated the final say on their nationhood to Brussels. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 62.25.109.196 (<a href="../../../6/2/2E/User_talk%7E62.25.109.196.html" title="User talk:62.25.109.196">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_62.25.109.196_5307.html" title="Special:Contributions/62.25.109.196">contribs</a>) 08:07, 1 September 2005.</small></p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. There's no reason to delete this article. It doesn't try to say what the place in question should be called, merely to document that there is a dispute. It seems to do that pretty well, and (though I'm not an expert in the area) there doesn't seem to be anything here that either side would object to.

<p><b>Comment</b> Usually I will want this article deleted, because ciritics of Ataturk should be included in his own entry. But since Turkish nationalists consider that dictator as more suprem than Allah, and will not premit criticism in his own entry, I don't know what other alternative there can be. If Ataturks entry was to be like how articles should be written, than I will be the first placing this article to deletion. For now, I don't know if this article should be deleted or not.

No mention of him on Wikipedia, &amp; a Google search turns up <a href="http://www.urdupoetry.com/shad.html" class="external text" title="http://www.urdupoetry.com/shad.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which suggests that he <i>may</i> be an <a href="../../../u/r/d/Urdu_language.html" title="Urdu language">Urdu</a> poet. however, if that is the case, then this article gets so much wrong about Mr Azeemabadi that we might as well delete what's here, &amp; write a new article on Azeemabadi from scratch. <a href="../../../l/l/y/User%7ELlywrch_461d.html" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> 23:19, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Note: There exists a series on "list of religious leaders", and there's one list from 1910, so I copied that into this article.

Just did a search of newspaper articles on ProQuest and found reviews/references to the site in several different newspapers including the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Guardian</i>. The creator of the website was also interviewed on NPR's <i>All Things Considered</i> on February 26, 2003 about the ongoing "How Much Is Inside?" feature on the site. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 16:17, 3 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>I get zero results when I try to find this site using ProQuest. Could you link to your search results? I also get zero results from Google news. Alexa ranking of 30,108. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 21:55, September 3, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, I can't link the ProQuest results because I am using a subscription service. I just searched for incidents of "cockeyed.com" anywhere in article text (searching national newspapers database). If you have some way to view it, try:
