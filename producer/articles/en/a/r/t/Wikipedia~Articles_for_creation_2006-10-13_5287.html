<p>Carlos Alberto Montaner was born in Cuba in 1943 and has lived in Madrid since 1970. He has been a professor in institutions throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States. He writes a weekly column which is featured in many daily newspapers published in Latin America and the United States, including the ABC of Madrid, the Miami Herald and the electronic periodical "El Iberoamericano". He is the author of many books, several of which have been translated into various languages. In collaboration with Álvaro Vargas Llosa and Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza he wrote Guide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot. In 2001 he published Twisted Roots: Latin America's Living Past. In this book, which has several different editions and is used as suplementary text in several Latin American Universities, Montaner writes from a historical perspective about one of the most interesting aspects of Latin American culture: Why is Latin America the poorest and most instable region in the Western Hemisphere? His latest books about his native country have been Cuba: A Century of Painful Learning, published in 2002 and Cubans: the History of Cuba in one Lesson, published in 2006. Both are the result of a series of conferences which were given in the the University of Miami.</p>

<p>After The Order is a Christian rock band from Kearney, Nebraska. The band formed in 1995 when lead vocalist/guitarist Luke Mills started a band known as Standing Stones with lead guitarist Kris Pfeil in 1995. In 2000, they decided to go professional with their career. Eventually, the band's name was changed from Standing Stones to After The Order. In 2002, along with drummer Josh McNeal and bass player Tim Wilson, After The Order released their first CD known as "Tear Stained World". The following year, in 2003, they released their second CD, "Broken Sky". In 2004, After The Order released their first EP, "Stop, Rock, N' Roll EP". They then began touring promotionally. In 2004, Kris Pfeil, Tim Wilson, and Josh McNeal all left After The Order, and it seemed like the band was about over. But Shane Moore, who had drummed for Standing Stones, started drumming once again with After The Order. Soon afterwards, bass player Tim Stratton joined the group, along with guitarist Amos Lanka. In 2005, After The Order released their fourth CD, "She Overturned A Stone". In summer of 2006, After The Order disbanded. However, former vocalist Luke Mills started a new band called "Pilot For Kite". All of After The Order's former band members are involved in musical projects as well. After The Order's 2 most recent CDs, "Stop, Rock, N' Roll EP" and "She Overturned A Stone" can both be purchased at itunes.com and their first 2 CDs, "Tear Stained World" and "Broken Sky" can be purchased at www.aftertheorder.com. After The Order's websites are www.aftertheorder.com, www.myspace.com/aftertheorder, or www.purevolume.com/aftertheorder.</p>

<p>72.1.182.173 00:50, 12 October 2006 (UTC) "DMARC" is industry slang for the point on the phone box/closet which the technician punches down the line in question.</p>
<p>For the purposes of DSL and T1 services, there is typically a plastic, rectangular box in the phone closet. On each of these boxes, the wires run from the lines which are fed into the building, and wrap around pegs which run in two to three columns, vertically up the box.</p>
<p>The point where the wire from the outside line connects to the inside wire is called the "demarcation point," or DMARC for short.</p>

<p><i><b>Maureen McGovern</b></i> was <a href="../../../m/a/u/Maureen_McGovern_8e1b.html" title="Maureen McGovern">Maureen McGovern</a>'s fourth studio album, released in 1979 (see <a href="../../../1/9/7/1979_in_music.html" title="1979 in music">1979 in music</a>).

<p>Published by Datamost Inc. in 1982 for the Apple II home computer<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup>, Aztec is an adventure game set in the ruins of an ancient Aztec temple. The goal of the game is to guide the ‘Indy Jones’ type player character down through the multiple levels of the ruins to find an idol and return to the surface with it. The player character must search through piles of rubble, bones and crates, occasionally discovering various weapons (machete, pistol, bullets and dynamite) which can be used against enemies, in order to eventually find the idol. The value of the idol is continually decreasing, so the player is rewarded for speed in completing the game. The multiple enemies include hostile natives and dangerous animals such as snakes, wildcats and at the lower levels, tentacle monsters, which can all either be avoided or killed. Some levels also include potentially fatal traps such as rooms which fill with water, ceilings which decend or bombs which explode.</p>
<p>The game was notalble at its time for the wide range of movements and actions that could be achieved with the player character, such a weilding of weapons, attacks, running jumping, ascending and descending stairs, placing dynamite etc.</p>
<p>The game was also notable for the various gliches that would allow a player to occasionally walk through walls, fall through levels, and walk on water to escape traps.</p>

<p>Elise Biorn-Hansen was born in 1920 in Oslo, Norway but moved to the United States while still an infant. She and her family were greatly affected by the outbreak of World War II (WWII) and the German invasion of Norway. Elise became strongly convicted by living through the WWII years that violence was not the answer to the world’s problems and that if even her peaceful homeland was at risk, violence was truly a systemic world concern. In her youth, she became active in anti-war activities and converted to a historic peace church, the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). It was at a Quaker meeting that she met her future husband, Kenneth Boulding (1910-1993), a highly respected English economist who would collaborate extensively with Elise on her peace work.</p>
<p>The Bouldings raised 5 children, with Elise serving as both homemaker and activist. Her writing on the foundations of peace would reflect her valuation of women, children and family in the peace process. She believed the family unit, and especially the role of women within that unit, was crucial to the global peace movement. After working at Iowa State College (where she received her Masters degree in Sociology) and at the University of Colorado at Boulder, she and Kenneth were invited to become Scholars in Residence at Dartmouth College. While at Dartmouth, she chaired the Sociology Department and developed the nation’s first Peace Studies program there. She is credited with greatly advancing the academic study of peace through her work at Dartmouth.</p>
<p>Boulding has held many leadership positions in peace and social justice related groups throughout her life, from chairing the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) to creating the International Peace Research Association (IPRA) to work with the United Nations through UNESCO and the University of the United Nations. She has authored more than 14 books and received many lifetime achievement awards for her dedication to peace, including a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990. She is now retired and lives in Needham, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Boulding’s Quaker faith played a vital role in her focus and development as a sociologist and peace activist. She found the Religious Society of Friends in young adulthood, but did not have a particularly religious upbringing. Though there was a church near her childhood home that had services in Norwegian (her family had emigrated from Norway), her family did not attend. Her father would read the story of Jesus from the Bible on Christmas Eve, and she still knows the Lord’s Prayer in Norwegian. Despite the lack of structured religion in her youth, she claims she felt the presence of God as a young child, and when she was 9 years old she began attending a local Protestant church on her own. She developed a relationship with the minister’s wife, who served as a spiritual mentor of sorts for the young Elise. In her teens, however, she recalls a longing to know “god” (she often used a lowercase g in referring to God in her personal writings) but felt that “no religion can quite fulfill [her] needs, so [she] will make [her] own religion.” She also was strongly influenced by her mother, who in Norway had been involved in peace parades and was a social worker for girls who worked in Norwegian factories. Elise shared her mother’s nostalgia for Norway, and always thought of her homeland as a “safe place” until her last year of college when the Nazis invaded it. It was then that she embraced pacifism, and began attending Quaker meetings that she had been introduced to by college friends. She decided that if “safe places” were to exist in the world, she would have to work for them, and this was her calling as a Friend.</p>
<p>Soon after becoming a Quaker, Elise met her husband Kenneth, who was also a Friend. He was an accomplished academic economist, international peace researcher, and poet when the couple met, and Elise names him as her strongest influence throughout her life. Together they moved to different universities and colleges where Kenneth taught and began a family. All the while, Elise was involved in different peace organizations, such as the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, and also introduced peace studies to public schools. Out of these experiences, Elise focused on the networking of international religious and/or peace organizations and education. She wrote several pamphlets on the Quaker educational philosophy. The Religious Society of Friends does not separate the spiritual and secular worlds, and see God as being present in all people.</p>
<p>Elise viewed listening as the key to advancing world peace and nonviolence. She published numerous works and gave frequent talks on this and related subjects. It is what she strove for in the many Friends’ organizations and newsletters she contributed to or developed, among them the American Friends Service Committee and the Committee on Friends Responsibilities in Higher Education and Research.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-13_5287.html" title="Edit section: The Theory of Peace as an Everyday Process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Theory of Peace as an Everyday Process</span></h3>
<p>A major theoretical focus for Boulding was the idea of peace as a daily process. She challenged the idea of peace as a dull, static process and advocated for a concept she termed “peaceableness.” Her work emphasized “personal and interpersonal promotion of peace.” This peace theory involved shaping and reshaping understandings and behaviors to adapt to a constantly changing world and sustain well-being for all.</p>
<p>Boulding felt in order to accomplish peace, one must review the history of conflicts. No two human beings are the same and as a result conflict becomes an integral part of any social order. Struggles and conflicts over politics and religion have always been a part of society but the world’s expanding interdependence makes it necessary to promote openness and flexibility for the sake of coexistence. Peace culture welcomes differences, recognizing them as potential sources of conflict, but also as a starting point for progress. By reviewing the history of conflict, Boulding noticed that two groups in society were underrepresented who could address this new perspective on peace, especially beginning on the micro level of the family unit.</p>
<p>Women and children are vital and underappreciated players in the peace process. Boulding felt children “gentle” the human species. By this, she meant that adults respond to children generally with affection and compassion. She argued that it is crucial to long-term societal changes that children be involved. She felt that from the youngest of ages children should be socialized to approach conflicts and problems critically and non-confrontationally. Women, being mothers, have a great influence in setting the foundation for this peace culture by teaching their children.</p>
<p>“…We’re never going to have respectful and reverential relationships with the planet- and sensible policies about what we put in the air, the soil, the water – if very young children don’t begin learning about these things literally in their houses, backyards, streets and schools. We need to have human beings who are oriented that way from their earliest memories.” (1992)</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-13_5287.html" title="Edit section: The Underside of History: Women’s role in history and the Peace Process">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Underside of History: Women’s role in history and the Peace Process</span></h3>
<p>Boulding’s book The Underside of History: A View of Women through Time, first published in 1976, is an exploration of the changing roles of women throughout history, from Paleolithic times to present. She attempts to understand what she describes as women’s “underlife” and men’s’ “overlife” in social roles. Boulding says that modern women’s roles are similar to that of inmates: the household imprisons them and expects them to be “on call” at all times to provide for their husbands and children. Women are, in a sense, stripped of their identity, autonomy and privacy and considered “under” their family and husbands. However, this needs not always be the case, Boulding asserts.</p>
<p>In hunting/gathering communities the female-male relationships were egalitarian. Men’s work was dedicated to hunting, providing about 20% of the food. Women, on the other hand, provided the other 80% of the food through gathering and capturing small game near their campsites. They did this while also being what Boulding calls the ‘breeder-feeders,’ producing and feeing the family. In those communities, women filled the triple role of ‘breeder-feeder-producers.’</p>
<p>As communities moved from hunting/gathering to agricultural communities, women’s and men’s roles further differentiated. Women stayed close to where the crops were planted while men continued to hunt. Men were now away hunting for days while women stayed in the same spot. The men’s mobility allowed them to acquire a body of knowledge about far off places and people that the women lacked. Men also started trading with other communities. As the communities turned to trading, towns women’s work was devalued as men were able to supply their produce to other villages and gain otherwise unavailable goods in return. Trade became economic premium.</p>
<p>Trading led to urbanization. Men moved to jobs in cities, while women stayed at home with the family. This created a differentiation between women’s and men’s spaces: Women’s space was private (dedans), men’s was public (dehors). When women eventually entered the wage market, they did so with unequal wages because their role in society had been devalued on the family level to the private sphere.</p>
<p>Historically there were alternatives to the familial roles for women. These were celibacy (monasticism), beguinage (female urban secular communes), hermitesses (isolated single women as sages/healers) and vagabonds. However, during the 1500s and 1600s these roles disappeared because they were often seen as threats to a male dominated society (as in the case of hermitesses who were murdered when accused of witchcraft).</p>
<p>The Renaissance and Enlightenment furthered male domination through discoveries about the nature of man and men’s organizations, creating individualism and less concentration of the family.</p>
<p>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries women worked to gain power and move from the dedans to the dehors. Women started to recognize the fictions of male guardianship and many rebelled. Boulding considers the foundation for peace to be empowering women to deconstruct a history of patriarchy and devaluation and reconstruct truly equality, appreciating certain differences, between the sexes.</p>

<p>Boulding claimed that families are the “practice ground for making history.” Boulding emphasizes family as the environment that grounds individuals for all their future endeavors. As a family sociologist, Boulding believed in the inherent worth of every child. This belief stems from her devotion to Quakerism. (See below) From her own experience as a mother, as well as the knowledge she acquired through research, Boulding developed an ideology that places importance on the influence children have on the greater society. She believed that children would be co-creators of a reformed visionary future if adults would accept their influence. Boulding believed that within the dynamics of a family parents must take their children seriously, listen and converse whole-heartedly, and finally fully accept their ability to influence parents own social imagination</p>
<p>Boulding has a collection of writings, but none represent her views on the importance of family quite as well as One Small Plot of Heaven: Reflections on Family Life by a Quaker Sociologist. This writing of hers represents in a most complete sense, her thoughts on families, parenting and the important relationship that exists between the family, God and the individual’s Quaker worship. She also emphasizes the importance of the “personhood of children”, the acknowledgment of time in solitude, and the need for interactions across age gaps</p>
<p>Boulding suggests that networking and partnerships built between men, women and children are what will cultivate the peace culture. “ We must look towards societies that set a high value on nonaggression and noncompetitive ness, and therefore handle conflicts by nonviolent means. We can see how child rearing patterns produce nurturing adult behaviors.”</p>

<p>Boulding offers Building a Global Civic Culture: Education for an Interdependent as a holistic first step towards solving international conflicts. She envisions a “global civic culture” as not simply made of nation states but as a global community of human beings. The book enforces the idea of thinking globally on a microcosmic level to facilitate solving problems in a peaceful international order. Boulding believed that a civic world order could become a reality, while acknowledging the strife that exists now. “Building a Global Civic Culture” is geared toward addressing the world’s problems and offering ideas for solutions.</p>
<p>To create peace, Boulding believes that we must all become teachers and develop new learning communities. Everyone, old and young, will teach. Age groups will teach each other from their respective generations. How we perceive events unique to our generation shapes the lens through which we each see later events. We need to know what the world looks like to young and old alike. Boulding believes all will be teachers.</p>
<p>In order to do this, we must learn to think outside of the box. Humans are intuitive, creative animals with cognitive-analytic reasoning abilities. We as human animals can grasp complex wholes from partial sets of facts. Boulding states that for most of us, education has been tied to the maxim “stick to the facts, no need for imaginative thinking.” We are taught in school that imagination and intuition are virtues of the daydreamer, not the true student. To the contrary, Boulding states we need to harness both intuition and imagination to solve world crises. Ultimately this book encourages us to become both teachers and problem solvers and includes exercises to lead the way.</p>

<p>BACKGROUNDER ON THE VIRGINIA STATUTE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM</p>
<p>In Virginia, the American Revolution led to the disestablishment of the Anglican Church, which had been tied closely to the royal government. Then the question arose as to whether the new state should continue to impose taxes to be used for the support of all recognized churches. The proposal had a number of supporters who, even if they no longer accepted an established church, still believed that religion should be supported by the public purse.</p>
<p>For some Virginians, however, imposing religion on people smacked of tyranny. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, both of whom would later be president of the United States, argued that religious beliefs should be solely matters of individual conscience and completely immune from any interference by the state. Moreover, religious activity of any sort should be wholly voluntary. Not only did they oppose taxing people to support an established church, but they also objected to forcing people to pay taxes even for their own church. To Jefferson, a high wall of separation should always keep church and state apart.</p>
<p>Jefferson drafted the following measure, but it was Madison who skillfully secured its adoption by the Virginia legislature in 1786. It is still part of modern Virginia's constitution, and it has not only been copied by other states but was also the basis for the Religion Clauses in the Constitution's Bill of Rights. Both men considered this bill one of the great achievements of their lives, and Jefferson directed that on his tombstone he should not be remembered as president of the United States or for any of the other high offices he held, but as the author of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and as the founder of the University of Virginia.</p>

<p><b>Actual Documen</b>t</p>
<p>Whereas Almighty God hath created the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burthens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either, as it was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption of legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who being themselves but fallible and uninspired men, have assumed dominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as such endeavouring to impose them on others, hath established and maintained false religions over the greatest part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his pattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness, and is withdrawing from the ministry those temporary rewards, which proceeding from an approbation of their personal conduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting labours for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions, any more than our opinions in physics or geometry; that therefore the proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right; that it tends only to corrupt the principles of that religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, those who will externally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these are criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither are those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer the civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion, and to restrain the profession or propagation of principles on supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course judge of that tendency will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts against peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when it is permitted freely to contradict them:</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly, That no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinion in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</p>
<p>And though we well know that this assembly elected by the people for the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power to restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies, constituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act to be irrevocable would be of no effect in law; yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present, or to narrow its operation, such act shall be an infringement of natural right.</p>

<p>In his brief two-year reign as a local rock superstar, Drew Willson expanded the vocabulary of the electric rock guitar more than anyone before or since. Willson was a master at coaxing all manner of unforeseen sonics from his instrument, often with innovative amplification experiments that produced astral-quality feedback and roaring distortion. His frequent hurricane blasts of noise and dazzling showmanship --he could and would often play behind his back-- has sometimes obscured his considerable gifts as a songwriter, musical mastermind, and godfather of all that is innovative rock music.</p>

<p>Aicelle's favorite colors are yellow, orange and blue. She has a very comfortable clothing style - a pair of jeans and sneakers is perfect for her. She loves to eat pasta and loves watching the movie Mulan. Another favorite of her is Ariel, the Little Mermaid. The powerful and enchanting voice of this cartoon character insired Aicelle when she was jist 7 years old.</p>
<p>Aicelle admires singers like Aretha Franklin, Lauryn Hill and Alicia Keys and Jaya. Her vocal talent had been formed under the influence of these artists which gave her an original fusion of styles of soul, pop, R&amp;B and jazz.</p>
<p>The singer got her creative drive after appearing in an ad for ice cream when she was a teenager. Aicelle started her stage life with the “Dream Sequence” group. She joined different contests and became one of the contestants of Star in a Million in ABS-CBN. She joined Pinoy Pop Superstar in GMA and lost on her first try. Singing ALL THE MAN THAT I NEED on her second try in PPS, Aicelle was declared as the winner for the week and she continued winning for eight weeks becoming the FIRST UNDEFEATED SUPERSTAR of the search. She became the 1st Runner of Pinoy Pop Superstar Year 2. Since then she was become a regular figure in different GMA Network shows especially “SOP” where she is semi-regular.</p>
<p>This talented performer from GMAAC’s pool of artist emerged victorious at the 2006 Astana Music Festival held in Astana, Kazakhstan. She won the Best Performance of Own Country Song, one of the two major awards given in the competition. She bested 14 other countries after her soulful performance of the song “Ba’t Di Subukan (If We Just Hold On)” with music by Vehnee and Doris Saturno.</p>
<p>After, the 2006 Astana Music Festival, Aicelle hopes to conquer more international singing competitions if given the chance. If ever, she would be proud to represent Philippines too in next year’s WCOPA. She wants to have a recording album and be known as a successful recording artist who has a hit song played on the radio. She further dreams of having her own concert.</p>

<p>According to primary historical sources, within the <a href="../../../o/f/l/Oflag_VII-B_f31e.html" title="Oflag VII-B">Oflag VII-B</a> at EICHSTATT in Bavaria, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belgian.html" title="Belgian">Belgian</a> officers who were <a href="../../../p/o/w/POW_17fa.html" title="POW">POW</a> were organizing theatral representations played by the POW themselves. This practice seems to be a way to kill time in this period of intense stress and isolation witnessed by prisonners in a camp in Germany during WWII. It is interesting to note that theatre plays had a large success among Belgian officers of the Oflag VII-B at EICHSTATT, and plays were performed regularly. According to historical sources from a journal written by a POW of this camp (Raymond Troye, see below), the plays were performed on a weekly basis in the church of the camp. At this occasion, the church of the Oflag VII-B was revamped into a theatre with a purposely built stage. Diverse topics were chosen by the officers themselves in charge of the <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theatre.html" title="Theatre">theatre</a>, they varied from classics to <a href="../../../v/a/u/Vaudeville.html" title="Vaudeville">Vaudeville</a>.</p>

<p>After the 90s, third-wave ska has become a joke among musicians. On the head of a new movement SOFAPUNCH is being haled as the fourth-wave of ska. Seperating itself from the traditional reggae roots, there is a more contemporary and progressive view to the music. Formed in the winter of 2005, SOFAPUNCH is now gaining notoriaty for their blend of modern rock and horns. Many people associate them with bands such as Chicago but in the same breath mention My Chemical Romance or Panic at the Disco!. Most notably is SOFAPUNCH's addition of a dance to punk and ska.</p>

<p>Jacinta Howard has always had a passion for the written word. Reared primarily in Denver, CO, she discovered the pen in the first grade, when she wrote a book about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for a class assignment. Impressed with her work, her teacher picked the book to be featured on a special segment honoring MLK Jr. that aired on the local evening news and the book was placed on display in the public library throughout Black History Month. Quiet and introspective, Howard often found solace by writing short stories as a child. In high school she joined the school yearbook and served as the copy editor for two years. Meanwhile, she also contributed rousing socio-political editorials to the campus paper. One article about local high schools’ failure to incorporate African-American history into regular courses incited a positive response from the district school board—they vowed to change the curriculum. She moved to Atlanta in 1997 to pursue a degree in Mass Media Arts from Clark Atlanta University (CAU) and served as a general assignment reporter and columnist on the campus paper, the Panther, for two years, tightening her skills as a writer and reporter and ruffling the feathers of conservative students and teachers with her controversial social and political columns. In the summer of 2000 she accepted an internship at the Asheville Citizen-Times in Asheville, NC where she quickly distinguished herself as a solid reporter and had several of her bylines picked up by the Associated Press. After graduating with honors from CAU in 2001, she took a job as a staff writer at Rolling Out a national alternative weekly paper. She soon was elevated to senior staff writer, a position that found her traveling across the country and interviewing mega stars like Quincy Jones, Angela Bassett and Queen Latifah and national and local business people in diverse industries. She also sharpened her photography skills while there, shooting numerous interview subjects for the publication. However, her passion was covering Hip Hop culture and politics and she soon began freelancing for a number of entertainment and rap publications writing cover and feature stories on everyone from Scarface and Jadakiss to Ja Rule and Common. She also began writing artist bios, press releases, and conducting photo shoots for major labels like Atlantic Records and Aftermath Records as well as independents like 8 Ways Entertainment (owned by platinum rapper, Eightball). In addition, she began editing copy for various clients, including co-editing the non-fiction book, They Killed Her by Nonnie Hawkins who was featured on Good Morning America. In 2004 she accepted a position as the news editor at Upscale magazine, a national lifestyle publication that covers everything from fine arts and travel to finance and entertainment. While there she was responsible for writing, editing and conceptualizing content as well as managing a group of contributing and freelance writers and forging and maintaining working relationships with public relations professionals throughout the country.</p>
<pre>
She left Upscale in early 2006 and continues to freelance for numerous publications including the Source, XXL, RIME, GRIP and Ozone. Currently she’s the managing editor for the informative lifestyle magazine, CONNECT Atlanta, which is published quarterly. She also provides public relations services to various clients throughout the country. Recently, she completed her first novel, which is slated for release in early 2007.

<p>Jason Smith is Creative Director and founder of Fontsmith, the London based type design foundry best known for its creation of bespoke fonts for corporate identity.</p>
<p>Jason hails from Lisburn and has created typography for clients such as Channel 4, The Post Office, ITV and Powergen.</p>
<p>Established in 1999, Fontsmith has steadily gained a reputation for producing work which Jason describes as "Very human and full of character", bringing style and personality to the business of crafting 'typographic identity'.</p>
<p>The success and enjoyment Jason derived from early clients like Allied Irish Bank and the Belgian energy giant Tractebel convinced him it was time to focus entirely on type design. Fontsmith was conceived with a modest dream of "One or two big jobs per year", but as the client list testifies "Things have snowballed since then".</p>
<p>Jason's goal has always been to create fonts for the brands that make up the vocabulary of our daily lives.</p>

<p>Frank Fenter was born on February 25, 1936 in Johannesburg, South Africa and moved to London , England in 1958, initially determined to become an actor. Fenter's acting career included securing a feature role in the BBC cult classic, "The Big Pull" and also having produced, directed and co-written the first Rock movie in South Africa, called "Africa Shakes."</p>
<p>While doing part time acting in the late 1950's early 1960's, Fenter also booked bands, including The Rolling Stones, Animals and Manfred Mann long before they had recording contracts. Fenter got his big break in the music industry in 1963 when he joined Chapell Music Publishing co., to head Liberty-Imperial Record Publishing and later ARC/Chess Music, which included songs by such artists as Chuck Berry.</p>
<p>In 1966, Frank Fenter was chosen by Atlantic Records Nesuhi Ertegun to head Atlantic Records in the United Kingdom. Within six months, he was at Atlantic's helm for all of Europe as Managing Director. During his tenure at Atlantic Records, Fenter was involved in the discovery and promotion/marketing of Yes, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin and Vinegar Joe.</p>
<p>Fenter created an explosion in Europe when he brought the "Hit the Road Stax" tour to Europe in 1967 and, with Franks direction, Stax Records, a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records, experienced a sales jump from 500,000 to 2.7 million units the year of the tour with seven of the eleven albums recorded live on the Stax tour received gold album certifications.</p>
<p>In 1969, Fenter co-founded Capricorn Records with a distribution deal from Ahmet Ertegun, Chairman of Atlantic Records. Frank Fenter became Executive Vice President and ran all departments of the label.</p>
<p>During most of the 1970s', Capricorn Records was the most successful privately held label in America, having created the genre of Southern Rock, signing such bands as The Allman Brothers, The Marshall Tucker Band, Elvin Bishop, Wet Willie, Sea Level, Dixie Dregs, Billy Thorpe, Dobie Gray and Captain Beyond.</p>
<p>Frank Fenter died on July 21, 1983, in Macon, GA, from a sudden heart attack.</p>

<p>Kiddoo works as a project manager for <a href="http://www.eahhousing.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.eahhousing.org/" rel="nofollow">EAH</a>, a nonprofit company that develops and manages affordable housing. Before taking the position with EAH, he worked for the <a href="http://www.acgov.org/cda/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.acgov.org/cda/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Alameda County Department of Housing and Community Development</a>. He has also worked as a journalist, small business manager and English teacher in the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Kiddoo received a bachelor's degree from <a href="../../../g/r/i/Grinnell_College_fcfe.html" title="Grinnell College">Grinnell College</a> in Iowa and a Masters in City and Regional Planning from the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill_49d1.html" title="University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill">University of North Carolina</a>, with a dual concentration in Housing Policy and Economic Development.</p>

<p>Kiddoo was urged to run for the Board of Supervisors by the San Francisco chapter of the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Independent_Voters_aaa7.html" title="League of Independent Voters">League of Pissed Off Voters</a>, of which he is a member. The League of Pissed Off Voters, formally known as the League of Young Voters, is a national organization focused on engaging young people in the political process.</p>
<p>Kiddoo and the League believed that they're progressive views were not being represented by the incumbent, <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michela_Alioto-Pier_0405.html" title="Michela Alioto-Pier">Michela Alioto-Pier</a>, or her one challenger on the ballot, Vilma Guito-Peoro. Because David began his campaign after the official filing deadline, he is running as a write-in candidate.</p>
<p>As a housing developer, Kiddoo believes housing affordability is the most critical issue facing San Francisco. He supports San Francisco's inclusionary housing requirements, which require developers to either offer units at below-market rates for low-income buyers. Kiddoo wants to protect rental housing in San Francisco through a combination of enforcing current tenant protections, amending the Ellis Act, and exploring reforms to rent control.</p>
<p>His other citywide priorities are addressing homelessness in San Francisco and protecting the environment by promoting alternative energy sources and reducing dependence on oil.</p>
<p>Kiddoo's top priorities for the District 2 neighborhoods are protecting local businesses, improving public transportation, and alleviating traffic.</p>

<p>Matt Marcotte is best known for creatively mocking others. Some of the terms he has created include "taker" and "f'ing taker". Marcotte is also known for being hated by many people including Tim Luczak, Maverick Puppy, and most of all Brad Gareiss. Gareiss has cited the fact that Marcotte put poop in his sink and a urine soaked pillow in his bath tub as reasons for hating him. Marcotte also has several aliases such as: "taker", "douchebag", "total douche", "worst person on earth", and "f_ _ _ing taker". If he gives Gareiss the book "The Game" back, Gareiss has said he will remain hating Marcotte, but not as much.</p>
