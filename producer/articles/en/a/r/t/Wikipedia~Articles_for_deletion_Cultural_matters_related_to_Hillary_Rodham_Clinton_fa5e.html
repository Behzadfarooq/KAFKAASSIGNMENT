<p>Reason The Sign of Four 02:43, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>This article has no place in Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Quotes about speculated cosmetic surgery and dress code belong in a gossip magazine, not an encyclopedia. A name is less popular than it was ten or twenty years ago? That is the rule, not an exception. A married woman keeps her surname? Honestly, I wonder who wrote this article.</p>
<p>Any real controversy should be posted to the main article and discussed there. It's my opinion that nothing in this article qualifies though.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment.</b> The Sign of Four,as a procedural issue, could you please set forth the specific Wikipedia policy or policies that demonstrate why you believe this article should be deleted? Thank you. <a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 02:52, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. True, these are not heavyweight controversies; those are contained in <a href="../../../h/i/l/Hillary_Rodham_Clinton_controversies_9e16.html" title="Hillary Rodham Clinton controversies">Hillary Rodham Clinton controversies</a>, which is referenced at the top of this article. But these are matters that have come up fairly often regarding HRC. The remark about cosmetic surgery came from her Republican opponent in the Senate race this year, not a gossip mag. The Tammy Wynette and baking cookies remarks were famous fiascos and got tons of media attention in 1992 and thereafter. The name changing bit is also clearly important, as it had political ramifications in Arkansas at the time and she made a big point of restoring the 'Rodham' officially in 1993. Like her or not, HRC has taken a unique path through American life and encountered or triggered various cultural rifts along the way; this article's purpose is to document those. <a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWasted_Time_R_164e.html" title="User:Wasted Time R">Wasted Time R</a> 02:54, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Maybe into a section like <b>Cultural criticism</b>. As it is this reads like a trivia section or a light magazine feature, not an encyclopedic article, and despite NPOV language and rebuttal links, comes across as treating a politician differently because she is a woman. There's no comparable section in our articles for any male politician (that I know of). I do think there's something to be said about how HRC is such a major icon in the culture war -- at least, that's where most of the criticism and dislike of her intermingle. As an article, though, this is just unfocused and poorly scoped. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:34, 11 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
