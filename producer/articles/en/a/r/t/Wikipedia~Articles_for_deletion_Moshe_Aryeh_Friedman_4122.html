Friedman has received extensive press coverage over the years from publications worldwide, especially given that newspapers lap up the antics of an "Ultra-Orthodox" Rabbi who seems to team up with the most virulent racists he can find. His participation in the recent Iranian hatefest has been <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22moishe+arye+friedman%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22moishe+arye+friedman%22&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">picked up by over 1,200 news reports</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The 'The Orthodox Anti-Zionist Society ' is an international organzition.

<dd>Indeed. However, he is right. I don't know Rabbi Friedman or any of his followers personally, but they are indeed a very small group. 50 is probably a realistic estimate.

<dd>I have had thousands of edits on wikipedia. I gave it up after the lunacy, which includes this vote for one. I actually know what I am talking about, but my vote was lost among the hundreds of idiots who couldn't tell Yiddish from Ladino, but think their opinions amount to anything. An absolute nobody becomes a somebody because Ahmadinejad found a fool who is probably mentally handicapped.

I looked to Wikipedia as always and could not find him. I was happy to see this rectified when I searched for him today! He may not be well known, but he is the first name that anyone has ever put to someone who is altogether Jewish, a holocaust denier, and a supporter of Hamas in the struggle against the state of Israel. That alone makes this rather strange dude notable. Moreover, the page is neutral in tone and factual in content -- this is not vanity. 68.218.8.145 20:43, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Some people read the news and ask "who is this guy?" so they want wikipedia to tell them. The problem is that this guy is a nobody (notability-wise) and there is no reason to have an article about him. I think <i>not</i> having an article about him tells the user all he really wants to know ("who is this guy?" - "Oh, just some nobody who doesn't even have a wikipedia article"). We don't change the notability rules just because there are a few searches about him for a few days. Part of our <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability rules</a> is to ask "will anyone care about this person in another 100 years?". I don't think anyone will care in another 100 <i>days</i>! <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 12:27, 14 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. The "100 years" test is <i>not</i> a Wikipedia rule. Some editors apply it. Others of us think it's seriously misguided. If people see a name in the news and come to Wikipedia asking "who is this guy?", that by itself is a good reason to have an article. Give the readers the information and let them reach their own judgments. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../j/a/m/User_talk%7EJamesMLane_fe1e.html" title="User talk:JamesMLane">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JamesMLane_dde2.html" title="Special:Contributions/JamesMLane">c</a></small> 16:33, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, the man is indeed crackpot lunatic, and his views about the holocaust are some of the most extreme ever held by a Jewish person, but the many media references to him (especially for the recent conference in Tehran) would render it non-NPOV if he did not have a page in Wikipedia.
