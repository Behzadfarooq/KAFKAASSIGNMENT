<li><b>delete'</b>. The information presented on the page seems to admit its own non-notability by focusing on the notable people who have been featured on the program, and not the program itself. The fact that its two main members use MySpace as a home page is also indicative of the notability problem. Most of the reading about its notable guests fail to mention their connection to the program, or do so in a very limited way. <a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConsequentially_9ed7.html" title="User:Consequentially">Consequentially</a> 03:35, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete'</b>. I have been working with this article recently, and I've been continually deleting comments that seem to be promotionals. If it is not to be deleted, (which is also completely fine) then it needs to be seriously cleaned up, allowing non-biased claims, removing self-praising claims in the article. (sorry for not having a wiki account, I haven't taken the initiative to make one). 75.18.189.236 03:58, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The atheist community is obviously going to be a smaller subset of the population that that of christianity. The Rational Response Squad is a notable entity. They play as one of the two most popular shows on the <a href="http://www.freethoughtmedia.com" class="external text" title="http://www.freethoughtmedia.com" rel="nofollow">largest free thought internet radio station</a>. If you base the minority of the population which subscribes to such a station, any atheist internet radio show would not qualify as "notable". I would say that endoresements by people like <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Carrier_fd31.html" title="Richard Carrier">Richard Carrier</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sam_Harris_%28author%29_3eaa.html" title="Sam Harris (author)">Sam Harris</a>, and <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Flemming_4943.html" title="Brian Flemming">Brian Flemming</a> would be enough to consider them notable. The Rational Response Squad carried out a "War on Easter" last year, distributing copies of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_God_Who_Wasn%27t_There_e98b.html" title="The God Who Wasn't There">The God Who Wasn't There</a>, an atheist dvd exposing reasons christ couldn't have existed, all across the nation through various members. Their genesis of this event alone qualifies them as notable, and the article is definitely encyclopedic. --Cbenard 16:32, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Various reasons to keep this include, and are not limited to, many hits on google and other sites, hundreds of thousands of listeners weekly, thousands upon thousands of myspace friends, and an intruiging yet thought provoking glimpse into Atheist America. To delete this, we must also delete Sean Hannity and his radio show, as well as Rush Limbaugh. Deleting this is like deleting the Bill of Rights.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.70.43.90 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.70.43.90_59aa.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.70.43.90">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Following what Cbenard said, the "War on Easter" was talked about on Fox News XM and Sirius Radio. "RRS" has about 20,000 friends on their myspace account, and they don't use "myspace as their homepage" as another person said. Their site is RationalResponders.com which is a thriving community. Furthermore the Alexa rankings for the site are innaccurate, as Alexa often is. The site seems to not be registering traffic since they changed their site, as you can see they used to be much much higher in Alexa rankings but for some reason in a time period when they are experiencing more traffic, Alexa says their experiencing less. On their website you can note their traffic fluctuates from 200-1000 visitiors at any given time. --Infidelaholic 16:45, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The RRS is one of my most visited pages. They make an argument that is growing exponentially across this nation and world. Its points are phenominal, and logical, and worth pondering. As an Atheist, they give me a voice towards the "Christian" world that now "Believes" it controls this country. I was not aware of Wikipedia being a practicer of Censorship!<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.78.50.10 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.78.50.10_0459.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.78.50.10">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As a Christian I feel its good to have the point of views of both sides, not matter how extreme. It makes for good discussion and debate. (why was this comment deleted and replaced with "keep?")</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>."....anyone who wants to verify our page can take a few minutes to research. Another charge is that we use myspace as a homepage, however RationalResponders.com is our website which gets 30 new members per day and represents the largest growing atheist community in the world..." I believe that right there is a good enough reason to keep. It's a rather large &amp; fast growing network and will continue to do so. They are reliable for real information &amp; radio shows, they always keep everything up to date, and they are just a great orginization overall, which makes me proud to be a member of it. Even if they do happen to get a bad rating from alexa.com or wherever else, they're relatively new, and need time to cut into a groove and learn &amp; form themselves entirely. For an orginization that's as new as they are, they're doing incredibly well &amp; better than most groups would at their stage of development. --<a href="../../../l/a/c/User%7ELacunaSerenity_9ba4.html" title="User:LacunaSerenity">LacunaSerenity</a>, member of the RationalResponders.com.

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree that the RRS needs to replace the self-promotional marketing text with a simple, factual representation of who and what they are. There're a legitimate topic for a wiki article, it just shouldn't be a mouthpiece.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems the first few delete votes were vandalized and changed by the following address: 68.232.151.145 Also Alexa doesn't work, it relies on unintelligent computer users to keep a spam toolbar on the browser. RRS asks people to switch to firefox, and many users with firefox don't have the bar. --Infidelaholic 17:21, 15 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> There is nothing self-promotional about this article. I DARE any of you to find something that is. You can't. It is purely factual. The "HamuROOKis" list is defined and explained. All data is clearly and obviously verifiable, their website is right there, and anyone who took half a second to look would realise that. It would seem this entire "argument" is forged purely on bigotry. And you're right, this shouldn't be a vote. Just because most people are bigots, doesn't mean this find article should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> -Deletion for notability reasons doesn't pertain to this article. The group that the article describes is cross-referenced in a multitude of places on the internet. Searching for the term, "rational response" (sans quotes) on Google gives 18M+ results, and at the top of that list is the "Rational Response Squad." That said, I am not too humble to admit that there seems to be a neutrality issue with the article. However, deletion of the article based on that is silly. The article needs to be revised, not deleted. ---Dumpy Dooby 19:00, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This organization exists, is notable, is active and has an effect on society and culture. There is information to be retained and catalogued about such an organization. I have been under the impression that Wikipedia exists to catalogue, in an encylopedic fashion, the entirety of human knowledge and experience. I see NO reason to delete this entry simply because a few seem to think that it is unnecessary.
