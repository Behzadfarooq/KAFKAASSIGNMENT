<li>Corey Lidle is not nearly as notable as JFK. Regardless, the Texas Book Depository didn't automatically become notable after JFK was shot there. It did indeed become notable because of that incident, but in a couple months, I doubt anybody will remember "Hey, there was a plane crash at 524 East 72nd street!". They'll just remember that there was a plane crash.

<dd>(edit conflict) Actually, all U.S. towns and census-designated places (however small) have articles, and high schools are generally deemed notable. There would be articles on both Shanksville and Columbine anyway. As for this building, I would have voted keep if it was listed in my AIA Guide (which includes 5000+ NYC buildings, including many in the immediate neighborhood of this apt building). I was looking to it as a source, but found nothing on this building to be able to expand the article. I also looked through the NY Times archives (pre-today) and found next to nothing (only real estate sales and such). --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 02:57, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
