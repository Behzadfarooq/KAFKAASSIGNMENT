<p><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT Section 1.7.2</a>: <i>No lists or repositories of loosely associated topics</i>, part of "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information" excludes this list. It even says that the people listed have no meaningful association with each other, as it expressly states that eccentricity is defined <i>relative to a person's social environment</i> and as such they're all being judged eccentric by different standards - which means they really have nothing in common. Added to which it arguably meets the "idiosyncratic non-topic" criterion in the deletion policy and, I believe, has no encyclopedic value, and I think it's clear that this entry should be deleted. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 02:36, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the article's third VfD/AfD; the first was in June 2003, and the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_notable_eccentrics_ba07.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of notable eccentrics">second</a> was in December 2004. (Back then, it was called "List of notable eccentrics".) What I said in the second deletion debate still applies: even though there isn't an absolutely precise definition of "eccentricity" that satisfies everyone, that doesn't mean we can't write an accurate, NPOV article about historical figures who have often been perceived as "eccentric". Yes, eccentricity is a vague concept that's open to wide interpretation, but so are <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a>. Should we delete those articles? In response to the assertion that this article violates <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it does only if we adhere to the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:Instruction_creep">absolute letter of the law</a>. An example of a "list or repository of loosely associated topics" would be, say, "List of interesting facts". <font color="green"><a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a> ]</font> 03:52, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The comparison to <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a> and <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a> is a false one, I think. If this were the article <a href="../../../e/c/c/Eccentricity_%28behavior%29.html" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">eccentricity (behavior)</a> I'd agree with you, but it's not: it's a list of people. And without a precise definition of what links those people, the list is what I call pointless. No, we shouldn't delete <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terrorism.html" title="Terrorism">terrorism</a>, but we should delete List of people accused of performing terrorism, and we shouldn't delete <a href="../../../l/o/v/Love.html" title="Love">love</a> but we should delete List of people who love. It's not about whether or not we <i>can</i> write the article, it's about whether or not we should even try, and in this case, I think we shouldn't. And I don't think it's instruction creep or a matter of adhering just to the letter of the policy, either. I think the spirit of that section of WP:NOT is that lists should not be made <i>unless there is a compelling reason to make it</i> (something stricter than the actual wording), and I don't see a compelling reason to have this list. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 04:08, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I never saw this article before but I think it is very interesting. The list is organized by subgroups and tells you a little about who each person is. The category would not be very good at the former (you would have to create–and then individually open–sub-catergories rather than see the people on one page) and does not allow the latter at all. -- <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 04:41, August 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No universal standard for eccentricity. --80.222.74.5 06:43, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I suggest that this article meets the criterion for keeping an article listed in the VfD guidelines: "The ideas have become newsworthy: they have been repeatedly and independently reported in newspapers or news stories". My reading is that this article only needs to meet one criterion for being kept to qualify as encyclopaedic. Maybe what we need is a concerted effort to cite some references to validate the assertion made by including someone on this list, not deletion? <a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfilms_5e8c.html" title="User:Infilms">Hugh Mason</a> 07:18, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Actually, it meets several. Aside from the sections of WP policy that the nominator mentioned, this article also flies in the face of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. While that isn't technically a criterion for deletion, the fact that the entire article hinges on the author's POV makes it so. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 19:11, 29 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> but have the author save it their own space if they like. Two reasons: First: I believe Faber and Penguin have published books on eccentrics, but that does not make it a viable encyclopedia topic. Second: We are all by definition a little off centre - whose <i>exactly</i> centered (well maybe the <a href="../../../d/a/l/Dalai_Lama_3904.html" title="Dalai Lama">Delhi Llama</a>)? I surely want my name on that list there.

<li><b>Delete</b>, non-encyclopedic owing to vagueness, and almost completely unreferenceable. Any available reference would simply the POV of whoever wrote the reference — unless someone can conjure psychologists who have diagnosed people with "eccentricity".

<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting and useful article, which clearly has some value. When I first came across it, I spent an hour reading about the different people on it. It's doing more good than harm to the Wikipedia. Some of the people who are voting delete make it sound like the term eccentric is so vague that nobody even knows what the term possibly means. This is clearly absurd. Eccentricity may not have a cut-n-dry definition but neither do many mental disorders. It's very possible to compile a decent list of eccentric people just as it is with people who have, say, Aspergers. <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Quinn_435d.html" title="User:Jason Quinn">Jason Quinn</a> 00:51, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> POV. A lot of work has gone into this and I agree it isn't an attack page.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Arguments such as "eccentricity is not measurable" or "unreferenceable" hold no weight here. The criteria for inclusion isn't whether or not the person actually <i>is</i> eccentric; it's only whether they are frequently <i>referred to</i> as eccentric. It's very easy to find references to "eccentric" people in the mass media and in history books. Anyway, I think this article is useful; I enjoyed browsing through the list of names and clicking on unfamiliar ones to see what sort of odd behaviour they're known for. —<a href="../../../p/s/y/User%7EPsychonaut_e6a0.html" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> 18:15, 30 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
