<p>non-notable defunct band that does not meet the criteria of <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>. The article is replete with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverified</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">unsourced</a> statements (including self-acknowledged "rumours" as sources). I had removed all unverified/unsourced statements, but another editor not only replaced that info, but also replaced all the grammatical errors. While not a reason for deletion <i>per se</i>, additional problems with the article is that it uses a large amount of non-roman characters and includes a <a href="../../../a/v/o/Wikipedia%7EAvoid_trivia_sections_in_articles_c909.html" title="Wikipedia:Avoid trivia sections in articles">non-encyclopedic trivia section</a>. There are also problems trying to verify any information on this band, as there are other bands around the world using the same name. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 18:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>strong keep</b> Non-roman characters are there to assist in verifying the information. The band is notable as per <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, because only real requirement there is that band has released two albums. Papaya has released two albums and one of their songs was remade in Chinese by notable singer (Cyndi Wang). What comes to trivia section, it is there because separate sections with just one factual statement is just no right... That's what for there is {{<a href="../../../e/x/p/Template%7EExpand_6021.html" title="Template:Expand">expand</a>}}. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>strong delete</b> - Yes, it's notable (at least according to WP guidelines), but without Papaya only got about <s>10,000</s> 600 google hits, making it difficult for this page to have reputable sources. Not to mention that there are no sources regarding the remake of the song either which was one of the reasons why Monni said the article was notable. <a href="../../../i/l/o/User%7EIloveayu_aa53.html" title="User:Iloveayu">mirageinred</a> 21:18, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not going to put any original search or YouTube links as sources, but I do think it's pretty easy to download those two songs out of eMule or some illegal download site just to verify if those two songs are identical enough. Mentioning artists and song titles was enough proof for me when one of my Korean friends did mention about resemblance of those two songs. I didn't accuse Cyndi Wang of making that "remake" illegally, because that would have been something that would require hard proof evidence. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 17:02, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, though not very strongly. It would be nice for every such article to disappear, but unfortunately that's not likely to happen; given that, we should at least avoid <a href="../../../s/y/s/Wikipedia%7ESystemic_bias_52e9.html" title="Wikipedia:Systemic bias">systematic bias</a>. Note that both Naver and Yahoo Korea have categories for the group and its members, as does something called "<a href="http://www.zaao.com/search/cat_site_page.php3?order=c&amp;code=007002001001001096" class="external text" title="http://www.zaao.com/search/cat_site_page.php3?order=c&amp;code=007002001001001096" rel="nofollow">Zaao</a>". Given all this, it should not be terribly difficult to locate somewhat <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> about the group and its members. For instance, here's a (Korean) article from 2005 in the Dong-A Weekly: <a href="http://www.dongailbo.co.kr/docs/magazine/weekly/2005/02/04/200502040500038/200502040500038_1.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dongailbo.co.kr/docs/magazine/weekly/2005/02/04/200502040500038/200502040500038_1.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> And I'm not familiar enough with them to evaluate their reliability or significance, but the first page of a Google search also turns up profile pages from <a href="http://epg.epg.co.kr/star/profile/index.asp?actor_id=4756&amp;menu_num=1" class="external text" title="http://epg.epg.co.kr/star/profile/index.asp?actor_id=4756&amp;menu_num=1" rel="nofollow">EPG</a> and <a href="http://www.musicon.co.kr/music_info/artist_info.asp?artistcode=1868" class="external text" title="http://www.musicon.co.kr/music_info/artist_info.asp?artistcode=1868" rel="nofollow">MusicON</a>. OK, I have now exhausted the time I willing to spend on articles of this nature for at least the next month. Blech, pop music. &gt;:-&lt; If only we could delete <i>all</i> of it... &#160;:-) -- <a href="../../../v/i/s/User%7EVisviva_a3c2.html" title="User:Visviva">Visviva</a> 01:14, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom and it does not meet <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> because it's not JUST "2 albums", but 2 albums on a major or "more important" indie label. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 03:25, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> In Korea there is only one major label, SM Entertainment. The rest are small labels. I don't think Trifecta/iStar group is too small, because it is not only for singers and groups but for actors and models too. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 04:55, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> We shouldn't have to lower the threshold for notability just because "there is only one major label" in Korea. If that were a good reason, then should we allow articles on ANY group from countries with no major label. (BTW, I just found <a href="../../../j/y/p/JYP_Entertainment_7a22.html" title="JYP Entertainment">JYP Entertainment</a> and <a href="../../../p/f/u/PFull_Entertainment_3b5e.html" title="PFull Entertainment">PFull Entertainment</a>. Are these not major labels in Korea?) - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 20:58, 27 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I think we should allow all bands in any country as long as they have released atleast two albums, it should not matter if the albums are from major label or just digital downloads. What I have understand from Korean music industry, is that SM Entertainment has monopoly in controlling it. Only way artists can deal with is to either join some label that SM Entertainment supports, or go to Japan or USA and sign with one of their labels. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 04:17, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Are you kidding? Do you realize how many absolutely inconsequential and non-notable bands that would qualify? And, sure, the plight of non-SM Entertainment artists in Korea might be lamentable, but I fail to see how that makes this group notable. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 15:48, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> No I'm not kidding... If you read carefully the wording in the reasons for deleting or keeping non-notable articles, it clearly says notability alone is not reason to delete any article. I agree that notability and verifiability together is another issue, but I also must say that article about Korean artist without English sources, but atleast one major Korean source is verifiable. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 16:57, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Actually, I don't see where it clearly says "notability alone is not reason to delete any article." (I see that notability is not a reason for a <i>speedy delete</i>, though.) In fact, when it comes to musical groups, it seems clear that notability <i>is</i> the deciding factor for keeping or deleting articles. That's why <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> exists. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 03:17, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - Excluding <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, there is only two valid criterias in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Deletion policy</a>, "<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>" and "<a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>". What isn't explicitly mentioned there should not be implicitly assumed just because some WikiProject thinks there is consensus about. For this large site there has to be over 50% of current users making up the consensus to it be the final consensus. Where this really belongs is <a href="../../../k/o/r/Portal%7EKorea_abaf.html" title="Portal:Korea">Portal:Korea</a> which maintains most of the articles about Korean artists. And I can say that I'm one of the participants there. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 04:21, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - You completely glossed over <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which states "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information," "Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed," and "Wikipedia is not a soap box." All of those policies are why there is a threshold of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> articles must meet (<a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> explains that threshold for music). It may help for you to read this <a href="../../../n/o/n/Wikipedia%7ENon-notability_3841.html" title="Wikipedia:Non-notability">failed proposal</a> which argued the same thing you are arguing. Finally, about your argument on consensus: we do not and certainly can not expect "50% of current users" to agree on deletion. That is why a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_guidelines_for_administrators_a507.html#Rough_consensus" title="Wikipedia:Deletion guidelines for administrators">rough consensus</a> is acceptable. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 15:19, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I guess I can plea on <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> on the first point. Normal users aren't supposed to memorize contents of all of the pages, just the important rules. Well... This might be totally irrelevant, but I could tell about how I discovered Papaya. Simply. BoA did sing one of their song in one competition. I think it was on some program on TBC or something. What comes to getting 50% consensus on anything, it is matter of narrowing it to specific Portal or WikiProject. Like I implied before, I think it is better to use narrowest guidelines to justify existence of some article. What works with articles about USA or Japan or any other country doesn't always apply with similar articles about Korea. Also when there is people involved who know more than average Wikipedian about this specific area (for example Korean dance music) it is easier to explain if article is better expanded or just plain trashed. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 18:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - I guess it comes down to this: I believe all articles should meet the same standards regardless of where the subject is from. It seems to me you disagree with that, at least when it comes to Korean music articles. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 19:28, 29 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I guess it comes down to this too: People think differently, people are individuals, people don't agree on every thing. Like I said, I do agree that verifiability is a good thing, but I also said that all important rules should be mentioned in the main guideline/rule, not hidden across several pages. I also implied that sometimes we need to assume that using common sense is not original research and as such non-verifiable. We need to assume that contributor was in good faith when he/she did weigh if some controversial clause is fact or fiction. Also... I think strongly we need to get rid of clauses which say or imply something "alone" isn't reason to delete <u>and</u> isn't reason to keep things; clauses that contradict itselves. Wikipedia isn't a book of laws, it is community driven encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:52, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Wikipedia is certainly not a book of laws, but the "community" does have a "book of policies" to determine what is notable enough to be included. I agree with some of the things you are saying but like it or not, the policies exist and this discussion should stick to the topic of whether or not this band meets those guidelines and not argue the merits of the policies themselves. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 19:32, 2 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> - Well.... I still believe the article should be kept, if just for being borderline case, as there has been previous vote already about keeping article that is close to be notable (refering to recent vote on <a href="../../../m/o/u/Moulann.html" title="Moulann">Moulann</a> article, which I did participate in too. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 19:58, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>comment</b> - Your argument that "We kept X so we should keep Y" is misleading. First, the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Moulann_13d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Moulann">afd for Moulann</a> resulted in a "no consensus" which maintained the status quo (also meaning that it can very easily be nominated for another afd). That is not "a vote for keeping" the article. Second, the only thing, germane to this discussion, that those two have in common is that neither meets <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>, which is obviously not a good reason to keep the article. - <a href="../../../e/k/t/User%7EEktar_4af5.html" title="User:Ektar">Ektar</a> 14:46, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Well... Duh... "No consensus" is a consensus too. It does say that we really don't care about <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> and their so-called policies. I'm not saying that it is totally useless WP, but some of their work clearly is against one or two ground rules of Wikipedia. They sure do piss off some of the users and that is something we should try to avoid. Well... I guess I should just turn this vote to "no consensus" too so we have two cases when someone tries to use <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> as excuse to delete something. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonni1995_fca8.html" title="User:Monni1995">Monni</a> 15:49, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
