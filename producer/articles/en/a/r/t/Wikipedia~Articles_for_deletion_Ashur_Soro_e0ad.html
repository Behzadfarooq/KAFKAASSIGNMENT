<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, I think this is his reason (from Ashur Soro, a clearly notable guy):</li>
</ul>
<p>Ashur Soro</p>
<p>Not factual... Only One Source which is only meant to discredit him.... Mar Bawai Soro is currently accepted by the Ancient Church of the East and Chaldean Church- both Recognize him as a Bishop. Court documents show he was cleared of any wrong doing and charges were deemed "baseless." This is an encylcopedia not a rumor mill. Nothing about history of Mar Bawai.. How about include his many accomplishments. Again truly sad you guys have so much time on your hands to do this. Check Shrara.com or Mar Bawai.com to actually SEE the truth.</p>

<li><b>DELETE</b>, this is not a man that should be known by the world. This and all the other pages which redirect("Mar Bawai", "Mar bawai", "Mar Bawai Soro" should be deleted. He is ONLY recognized as a bishop by the Ancient Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church for the destruction of the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Apostolic_Catholic_Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_e5c2.html" title="Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East">Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East</a>. Shrara.com and Mar Bawai.com are both sites that are run by uneducated people. The people who have created those sites are nothing but Ashur Soro's family/tribal members.--<a href="../../../a/2/r/User%7EA2raya07_1468.html" title="User:A2raya07">A2raya07</a> 16:20, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>What are you talking about???? Tribal members??? Of what tribe? Mar Bawai is of mixed descent, but nice try. Shows how "educated" you are about the situation. Why don't take a look at his accomplishments before you let emotions get in the way of your "tribe." Mr Nochiyaya!!!! The truth is Mar Bawai's supporters are not tribal but for unity; specification, he has great support from many of the "tribes" or villages, especially the largest tribe of the Tyaraye. It seems only one "tribe" is only against him -- Nochiyaya &lt; Kurdish word for between mountains. To tell you the truth this seems very childish to me that someone would come up with these ideas that he "destroyed" the ACOE (Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East). The main reason why there is so much hostility around this area is, the man is preaching unity between all the Churches, but people are against this for stubborn reasons - tribal loyalties. I would also like to point out that the ACOE has been covered with corruption little bit before and after the death of the beloved Patriarch Mar Esho Shimoon, he to preached unity.</i>
<ul>
<li>An Englishman visiting the region of Shamezdin in the late 1800's noted that <b>"<i>There is perhaps no Assyrian district where simple piety and loyal devotion to the church of their fathers is more beautifully seen than <a href="../../../n/o/c/Nochiya.html" title="Nochiya">Nochiya</a></i>"</b>. As for the Tyarayeh, 98% of are part of the Ancient Church of the East which has nothing to do with the <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Apostolic_Catholic_Assyrian_Church_of_the_East_e5c2.html" title="Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East">Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East</a> (the <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_Church_of_Assyria_5a5c.html" title="Mother Church of Assyria">Mother Church of Assyria</a> and the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martyr_Church_of_Christianity_a01e.html" title="Martyr Church of Christianity">Martyr Church of Christianity</a>). --<a href="../../../a/2/r/User%7EA2raya07_1468.html" title="User:A2raya07">A2raya07</a> 01:30, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our people are currently dieing in Iraq and some just feel it is funny to make up stories about a Bishop who simply preaches unity for our people and our ancient churches. I say delete this and leave up his accomplishments if anything. A man who stands up for unification deserves a little bit of respect. the claims about all these funds has been cleared up and the case has been dropped. These were used as a way to confuse people about the situation. <a href="http://marbawai.com/docs/CourtOrderFebruary23_2006.pdf" class="external free" title="http://marbawai.com/docs/CourtOrderFebruary23_2006.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://marbawai.com/docs/CourtOrderFebruary23_2006.pdf</a> &lt;THIS LINK WORKS!!!&gt; <a href="http://www.MarBawai.com" class="external free" title="http://www.MarBawai.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.MarBawai.com</a></p>

<p><b>can i ask to ban A2raya07 from editing this page.... Keeps sabotaging my links. Ex... changing the i and the a in Mar Bawai to hide the fact that the charges against him are baseless.

<li>Why is that, is it because I always correct your mistakes??? --<a href="../../../a/2/r/User%7EA2raya07_1468.html" title="User:A2raya07">A2raya07</a> 20:13, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>&#160;????? okay can we make Sense now...</li>
</ul>
<p><i>????? okay can we make Sense now...</i> 'Omg an Englishman said that.. Why don't you ask your parents about Simku and the English’s involvement; if you don't know that part of history you shouldn't be editing anything Assyrian. Englishman said that and it’s supposed to mean something????? Are you sane: English, Assyrians, Arabs, etc say a lot of things. Who is this English man??? What is his expertise?? Any documents to show that this guy said this, or did you get this from story time. Currently Nochiyaye, in chicago, are dividers and only for themselves, extremely tribal as seen in A2raya07 post (though in Iraq there is no issue of tribalism only with the ACOE ,run by A Nochiyaya). That’s all you are A2raya a tribal fanatic and care nothing about the Assyrian cause. Its always your tribe first am I not correct. .. By the way this is an encyclopedia so don't throw percentages around, "98 percent of tyaraye." LOL.... 98% Do you know anyone outside of your tribe??? Where did you get this percentage from?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>DELETE</b>Mar Bawai is a Bishop. This libel and slander against him, especially since the courts have deemed the financial accusations as baseless. A2raya07, Edwin, needs to understand the consequences of being too involved in his Kurdish named tribe, and stop harrasing men of God. Please delete this, as no good is coming out of it. --Shrara4All
<ul>
<li>The courts haven't deemed anything yet. The case hasn't even begone. Why dont you reveal your real name Shrara4All, or should I say Joseph Danavi, are you scared that the Secret Kurdish Agents might get you??? In what church is Ashur a bishop in? He is not a Bishop in the <a href="../../../c/h/u/Church_of_the_East_bbc4.html" title="Church of the East">Church of the East</a> and he most likely wont be in anyother church. --</li>

<li><b>DELETE</b> Yeah okay time to go to sleep edwin. "He is ONLY recognized as a bishop by the Ancient Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church" Who said this Edwin... Ohh it was you.. COE and Chaldean Church excepts him. Keep saying they don't then they do.You can barely understand whats going on in our church and you post this bs. Why don't you get another source beside your kurdish tribe. THIS MAN AGGREES THAT THIS ARTICLE IS TO BE DELETED. TALK IS GOING NOWHERE. I PROPOSE WE LEAVE HIS BIO UP AND IT BE LOCKED. A2raya is also bringing up peoples full names in this article.
<ul>
<li>Very mature, can you show me OFFICIAL documents state the Ancient and Chaldeans views on Ashur Soro. And, to be a bishop don't you need to be part of a church, can you tell me which church Ashur Soro is a bishop in??? <b>I ask the Administrators to ban User:AkaAtour, he is doing nothing but vandalizing articles and harassing members on Wikipedia.</b> --<a href="../../../a/2/r/User%7EA2raya07_1468.html" title="User:A2raya07">A2raya07</a> 20:10, 4 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to play this game i'll make sure all your "articles" are deleted AFD, they lack any OFFICIAL SOURCE... you don't make sense..</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyways lets get on with deleting this article. DELETE DELETE!!! EVERYONE WANTS IT GONE!!!!</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - how can you just delete it? What is the reason? I haven't heard not one good reason? <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChaldean_d16d.html" title="User:Chaldean">Chaldean</a> 15:44, 5 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
