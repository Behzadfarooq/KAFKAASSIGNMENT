<p>Contested PROD, nominator stated "NN local politician withg copyvio issues" (bio is largely from the local paper). The copyvio issue may be fixable, assuming that other reliable sources can be found to substantiate the details of the mayor of a small town, but per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it is highly unlikely that being mayor of <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a> is a significant national office which in and of itself confers encyclopaedic notability. For comparison, this town is rather smaller than <a href="../../../r/e/a/Reading%2C_Berkshire_0865.html" title="Reading, Berkshire">Reading, Berkshire</a> (where I live). I know one of Reading's former mayors, he is a schoolteacher at my son's primary school. The two roles are of roughly equivalent importance, in my view. The world has many tens of thousands of mayors, most of them worthy and sincere individuals, but only one of them is <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clint_Eastwood_469b.html" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>, and it's not this one. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:49, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have a few points I want to get out:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've been reading through <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a>, and the <i>Sources</i> section specifically says that local newspapers are an acceptable source of information. I was also very careful to attribute the article, as I did not want to make it seem as if it was plagiarization - I wanted it to be clear that there was a source, and that source was attributed</li>
<li>After reading the <i>Information to be included</i> section, I see that I haven't really put much of value into this article from a historical perspective - I will fix this up, however I believe that 5 days is too short a time. Can I request that a deletion decision be deferred until 1 month from now, Sept. 30th 2006? By then, if the article hasn't been updated or reached an acceptable level of content, I will tacitly agree to it's deletion</li>
<li>I would propse that, if this article is pegged as being worthy of deletion, that a thorough cleanup be done on the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_municipal_elections%2C_2003.html" title="Ontario municipal elections, 2003">Ontario municipal elections, 2003</a> page as there are numerous articles that I have seen there which contain less information than this one (see <a href="../../../w/a/y/Wayne_Thomson_0ed8.html" title="Wayne Thomson">Wayne Thomson</a>, <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karen_Farbridge_b510.html" title="Karen Farbridge">Karen Farbridge</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_MacIsaac_4e92.html" title="Rob MacIsaac">Rob MacIsaac</a>, <a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Peterson_1d2e.html" title="Lynn Peterson">Lynn Peterson</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStraxus_2a2e.html" title="User talk:Straxus">User Talk:Straxus</a> 13:15, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Wayne Thomson = former incumbent mayor. Karen Farbridge = former incumbent mayor. Rob MacIsaac = current incumbent mayor. Lynn Peterson = current incumbent mayor. This line of argument holds no water whatsoever. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/y/n/Lynn_Peterson_1d2e.html" title="Lynn Peterson">Lynn Peterson</a> was the mayor of Thunder Bay - even though her article is a stub, it's still a valid encyclopaedic topic. <i>Stub</i> is not a criterion for deletion. Checking the rest, they are either mayors of former mayors of reasonably important cities - not <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Bridge%2C_Ontario_b29d.html" title="Iron Bridge, Ontario">Iron Bridge, Ontario</a>, but <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay, Ontario</a>. Encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:21, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>He was never mayor of Thunder Bay - he ran, and lost (according to the article.) I'm pretty sure every mayor of Thunder Bay is an encyclopaedic topic, but I don't think the same is true of failed candidates. <i>Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage</i> would almost certainly be true of any mayor of a large city (and Thunder Bay is the largest city within about a thousand kilometers) But he lost. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilyD_47ea.html" title="User:WilyD">WilyD</a> 13:20, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Update on the above list of candidates: Hmm, it appears I did miss the fact that they were all past mayors. However, what about <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Upson_60d4.html" title="Donna Upson">Donna Upson</a>? <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStraxus_2a2e.html" title="User talk:Straxus">User Talk:Straxus</a> 19:43, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
An interesting mix of viewpoints is being shown - on the one hand, it is stated that <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay</a> is too small a city to really merit much attention (<a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">User Talk:JzG</a> above). On the other hand, it's being claimed that the city is a big one and that as a result the mayoral article should be preserved (<a href="../../../w/i/l/User_talk%7EWilyD_17e3.html" title="User talk:WilyD">User Talk:WilyD</a> above). In a multi-contributor environment like Wikipedia, I realize that it's very difficult to apply editorial consistency, however I would refer again to the <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> page and say that I will attempt to bring this article up to that standard in one month. I'm also not trying to turn this into some sort of contest - it matters not to me who won or lost a given election, but rather that historical background on the election is present for readers to analyze. As far as my own opinion about <a href="../../../t/h/u/Thunder_Bay%2C_Ontario_b670.html" title="Thunder Bay, Ontario">Thunder Bay</a>, I lived there for 18 years and it is definitely the largest city within a long range. It's approximately 800 km to any city which is larger than it, and it serves as the nerve centre for Northwestern Ontario (of the population of 250,000 in the region, it contains about 110,000). I believe that it qualifies it as a local 'major city', and the much lower population densities in Canada mean that the major cities are significantly smaller than in the UK. <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStraxus_2a2e.html" title="User talk:Straxus">User Talk:Straxus</a> 13:34, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I've done some further research, and it turns out that mayoral candidate is not the only historically interesting information about this person. It appears that he was both Board Director and Chairman of the Thunder Bay Chamber of Commerce, and he is also currently on the Board of Directors of the Thunder Bay Airport.</p>
