See <strong class="selflink">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/What Really Happened (2nd nomination)</strong>. This is its second AFD in about a month. Debate appears to be quite vitriolic.

<p>I apologize, I was trying to mark the discussion page on the second nomination for deletion for cleanup, and not the article itself. The article needs wikification.

<p>This website is not that notable and should not be included in an encylopedia. Wikipedia is not a repository of every website on the planet.

<li>I hope you realize that you are nominating this site almost exactly one month after it was nominated for deletion on the same grounds of it allegedly being non-notable. I further hope you realize the human resources that get tied up in a process like this that could otherwise be spent in productive editing and expansion of Wikipedia. I wonder if there are any instruments implemented to annul these types of AfD nominations that in my opinion are frivolous. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 15:44, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I certainly can't speak for Aeon and I don't really accept non-notable as a reason for deletion, but looking through the first AfD I don't see how What Really Happened meets any of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. There was an attempt to justify it per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#2" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#2</a>, but those awards are very minor "site of the day" type awards. In my opinion they don't qualify per #2. There also was an attempt to justify it per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#1</a> essentially arguing that WRH met the criteria per 11 published interviews. Unfortunately, these interviews were bittorrent, Google Video, and <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Jones_9070.html" title="Alex Jones">Alex Jones</a>' prisonplanet website. None of these qualify as non-trivial. 3 more NewsMax cites were added, but none of these articles were <i>about</i> WRH, they were either mentioned in passing or linked at the end of the article. Obviously this was <i>no consensus</i> upon closing, so opinion was split, but I personally see no credible evidence or argument provided that this site meets <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:10, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><s><b>comment to above</b> I have been trying to reply for a few minutes but have been unable to due to about a half dozen edit conflicts.

<dd>I think it's in poor judgment, and, as you can read in the quote above, it actually violates the criteria for hasty renomination. Consider that last time this article was up for deletion a huge number of people spent their time (the entire debate actually made up 97kb) on it, and now you're asking all of them to repeat that exercise. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 16:48, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To be fair to <a href="../../../a/e/o/User%7EAeon1006_ee0d.html" title="User:Aeon1006">Aeon</a>, it only violates <i>your</i> reading of the criteria <a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> based on the bolded text above. It specifically states that there is <i>no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations...</i> which essentially leaves it open to interpretation by individual editors. There is no violation here, just a difference in opinion as to what constitutes an immediate renomination. As for the effort an AfD takes, the previous AfD is linked so hopefully editors participating can read through the article, the previous AfD, and arguments here before rendering a well-thought out opinion. I don't see anything wrong with a healthy debate about an article's merits, particularly when the previous AfD ended without consensus being reached.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:24, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes fair enough, And it was my interpretation on the Deletion Policy, perhaps there should be an review of the renom part of the policy to address this issue so it doesn't come up again.

<li>Considering the fact that I and many many more people visit WRH (intentionally, as opposed to redirect or Googling) - AND, after clicking on so many of the links (in the Wikipedia site) under the heading of WRH, it appears to me that WRH is actually much more "Notable" than this site with all the psuedo intellectual arguing about the nuances of the criteria for "notability" and deletion - AND, that, just like so many other things in Wikipedia (which really Could be a good idea, IF there were ANY control over the FACTUALNESS of the information - AND a restriction of the ability of axe-grinders and special interests, i.e., Zionists, as an excellent example, (and other people who have Obviously never even bothered to actually look up the dictionary or encyclopedic definition of the word "Semite" in ALL it's meanings!) to just jump in and edit and erase whatever they simply don't like. SO, it is my opinion that WRH deserves to be in this compilation of accurate - and inaccurate - information website just as much as "Wikipedia" itself does.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 4.235.6.178 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.235.6.178_04ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.235.6.178">contribs</a>) 01:42, June 30, 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>What in the world is wrong with Wikipedia? Have you folks gone mad? I suggest that perhaps it is Wikipedia that is non relevent, if you are too small for the likes of WRH.

<dd>Though I do sympathize with the frustration felt by avid readers of What Really Happened. I would like to express my take on the reason why this is happening (again) which I believe is threefold: 1) It is true that the article about What Really Happened lacks credible sources that would testify to the notability of the site to "someone who isn't acquainted with the site", i.e. most Wikipedia contributors. 2) Wikipedia's criteria for notability of a web site (which can be read at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>) may in fact be deficient and in need of revision. 3) True, What Really Happened is shunned by most mainstream outlets which leads to it not getting the publicity other sites would have received all things being equal. Apart from that, while I have your attention, I might entice you to read Wikipedia's quite good article about <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a> and urge all that come here basically to fight the nomination for deletion to become active contributors to the Wikipedia project. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 02:56, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Keep. whatreallyhappened has some original content as well as being a collection of the current batch of links pertinent to the views of the site editor. It is the "Go-To" place for updates on the unprecidented changes taking place in the American way of life that the neo-conservatives, and likely the fanatic zionists are bringing about. <i>The Dog that Did not Bark,</i> and <i>The Crime of the Century</i> are just two pieces of original content on the site. Have you read them? You'll have to read 1984 to know who Winston Smith is.--112358 02:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Keep This is a silly politically motivated call for deletion. Wikipedia has links to many similar political commentary web sites: frontpagemag.com, discoverthenetworks.org, antiwar.com. Many many such sites are documented - because they exist out there in the world and are relevant. This is part of a concerted effort by zionists and their supporters to have wikipedia reflect their POV. Its part of a project to remove not only whatreallyhappened, but also a whole list of similar anti-zionist political commentary web sites. --rafael</li>
<li>Keep Even though there was no consensus, and the last keep was a default keep, I still feel enough unique people contributed to the last discussion that we should not open this up again. 24.54.83.216 02:57, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You may choose to do as you will but the truth is zionism is losing its battle to suppress and obscure the truth. Wikipedia is the last place I would visit to obtain investagatory information on ANY subject. This site is no different than the textbooks used in American schools. Superficial, skewed and absolutely biased. Sorta like Dragnet with a twist, "History has beed altered to protect the guity", but not for much longer.

<li>Keep WhatReallyHappened in Wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex;">
<p>WhatReallyHappened is within WP:NPOV, because it is essentially a news service website which happens to include short descriptions of the meaning of the news articles linked to in the opinion of the site administrator. Like any website, there is an option for reader comments, however this option clearly isn't the primary focus of the site in form or function. The readers comments section, a tiny link on the left hand column, has no flash and little color. Obviously the administrator doesn't consider reader comments the primary focus of his site, and the reader cannot mistake the site for that purpose. WhatReallyHappened is not "blog-like" because the primary highlighted information, prominently displayed throughout the majority and in the center of home page, is composed of links chosen by the site administrator which are not found in the mainstream media, which is the stated and obvious purpose of the site: provide links to articles and information not found in the mainstream media, along with original content and characterizations of the external information by the site administrator, which the reader is free to reject or accept in relation to the article or information presented.</p>
<p>When a member of the mainstream media scoops another publication, that particular media wishes to present information not found in the other media. By consistently highlighting articles not typically found in what is considered the mainstream media, WhatReallyHappened consistently scoops that media, or any other media not reflecting the information. Further, if Free Republic isn't deleted for failure to adhere WP:NPOV, logically it isn't possible to delete WhatReallyHappened for failure to adhere to WP:NPOV, because no website violates WP:NPOV like Free Republic, and Free Republic is decisively "blog-like".</p>
<p>Next, the primary purpose of WhatReallyHappened as a significant source of unusual news links significantly disables much application of WP:WEB, because the guts of WP:WEB largely depend upon definitions fulfilled by the same media WhatReallyHappened is not designed to represent. What would the charge of the Web be then, if WhatReallyHappened were represented in claimed "reliable" media, that WhatReallyHappened is a mainstream puppet? Reliable media like The Nation or Mother Jones magazines aren't referred to in most media, heck, the Congressional Budget Office isn't even represented properly, with its accurate numbers prepared by dutiful civil servants held up in comparison to politically motivated numbers provided by private companies like the Heritage Foundation.</p>
<p>Yes, the move for renomination for deletion is in violation of standards of reasonableness in relation to not allowing immediate renomination. It isn't really arguable except on hypertechnical grounds, the next afternoon after the previous nomination for deletion failed could be said not to be immediate, if one wants to be hypertechnical. To a reasonable person there is obviously a campaign to remove WhatReallyHappened from Wikipedia, and, to a reasonable person, the nomination for deletion is itself in violation of WP:NPOV because of that campaign, once a reasonable person has reached the conclusion that the renomination violates the immediacy rule. The criteria for renomination for deletion should be that some change has occurred in relation to WhatReallyHappened since the last discussion for deletion which qualifies for another motion for deletion. We're entitled to hear what new information has come to light since the last discussion which qualifies WhatReallyHappened for a new motion for deletion.</p>
<p>WhatReallyHappened is a notable website, first for many references to its data in other well known and established websites, like Counterpunch, which credits WhatReallyHappened with good "detective work", because of the "11 published interviews" a detractor here tried to minimize, and because awards like "Site of the Day" is a criteria the Web uses to rate other sites. Would Wikipedia turn a "Site of the Day" award down? And why does Robert-Fisk.com bother with WhatReallyHappened, surely Robert Fisk is notable and reliable, risking his life in Iraq and Lebanon? Why did Wikipedia fail to delete WhatReallyHappened the last nomination, if it wasn't notable in the earlier determination? I don't see how, if the matter was a split decision, this split decision is anything but a failure to prove WhatReallyHappened isn't notable, it clearly was a failure to prove that, and there's no new information to say that WhatReallyHappened isn't notable. There is, however, new information that WhatReallyHappened is notable, in addition to the earlier failure to delete it as non-notable, because another nomination for deletion has occurred within a month of the last effort to delete WhatReallyHappened from Wikipedia, when no new information has arisen in the meantime to cause this nomination for deletion. That is notable in relation to WhatReallyHappened, and it has happened because WhatReallyHappened is a notable website which draws such attention.</p>

<p>O.k., this is REALLY starting to get out of hand... Wikipedia should do everything that is humanly possible to make certain that no one-sided, or unprofessional views are permitted. Having said that, these constant nominations for deletion are nothing more than malicious attempts to supress valuable information.</p>
<p>Whether one agrees with Mr. Rivero, (and/or his website), is completely irrelevant to the purpose of this website. Wikipedia was designed to allow a wealth of information to be contributed from all kinds of people, from all walks of life, from all political or religious affiliations, and from every corner of the globe. Does whatreallyhappened.com present a professional NPOV? Of course not.&#160;:P But the <b>WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE' <i>on it</i></b> <i>DOES</i>, (or at least, <b>should</b>).</p>
<p>If we start deleting articles about websites, or cult movements simply because we don't agree with them; and/or because they might offend certain groups of people, where does that inevitably lead? Would we have to delete articles on rival political parties? Would we have to delete the article on "Red Magen David" because it offends Muslims?, the article on "Huckleberry Finn" because it offends Americans of African descent?, or perhaps the article on the "Spanish Inquisition" because a recent revelation that Tomas Torquemada was a converted Jew might offend people of that particular faith? Seriously, at what point do we draw the line?</p>
<p>The reality is that there IS a site called whatreallyhappened.com . The only adequate reason for deleting this article would be said website NEVER EXISTED, and is just somebody's idea of a joke.</p>
<p>As a fountain of information, Wikipedia should do everything possible to give all people the right to speak their minds, so long as they do so in a professional way, and expressing a neutral point of view, when writing a fair and balanced article. Pine 05:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex">
<p>KEEP: A second time for deletion one month later? Get real. This is clearly politics and attempted censorship. Someone is trying to delete it because it's one of the top and most popular alternative news sites on the internet - that, by definition, makes it important and worthy of inclusion. It's also very controversial - that also makes it important and worthy of inclusion, and actually worthy of having an article with a neutral point of view. (Which so far the incorrect article has not been neutral being repeatedly reset to incorrect information.)</p>
<p>The real reason the site is being targeted is because it combines three dangerous things: controversial politics, disturbing truth (presented in the form of directly linked verifyable media reports, many of them mainstream, but under reported), and popularity. This is causing abusive interpretations of the rules hoping to cause it to go away by attacking those which link to it. Admittedly the opinions of the site owner border on abusive hate speech and anti semitism at times lashing out with cynicism and outrage, but it primarily serves as a link page to suppressed or nontrivial articles in mainstream or alternative media even for people who do not agree with the political feelings of the site owner.</p>
<p>I do not like or believe the opinions of the author, but I believe censoring the article about him would only prove his claims right all that much more. I read it to find under represented news. Both the WRH site itself and the article here on it could use some clean up, but they absolutely need to be in Wikipedia if you dont want to have a huge gaping hole which is painfully obvious because there is no article there. Deleting it would be dangerous and very counterproductive, showing Wikipedia to be a compromised and nontrustable reference source from now on.</p>
<p>My opinion of Wikipedia has dropped to about a quarter of what it was a month ago for even seeing this. The first call for deletion didnt really surprise me, actually falling for the second so soon again is approaching absurd. I've written articles for Wikipedia in the past, but I will not waste my time on it in the future if it is turned into yet another personal whipping boy due to threats forcing it into a political viewpoint. I will not waste my money on more donations either if it simply kowtows to a shortsighted minority trying to bully others into accepting their point of view.</p>
<p>Lets just be honest and say it all out in the open. Quit pretending that Wikipedia or certain people within Wikipedia are not being pressured in some abusive manner to try and quietly make the article and links go away. Stop the selectively overzealous interpretation of the rules on political grounds and let the truth stand for itself. Wikipedia's reputation has already been tarnished over this, I never even suspected rumors that other articles had been politically censored until WRH came up TWICE in this short of time. If the deletion goes through or ever comes up again it will just prove everyone right and other support may well flock away in droves after seeing the smoking gun of censorship.</p>
<p>To those saying the site is barely notable, how do you call 4-6 million page views per day of nothing other than hardcore news non notable? Considering the level of controversy and strength of opinions about it? 84.9.109.10 06:33, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I keep reading here how Wikipedia is... a) conspiring against WRH b) doomed to be irrelevant if the WRH article is deleted c) a younger, less popular website than WRH etc. It seems like WP is really an inferior site. I'd think it'd be best for WRH fans to concur with deletion and be rid of this mar on their site.

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't really believe there are WRH "fans" as such I think that every "thinking" individual is a "fan" of independence and alternative sides of the story, because that's what thinking is all about isn't it, making your own decision. now when wikipedia or people inside wikipedia appear to be trying to stop such independent sites from propagating like say...... [putting it up for deletion a second time in less than a month] people get angry, understand? The point of the comment above is to address the fact that when a human is faced with a choice between a distortion or an obvious lie, and the alternative they will take the alternative, if wikipedia chooses to knowingly digress from alternatives to the "T.V generation" propaganda then it in it's self will doom it's self to second class cheapness, just through the simple principals of the market system and competition. this is a cold hard fact, there will be in the future and already is other online free encyclopedia's if they have more [of all] information and wikipedia keeps "towing the line" then wikipedia will be known as the [fox encyclopedia] of the net.<br />

<li><b>Comment</b> Keep it. One of the few sources of reliable and unbiased news on the Internet.</li>
<li>All the verbiage is bogus. This is all about censorship plain and simple. There is an information war going on! The truth is rare and many want to squelch it. If anyone doubts Wikipedia's political agenda I refer you to the history of their AIPAC entry, which is now resolved (into a mere 75% lies).</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. WhatReallyHappened.com has kept me sane in trying to understand international affairs for the last eight years or so. More than any other website I value it's daily collection of news and commentary. Yes it posts links to articles that are critical of the US and Israeli Administrations. But when you consider the evidence from an intelligent non-imperialist perspective then the criticism is warranted. What really happened with 911? Does anyone still believe that airliners and jet fuel brought down and pulverised three massively sturdy WTC buildings on 911? Burning kerosene cannot melt steel!! Does this tragedy justify invading two sovereign countries and murdering hundreds of thousands of civilians? More recently, who really believes that the IDF's shoot and burn policy in Gaza is a reasonable response to one captured POW soldier? The Israeli Administration just cannot accept that the Palestinian people would vote for a Hamas led democratic government.</li>
<li>If you follow WhatReallyHappened.com you see the reports day to day from world media that illuminate what is really going on. Unless Wikipedia editors want to distinguish themselves as guardians of Anglo-Zionist propaganda, there is no reason to delete WhatReallyHappened.com. It is a veteran giant among the alternative Internet media sources.</li>
<li>Before you decide the value of the website, try following the stories for a few weeks and look into the archives.

<li><b>Keep</b> WhatReallyHappened is one of the leading news and opinion aggregation web sites on the Internet. If you administrators who are, in effect, the policy makers at Wikipedia intend to provide yet another clear example of how Wikipedia is little more than a biased, agenda-driven web site disguised as a repository of knowledge, then go ahead and delete WhatReallyHappened. Then you can delete Rense and Raw Story Entry and who knows how many others... After you do that then you'll spend the indefinite future in what can only be a futile pursuit, trying to convince the world that deleting content aggregation web sites whose content you sometimes do not approve of is not censorship.

<li><b>KEEP</b>. . I don't know what more to say that hasn't already been said. Let me try and just reinforce what seems to be the common idea:
<ol>
<li>Grounds for non notability? Seems like alot of people are fighting for it...</li>
<li>This site and its listing here is VERY important if only as an example that there is truth out there and someone needs to show it in the light. For those of you who REFUSE to look at the deeper things, the VERY REAL things that make this world go round then I feel very sad for you and angry at the same time because you are part of the problem.</li>
<li>Yes nominating this listing to be deleted in such a short time very much sounds like a personal attack. It reminds me of a spoiled child demanding they get their way. Again...very sad. I can only begin to imagine what your political, personal and religious affiliations are.</li>
<li>Perhaps some of you think this is a conspiracy site. Let me say this. Even conspiracy theories and general stereotypes have roots in truth. Compare WRH to what can be said (no matter how very informative it is) to be a conspiracy site: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html" class="external free" title="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/wake_up_america.html</a></li>
<li>My personal opinion is that the world and particularly the United States is on fire and we are living in unprecedented times. Things have not been this bad, turbulent and corrupt since the collapse of the Roman empire. To add more to it by what really does look like censorship is a real shame. If you want to make a site molded in your opinion then why did you create an encyclopedia site?<br />

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> It looks like the notability criteria needs an amendment that takes into account the volume and quality of comments made in defense of a site. I also think that the number of google hits should be considered as well (on my count 343,000 for "whatreallyhappened"). For the time being, and as regards the<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html#1" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB#1</a> criteria on multiple non-trivial published works, there were indeed two articles in the Toronto Star by Antonia Zerbisias in 2002 on Rivero's site. Considering that whatreallyhappened.com focuses on highlighting news stories the mainstream media misses, it is surprising that it even achieved that distinction.

Note that <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>#1 states that the web-site in question must be the <i>subject</i> of multiple non-trivial published works.

<p>It is the reaction to that initial article which generates subsequent coverage of whatreallyhappened in the Star. Zerbisias in on record stating she received over 20,000 letters in response to the article, overwhelmingly thankful or appreciative. Bnai Brith Canada, however, wrote a press release on 18 November 2002, condemning Zerbisias for promoting "anti-semitic" sites and trying to get her article removed from the paper.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I have been postponing my decision on this. During the previous AfD I was strongly opposed to deleting the article. At that point I had not read <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, like *very* many of the "<a href="../../../m/e/a/Meatpuppet.html" title="Meatpuppet">meatpuppet</a>" people here now obviously haven't either. And like them I was moved by a moral imperative that told me that this site is important and if it is deleted then something must be very wrong somewhere. I now have come to realize that the article doesn't conform to Wikipedia's quality standards which apply equally to all articles, and I particularly make a note of the fact that in the month that has passed since the previous nomination the issue that was raised then has not been addressed in earnest fashion. I also would like to comment that unsubstantiated accusations that "the Wikipedia editors" are out to get "What Really Happens" are immature generalizations. I for one believe that it is possible to find both that WRH is an interesting and important website and that this website unfortunately doesn't meet Wikipedia's standards without particularly suspecting that this is simplistically linked with the ubiquitous tentacles of the NWO machinating the Wikipedia voluntary organization. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 15:08, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Bold text</b>Keep, <b>Bold text</b>Continue, and <b>Bold text</b>Stop Polarazing Discussion - Wikipedia is designed to be an online encyclopedia available to all for editing and reading. To choose to no longer list a page due to political slant is contrary to that motto.

The fact that we are even having this polarazing discussion points to that wikipedia is loosing its focus on expanding the world knowledge encumbered by political manipulation.</li>

<p>Bottom Line: Facts are facts. WRH exists, it's a real website and voice of an important perspective. It should therefore be kept and continued in the worlds freest and largest encyclopedia. --12.161.155.144 15:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)Private Citizen Z</p>

<p><b>Strong Keep</b>- The site served its readers well in providing links to contextual background information on the "War on Terror" and the relentless PR campaign that led up to the Iraq invasion, something the mainstream media, for whatever reason, did not do. WRH has also linked to countless articles which purported to document anomalies in the events and official narrative of 9/11- another potentially fertile subject in which the mainstream media has shown no interest. WRH is a very notable alternative news site for those who wish to "question everything", and is a threat to those who are afraid of out-of-consensus viewpoints, even if, or perhaps especially if, those viewpoints are closer to the truth than the conventional wisdom.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Isayoldchap (<a href="../../../i/s/a/User_talk%7EIsayoldchap_88d9.html" title="User talk:Isayoldchap">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Isayoldchap_77cd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Isayoldchap">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex">
<p>KEEP - Of course, I'd argue "keep," this entry. Right now, however, I'm not even sure it's worthwhile to debate this argument of whether "What Really Happened" should be kept on Wikipedia anymore. I suggest this because I believe that this problem truly originates in Wikipedia's flawed notability policy which needs objectivity, transparency, and oversight.</p>
<p>To me, notability is extremely tricky; for, it suggests that there are gatekeepers of culture who decide what is popular. Who are the people that determine what is "notable?" Is it the media, the intelligensia, those with power, or the masses? Is popularity determined by an individual, cultural, local, nation or international spheres? Is it indicated if it's pop culture or historical? Is it determined by one's known professional knowledge? Is it determined by one's individual taste or preference?</p>
<p>Although one may argue that the above classifications are valid ways to determine notability, I still believe that it is flawed because there is no objectivity. Almost anyone can nominate a site for deletion on Wikipedia, and therein lies the problem. What one person determines as "notable" may not be "notable" to another person, especially if an individual has not had contact, exposure to, or prior knowledge of the subject or article being nominated for deletion. For example, there are plenty authors, such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Gloria Naylor, or Ursula Hegi, that I am sure that quite a few people on this site have not read, are familiar with, or have heard about. Does this make these individuals non-notable because they are not known to an individual editor or Wikipedian member? They are not "notable" to these editors, but they may be known to a person who is familiar with world literature. What if a person doesn't know about a philosopher like Charles S. Peirce -- one of the founders of American pragmatism? If a person hasn't studied or isn't interested in philosophy, does this make Peirce non notable? I have had this experience myself, where articles I've written -- not so well known to some in American culture, have been nominated for deletion less than a minute after their initial creation -- without the Wikipedian editor taking the time to research, let alone taking the mere five seconds one would need to check Google's search engine to determine if a subject had prior media coverage or newsworthiness.</p>
<p>Another flaw in Wikipedia's notability policy is that there is little transparency. What if a person, organization, or institution has a dislike of a certain subject's inclusion in this "wiki" and wishes to have it removed from the public sphere to stiffle knowledge and to silence debate. One can easily cite Wikipedia's "notability" clause as a specious argument for an article's removal. I would argue that a similar phenomena is already exists and is rampant in corporate-controlled media where international and national news stories are shelved to prevent damage to their bottom-line.</p>
<p>My last argument is there is little oversight. I would have no problem if a page was deleted based on something quantifiable: Wikipedia has not instituted anything measurable in this regard. And, yes, there are ways to determine an entry's popularity - - statistics. Blog sites do this all the time. When I oversaw certain websites, I used free programs like <a href="http://www.xav.com/scripts/axs/" class="external text" title="http://www.xav.com/scripts/axs/" rel="nofollow">| AXS Visitor Tracking</a> that could do tracking. And even CPANEL has programs that can give individual statistics on which pages get the most traffic. Anyway, that's my two cents.</p>
<p>And lastly, I really object to Wikipedia's use of "meatpuppetry" and the like. It just sounds childish and meanspirited, in my opinion. All individuals have the right to their opinions and if they feel strongly about a subject, they have the right to express it, just as you do. And inspite of how we'd all like to believe we're "independent thinkers," we're all "meatpuppets" to some extent of our desires, cultures or society. American debate has sunk to the level of labelling or slandering groups of people, ideas, and/or subjects in order to "silence" the effectiveness of their opponents' argument. As a result topics, such as this one, that are in need of a serious debate are reduced to the mere superficial. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarah_smiling_again_dfad.html" title="User:Sarah smiling again">Sarah smiling again</a> 16:05, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, personally I don't see this as necessarily a question of vague "notability" of the site. We do have a quantifiable guideline with which to measure web content against: <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. Whether or not you agree with the the guidelines is a different matter all together, and is probably a more appropriate debate at the actual guidelines. In my opinion, What Really Happened does not meet said guideline (and I've enumerated why above). As for transparency, it's readily available on userpages (sometimes) and if not you can usually get a pretty good idea about a person from their edit history. I have no agenda other than strongly defending my point that we have guidelines for this type of entry, this particular entry does not meet said guidelines base on all evidence provided (and based on the fact that I mucked around on the internet for a while looking for anything that would meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and nobody has advanced an argument explaining how it meets the guidelines.

<li><b>strong keep</b> An encyclopedia is not an item to be maintained by deletions. Obviously this site is inhabited by shills for the pro-war government. This was apparent in the Vietnam era but really unseen by the young in this decade. Think back to the War on Drugs - a propaganda war only, until the supply stopped - now NATO is the supplier/protector of over 90% of the world's opium. Wiki will sink into the same marshes of baloney after its successful hijacking occuring now. It was interesting for a while but it won't survive unopposed efforts at thought control. The internet was designed as a military system, and, as such, will interpret censorship as an outage and simply route around it. The designers knew that centralized control is a failed strategy (no not al gore). Ever think about a policy on NO DELETIONS&#160;? Galileo and Copernicus would have loved that. After all, they were right in the beginning and won in the end, and its been the 'authorities' that first wanted G and C's work deleted, but today want their true role in thistory deleted. In the final analysis, where will wiki stand, and, by the way, what does the title 'Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia' really mean&#160;? The truth is never decided by votes. When my children were very young watching a football game with me, they wanted to know which team I was 'voting' for ......... of course I had to tell them that votes only mattered in an election.........silly me 24.73.33.65 16:20, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This might be a fools errand to point these out, but a few things that might need to be made clear:
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is not voting to delete this website. That's not within Wikipedia's power.</li>
<li>The website will continue to exist and plenty of people will visit it, whether it is in Wikipedia or not. The website does not have an inalienable right to be included in Wikipedia for purposes of publicity or advertisement.</li>
<li>Nobody advocates deleting this encyclopedia entry because of the content of the website or the news items and opinions there.</li>
<li>This is not a question of whether you like the website, or how often you visit it. It is also not a question of whether there exist other articles in Wikipedia which do not meet notability criteria (if there are, they should be brought up for discussion as well, but that is not a reason to end this discussion.)</li>
<li>This is a simple question of the pre-existing Wikipedia guidelines for whether a website should be the topic of an encyclopedic article, and whether this website meets them.</li>
<li>The guidelines can be read by clicking on the link <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. If you think this article should be Kept, then make an argument as to how the website meets these criteria.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> Obviously a bunch of new users have been encouraged to come "vote" to keep this article. It doesn't meet wp:web, so it should be deleted.

<p><b>Comment</b> The criteria regarding multiple published works has been met. See my earlier entry above under Very Strong Keep. The policies also need to be changed. They are elitist, as is the tone of many of the posters here who made derogatory remarks about without Wikipedia user names who were posting here in support of the site. WRH is notable, even under the policies currently in place. People who want less censorship here need to get involved in drafting policy. Unfortunately, it is often those with a predeliction for power who get into that game, inscribing gobbledy gook with legalese loopholes that can be selectively invoked to discount entries on mere technicalities. I just want to remind Wiki members of one incredibly important existent guideline that mentions the importance of following the spirit and not the letter as regards the inclusion of a given page. Deletes are supposed to be a last resort. This site is clearly notable. The article can be developed, as has been since the last proposed delete. To delete now will be evidence of extreme bias and frankly counterproductive when so many new people have been exposed to Wikipedia and could form a completely wrong opinion about it based on the views of a hypervocal, rather disdainful minority. People, the policy needs to be improved! I urge those who care to join up, and get to it. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 19:35, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I am familiar with the contents of both articles, having read them when they were initially published in 2002. In order to see the full text at the links provided (the original primary sources) you have to pay for the service. But if you do google searches on the titles of the articles or on zerbisias and rivero, you will see disucssions of the articles at many different blogs and perhaps even a reprint of one them. It should also be noted that whatreallyhappened.com is is linked by over 2253 sites according to its Alexa information <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=whatreallyhappened.com&amp;url=whatreallyhappened.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=whatreallyhappened.com&amp;url=whatreallyhappened.com" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>, including World Net Daily <a href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22518" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22518" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> who quotes it as an important source in an article on the Oklahoma bombing, and Robert Fisk <a href="http://www.robert-fisk.com/911_initial_reaction.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.robert-fisk.com/911_initial_reaction.htm" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> who finds Rivero's views on the site to be notable enough to be included with the likes of Arundhati Roy, Ralph Nader, and the Dalai Lama. In summary once again, whatreallyhappened.com has been proven over the course of this discussion to have 1) been the subject of a 18 November press release by B'nai Brith Canada accusing it of anti-semitism, 2) the main subject of at least one and arugably three articles in the Toronto Star, 3) a primary source for World Net Daily story on the Oklahoma bombings, 4) an important source on 9/11 in the opinion of Robert Fisk, and 5) the recipient of the Democratic Media Award 2005. As such, it meets two, if not three of criteria listed in the<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> policy. The resistance to recognize this despite hours of efforts from those who wish to see the page remain and documentation of the resources listed throughout this talk page is very disturbing and contrary to Wikipedia policies regarding deletion as a last resort only when efforts to improve articles have failed. Since the last nomination, improvements have been made to the article and research appearing on this talk page can be incorporated into the article to futher strengthen it. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 10:14, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment'</b> Inner Earth, please see my entry above on the three separate articles in the Toronto Star on whatreallyhappened.com. At least two of the articles were non-trivial, the source is independent, and being more than one, I would argue that that qualifies as "multiple". Additionally, the site, meets other <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria as the recipient of of the Democratic Media Award <a href="http://www.goodwriters.net/dmr2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.goodwriters.net/dmr2.html" rel="nofollow">[14]</a> in 2005, a list whose 2006 winners include ABC News Off the Wire, Adbusters magazine, The Nation, and Mother Jones, among others. This is therefore a notable site under the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> which only requires the site to meet one of the three criteria listed. The evidence cited throughout this discussion indicates that two of the three criteria are met. Additionally, there is widespread agreement, even from those for deletion of the article, that the policy needs revision. "Wikipedia is not about censorship" nor is it about rule-setting and technical nitpicking. It is as plain as day that the site is notable. A deletion would be a violation of existing Wikipedia policy, both the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and the broader policy per deletion in general. I would argue that it also defeats Wikipedia's purpose. The controversy surrounding Zerbisias' initial article on Rivero's site in the Toronto Star would make an excellent addition to the article and thoroughly justify its inclusion. I will try to make those changes myself, but if anyone else feels inspired, please go ahead.<a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 22:34, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment'</b> Again, your contention that the site does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria is a blatant falsehood. As has been noted and cited in any number of ways in both discussions, it clearly does. And if "anonymous comments" will always be disregarded, then your "wiki" should cease allowing "anonymous comments" to be posted. Threatening to remove such comments from sources 'outside' your 'group' because they post comments you don't approve of (or agree with) shows you have a problem with adverse opinion on some level. And that problem can, should, and will be construed as "editorial bias" in many quarters. Thus, if your policy is to remain truly "neutral" as a good "reference" site, then you shouldn't even be having this discussion. If you want to remain credible, you need to take your personality out of the discussion.64.193.3.46 23:09, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

B'nai Brith accused Zerbisias of promoting anti-semitism in press release condemning the article which referred to some of the content of Rivero's site. <a href="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:DIOq7Nd2Gx4J:www.newsdissector.org/blog/2002/11/20/do-you-think-he-means-it/+zerbisias+9/11+2002+november&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" class="external autonumber" title="http://72.14.221.104/search?q=cache:DIOq7Nd2Gx4J:www.newsdissector.org/blog/2002/11/20/do-you-think-he-means-it/+zerbisias+9/11+2002+november&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=ca&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=16" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> She refused to consider having the article removed and wrote another article on 19 November totally devoted to examining Rivero's site against the charge of anti-semitism <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" class="external autonumber" title="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/422157441.html?did=422157441&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=FT&amp;date=Nov+19%2C+2002&amp;author=Antonia+Zerbisias&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=Judge+not+fourth+(or+fifth)+estate" rel="nofollow">[17]</a>.

<li>Meh, you're no fun. But let's talk about your comment, "If you suppress this site by not allowing a Wikipedia reference to it, then you are guilty of attempting to hide and obscure this content which is an intellectual crime of the first order." Would you say the same thing in a letter to Encyclopedia Brittanica, telling them why they should write an article about this website? Because you understand, this is an encyclopedia we're working on, and though we hope it will be bigger and better than Brittanica, it's got to have some standards.</li>

<dd>How would the truth be suppressed if readers of an encyclopedia missed out on a gem like "The main page of WRH is the news blog, featuring links to news articles selected by Rivero with some commentary." or "To the left side of the main blog are links to articles written by Rivero or posted on pages belonging to WhatReallyHappened.com, advertisements, links to archives of items posted onto the blog in the past, a search bar and a link to the WRH store."</dd>
<dd>Or is that just a bunch of filler, because there's really nothing of encyclopedic interest to say about this website? <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 02:47, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The Wikipedia is not the Encyclopedia Brittanica, it should not try to be the Encyclopedia Brittanica. It is however a reference point for people like myself who are researching information and opinion on current events. I don't agree with Grudge, but I would not want that site to be taken off the internet, and I would want Wikipedia to have an appropriate reference to it. You may not know this but students of contemporary events like myself, do want these type of sites to be well known and covered by other internet reference publications, even if we do not always agree with the content or perspectives of the authors we want to know what the POV is, and what views are being expressed. That is an important aspect of freedom of speech.
<dl>
<dd>You haven't answered the question; what is the critical research material or coverage that a student/researcher would be missing out on? It sounds like you think that this site has a right to be in Wikipedia just to make sure it gets as much publicity as the <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drudge_Report_b304.html" title="Drudge Report">Drudge Report</a> - and that's <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">NOT</a> what Wikipedia is for! <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 03:07, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I have in fact answered the question. The criteria is not and should not be that Wikipedia will only cover a site if and only if it has some entirely unique critical research material, which is the standard you are attempting to forward at this point. You should know by now that a good number of people like myself rely on that site, among others for information about contemporary events. It is unique in its compilation and it is convenient in that sense for someone researching the information even if WRH is not the original source of all of the material being researched. Again, though WRH does have some original and interesting summaries and exposition. There is no valid rational for suppressing the article on this site. And again, repeating my first comment, given the ferocity of the pro-deletion opinions being expressed, apparently those commenters are attempting to suppress the Wikipedia article on WRH for political or ideological reasons. If the site was entirely trivial in that sense, would it raise so much commentary? Obviously it would not.24.1.11.49 03:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually, when I said critical research material, etc., I was just picking a few words out of your original comment. But I think it ought to be obvious to you that Wikipedia does not have the power to delete this site from the internet, and obviously WRH got along fine before someone tried to create an encyclopedia article about it, and obviously will get along fine without it. And no, believe it or not, <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">there is no cabal</a>, this is not a conspiracy, Zionist or otherwise; I'm just talking, same as you. I also didn't pick up on anyone advocating deletion for political or ideological reasons. (although there are plenty of paranoid folks <i>claiming</i> so)</li>
<li>But let's try another tact on this - if tomorrow, Rivero suddenly starts posting links to hardcore pornography on WRH, or reviews of Harry Potter books written in Esperanto - that would be out of character, right? That's not what the site's about. It's the same way with Wikipedia. If it's not encyclopedic, that's not what the site's about. That's why we'll have an article about <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but not someone's grandfather who served in WWII, <i>unless</i> that grandfather did something notable (and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>). However, just about anything or anyone, regardless of their objective value, or whether they are good or evil, can have an article if it manages to clearly meet our standards of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">notability</a>, and if the community consensus (this sort of discussion) is in favor of it. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 03:34, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>COMMENT</b> to <b>finally</b> answer the question.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatreallyhappened.Com IS <b>VERY</b> notable, since it was the first major website, (run by a steadfast Republican), that discussed the distinct possibility that the Bush Administration's plans to start foreign wars, were for no reasons apart from providing exhorbitant profits for Halliburton et al, and preserving America's <i>Entente Cordiale</i> with fair-weather allies: Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>When practically the entire "mainstream media" and virtually all of the (supposedly) opposition Democratic Party, were swooning over Mr. Bush, and giving a verbal rubber-stamp to his Woodrow Wilson-esque foreign odysseys; whatreallyhappened.com was the <b>only</b> conservative, pro-Republican, online community that presented an opportunity for peaceful dissent.</p>
<p>In essence, the website in question provided the <b>ONLY</b> "speaker's corner" to the millions of conservative, pro-Republican, Americans who otherwise would have had no outlet; by virtue of BOTH chastisement by other right-leaning media AND reluctance to stand with left-leaning, non-mainstream, media.</p>
<p>This article should <b>not</b> be deleted, any more than any article on pro-solidarity media in 1980s Poland, anti-apartheid media in 1990s South Africa, or the Voice of America, should be.</p>
<p>I apologize, Dicty, but I must respectfully disagree. The pro-deletion side IS largely, (though <b>not</b> entirely), driven by people who wish to censor opinions that they do not agree with. As one good-faith editor addressing another, I implore you to consider how history might one day look back on whatreallyhappened.com. That is, <i>assuming</i> history is ever given that chance. Pine 05:16, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<div style="border: 1px solid; padding: 1ex">
<p>MMIE: (sorry did not mean to make it look like Pine posted this) Was the Article on WRH really burning up that many of Wiki's resources to necessitate deletion? I love both websites and it causes me a good deal of dissonance to have to take any kind of sides between the two.</p>
<p><br />
207.224.92.111 07:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC) Keep.</p>
<p>"Wikipedia is not a moot court, and although rules can make things easier, they are not the purpose of the community and instruction creep should generally be avoided. A perceived procedural error made in posting anything, such as an idea or nomination, is not grounds for invalidating that post. Follow the spirit, not the letter, of any rules, policies and guidelines. Disagreements should be resolved through consensual discussion, rather than through tightly sticking to rules and procedures."</p>
<p>I quote the above because whether the article does or does not obey the strict letter of wikipedia's policies should not be exclusive grounds for deletion. That Whatreallyhappened is such a notable if controversial site in the alternative media community is probably justification for having at least some type of article on it, even if only a stub or less than perfect article, to avoid accusations or proof of bias. That there is high risk, if not evidence, of a desire to censor the existance/links to Whatreallyhappened should be grounds for ruling in it's favor. Being marked twice in one month is suspicious. Consensus is fundamentally unobtainable when there is sock puppetry, therefore lack of consensus shouldn't be reason for a second or third attempt at deletion. Rather it should be evidence of McCarthyism.</p>
<p>Mark the article as needing cleanup, more references, more neutrality, and other points of view. It should remain unmerged because it has a separate existance from Michael Rivero himself, just like Microsoft is a separate article from Bill Gates. Indeed it is far more likely a searcher will be searching for Whatreallyhappened the site than Michael Rivero the person. There needs to be an article here, just not a poorly written one. Let people volunteer to fix it, then move on. Nobody will waste time rewriting it if they expect their hard work and research to be deleted in a third call for removal come the end of July. 207.224.92.111 07:27, 1 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>'Comment' I have already voted, but I would like to address the above comment. BankIndex.com has since went down but there are archives of the article <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/ARCHIVE/BankIndexPart2.htm</a>. Dubious or not, they meet the "criteria", which itself seems dubious because it's common sense that a website like whatreallyhappened.com is notable. The notability article first states that it is a guidline, but then becomes a set of criteria. So are they rules of thumb or a gospel to be followed? As for people who don't like anonymous comments, I'd just like to point out that just because it's anonymous doesn't mean we don't have accounts on here.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I cannot understand this objection. Blogs are explicitly mentioned content covered by the WP:WEB policy and rightly so, since blogs are a huge and growing phenomenon. The rights and responsibilities of bloggers as journalists is a notion gaining legislative ground in many places around the world (including recently, California). The refusal of some parties to concede that the policy on notability under which this article was nomiated for deletion has been evidentially met over and over again is simply bizarre. Wikipedia is not supposed to be a stuffy hardcover encyclopedia. It's a revolutionary format on a revolutionary medium and its content should reflect important trends in the cyber-reality that makes it very existence possible. Wikipedia is in many ways a kind of collective blog, though taken to another level, where people can interact with one another as equals, exchange knowledge and build a peer-checked resource that can cover an unlimited amount of subject matter because it exists in cyberspace; and as such, it should resist aspiring to be a dusty encyclopedic volume on an office shelf that nobody ever bothers to pull down and look into since it is so out-of-date and so out-of-touch with present realities. No one is forcing anybody to love, feature or visit this page, except those working for its deletion. Let those interested in improving it work on doing so. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 21:02, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Regarding edits to article</b> KwH, I accept that the use of "attacking" was possibly POV and the edit that you carried out, particularly the follow-up edit, likely helped to enrich the article. (N.B. I do find it strange that you would spend time editing an article you have voted to delete. Why bother if it is so non-notable?) In your edit summary, however, you accuse me of misquoting OmBudsGod.com, when in fact I do not quote them, but rather had provided a link to the blog since it holds a direct quote from Zerbisias in her initial response to the B'nai Brith press release, that I had quite briefly and accurately paraphrased in the original edit, I might add. Please do not make baseless accusations of "misquoting." While I make mistakes sometimes, I edit in good faith and to try faithfully represent the diverse sources I cite.

<dd>Upon researching the claim, I found a link to Damien Penny's blog (which is mentioned by OmbudsGod). IIRC, the original text claimed that Zerbisias "stood by her reporting" <i>at first</i>, when the Penny blog revealed that phrase came from an open letter to WRH from Zerbisias which was sent <i>after</i> her second article criticizing the site. Zerbisias stated that she refused to retract the original story, but this was in the context of her responding to WRH readers who were furiously emailing her <i>after the second story</i> and alleging that she must have been pressured by The Star to repudiate WRH (which she denied being pressured). She stood by the thrust of her original story (that alternate causes of 9/11 should be investigated) but did not stand by WRH whatsoever other than as quoted ("the good parts are ruined by the hateful sections"). I'll give a copy of the link to Daimnation later if you like.</dd>
<dd>I apologize if you take it personally, but taken in toto the section seemed to be a misread or 'misquote' of the entire situation as I understood it from further research - I was referring to the content, not you personally. Also, bear in mind that OmbudsGod and Penny slightly misrepresent the situation themselves, since they accuse Zerbisias and the ombudsman of the paper of anti-semitism anyways, so the misquote is partially theirs.</dd>
<dd>And to the extent that I enriched an article which I favor deleting... the fact is that I researched the matter to understand why Zerbisias mentioned the site in two columns, and having done so, I have no reason to withhold that information from others. I still think that Zerbisias' mention is the very definition of 'trivial coverage'. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 14:06, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to review KwH, I had written that, "Ms. Zerbisias responded by standing by her reporting (See November 20, 2002 entry of the blog OmBudsGod! <a href="http://ombudsgod.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_ombudsgod_archive.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://ombudsgod.blogspot.com/2002_11_01_ombudsgod_archive.html" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>). She did, however, retract her support for the WRH site in a subsequent article [ <a href="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1035774581010&amp;call_page=TS_Columnists&amp;call_pageid=970599109774&amp;call_pagepath=Columnists" class="external text" title="http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&amp;c=Article&amp;cid=1035774581010&amp;call_page=TS_Columnists&amp;call_pageid=970599109774&amp;call_pagepath=Columnists" rel="nofollow">Judge not the Fourth (or Fifth) Estate</a>. The Toronto Star (November 19, 2002). ]." I do not see how this is a misquote or a misrepresentation of the link I provided, but would defintely appreciate having a look at the DamianPenny link you cited, or something even more authoritative. If Zerbisias' statement was a response to WRH readers, and not the B'nai Brith press release, it would be useful to the WRH article, definitely increasing the notability of the site. It would constitute evidence of WRH being an effective rallyer of 9/11 skeptics that can pressure the mainstream media to respond to the site and its readers concerns. <a href="../../../t/i/a/User%7ETiamut_fba0.html" title="User:Tiamut">Tiamut</a> 14:55, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

Further, I believe in making only one comment, not bandying things about, now TedE has me making two. I don't like that. Now look here, there's a lot not to like about WRH, but the evidence for deletion from Wikipedia ain't here. And I don't usually stick my nose in any business except democracy business, which is what we got going on here.

<dd>I don't have a problem with Ted. Who's Ted? Any remark on this Afd after closure isn't right, and I think it was reasonable to say that Ted was cued to my article directly from here, so I responded here, because it is part of this story. If you had said nothing, Isotope, I would not write this, but when you say I have a problem with "Ted", it can sound like my problem with the edit is personal. Uh-uh. All stems from failure to lock. I have answered his answer on my talk page, taking a cue from him. I think the admin requirements he lists on his talk page are quite admirable, and after careful reading I am convinced he believes in them. This is a hot issue for some people, not much for me, frankly, as long as I get my one bit in, which is what it should have been left at, so momma don't care. Now take a cue from me, admins. Lock this page at the point when the decision was reached, so the record is not subsequently fouled by too much errata occurring outside the meaningful time frame. It starts to look like an effort to create a new paradigm, regardless what is actually happening. In this case reality doesn't matter, it's a matter of what it starts to look like. If you let it go on much more, and subsequently lock it at the earlier point like I suggest, why, anybody can say things like, hey, this isn't going our way, let's hide under Roukan's suggestion. You've got both sides to this discussion taking notice that this continues, too. Dicty and I were the first to flag it, the instant we discovered it was open. Like I said, reality of what is happening here shouldn't matter, because the decision is closed, but if you don't lock it, anything can happen, anything can be said about it, and I can see unintended damage accruing. If the discussion wasn't locked, Ted wouldn't have remarked here, he wouldn't have potentially had a commitment to a point of view in his mind doing edits a little while later, at least I'd have been convinced at that time that it didn't matter, and approached the edit with him, as we have now done. None of this would be possible if the thing was locked. And there's likely to be more damage, too. Heck all discussions should be locked once the decision is reached. It's obvious. It did take people a thousand years riding horses before somebody threw a saddle on one. Do we have to wait that long to adopt an obvious procedure?</dd>
