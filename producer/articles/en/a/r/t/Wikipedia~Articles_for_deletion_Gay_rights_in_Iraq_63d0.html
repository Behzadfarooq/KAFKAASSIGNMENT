<p>I believe that this article should be <b>delete</b>d. It is just pushing the author/authoress' point of view, and doesn't give much information, but to be fair I'll put it to a vote. <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChooserr_aa51.html" title="User:Chooserr">Chooserr</a> 00:05, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Neutral</b> for now</s>, although the article might need renaming (e.g. to LGBT rights in Iraq).

<li><s><b>Keep</b>. Deletion is only an option if the article is intrinsically and irreparably pov. I don't think that is the case with this article.

<li><s><b>Strong keep</b>. I find it hard to understand the nomination or the delete votes.</s> This is a fairly good sized article with a dozen external links that has received quite a few contributions from different editors for half a year. It's a dry analysis of Iraqi law and recent history as it affects gay rights. It certainly doesn't attack the United States. If it does have POV problems (which I don't see), then the proper procedure is to give it an NPOV flag and leave comments on the talk page or better yet to correct the text. The nominator attempted none of these remedies. There is no valid basis for deletion. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 01:00, 16 December 2005 (UTC) <b>Speedy keep</b> per <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERob_5d2f.html" title="User:Rob">User:Rob</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm at a loss to see what <i>POV issues</i> to fix. The only specific examples in this discussion come from people who appear not to have read the article. It attacks no country or culture. It does not advocate homosexuality. <a href="../../../g/a/y/Category%7EGay_rights_by_country_6550.html" title="Category:Gay rights by country">Category:Gay rights by country</a> has 35 other entries. I say this with caution since such things should not be suggested lightly, but perhaps the intersection of <i>gay</i> + <i>Iraq</i> pushes buttons for some people. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 03:52, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This article, as said by <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> above, is a well researched and rather comprehensive one (IMHO) covering history, legal issues, etc. The POV issues that some users seem to see should be <i>discussed on its talk page</i> and eventually fixed, not simply speedily deleted. That does not solve problems and as far as I was informed, was not the way Wikipedia operated. You don't see the George Bush or Palestinian articles being speedied, and those are, again IMHO, more controversial and potentially POV than this one. Another problem seems to be <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.11.html" title="User:64.12.116.11">User:64.12.116.11</a>, who has in the past couple of minutes added a NPOV tag, a nonsense tag, a totally disputed tag, an unwanted tag, and finally deleted the article (which has now been reverted). This user has a history of vandalism and has struck again here, evidently, which I think is a different issue than the other discussions. <a href="../../../s/p/u/User%7ESputnikcccp_4ea7.html" title="User:Sputnikcccp">Sputnikcccp</a> 01:48, 16 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow, I see you have a pretty strong POV. "Homosexuals are non-notable"? Is that why their rights are a major political issue around the world? "Irrelevant minority?"

<li>Yes, we are going to have articles about this on every country in the world. And why shouldn't we? Homosexuality is notable, just like crime, cuisine, culture and religion. And the legal dealings with homosexuality in different countries is definitely encyclopedic. I won't get involved in a religious discussion with you (although I have a feeling that I think most of what you feel is utter bullshit), but you really shouldn't let your pov get in the way of your contributions to this encyclopedia.

<li>Those edits do not stand on their own. They are part of what seems to be structured and organized behaviour to fix votes, and with it wikipedia content, along the lines of religious beliefs.

<dd>This is typical you don't like something or someone so they must be punished. He had every right to nominate this article for deletion. Just the title alone is Point of View. <a href="../../../p/i/t/User%7EPitchka_b625.html" title="User:Pitchka">Dwain</a> 04:29, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nobody is talking of censure simply because of nomination of an article we wish kept. It's the *expressed* motive of the deletion that's the problem, and the means of promoting the deletion. We must <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, but the nominator has made clear through their own words and actions; that they're seeking the deletion of articles based on religious/moral grounds, and are trying to gather a coalition of like-minded voters along sectarian lines to accomplish this. That's what's truly unacceptable here. As an anology, if somebody nominated a Christian rights in Iraq article because they personally opposed Christianity, and solicited votes principally from people they thought shared their religious views (based on religious affiliation), then that would also be unacceptable. We don't want any religious block to start dictating content at Wikipedia. If you don't like the article title, then please go to the talk page, and suggest an alternate name, and try and gain a consensus for a better one. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 04:51, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
