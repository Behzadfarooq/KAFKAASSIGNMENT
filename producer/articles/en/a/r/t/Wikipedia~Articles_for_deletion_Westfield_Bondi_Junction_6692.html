<li><b>Comment</b> I find it troublesome that multiple users are expressing frustration about Elonka's nomination, insisting on the notability of the mall, and have yet to add any assertion of notability to the article. Rebecca, in particular, would do well to actually spend time <i>working on the article</i> and cease making <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">bad faith assumptions</a> and calling for sanctions against Elonka. As of this post, there aren't even any sourceless notability assertions, much less one with a reference attached to it. Thus, the article still should be speedy deleted per CSD A7. <b><a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoes_d467.html" title="User:Simoes"><font color="#006400">Simões</font></a></b> (<font size="1"><sup><a href="../../../s/i/m/User_talk%7ESimoes_e6ed.html" title="User talk:Simoes">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simoes_0c82.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simoes">contribs</a></sub></font>) 17:47, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I did add a cited reference stating that this was Westfield's newest and <b>largest</b> centre - I haven't even added the ref above yet ("unparalleled financial success"). I partly agree though: Rebecca, can you stop just reverting any tags Elonka adds and calling for sanctions? She's right, these articles need work.

<li>I'm not reverting all of Elonka's tags. I'm keeping those that actually warrant it, such as the local interest tags for malls that are actually of only local interest, and not those, such as this, which are patently not, and which Elonka did not bother to find out about. I also stand by calling for sanctions - I'm fed up with having to spend so much time defending articles like this from guerrilla deletion tactics (speedy, then prod, then AfD), when if anything, all they need is a bit of cleanup and expansion. <a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebecca_4f8f.html" title="User:Rebecca">Rebecca</a> 00:54, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>It being Westfield's largest is not inherently notable. The strip mall down the street is the largest owned by its owner, and it is really small. It is up to the creaters of an article and those who wish to keep it to make a claim of notability and to support it with verifiable and reliable sources, not to all other editors. The article had one from the Economist which was a directory type paragraph listing which said it was there and had a lot of stores, as do many other shopping centers. The other citation told of digging a big hole in the ground, as is customary when building something. The newest cite says the owner has made a hunk of money. Still not that superlative or notable. Please do not threaten editors with sanctions if they nominate articles which could benefit from re-writing or added citations. We really need a guideline to separate the notable from the non-notable shopping mall. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:03, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Can I just ask, what sort of information would change your mind here? I mean, what (verifiable) sentence in the intro would make you think "yes, this mall/centre <i>is</i> notable"? I realise it is up to creators and keepers to verify and assert notability, but it's not easy when such attempts or references are dismissed out of hand (the references, by the way, were for the figures, not to back up superlative claims). I definitely agree we need a guideline on this. However, Westfield of course is not just "the guy down the road", you are surely aware of how many centres they own, so I think this is a fallacious dismissal of a sound claim to notability. This is like saying, "this is Australia's largest shopping centre, but Papua New Guinea's largest shopping centre is tiny, so Australia's largest is therefore not notable".--<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 23:35, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>Well, if the mall is distinguished from all other malls in the country by its size, architecture, splendor of its stores, or unique features, that would probably do it for me. <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> comes to mind:"the largest shopping mall in total area in the United States when it opened in 1992."See also<a href="../../../w/a/t/Water_Tower_Place_a24f.html" title="Water Tower Place">Water Tower Place</a> which is notable as a skyscraper mall which has had a profound influence for 30 years. The largest malls in the largest cities of a country might be notable. <a href="../../../m/e/r/Meridian_Mall_a9f6.html" title="Meridian Mall">Meridian Mall</a> in a suburb of Lansing Michigan, the state capital, stayed. Lansing Mall, the second largets, got deleted. I might have kept it. I would not have kept the 3rd, 4th, 5th etc in the Lansing area. Also the ritziest malls in the largest cities. Do people all over the country talk about visiting the mall if they are ever in the town? Do people take bus trips for a long distance just to visit the mall? Or is it just the place you go to buy a shirt at J.C Penney's? Saying it is "Westfield's largest mall" is like saying it is "Joe Doe's largest mall" because it assumes we think Westfield is inherently important. Identifying it as "the largest mall in Xville" begs the question of the significance of Xville, for people in other continents. Bondi may be notable, but the article read very similarly to innumerable writeups of utterly unmemorable malls. The intro still just says it is Westfield's largest, not the world's largest or the country's largest. Maybe it could be revised to highlight the notability of Bondi. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:30, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. The discussion here seems to raise the inadequacy of what we all mean by notable. Different people think some things are notable (or not) and others think the reverse. For example I find High Schools and large Shopping Centres to be notable, while I think most railway stations and roads are completely unnotable, yet there there appears to be little objection to keeping these. I also find villages to be notable even though they are often smaller than Schools and Shopping Centres. Perhaps for now we should move to be more inclusionist in all these areas, so I favour <b>keep</b> here. --<a href="../../../b/d/u/User%7EBduke_8398.html" title="User:Bduke">Bduke</a> 23:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
