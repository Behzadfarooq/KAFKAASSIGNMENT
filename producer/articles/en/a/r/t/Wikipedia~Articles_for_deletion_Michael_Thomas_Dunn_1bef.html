<p>Well, I don't know about all this. It seems that both sides are spamming to me. But I don't think that any rules are being broken and don't see what would be gained from deletion. Honestly, Wiki lists porn stars -- many of which are pretty obscure, too. Whatever. Don't like a show, change the channel. Don't like a web site, don't read it.</p>
<p>I don't recall reading anything on Wiki that stated that I couldn't invite my friends to partipate in discussions. I have many contributions over the past year to Wiki (I am no where near a single user account) -- a large portion were the articles mentioned on the AFD, but I have also contributed to content regarding Florida history, theme parks, automobiles, video games, heavy trucks and other topics I am familar with. I will make any changes that are suggested. But so far, no suggestions have been made. I will break it down: A. These Pages meet Wiki's Reliable Sources: I have cited several newspaper articles (New York Times/Orlando Business Journal/Central Florida Future) confirm the info. B. Wiki's Non-Notable Subject: the Subject is also listed on many other entertainment web sites. C. "Delete per well documented nom" - Not a single user has once tried to rebute any of the facts I have listed. DodgeM4S</p>

<dd><b>Reply</b> Thank you for pointing out the SPAM policy and I just re-read it-- but inviting friends and local newsgroup readers does not appear to violate the Wiki policy in any way. I think this debate is definitely useful -- and I'm looking to improve the quality of all the content I have submitted, not just the ones listed in the APD. Another contribution I made to a theme park was deemed a little too POV/opinionated -- so I fixed it. All I ask is you make constructive suggestions that I can use to remedy any of the content. I've put a lot of effort in all the content submitted -- and think it has made wikipedia a more complete source of information.... which has been my goal all along. I do wish I registered earlier, as I had made many earlier contributions as anonymous -- that is the reason my credited contributions seem lopsided. But I've been a contributor for about a year and a half now. By any chance, Is there a concensus of what exactly needs fixing? I'd be happy make these corrections. -DodgeM4S
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: No, there isn't any policy against inviting friends and coworkers -- they'll just be more likely ignored per the <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">Wikipedia:Single purpose account</a> guideline by the administrator making the final decision. So far I've only seen one source that passes the <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">Wikipedia:Reliable source</a> test, the Orlando Business Journal and if you provide at least two more article in the same vein, I'd be willing to change my vote altogether. I don't count the New York Times and VH1 links because they're not articles but movie synopsises that can be self-submitted to the <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Movie_Guide_b038.html" title="All Movie Guide">All Movie Guide</a>. Look, come back in a year or two's time and recreate the article if Dunn produces a film that wins a major film festival award or is distributed nation-wide. My philosophy when it comes to notability is that one is only truly notable when other people are writing about them, not when they write about themselves or have their coworkers or friends do it for them. We have to take a hard-line stance on notability because everything in an encyclopedia has to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. For example, how could any reader ever determine if Dunn really "owns a collection of performance cars and classic automobiles"? How can I accept that anything written in the Trivia section is true or made up? I can't -- because no 3rd parties are constantly providing new information that we can use to scrutinise the article's contents with. We have to take your word alone -- and that's simply unacceptable in an encyclopedia. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 18:56, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Since you raised concerns over the ability to verify the trivia information, I have deleted the section. The bio comes from an official site, so I'd imagine its accurate. <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps you could userfy the article -- get it out of the Wikipedia namespace -- and keep it as a user page until you get it up to snuff. That would stop the single purpose account people, because as <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe">User:Netsnipe</a> says, they will be discounted anyway and the fact your article draws that type to vote ends up making your article look bad rather than helping. <a href="../../../g/b/y/User%7EGBYork_974d.html" title="User:GBYork">GBYork</a> 19:19, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> userfy is Wikipedia slang for moving an article to userspace (which means it's no longer an article in an encyclopedia, but a personal page / article in progress). To do so, copy and paste the original article into a new page called User:Dodgem4s/<i>original_article_name</i>. This means that even if this article is deleted, you can still continue to work on it and when you believe that the article will pass a future AFD review, you are free to move it back into the encyclopedia proper. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 19:30, 23 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Well if its more newspaper sources you need -- that really isn't a problem. They just aren't online any more (most newspapers delete their content after a few months). But I've saved lots of newspaper articles regarding the local film industry. I'm going to UCF to join the film school, but I just a sophomore still (not in the film school yet). I'd be happy to photocopy any of them and mail them to any of the editors. I've been collecting news clipping since 1998 when the Blair Witch Project came out. I've got a ton of stuff on local feature films like Blair Witch, Flora Plum, The Bros., Jurrassic Park III, Alone and Restless, Larry The Cable Guy: Health Inspector, Olive Juice, etc. I've also got articles for the TV shows: Carpocolypse, Sheena, From Earth to the Moon and the Pet Psychic. I know I've got at least 2 articles on Alone and Restless, I think I got one on Black Zone, too. I can Userfy if necessary -- but it would be a lot of work to Userfy all the submissions that are flagged. Which ones would I need to userfy and which ones already meet Wiki guidelines? As for the trivia section -- its almost all cut and pasted off of IMDb. The bio, I cut and pasted off the official site. Perhaps I should cut and paste the content to another Wiki article I've been working on <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a>. Suggestions????? <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>
<p>I would like to point out that WP: VAIN states this: "an article about a little-known musician or band should preferably not be by the musician, a member, or a manager, roadie, groupie, etc. Articles on very little-known subjects are often of debatable value for our readers, so if you write a new article on one it is particularly important to express the facts in a neutral way and as much as possible to cite sources that are credible, neutral, and independent." <b>This policy does not expressly prohibit content on subjects that are considered little-known -- and how many "indie" filmmakers are considered well-known? I think his occupation puts him at a unfair disadvantage. But as per wiki guidelines, even if he is deemed little-known by an administrator that still does not prohibit the content of the above articles</b> The articles are very credible, neutral and independent. ...and any passages to the contrary I would be happy to delete. <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>
<p>I would also like to argue on the grounds WP: PORN BIO -- Why is it so much more difficult for an independent film maker to be considered relavent to Wikipedia than a porn star? Does a Porn Star need 3-4 third party newspaper interviews (since movie synopsis don't count) to be deemed notable and how many porn stars actually have been flagged for the lack of these newspaper articles? <a href="../../../d/o/d/User%7EDodgeM4S_3297.html" title="User:DodgeM4S">DodgeM4S</a></p>

<li><b>Reply:</b> Porn star articles get deleted very frequently I can assure you. You just haven't been participating in other <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_Deletion_f620.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for Deletion</a> to have known about them. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 20:30, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> As I has posted earlier, I gave several examples that all above articles meet the Wikipedia notability articles. I also politely request that you re-read the Wiki notibility guidelines <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, specifically the section that states, "People who satisfy at least one of the items below generally merit their own Wikipedia articles, as there is likely to be a good deal of verifiable information available about them and a good deal of public interest in them. <b>This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted."</b></li>

<li><b>ADDITIONAL NOTES</b> Please keep in mind that these flagged articles were never intended to stand solely by themselves. This content was written as supplemental components to the comprehensive history of the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a> that I've been working on. I'm also concerned that other independent films that I've posted will be flagged and deleted for similar Notability reasons (and wish to protect them now). I wrote submissions for <a href="../../../o/l/i/Olive_Juice_faee.html" title="Olive Juice">Olive Juice</a> and <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walking_Across_Egypt_0dea.html" title="Walking Across Egypt">Walking Across Egypt</a> which like Alone and Restless are not notable mainstream Hollywood films -- yet all were historically important to this area as more Independent Filmmakers choose to shoot here. I plan to continue submitting information on independent film, but I'm a little shocked by all the hostility towards Indie films on Wiki..... Of course, I was also shocked to discover while writing the <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a> page that the locally produced HBO miniseries From Earth to the Moon had no Wiki coverage, either. Don't worry, I'm working on the content for that TV show, too.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>QUESTION</b> So is it all right to list other indepedent film makers, too? I am working on content for prominant local independent filmmaker/actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0860791/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0860791/" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Todd Thompson. Again this submission would be a component to my <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida_Film_Industry_a796.html" title="Florida Film Industry">Florida Film Industry</a> page.</li>
