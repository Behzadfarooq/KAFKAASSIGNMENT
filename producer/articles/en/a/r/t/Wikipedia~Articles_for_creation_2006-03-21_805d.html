<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-21_805d.html" title="Edit section: Axis Dynide (Band)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Axis Dynide (Band)</span></h2>
<p>Axis Dynide are a heavy progressive rock band formed in Sheffield,U.K. August 2005. The band consists of three members who have been playing music together since September 2001 under the old band Ritalin which dissolved because of the lead singers (Will Horton) differences in August 2005. The members of Axis Dynide consist of Tamir Ali (Bass, vocals), Kriss Kinneavy (Guitar, vocals), and Taran Ali (Drums). There music has been compared and described in many different ways. But as the guitarist Kriss sums up quoted from his description comment in <a href="http://www.mp3unsigned.com/showmp3.asp?mp3ID=25443&amp;aid=12138" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mp3unsigned.com/showmp3.asp?mp3ID=25443&amp;aid=12138" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> " The fine line between green slime and purple porridge poured from a chocolate teapot.The details of the angles for this flawed automata were not available at the time of pressing lime brown trousers but damascus was as good a starting point as any.The bonus of this being that the materials for building the foundations took years and days of mulework EVEN during the christmas menstruation. Oh well cant please nobody all the time but you can always try to eat a thousand mangos but make sure you check the warning packaging as allergies can strike when they, not you choose to."</p>
<p>So to translate Axis Dynides music, the music although heavy and tuneful, also has a rather bizzare surreal image to their music at the same time which is seen by many punters as dark and melodical.</p>

<p>There influences are very varied from each other.To summarise, the band are into a wide range of music like blues,jazz, rock,psychedelic,progressive rock,trip-hop,avant-grade,metal(although it would not be so cool to describe some of Axis Dynides influences as metal), and rockabilly. Kriss Kinneavy the guitarist has been compared for his guitar style to the likes of Omar Rodriguez Lopez (The Mars Volta) and Jimi Hendrix in which he admires the most of all the guitarists.The other influences Kriss grew up with are The Doors, Can, The Meteors, and his favourite idol Syd Barrett.</p>
<p>Taran Ali (Drummer), admits his influences mainly range of jazz, rock and ambient music. But in more focus on the drumming aspect, he grew up listening to drummers like Danny Carey (Tool) and Jon Theodore (The Mars Volta). He also greatly learns rudiments and fill tricks from drummers such as Neil Peart (Rush), Bill Bruford (Yes, King Crimson), Steve Gadd (Independent), Lenny White (Return To Forever), and Alan White (Yes).</p>
<p>Tamir Ali (Bassist), shows his influence of bass playing from bands such as Soundgarden and Alice In Chains for the more heavy low bass sound which has frequently been complemented by various reviewers of live gigs. However, he also likes artists such as Frank Zappa and Morphine and is quickly grasping Mark Sandman's (Morphine) unique style of playing.</p>

<p>The band began after the last ever gig with the old formation "Ritalin" when the lead singer suddenly shocked everyone and didn't turn up for the gig in Grapes 11th August 2005. The problems did occur several times in the same year before this certain event happened and the three remaining members of Ritalin had started their own interest around in August when the bands position turned sour. But a month gap was given for the three members Tamir Ali, Kriss Kinneavy, and Taran Ali to write at least several new songs before their first gig in Charters Arms, Rotherham for a charity gig which was set in 16th September 2005.</p>
<p>Since then, Axis Dynide have been gigging at least ten gigs around Yorkshire (U.K.) till the end of 2005 and have made a strong start gaining respect and a unique fair audience.</p>
<p>Axis Dynide are still gigging frequently in the year 2006.</p>

Currently works for the Insane Wrestling Federation based out of Michigan, where he is a two time former cruiserweight champion. He has been voted most hated wrestler of the year on multiple occassions, as fans like to chant "URKEL" when he makes his way to the ring, in reference to his resemblance to the former Family Matters character Steve Urkel. Overall, one of the most entertaining workers you will ever find on the indy circuit and definitely a heat magnet who the fans love to hate.</p>

<p>Edward V was planned to crowned king of England during the War of the Roses ater his father Edward IV died. On the day of the coronation, the mayor’s brother Dr Ralph Shaa revealed to the people of London that Edward IV’s marriage to Edward V’s mother was not legitimate because Edward IV had already signed a pre-marital contact with another women. This made Edward V and his brother illegitimate heirs. Four days later, Richard was crowned king. There has been much controversy over his actions and if it was one lucky coincidence or a brilliant scandal6.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-21_805d.html" title="Edit section: Oodle">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Oodle</span></h2>
<p>The term oodle can be used to denote how much there is of something. It is a commonly held belief that oodle does not relate to a specific amount. It has been recently researched and shown that the most logical amount for oodle to mean is 57. The reasoning behind this may first seem absurd but after carefully analyzing it, it makes perfect sense. The simple reasoning behind it is as follows, oodle cannot be 62 or 83 therefore it must be 57. I know you might think this to be crazy but you must look at it at the right perspective. Oodle is actually a Hindu term for the god of crundles. The word crundle translated to English language means "old crusty lampshade" and crundles are often passed down as family air looms in India and have been for centuries. In India there were as of the year 500, 62 temples that worshipped the god oodle and there were a total of 83 crundles between these temples. When you subtract 62 from 83 you are left with 21. The reason behind doing this is to signify the importance of crundles to Oodle and how extra crundles were sometimes kept incase the others ones were lost. They believed that if they didn't have the crundles their god would abandon them and it would take many years to "create" a new crundle. So we are left with 21 extra crundles. The Ooodle god would use these extra crundles to light up his pantry and basement which would have a hard time seeing in otherwise (he let his worshippers use the other 63 crundles to light up the temples). He designated 3 of the extra crundles to each day of the week for fear of catching his house on fire and burning up all of the crundles at one time. The god crundle also had 19 other lampshades for each crundle incase one of them broke or caught fire. Using this information you can figure out that there were 60 lampshades in his house at any one time and the amount of non crundle lampshades was 57. This number is considered an oodle because talking of 83 or 62 commonly would be considered rude as it would be implied that the crundles were of little importance. The 57 extra lampshades were in fact of little significance and were allowed to be used commonly in the type of expression used to day, for instance "I have oodles of candy". This relates because both the candy and regular lampshades are common and crundles would never be held at such a low regard.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-21_805d.html" title="Edit section: Indira Jocy, a new singer in making in Nepal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Indira Jocy, a new singer in making in Nepal</span></h2>
<p>Indira Jocy</p>
<p><br />
“Do you have the guts to compete?” The advertisement published in newspapers on 2062 Magh attracted her. It was an announcement of a mega television program to hunt singing talents across the country. Indira Jocy, 19, decided to accept the challenge.</p>
<p>Jocy, from Nawalparasee had been living in Kathmandu for studies. A student of 11, she had been singing from early childhood in local programs. She had been acquiring formal musical trainings from DO RE MI music school for some time. Little did she imagine at that time that she would get a national recognition through the program.</p>
<p>When she reached the studios for primary auditions, she could see a never ending queue of aspiring singers. She waited patiently for 6 hours and yet her turn did not come that day. She had to go the next day for her turn. She says,</p>
<p>“ I sang Aruna Lama's “Eklai Basda.” I was bit nervous to sing in front of the judges like Deepak Jungam, Bimala Rai and Aalokshree, but they selected me for the second round.”</p>
<p>She crooned “Udi Jun Bhane” on the second round. When she passed it to be selected amongst 206 from 9000 plus participants through out the country, she sensed some sort of achievement. they had to sing along with music for next round. Despite other participant's advice not to go for a pop number, she tried out “Mayako Baato” by Sugam Pokharel. Till then she was just another face in the crowd but her decision to attempt a different genre of song proved to be fruitful. Not only the organizers and the judges, but even the viewers were taken by storm by her singing that time which made an long lasting impression. Her capability to feel and improvise a song was revealed in that performance. Even an average audience of television could clearly feel her passion for singing, the depth of her voice and modulation.</p>
<p>That was the beginning and came subsequent rounds, she surprised the judges by her sudden improvisation skills and distinctive style of singing. She made the songs sound pleasantly different which attracted the listeners. She secured her place in the top twenty by singing “Mayaluko Maya Meetho” in duet round. She had covered up for her partner's mistake and it was noticed and appreciated by the judges.</p>
<p>By now she was being recognized and stopped by strangers to wish her. She says, “That gave me a feeling of responsibility. I felt that I should work even harder to be able to meet the audience's expectation. To reach the Top Ten, we were supposed to prove ourself in three different types of songs.”</p>
<p>She was a bit laid back till then, but after that, she did her Reeyaz regularly and never missed a class in DO RE MI.</p>
<p>“My teachers Ishwar Amatya and Bhanubhakta Pokharel guided and inspired me”</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
She sang Tara Devi's classic “Ukalee Oraleeharuma” in modern semi classical, Reema Gurung's “Lahuredai” in folk and Naleena Chitrakar's “Gori Kaali” in pop category, came out with flying colors and secured therself in the much coveted Top Ten. The judges had praised her whole heartedly and accepted that she had unlimited potential.</p>
<p>By this time, she was a hot favorite amongst the viewers. Shopkeepers around the town had started to cut and paste her pictures from newspapers in their shops. Her fans had started showering her with emails in the program's id, not only congratulating her but even to propose marriage.</p>
<p>Top Ten were supposed to sing in Aalokshree's new album. After she recorded her own song, “Sayyoun Juni”, Aalokshree said that it was hard to believe she was a new comer. She had performed like a seasoned veteran.</p>
<p>Tope Ten went out for open concerts around Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Banepa. Once again her popularity amongst the crowd was confirmed. Indira Jocy performed in front of thousands of viewers with confidence. Banners and placards with her name could be seen in the crowd. Many came with gift and cards for her. Al the ten were popular but Indira stole the show. After a concert at Bhrikutimandap, Indira had to be escorted away by security to save her from the mass of excited autograph hunters.</p>
<p>When she sang Melawa Devi's 73 years old song “Sawaree mero railaima” in the competition, chief judge Deepak Jungam had said,</p>
<p>“Melawa Devi was a renowned classical singer respected by veteran Indian contemporary singers. This is a very complicated and hard song. Normally other singers can not even attempt this. The way you did justice to it is worth applauding. I am confident that your voice will cover the country from Mechi to Mahakali”</p>
<p>Similarly, when she sang veteran Bimala Rai's “Katai Napaai Timilai”, she had said, “I will learn certain singing techniques from you.”</p>
<p>It was the greatest compliment by the judge for any participant.</p>
<p>Indira Jocy fulfilled the audience's expectation as the competition grew more fierce and reached the Top Five becoming the numero uno between females. As every journey, it came to a halt as well when she was out of the race in To Four. The shocked audience bombarded with e mails and letters, some even threatening to quit watching the program. But Indira Jocy took it gracefully and told her audience, “I will never stop singing. I need your love and support all my life.”</p>
<p>Bimala Rai had exressed her confidennce that Indira would fill the void in Nepali Female singing. Aalokshree admitted that he had rarely heard such a magical voice. The greatest compliment was from the veteran guest judge Prem Dhoj Pradhan,</p>
<p>“For me, you are the real Nepali Tara. I can see a very bright future for you.”</p>
<p>The prediction did not fail. Indira Jocy has been flooded with offers. She has already sung in an album which also features Indian Idol finalists Prajakta Shukre and Rahul Vaidya. Her album “Step-1” is also in the making which is expected to hit the market by February 14, 2006. She has also sung a duet with international star Udit Narayan for veteran film producer Binod Serchan (Of Trishna, Kanyadaan and Badal Pari Fame) for his next venture titled "DUNIYA." Recently she was honored at her hometown by the Nawalarasee Jaycees.</p>
<p>Indira Says, “Nepali Tara made my struggle a lot easier. I am thankful to it. I have just started my journey. My mother is my first inspiration, then my brother Ashok for training me since my childhood. I will always be grateful to Mr.brazesh khanal, who has done a lot to make me what I am today after I met him in Nepali Tara. His never ending support and inspiration played a very vital role to shape me up as what I am today.</p>
<p>An artiste should always be dedicated to the audience. I hope they will love and encourage me forever.</p>
<p>A singing sensation is born thanks to Nepali Tara. Indira Jocy is a true voice of women.</p>
<p>Indira Jocy, the only female contestant reaches the TOP FIVE and becomes the first between female contestants.</p>

<p>Gary A. Klein (born February 5, 1944 in New York, NY) is a research psychologist famous for his work in pioneering the field of naturalistic decision making. By studying experts such as firefighters in their natural environment, he discovered that laboratory models of decision making couldn’t describe decision-making under uncertainty. His Recognition Primed Decision (RPD) model has influenced changes in the ways the Marines and Army train their officers to make decisions. He has also developed methods such as Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) to gather data in complex domains.</p>
<p>Klein received his B.A. in Psychology from CCNY in New York, NY (1964) and his Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology from the University of Pittsburgh (1969). Currently, he is Chief Scientist at Klein Associates.</p>

<p>The heart of Teaching Drum is a year-long wilderness immersion program where students live continuously in a primitive <a href="../../../n/o/r/North_Woods_b333.html" title="North Woods">Northwoods</a> camp replete with <a href="../../../w/i/g/Wigwam.html" title="Wigwam">wigwams</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lean-to.html" title="Lean-to">lean-tos</a> and other primitive structures while learning and applying traditional <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hunter-gatherer.html" title="Hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> crafts and skills such as <a href="../../../t/r/a/Tracking.html" title="Tracking">tracking</a>, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Foraging.html" title="Foraging">foraging</a>, shelter building, <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canoeing.html" title="Canoeing">canoeing</a>, and hide <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tanning.html" title="Tanning">tanning</a>.

<p>In comparison with other wilderness skills schools Teaching Drum has an unorthodox approach. This is reflected in the school’s insistence that it is more of a “Native Lifeway” school than a traditional primitive skills school. The emphasis is on holistic <a href="../../../e/x/p/Experiential_learning.html" title="Experiential learning">experiential learning</a>, spiritual healing, and the development of awareness. This is seen as being more effective than individually learning isolated skills out of context. In fact, heightened awareness is seen as critical to the effective learning and application of wilderness skills.</p>

<p>Approximately 10 staff people also work and live at the school’s administrative center, Nad’mad’ewining. They mainly give support to the year-long program, but also work on wilderness skills, writing, and publishing projects throughout the year.</p>

<p>History and Secret</p>
<p>Saal is a community in the administrative district Northern Pomerania in Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania (Germany). The community is under administration of the small city of Barth. Saal has first been documented in a deed of the city of Barth in the year of 1255. At this time there was an already abandoned Slavic castle by the mouth of the Saal creek into the Saal “bodden”. The population around 1255 consisted of indigenous Slav, migrants from Westphalia and Denmark. The first church already existed and was completely made of wood and sanctified to the “Holy Cross”. From today’s village Tempel, at the time a commandery, knights templar arrived at Saal. The order of knights was in search to expanding Northeast, and had to take provisions securing its continuity as the Holy Land was lost.</p>
<p>The order induced the erection of the church, which until this date dominates impressively the scenery and gives a different impression of Gothic architecture. Everything at this church is characterized by ‘shiftings’: windows, portals. The frayed walls are evidence of both planned or symbolic annexes and continued constructions.</p>
<p>The entry to the underground walkway, behind the altar, can still be seen. It is said to end somewhere by the “bodden”. Underneath the bell tower (1731) standing aside from the actual church, is a hollow space, which however, had never been explored. According to the legend a part of the templar treasure was brought here around 1300. One of the templar stole a part of the treasure and hid it in one of the column foundations. It was said to be the vanished imperial regalia of John Lackland, which he lost in unclear circumstances in 1216.</p>
<p>Until 1309 the templar rebuilt the castle at the „bodden“ and used it as a port facility. Today, only the castle ramparts testify of the once great times. The Vitalian Brotherhood under Stoertebeker (…/succession order of the templar in Portugal) had used the castle until 1391 and are said to have brought the treasure under the bell tower to this place. After they were involved in a fight with the Danes on the Saal bodden, they had to flee and never returned to Saal. The treasure is said to be still somewhere there. Today the templar in Saal are forgotten; only Stoertebeker is sometimes spoken about. Who ever comes to Saal, should not miss visiting an ancient stone circle, the apostle stones.</p>

<p>Situated in the extreme west of Surrey, within a short distance of the Hampshire border, the parish of Normandy includes Wyke, Christmaspie, Willey Green, Pinewood and Flexford. In spite of increasing residential development, this district still remains largely rural in character with agriculture and its associated undertakings as the principal local industry. There are an increasing number of residents finding their employment in Aldershot and Guildford, for which a regular bus service takes about 20 minutes to either town. Some residents commute to London either by rail or road, this taking about 50 minutes. Trains from Wanborough Station (located within the village) connect to Ash and Guildford</p>
<p>Modern development is strictly controlled by the local authority in order to maintain the very attractive natural amenities and to ensure the protection of the Metropolitan Green Belt.</p>
<p>The southern part of the parish lies within a mile of the Hogs Back on the North Downs. The northern part undulates amidst woodlands and commons with its natural charm.</p>

<p>Freienhagen is a quarter of the community whale cover in the Hessian district Waldeck-Frankenberg. To the zone reform in the year 1974, Freienhagen was an independent city; the city rights were already available in the first authentic mention in the year 1253 - it were given probably around 1231. On the Hünenburg, a mountain in the Freienhagener city forest even traces of a prehistoric settlement were found. The original Freienhagen is a relatively regularly constructed place (a main street and two in addition parallel rear streets, that among one another through lanes connected are), on a hill spur arranged to East, that is flowed around by two source streams of the Watter. Worthwhile the defense church built in the late Romany niche and gothic style with rarer onion cupola turned in itself (distorted coffee pot) as well as the many well received, monument marksman of half-timbered houses (Freienhagen lies at the German half-timbering street) are. In the Middle Ages, Freienhagen possessed a closed wall ring with two city gates through which the old trade street from Cologne to Leipzig led. Also historicalally interesting the Freienhagener free court, that met in the Middle Ages first at the Schiebenscheid and later under the linden tree at the Steinborn, is. Under the free count Sigmund Manegold (1435-1455) and Johann Manhoff (1438-1458), the court reaches its largest meaning: the German knight order as well as the cities Frankfurt/main and Cologne are quoted after Freienhagen. In the idyllic Wattertal, it gives was built two water mills, the "lower mill" 1717 of sovereign Friedrich Anton Ulrich to whale cover and is restores costly, with renewed water wheel (ø 5.5 ms). An agriculturally stamped place is the current Freienhagen and prices be itself especially through its forest wealth (situation in the long forest; forest was early head source of income of the city; large share of booking and Buchenmischwäldern) mild attraction climate.</p>

<p>Saal is a community in the administrative district Northern Pomerania in Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania (Germany). The community is under administration of the small city of Barth. Saal has first been documented in a deed of the city of Barth in the year of 1255. At this time there was an already abandoned Slavic castle by the mouth of the Saal creek into the Saal “bodden”. The population around 1255 consisted of indigenous Slav, migrants from Westphalia and Denmark. The first church already existed and was completely made of wood and sanctified to the “Holy Cross”.</p>
<p>From today’s village Tempel, at the time a commandery, knights templar arrived at Saal. The order of knights was in search to expanding Northeast, and had to take provisions securing its continuity as the Holy Land was lost.</p>
<p>The order induced the erection of the church, which until this date dominates impressively the scenery and gives a different impression of Gothic architecture. Everything at this church is characterized by ‘shiftings’: windows, portals. The frayed walls are evidence of both planned or symbolic annexes and continued constructions.</p>
<p>The entry to the underground walkway, behind the altar, can still be seen. It is said to end somewhere by the “bodden”. Underneath the bell tower (1731) standing aside from the actual church, is a hollow space, which however, had never been explored. According to the legend a part of the templar treasure was brought here around 1300. One of the templar stole a part of the treasure and hid it in one of the column foundations. It was said to be the vanished imperial regalia of John Lackland, which he lost in unclear circumstances in 1216.</p>
<p>Until 1309 the templar rebuilt the castle at the „bodden“ and used it as a port facility. Today, only the castle ramparts testify of the once great times. The Vitalian Brotherhood under Stoertebeker (…/succession order of the templar in Portugal) had used the castle until 1391 and are said to have brought the treasure under the bell tower to this place. After they were involved in a fight with the Danes on the Saal bodden, they had to flee and never returned to Saal. The treasure is said to be still somewhere there. Today the templar in Saal are forgotten; only Stoertebeker is sometimes spoken about. Who ever comes to Saal, should not miss visiting an ancient stone circle, the apostle stones.</p>

<p>Billy Brennan is a fictional character from the movie Jurassic Park III, played by Alessandro Nivola. In the movie, Billy is one of Dr. Alan Grant's paleontology students. He is said to be 25 years old at the time of the movie (this information comes from the original Jurassic Park III script).</p>
<p>Billy Brennan represents the modern paleontology, that uses technology and computers, as opossite to classic paleontology and fossil hunting, represented by Alan Grant, who can't stand technology. In the movie, Billy Brennan is helping Alan in his research about the communication abilities of Velociraptors; he even re creates the resonanting chamber of the skull of one of those dinosaurs, thus recreating the sounds made by the animal.</p>
<p>Billy Brennan was left in charge of Grant's field work in Montana when the doctor had to attend a symposium in some unnamed University. Later he joined Grant to Isla Sorna when the Kirbys offered Grant a high reward if he was their guide. The plane crashed against a dinosaur (Spinosaurus), and then into the jungle. Billy escaped alive from that first incident, and also from the attack of Velociraptors that followed. Nonetheless, he made a terrible mistake when he stole two eggs from the nest of the Velociraptors (he wanted to sell them). Therefore, the raptors started chasing Grant, Billy and the Kirbys, trying to get back their eggs.</p>
<p>Later, they entered unknowingly a giant bird cage (the Aviary Canyon). There, they were attacked by a flock of Pteranodon, large, flesh eating flying reptiles. While trying to save Eric Kirby (the son of the Kirbys) from the Pteranodon, Billy got caught by the animals and was viciously mauled. Grant and the Kirbys ran away from the Aviary, Grant believing that Billy was dead.</p>
<p>However, at the end of the movie, we discover that Billy is alive, tough badly injured, and was found by militars sent by Ellie Sattler. Billy had also rescued Alan Grant's hat, a hint to the Indiana Jones movies, where the hat always returns to the hero in the end.</p>
<p>In the original movie script, Billy Brennan was supossed to die, but director Joe Johnston changed that in order to create a happier ending.</p>

<p>Waco Hoover is the musical love child of Larry Grimes known for their catchy songs, intense lyrics, driving guitar lines, and a strong sense of how vast the "real" world can be. Although it is far from mainstream, Waco Hoover's music is not entirely out of touch with the "Pop" world, allowing their songs to be appreciated by a wide and diverse audience. Waco Hoover is home. Their sound is most comparable to that of Dave Matthews Band, Bela Fleck and the Flecktones, Neil Young, and David Gray, but with a style all their own. Their music can be found at www.myspace.com/wacohoover or www.soundclick.com/wacohoover. Waco Hoover - give them a spin.</p>

<p><b>Chow Nasty</b> is a blues-rock trio based in San Francisco, composed of singer/guitarist Damon Harris, bassist Joey Enos, and multi-instrumentalist Zac Hewitt. Formed in Chicago in 2003, the band was created after Enos had expressed interest in starting a group whose songs were based around simple, primal chants. Originally the band included a fourth member, drummer Sven Zeissner, but immigration issues forced him out of the country and the remaining members replaced him with a drum machine, affectionately titled Sven 2.0. Frequently compared to Liquid Liquid, the Make-Up and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Chow Nasty stands apart from most rock groups because of their unique sonic structure, which in addition to the standard guitar and bass includes the aforementioned drum machine, as well as a Farfisa organ, synthesizer, and harmonica, all of which are commandeered by Hewitt.</p>
<p>Harris, Enos, and Hewitt, all native Californians, moved back to their home state at the start of 2004, and quickly gained a reputation as one of the best live acts in the Bay Area and became a favorite of local club bookers who needed strong local support for diverse touring acts, including&#160;!!!, Cameo, Chromeo, MC Hammer, Louis XIV, Very Be Careful, the Bellrays, Death From Above 1979, Morris Day and the Time, the Soledad Brothers, the Ohio Players, and the Eagles of Death Metal.</p>
<p>After opening for Chromeo in San Francisco in July of 2004, the band was asked to play with them the following night in Los Angeles, and the show proved to be wildly important for the young group. In the sparse crowd that night were Peanut Butter Wolf, who was DJing on the bill, and Jeppe Laursen (Senior of Junior Senior). After Chow Nasty's set, Wolf approached the group and expressed admiration for their sound, and asked the group to open for Gary Wilson, the cult musician whose comeback album was being released on Stones Throw. The day after the gig, Laursen called his friend Alexis Rivera, of the management/event production company Echo Park Records, and recommended he check out Chow Nasty. Rivera eventually became their manager in October of 2005, and Laursen would direct their first electronic press kit, or EPK, in March of 2006.</p>
<p>With their strong Bay Area following and a burgeoning LA fanbase, the band spent much of 2005 touring up and down the West Coast, opening an old-school funk show at Concord Pavillion, playing a sold-out show with Junior Senior at Silver Lake club Spaceland, and doing a show at the historic Fillmore in San Francisco. They were also picked to be an official band of popular energy drink Sparks, along with hotly-tipped acts like the Locust and the Fever. In October of 2005 the band shot a video for their song "Ungawa," after being approached by the directing team of Ally and Helder, who'd filmed the clip for "Van Nuys (Es Very Nice)" by Los Abandoned. In November the band hooked up again with Peanut Butter Wolf, and he agreed to produce their debut album.</p>
<p>In January of 2006 the video for "Ungawa" had release dance parties at Mighty in San Francisco (sponsored by humor weekly The Onion) and at Little Pedro's in Los Angeles (sponsored by online hip-hop site Fusicology), each night featuring a performance by Chow Nasty as well as a line-up of local DJs, including Wolf, who spun at both shows. "Ungawa" proved to be a popular song online, where the track appeared on numerous audioblogs including Fluxblog and Gorilla Vs. Bear, and in the LA club scene, where it was spun by Peaches and JD Samson of Le Tigre. The press response to Chow Nasty quickly blossomed, and the SF Weekly described the group as "Sweet jams and beats that go boom, it's 21st century soul music as played by three kids with A.D.D. and a cursory knowledge of Radio Shack electronics," and the SF Bay Guardian commenting that their "Infectiously goofy, balls-out shows come off like some kind of underage, oversexed punk b-boy Rolling Stones revival."</p>
<p>In March of 2006 the group recorded their debut album at Prairie Sun Studios, the rural ranch recording spot that's a favorite of Tom Waits. Featured on the album is the track "I Was Wrong," a duet between Harris and Lisa Kekaula, singer of the Bellrays and Grammy-winning vocalist with Basement Jaxx. The same month Chow Nasty was selected to headline the annual happy hour show as part of the weeklong San Francisco music festival Noise Pop Festival.</p>

<p>Countries have revolution usually because of a vast change in power structure. This basically means that the country is not happy with the way it is being ruled so they want a change in government and a new leader to be elected. This sometimes means that instead of having a King/Queen and a Prime Minister they would change to have a President. This is called a Political Revolution. There are religious revolutions for example in France instead of having a absolute monarchy, they had a republicanism replaced instead.</p>

<p>The Fulton Street El was an Elevated Railroad built by the Union Elevated Rairoad and leased to the Brooklyn Elevated Railroad for operation. Later these companies combined as the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad. In 1900 The Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad was absorbed in to the BRT (Brooklyn Rapid Transit), and its later the BMT (Brooklyn Manhattan Transit), successor to the BRT. The lined serviced neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens from the 1880’s until the 1950’s.</p>
<p>The Elevated originally started at two seprate terminuses, one at Park Row and Manhattan, and one at Sands Street in Brooklyn. From their the line proceeded down Fulton Street in to Brooklyn. In the 1910’s during the Dual Contracts of both the IRT and and BMT lines, the Fulton Street El was extended down Fulton Street in to eastern sections of Brooklyn and eventually down Pitkin and Liberty Avenues in to Ozone Park, Queens were it terminated at Lefferts Avenue.</p>
<p>The Els demise came in the form of the IND Fulton Street Subway which was built in the 1936, and directly paralled the El from Sands Street station to the Rockaway Avenue station in Brooklyn. On the day that New York City acquired all the properties of the BMT and the IRT, June 1, 1940, service from Fulton Ferry and Park Row to Rockaway Avenue was abandoned. Service remained from Rockaway Avenue to Lefferts Avenue in which lead to an interesting oddity. Commuters from Queens and Eastern Brooklyn would have to ride the remaining portion of the El to Rockaway Avenue and then get off their trains and transfer to the IND subway at Rockaway Avenue to continue on in to Manhattan, a major inconvenience. According to nyssubway.org "There was also a 14th Street-Fulton service, which ran from 8th Avenue IND subway in Manhattan via the 14th Street Canarsie line to the Atlantic Avenue station in which the Canarsie El, Fulton Street, and the Broadway Jamaica Els all convened together. From there trains switched onto the Fulton Street El to Lefferts Avenue (later Boulevard). There was a non-rush hour cutback of El service to Eastern Parkway in 1952, with Rockaway Avenue served in rush hours only."</p>
<p>During the Post War years the subway under Fulton Street was extended reaching the Atlantic Avenue station in 1948 and later to Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn. Another planned extension would take the subway right under the remaining portion of the El on Liberty Avenue in Queens, making the rest of the El obsolete. However, in 1955 the transit authority took over the Long Island Railroads Rockaway line and was anxious to connect it to the IND Eighth Avenue/Fulton Street Line. Spending much of it money renovating the Rockaway line, the city decided to connect the Fulton Street Subway with the remaining portion of the El. On April 26, 1956, a connection was opened from the IND Fulton Street Subway line at Euclid Avenue to the Fulton Street El at the 80 Street/Hudson Avenue station, and the "A" train began running via this connection through to Lefferts Boulevard. The section from Rockaway Avenue to Hudson Avenue was then abandoned and torn down. Two months later, the connection from Rockaway Blvd. to the old LIRR Rockaway branch was opened and IND service to the Rockaway began.</p>
<p>Today the Fulton Street El section over Liberty Avenue in Queens from the 80th Street/Hudson Avenue Station to Lefferts Boulevard is all that remains of the Fulton Street El.</p>

<p>The Strike Team is an elite group of LA police officers featured on the FX cop drama The Shield. Based off the real-life <a href="../../../c/r/a/CRASH_cef2.html" title="CRASH">CRASH</a> gang unit, the Strike Team consisted of corrupt LAPD cops who utilized various morally-questionable tactics to bring in criminals at the cost of their own morality. The Strike Team was created by Shawn Ryan.</p>
<p><br />
<b>== Origins ==</b></p>
<p>The Strike Team is a brutal, four-man task force created to combat gang-related crimes in the fictional LA neighborhood of Farmington (The Farm). The ST served as a sort of first-wave assault team for the neighborhood's experimental Farmington Division (The Barn). In reality, the Strike Team was created by crooked Assistant Chief Ben Gilroy as a vehicle for his friend Detective Vic Mackey (also giving Mackey the authority to recruit his own teammates for the team) and through which he can carry out his malicious plans. Its members consist of:</p>
<p>[[-<a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Vic_Mackey_9208.html" title="Detective Vic Mackey">Detective Vic Mackey</a></p>
<p>-Detective Shane Vendrell</p>
<p>-Detective Curtis "Lemonhead" Lemansky</p>
<p>-<a href="../../../d/e/t/Detective_Ronnie_Gardocki_e160.html" title="Detective Ronnie Gardocki">Detective Ronnie Gardocki</a>]]</p>
<p>-Detective Tavon Garris (former member, inactive)</p>
<p>-Detective Armando "Army" Renta (Former member, resigned membership) -Detective Terry Crowley (former member, deceased)</p>
<p><b>== Trauma ==</b></p>
<p>The Strike Team was a guise for its members' use of corrupt police tactics to inflict their own type of street justice and/or for their own advancements. Suspicious of their motives, then-Captain David Aceveda recruited Detective Terry Crowley to join the Strike Team to expose them for corruption.When members Detective Mackey and Vendrell discovered this, Mackey killed Crowley. Since then, the Strike Team used increasingly more morally-ambigious methods to bust criminals, blurring the line of cop, criminal, and vigilante. At the end of Season Two, the Strike Team succeeded in ripping off an Armenian Mob Money Train. The aftershocks of this carried over into Season Four. The season chronicled the various personal and professional consequences that troubled the Strike Team as a result. Among them included Detective Tavon Garris getting taken off duty thanks to Detective Vendrell's jealousy and racism and the threat of Armenian hitman Margos Dezerian who was sent to kill them once their involvement in the Money Train ripoff was revealed. Despite Detective Mackey's success at eradicating Margos' threat, he couldn't prevent the Strike Team from falling apart, the aftermath of a falling-out between Vendrell and Lemansky and Mackey. (Due to his failed efforts at trying to bust the Strike Team, Aceveda planted a type of fail-safe device that declared if one person left the mostly four-man Strike Team, the team was forced to disband. In this case, that man was Detective Lemansky.) Vendrell transferred to another division were he gained a new partner, Armando "Army" Renta, and a successful career while Mackey and Gardocki were assigned to surveillance duty and Lemansky to aiding juveniles. However, Mackey succeeded in convincing new Farmingto Division Captain Monica Rawling and the other former Strike Team members including newcomer Army to come back to Farmington. When Vendrell's connection to drug lord Antwon Mitchell became clear, it was decided that the Strike Team was to be reactivated to keep an eye on Shane. Eventually, due to his lack of handling the corrupt lifestyle of the group, Army resigned from the Strike Team.</p>
<p><br />
<b>== Enemies ==</b></p>
<p>The Strike Team's corrupt police work make them the enmity of anyone they come across, including other cops. But their most notable threats included:</p>
