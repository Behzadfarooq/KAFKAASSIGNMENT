Despite what you may have been told, it is <b>not true</b> that everyone who shows up to a deletion discussion gets an automatic vote just for showing up.</p>
<p>The deletion process is designed to determine the consensus of opinion of Wikipedia editors; for this reason comments from users whose histories do not show experience with or contributions to Wikipedia are traditionally given less weight and may be discounted entirely.</p>
