<li><b>Speedy deletion</b>, since this one has already been deleted three times. If that was not the right decision (and I see that it was by no means a swiftly reached or full consensus, so there's probably room for argument there), the proper way to deal with that is bringing that up at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">Deletion review</a>, not by recreating the article repeatedly again under a slightly different name in the hopes that no one notices. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 06:51, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> deletion review sounds like a good idea - the current version of the article does have better sources, but there are large falsifiability issues. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 09:29, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Article needs to be debted. It is fair to advance deletion till we reach a consensus on the present form, which is different from the ones before. <a href="../../../p/r/a/User%7EPrashanthns_c87b.html" title="User:Prashanthns">Prashanthns</a> 11:15, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>The author asserts that the theory is "very popular in the autistic community" and then jumps into original research. 65 hits on Google Scholar, none of them really pertinent. Unless the author proves that the theory has a signifigant number of followers, <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilatus_9ccf.html" title="User:Pilatus">Pilatus</a> 12:26, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Original research it was, and original research it continues to be. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 16:18, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as OR. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarol_Langner_26da.html" title="User:Karol Langner">Karol</a> 17:13, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> of course; may be speedyable due to continued recreation. However, I note that the article is moving towards a discussion of genetic evidence Neanderthal-human interbreeding, which is a much more scientific topic (right now). If the author wanted to write an article on Evidence for human-Neanderthal interbreeding, and if that article contained a sentence that said, "the idea that such interbreeding is responsible for autism has some support within the autistic community, although no scientific research yet suggests that this is the case.", then I would consider that a reasonable nod to the "theory" that would be appropriate to WP. Until such time as the "theory" has any smidgeon of scientific support, however, it does not deserve its own article. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> 19:39, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Suggestion</b>. I agree with <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> (above). The article could be moved to <a href="http://academia.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://academia.wikicities.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">another wiki</a>. --<a href="../../../j/w/s/User%7EJWSchmidt_1173.html" title="User:JWSchmidt">JWSchmidt</a> 19:56, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> but this appears to be a treasur that someone just can't live without on Wikipedia. Even if one drives the silver spike of death into it, its sure to resurface again. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 20:24, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I still not only think that it's original research, but that no other minority group would stand for being spoken of in the same way. However, this time around that's all I will say. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 21:44, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> original research. The current article provides four citations to support it: however, the two that are from reputable sources are irrelevant (they concern only the possibility of human-Neanderthal interbreeding, with no reference to autism in any way), and the two that discuss autism are both apparently unpublished original research on personal websites. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a soapbox. The authors are welcome to come back when they have some evidence that this theory has any acceptance in any circles whatsoever. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:08, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> as re-creation. It is technically re-written, but is substantially the same description of the same theory by (one assumes) the same user or someone in collaboration with him/her, and unquestionably meets the spirit of CSD:G4. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 01:05, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm voting delete too, but to be fair I think I should point out that this is not the same user (I checked) and that this version of the page at least includes a "controversy" section, which the others did not, if I remember correctly. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 01:41, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The mere fact of a theory's existence makes it notable enough for inclusion. It is clear that someone somewhere has come up with this theory (otherwise there wouldn't have been an article written in the first place) and thus, regardless of whether the theory itself is valid or not, it does exist. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 01:29, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Seriously? So if I come up with a theory -- for example, right now, my theory is that people don't always think the full implications of their statement through before making them, which I hereby dub the Theory of People Going Off Half-Cocked -- that means it's notable enough for inclusion? So if I were to actually create the article (or, for the sake of argument, got someone else to do it for me), that would automatically make it notable and a valid addition to Wikipedia, simply because someone thought it up and took the ten minutes to write it down? I must disagree. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 02:27, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Considering how manyh "articles" get written every day around here that are deemed personal essays or original research, I'm going to have to disagree with you. The precise reason why those policies exist is so that we don't waste valuable space discussing a view held by one person or a very small group of people. <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_8a0c.html" title="User:Jacqui M Schedler"><font color="#663366">Jacqui</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacqui_M_Schedler_92a1.html" title="User talk:Jacqui M Schedler">★</a> 15:22, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</sup></li>
