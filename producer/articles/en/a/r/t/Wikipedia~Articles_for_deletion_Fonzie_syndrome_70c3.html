<p>The text and the premise are rampant violations of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - As much as i violently disagree with Wikipediatrix's heavy-handedness and tendency for unilateralism, she has a point - although i would say it's a genuine phenomenon not "contrived". <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPMA_64d9.html" title="User:PMA">PMA</a> 18:59, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Weak keep</s></b>. I believe the term is used offhandedly in Jon Hein's book regarding Kramer, suggesting to me that it existed independently outside of Wikipedia. Someone would have to Nexis the work of most TV critics to really make sure. Also, I would really like it if Wikipediatrix didn't use the same abusive text for all these nominations. It leads me to further doubt her <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> (is it really necessary to stick your own vote in when you made the nomination? That makes it look personal). Although, I admit this is a bit more open-ended and could quarrel with some of the entries (I would never have described Sipowicz, ever, as a supporting character), that's what we have editors and talk pages for. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 19:09, 20 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's nothing "abusive" about what I said about this article. Sorry if it rubbed you the wrong way for whatever reason. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 19:52, 20 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There's everything abusive about it. Using both "contrived" and "made-up" is redundant and unnecessary as they both mean the same thing here (especially when they modify "neologism," which implies the same thing). The only reason to do it is when the writer or speaker feels one word does not adequately convey the depth of their negative feelings, cf. "international world Jewry", as used by antisemites.
<p>Further, reusing the same text for another nomination suggests some sort of grander agenda (which, to be fair, you've copped to elsewhere).</p>

<li><b>Neutral Comment</b>. In regards to Daniel Case's suggestion about a Nexis search, I was actually crazy enough to search for "fonz! syndrome" in the <i>News, All (English, Full Text)</i> database and found a single story, from <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orange_County_Register_03f1.html" title="The Orange County Register">The Orange County Register</a>. That 2000 story used the term "Fonzie Syndrome" to refer to actors who become identified to a single role that made them famous. I hope this helps. --- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">talk</a></sup> 01:22, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I, too, have tried to find secondary sources that describe the purported syndrome described by this article. Unfortunately, most (of the few) web pages on this subject are like <a href="http://alanphipps.blogspot.com/2006_04_16_alanphipps_archive.html" class="external text" title="http://alanphipps.blogspot.com/2006_04_16_alanphipps_archive.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a> in that they <i>cite Wikipedia as their source</i>. (Others turn out to be simple non-GFDL-compliant mirrors of Wikipedia.) The article cites no sources. Editors have argued on <a href="../../../f/o/n/Talk%7EFonzie_syndrome_eab6.html" title="Talk:Fonzie syndrome">Talk:Fonzie syndrome</a> over what the syndrome actually is, but not a single source defining it has been cited on that talk page, and requests for sources for any of this have remained unanswered there. Editors have claimed that this concept existed prior to the Wikipiedia article, but no sources have been presented to demonstrate that. The <i>Orange County Register</i> story (Barry Koltnow. "Shaft, first and forever: Actor Richard Roundtree reprises the role that made him famous in the 1971 action film.", <i>Orange County Register</i>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_15.html" title="July 15">07-15</a>.) is, as <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> says, about <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Roundtree_5140.html" title="Richard Roundtree">Richard Roundtree</a> with the reference to Fonzie syndrome apparently being nothing more than about the strong association of certain actors with their most popular rôles. That is nothing like the syndrome discussed in this article. This therefore appears to be <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. <s><b>Delete</b></s>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:29, 21 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I defer to UncleG here and accordingly acquiesce in the deletion of this article as presently constituted, or (what I would still prefer) a <b>redirect</b> to Continuity issues with characters in episodic media, as I proposed on Wikipediatrix's talk page. My concerns about her and what I see as her insufficient commitment to <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIV_e5ff.html" title="WP:CIV">civility</a> still stand, however. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 18:57, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>On second thought, per <a href="../../../f/o/n/Talk%7EFonzie_syndrome_eab6.html#Breakout_characters_in_television_fiction" title="Talk:Fonzie syndrome">Wikipediatrix's own suggestion</a>, can we consider <b>renaming</b> this to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">Breakout character</a>?

<ul>
<li>Well done with the research! That's the sort of use of Google (to locate actual source material, rather than merely to count hits) that we need editors to do more of. Looking at the sources, you appear to have a fairly verifiable definition of what a breakout character is (albeit that there's probably a better source available than that), and two verifiable instances of breakout characters. That addresses the concern of original research, since now editors and readers can confirm that the concept discussed by the (proposed rewritten) article exists outside of Wikipedia and has gained traction in the world at large. I therefore change to <b>rename and heavily rewrite</b> to be about <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">breakout characters</a>, as per the sources located (and whatever further sources editors locate). You'll have to refactor the introduction quite drastically; and you'll have to start the list of characters from scratch, but you have sources for three (Barney, Fonzie, and Clouseau) already. I strongly recommend requiring that every character in the list be accompanied by a source acknowledging xem to be a breakout character. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

It can't just be another free-for-all where people say "oh, Shaggy's my favorite <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scooby-Doo_627a.html" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a> character, I think I'll add him to the list." <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 15:51, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't see anything there that counts as original research, and it's decently well-footnoted in proportion to its length.<a href="../../../k/a/s/User%7EKASchmidt_2aaf.html" title="User:KASchmidt">KASchmidt</a> 19:24, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">Breakout character</a>, a better term. Remove all uncited examples. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 19:56, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>, who's making all these Syndromes up?it's not making Wikipedia more credible. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarminnetje_9db2.html" title="User:Marminnetje">Marminnetje</a> 03:04, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">Breakout character</a>. Yes, who's making up all these Syndromes? Just because <i>one</i> character, <i>one</i> (re)casting situation, or <i>one</i> writing out of a character is odd, noticeable, or notable, why do editors insist on coining a <i>syndrome</i> based on that single event and playing a parlour game to add in supposedly similar events from other shows. Spate of these articles on wikipedia. We'll have to watch out for the multi examples creeping in to <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">Breakout character</a> though. <a href="../../../a/s/a/User%7EAsa01_2b1b.html" title="User:Asa01">Asa01</a> 19:53, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../b/r/e/Breakout_character.html" title="Breakout character">breakout character</a>; the term is both more neutral and more widespread, per research above; do not keep on its own. Well spotted. -- <a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae'blis</a> <i><sub><a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">(talk)</a></sub></i> 19:58, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
