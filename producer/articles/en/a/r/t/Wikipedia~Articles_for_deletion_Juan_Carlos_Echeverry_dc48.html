<li><b>Comment</b> - neither of these articles are critiques at all. They are summaries of his career progression from Bogota to Europe and his first job in Paris. Now, if all performers who have signed a contract with the Paris opera (which one?) are notable, then this guy should have an article. If not, then there is nothing in these sources to indicate this singer is notable. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:59, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - The short of it is, this guy is just starting his career, and I see nothing extraordinary. The article, makes it clear that he exists and that he's had two articles written about him in the Colombian press. He has made no records, taken no leading roles in major productions, and he has received no critical reviews from the opera press. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:36, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To the contrary of popular musicians, classic musicians just don't disappear into oblivion after starting their career with positive critiques, and there is more than one notable classical musician who has not yet made a record... and I can't remember any classical music being in the top 100 of any chart since Miguel Rios' adaptation of the final chorus of Beethoven's 9th. And opera press, who are they? <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 17:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The question is, who writes the positive critique? Has the subject generated any buzz within the opera community? It boils down to whether or not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> say this guy is any good. Just as there are well respected book, movie, and theatre critics, there are also well respected opera critics. They are the ones who should determine whether or not this guy is notable, and we haven't heard word one from them. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 18:04, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I agree.

Very hard to me to understand where is a lack of information and/or opera critic's articles. We have at least two from the very respected critics from el El Espectador and El Tiempo. I am afraid you don't like latino opera singers at all&#160;:))) Is it? Anyway, according to the rules article can be kept, nevertheless it can be added or improved.

<li><b>Answer</b> - I don't try to disqualify anybody here, but it is really interesting, that only two professional photographers are criticizing an article about opera singer. Nevertheless, I asked two agencies in Paris and Geneva two send me additional press kit about him. I a going to improve the article with significant information. Back to the rules, there are clearly stated all conditions to post the article. He already meets more then only ONE condition.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - I see. So first you claim the two authors were reputable critics, and now you make no such claim? Next, would you mind telling us which criteria this person has satisfied so far? Finally, anyone who reads Wikipedia's rules can check to see if an article satisfies those rules. At present, I see nothing to indicate this biography satisfies those rules. I will be happy for the singer if indeed he is worthy of an article. I will be just as happy to see his article removed if he is not. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 00:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Question</b> - what roles has this subject actually sung in concert with the Paris opera? The second source indicates he hasn't sung anything in concert at all. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 01:05, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>weak keep</b> The roles are listed in the third paragraph under "education and profession" It would have been preferable to add the reviews in the first place--apparently it is not yet generally understood that a WP article needs sources. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> vague claims for roles (performed where, when, and for whom?) may be enough to prevent a speedy delete, but this is an AfD and those statements aren't supported by the sources. While it may not be commonly understood by novice editors that articles need sources (or biographical subjects should be notable), the article was first tagged for sources. It was later prodded with both the sources and notability problems clearly highlighted. Both these tags were ignored and deleted by the creating editor. In short, he/she was well advised prior to this AfD, and the article still lacks reliable, verifiable sources. Remember, the one "source" provided lists two improperly cited articles (it's not even a secondary source). The other source is the OIA and does nothing to verify most of the claims made in the article. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 04:32,</dd>

</li>
</ul>
<p>28 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles are indicated in the web page of the agency. I checked other articles about other tenors. Most of are written in same way. Why we are not going to overwrite those articles? Maybe we should revise whole contributions about opera? Article should remain, even to give the chance to improve it. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVeritaRTs_db30.html" title="User:VeritaRTs">User:veritaRTs</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - this is a <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">WP:SPA</a>. The point I'm making above, is that while the OIA lists the performer's repertoire, it says nothing about if or where these roles were actually performed. The remaining articles are only partially credited reprints of (possibly) real articles – but none of them list any of his performances, either. <a href="../../../r/k/l/User%7ERklawton_a730.html" title="User:Rklawton">Rklawton</a> 16:55, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
