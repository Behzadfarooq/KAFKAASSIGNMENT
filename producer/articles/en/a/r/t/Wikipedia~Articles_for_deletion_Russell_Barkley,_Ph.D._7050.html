<dd>Thats actually my view on this process anyhow: the copyvio outweighs the afd.

<li><b>Comment</b> As both the author and subject of this biographical sketch, there was no intent to deceive anyone in its submission, as one commentator insinuates above. This is the sketch that appears on my own website and in my books. And it is hardly "stupid" to submit such a sketch by oneself provided the statements are factual and verifiable. Isn't that the transparency you want in such matters? Should one use a disguised name as the comment above suggests? That would be the height of stupidity and also unethical would it not? It may be on WebMD because I wrote it and they asked my permission to use it with reference to articles I assisted them with about ADHD any myself. All statements in the biographical sketch are statements of fact and readily verifiable. Submission of a curriculum vitae can be provided to provide verification, unless you are implying that I have fabricated my vita. Remove the entry if you wish, but entering my name into Google results in more than 80,000 hits. Should not Wikipedia have at least some entry? Kindly tell me, despite all hyperbole, what statements in the sketch are not statements of fact. My education? My professional positions? My 200 pubications? My more than 20 books? My professional awards? My TV and other appearances? Your snide comments aside, make your case with specifics. Russell A. Barkley, Ph.D. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Barkleyr (<a href="../../../b/a/r/User_talk%7EBarkleyr_6082.html" title="User talk:Barkleyr">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Barkleyr_0a44.html" title="Special:Contributions/Barkleyr">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li>Prof. Barkley (assuming it is you), after doing a google search, I have no doubt on your notability (I changed my position after initially thinking the article as a hoax). An article on you is definitely possible. However, the article you created was directly copied from WebMD, and there was no clear proof of the copyright permission from WebMD. The <a href="http://www.webmd.com/content/biography/8/95770" class="external text" title="http://www.webmd.com/content/biography/8/95770" rel="nofollow">page</a> where it was taken from shows a copyright notice from WebMD and that all rights are reserved. It is not possible for wikipedia to use such copyrighted material, without WebMDs permission to release it under <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>. As for your question of creating the entry, it is common for people to become suspicious when someone creates an entry for them. Wikipedias official guidelines discourage people from writing about themselves. See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a>. Also, I'm quoting from <a href="../../../b/i/o/Wikipedia%7EBiographies_of_living_persons_cfbe.html#Dealing_with_articles_about_yourself" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons#Dealing_with_articles_about_yourself</a>:</li>

<dd>So, you are welcome to correct the articles facts, but getting involved in writing about yourself is not considered a good thing.

So, don't let the AfD become a big issue, this is about the original article, not about you as a person. The original article was a <a href="../../../c/p/_/WP%7ECP_e7b9.html" title="WP:CP">copyvio</a>, so a non-copyvio article will definitely be created.

<li><b>Reply</b> Thanks, Ragib. I am the Russell Barkley in the bio. that was submitted. Your information is helpful in understanding this decision. I had not read the specific requirements under Autobiography and therefore would have understood this issue better. I appreciate your thoughtful and courteous response and the details on which it is based rather than the earlier sarcasm that seemed to permeate other comments. And I would not want copyright to be violated even though I am the author of the WebMD bio. sketch as well. Let's just withdraw the submission. By the way, self-promotion was not the issue (I am nearly retired now so that is of less consequence to me). Instead, I had read of the misrepresented bio sketch at Wikipedia for Siegenthaler and how it had been altered erroneously about him by others (as a joke, no less). I have my own critics, as you are no doubt aware if you searched the web about me, including Scientologists so the bio I submitted was more as a pre-emptive effort to place correct information before the public. I will continue to update your ADHD entries as time permits in hopes of giving them more accuracy and balance. The initial entry I read was a bit lopsided around supporting nutritional solutions for ADHD, which are not well-supported, and was rather naive about the recent findings concerning neuro-imaging and genetics. Thanks again for your reply. Russ Barkley, Ph.D.</li>
<li><b>keep</b>. all it needs is a fix in the title and a major copyedit. google shows that russell barkley is a controversial figure in the world of ADHD. he's been interviewed by Frontline and he's written books on the subject. i see no reason why an article shouldn't exist about him. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingturtle_613d.html" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> 06:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
