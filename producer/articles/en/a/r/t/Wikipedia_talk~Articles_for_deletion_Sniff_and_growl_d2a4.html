<p>It doesn't matter that it <i><b>exists</b></i>. My back yard exists. That still doesn't mean it merits an encyclopedia article.

<li>Accusations of sockpuppetry and poor ethics aside, I think it'd be a good idea to use this article's talk page for any further discussion not directly related to arguments for/against the article. It's getting <i>really</i> long. I've got half a mind to do this with all of the chatter on this page, but I don't know if I've got the patience to separate the wheat from the chaff. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>â†”<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 00:25, Apr 2, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>If you're going to repeatedly make accusations then you have to back them up. Otherwise it's idle speculation to support your overly personal attachment to this action. And your addition of inflamatory accusations is outrageous. It's very curious how much time you're spending monitoring and editing this page. At any rate, how do you respond about your posting this on a message board to gather false votes of support? 24.5.64.248</li>

<li>It's not an accusation, it's a fact. Go compare the IP address for Rienzo with his rap sheet. This guy not only is a sock puppet who for all we know cast the very votes you see in this thread just to discredit the entire entry. -- he has a history of rewriting people's web pages and creating false charges against people. These are not MY "allegations" they are very rulings of the Wikipedia administrators. Read it all for yourself. This guy is leading you as much as he's leading me. I already said that I'd be fine with this wiktionaried. Said I wasn't fine with people usign google as a criteria. Don't know where the rest of this contentious bologna came from. If you go back and read all my comments you'll see I'm not even asking anybody for a defense so I have no incentive to wage a "campaign" though I asked a couple of friends (who know sniff and growl) to check the page out (certainly not 7 people) I took issue with a summary non-notability. If anything, because this entry is by its very nature a definition, I supported moving it on the outset. <b>Sniffandgrowl</b> 01:00, 2 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was a bit suprised here, but apparently Rienzo is already known for Forgery of Evidence. Yes! In addition to frequently writing anti-gay slurs on web pages, he's also a forger!!!

<li>Wiki people: I don't even know how it got this far. I really don't give a fart about proving this article any more than I can. It exists, it's notable, but probably not as notable as Pokemon, and well, while I think people are too fast on the delete button, I also had no idea it would get this contentious to argue AGAINST deleting. Do what you will and I'll obviously respect it. As for this OTHER crap, I have no idea what Rienzo's malfunction is (aside that he's a proven hatemonger and page vandal by the wiki admins) or even if he's accusing the right guy. I'm not responsible for what other actions anybody else here may have taken.</li>

I do ask that you consider Wiktionary. Otherwise, there's ZERO hard feelings here, other than a minor misunderstanding on a few points.
