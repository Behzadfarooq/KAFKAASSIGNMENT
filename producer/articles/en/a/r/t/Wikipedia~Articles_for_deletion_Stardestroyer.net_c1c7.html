<p><b>Keep</b> It is obvious that revprez is doing this because of personal reasons, not because of an actual fault with the article that he has vandalised several times. Ubiquitous ALI_G.</p>
<p><b>Keep</b> Stardestroyer.net is a specialist sight which would not be interesting to some one other than if they were looking for information on the startrek v starwars debate. There for it would pointless to advertises this site and there for it is my belief that the page in question dose not constitute advertising. It also may give vital information to some one confused by the purpose of stardestoryer.net and as such should be allowed to stay. 81.153.150.165 21:15, 28 May 2005</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I also urge any admin considering this VfD to review Revprez's edit histories. He has repeatedly vandalized the page that this VfD is being conducted on as well as the Star Trek vs Star Wars page. He is carrying out a vendetta against SD.net and SB.com for having been banned from those forums. This is a personal vendetta for Revprez and he is using Wikipedia as his tool to try and hurt other forums. <a href="../../../a/l/y/User%7EAlyeska_8737.html" title="User:Alyeska">Alyeska</a> 20:46, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep.</b> - The site is widely reknowned for it's objective stances on the SW vs. ST debate. I am in agreement that touting the forum on a wiki entry may be a bit much, but SDN is what it is and what it has always been. That is, a vast storehouse of SW and ST knowledge compiled over several years from several knowledgeable sources.Chardok 19:37, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep. I am convinced that Revprez is nominating this article as a vendetta against Stardestroyer, and I think that Stardestroyer is a notable website, particularly because of its very active forums. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EAcademic_Challenger_1bc6.html" title="User:Academic Challenger">Academic Challenger</a> 23:46, 28 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment:</b> It should be noted that I was banned from SDN for trollish behavior, as well as from three other forums where I've trolled in discussions related to religion and politics. I guess in the experience of some posting here, that means I should hold a grudge or something. But even Darkstar has to admit that SDN of the most informative sites related to the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> debate; his site wouldn't be up if it weren't. It continues that rare tradition in fan culture of examining beloved content with an empirical eye. If <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Technical_Commentaries_8152.html" title="Star Wars Technical Commentaries">SWTC</a> has had an impact on the debate noteworthy of its own page, then SDN may deserve its own as well. And the boards likewise lend themselves to rich discussion; there's nothing else out there that comes close in SDN's category. So I have no idea where all this "vendetta" crap is coming from. Still, the entry as stands doesn't even pass the laugh test. It's a vain, self-serving promotion. I've tried to work out the POV issues, but if people keep reverting it to the same old crap rather than expanding the stub then I don't see why it should stay. I don't intend to revert it back; the opening hook I wrote is in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> now. The question is whether the article is salvageable. <s>With that, I'm changing my vote to <b>weak keep</b>.</s> --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevprez_167e.html" title="User:Revprez">Rev Prez</a> 06:03, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>On second thought, I'm changing my vote to <b>delete</b>.</s> The entry is five paragraphs. The half of the second paragraph is an explanation of the SDN abbreviation, and the other half lists Michael Wong's fanfiction (is it customary to advertise individual fanfics?). The fifth paragraph ends with a sentence (there are, again, only two) that simply restates the third paragraph--which in turn restates a fragment in the opening hook. The fourth paragraph--yet again another two sentence number--is half "Michael Wong likes Star Wars" and "AOTC:ICS supports SW over ST"; the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a> article already discusses this. So really, what additional information of value follows the first paragraph? --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevprez_167e.html" title="User:Revprez">Rev Prez</a> 08:07, 29 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You come here and you exclusivley target SDnet and pages related to it for massive deletions of text, without discussing it in the talk pages of the entries. When people ask you to come to the talk pages you ignore it and continue rampant deletion, and slap a VfD on the page to continue this. When you're reported for vandalism of the page in question you go to the Vandalism in Progress page, and edit the entry (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=14357364&amp;oldid=14357316" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress&amp;diff=14357364&amp;oldid=14357316" rel="nofollow">seen here</a>), changing it's report from one agaisnt you to one against the person who reported you. Then when you get called on this you come here you admit to being banned because you were a troll, and yet claim you have no vendetta even though you came back there with sock puppets, twice.

<dd>Do you want to list any specific instance where I've vandalized the SDN page, or any evidence whatsoever that this VfD was started in bad faith? No? I didn't thinkso. But with all the bitching going on amongst the SDN members, you'd think SDN would send over people with a larger vocabulary than "the," "Revprez" and "vendetta." --<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevprez_167e.html" title="User:Revprez">Rev Prez</a> 14:05, 30 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - "That better be my last vote change" or what? Seriously, I'm looking back over the entry and besides the opening hook I see little more than a brief restatement of the STvSW article, some stuff about Mike Wong's political and social views as well as his personal life, and a self-flattering portrait of the forums. I can't even say keep and merge; I just can't wring anything of value out the entry.--<a href="../../../r/e/v/User%7ERevprez_167e.html" title="User:Revprez">Rev Prez</a> 07:32, 1 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Are you just a fucking moron or did you have to Dumbass U? You actually think Secular Humanism isn't worthy of having an article?

<dd><b>Comment</b> To put it politley, yes, yes he is a fucking moron, and yes he probably actually thinks that Secular Humanism doesn't deserve an entry. (What's even sadder, however, is that he actually went to MIT)--Robgea 15:11, 2 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thats the funny thing. Several people checked and according to them, they discovered that he never finished at MIT. We're guessing he either failed or was expelled.

<p><b>Keep.</b> The website is well-known within its specialty, and thus deserves its own article.

<p><b>Keep.</b> It's a notable enough website within the fan circles to deserve its own Wikipedia article. (Vote is from User:Ryan Hardy)</p>
<p><b>Delete</b>, notable or not, there's insufficient depth of material here to warrant an encyclopedia article. Aside from the description fo the main site and its forum, this is an article on a personal website: "<i>over the years Mike Wong has expanded the site to cover other topics within <b>his interests</b></i> " The site is already linked to in <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_versus_Star_Wars_c138.html" title="Star Trek versus Star Wars">Star Trek versus Star Wars</a>; its basic description could be expanded there (as some of the other sites' descriptions are). <a href="../../../s/o/c/User%7ESockatume_ba19.html" title="User:Sockatume">Socka</a><a href="../../../s/o/c/User_talk%7ESockatume_a9d2.html" title="User talk:Sockatume"><b>tume</b></a> 22:53, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
