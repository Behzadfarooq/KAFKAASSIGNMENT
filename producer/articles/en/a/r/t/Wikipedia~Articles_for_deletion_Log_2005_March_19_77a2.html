<li><b>Keep</b>. I've rewritten the article to make it more keepworthy. I'd respectfully suggest that this is a case where flagging an item for cleanup is more appropriate than nominating it for deletion. Before you nominate an article for deletion, or vote "delete," please take the time to see what other articles link to it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have also added to the article, to make it more encyclopedic. I actually wrote a stub on the film, but on second thoughts I think we should have a single article on the song and the film. However we should be sure about the exact punctuation and spelling of the title. It is possible that the exact title of the song and the film may vary, it may be the exact title of the song is unclear. The film is better known nowadays, its spelling is easier to establish, treat it as standard.<a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 18:31, 2005 Mar 24 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> as history of title into the film article. Yes, it is better than it was, although I seriously worry about the two exclamation marks as one is correct for the song and the other for the film, but neither has both, thus the article title as it stands is incorrect both ways! --<a href="../../../v/a/m/User%7EVampWillow_af3c.html" title="User:VampWillow">Vamp</a>:<a href="../../../v/a/m/User_talk%7EVampWillow_2eb2.html" title="User talk:VampWillow">Willow</a> 19:49, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point, VampWillow. I now propose to <b>be bold</b>, but as things could be getting confused I will wait 24 hours or so for anyone to object before I do this.

I agree the Wiki stubb is very badly written, but I find the claims above that Paul Smith does not exist to be absolutely laughable. He is one of the 3/4 men responsible for the development of remote viewing as a structured process. No question. In fact, he wrote the military manual on the subject! Now his existence, and the significance of his work is clear. The only real question is whether Wiki wants remote viewing in it. Based upon my past experiences on deletion, Wiki has a pro Western materialistic skeptical bias to its voting, and it will get dumped for this reason. But personally, I don't understand the logic of voting in WWE referees, and dumping guys like Paul...... but thats exactly how Wiki works. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimharwoodx_16da.html" title="User:Timharwoodx">Timharwoodx</a> 16:13, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Although this person exists, everything it says about him is not true. Check the university website. --Fredthemonsterman 05:11, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>The university humanities website is currently out of date as it failed to meet the deadline for recent updates. Theerfore not all enteries include accurate information. Moreover, Peter Goodall is certainly an academic worth an encylopedia article about because of the relevance of his research and his achievments. Perhaps you should look further into his history- I think a biography about him is available on auslit- and the article was based on an interview with and other academics in the english department at the university, including Rosemary Colmer. He teaches accross a broad range of subject matter including the english literature masters and honours programmes. So please before deleting this page, research the topic further as i think it is important to give recognition to the significant contribution Australin academics are making, particularly as there is a tendency to overlook their achievmnets- particularly when areas such as literature, and egyptological studies have important historical foundations. <i>unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i></li>

<li>I disagree that the article does not establish "notability". Clearly Professor Goodall has contributed significantly to a number of fields, most noteworthy, is literature and holds a high profile position coupled with a number of degrees (including an honoury doctorate from Macquarie University) from highly regarded universities, including Oxford and Harvard. If further information needs to be added, Peter is contactable via email, for verification, chapters from "la chess sherry" or other recent research papers (which he has agreed to)peter.goodall@hmn.mq.edu.au and is strong supporter of highlighting the works of Australian academics. Perhaps you definition of notability needs to be reconsidered- <i>second unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i>

<li>Tell you what, I'll go one better. I live not very far from Maq.

<li>I have to say i am offended by that comment as it completely undermines my credibility as a person- i don't think it is appropritate or helpful to make statements without doing all the particulars. Ihave provided his email address and if you do not wish to ascertain the legitimacy of this article through him, you may also contact the computing department regarding the incomplete biographical information of a number of the humanities/SCMP staff. I categorically deny falsifying any information and it is just not appropriate to advocate for the deletion of an article about someone who has contributed much to thinking and theory throughout his long academic life. I hope this is helpful but i strongly maintain that Australian academics really do need to be given more recognition for their contribution. <i>third unsigned comment by anon <a href="../../../1/3/7/User%7E137.111.13.34.html" title="User:137.111.13.34">user:137.111.13.34</a></i></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am a GP at Round Corner Medical Centre in Dural, with an interest in English literature. I have read his nove "La chess sherry", which was a very interesting historical account of the profound meaning chess took on in Venice during the period of the Grand Serene Republic. He approaches the topic of dominance and democracy drawing upon the works of Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Jacques Rosseau, Jacques Derrida, Andy Warhol, Marcelle Freiman, Jane Messer, Rosemary Colmer, Andy Kissane and David Hume. Clearly, it is a very electic and original approach, because not only has Professor Goodall shown new insights into the theories of the abovementioned people, he has been able to draw them together and develop an innovative new theoretical perspective, which is something rare in academia these days. I am not sure who the writer of this bio was as they remained anonymous, however I do think they failed to provide sufficient information or background on his works and their significance to Australian literature. Hopefully someone from a literary background will be able to expand upon them.--Josette.docherty@gmail.com 07:22, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>== <i><b>Keep this one!</b></i> == I do know of peter Goodall but tend to agree with Josette that his bio needs significant work. It seems to have been written by an amateur, which is a pity, as its great to see Australian academics been given mention in encyclopedias. While I have not read his new book, I have seen, but after reading Josette's comment I will be obtaining myself a copy, though I have read several of his research papers in the field of Egyptology, which is an interest of myself and my late friend Professor Pierre Beaumont, who I believe also appreciated his works. --Stephent@psych.usyd.edu.au 07:31, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>The title V.C. given to Prof. Goodall is not a reference to either the victoria cross or vice chancellor, but rather is an honorary dignity ( called Most high Viccali Canonist, therefore the V.C. initials).

<li>Acting Dean, so not a low level professor. I've not got the impression that Macquarie is a bog-standard Uni, I thought they were better than that (a good standard Australian Uni - top twelve in the country, appeared in the top 100 of Asiaweek's survey of Asian universities, that sort of thing) and the humanities are one of their stronger areas. So a reasonably high position at a reasonably good university - and since I see no good reason why we should be significantly harsher on academics than we are on actors, sportspeople or pokemon cards, that would warrant Capitalistroadster's article as a <b>keep</b>, unverifiable claims by sockpuppets or not. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:33, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am Andrew Venn, co-founder of CYNF.</p>
<p>I have since edited the first lines of the article to make it sound less marketing speak, hope this addresses the key concern.</p>
<p>In relation to CYNF I do believe that an entry is valuable because CYNF represents a unique use of social networks and has some features not seen elsewhere:</p>
<p>1. Asymetrical mapping of relationships 2. Use of network distance to control release of information (ie. in this case asset availability information) 3. The linking of Assets to social networks 4. Creation of virtual libraries based upon social networks.</p>
<p>The organisation is relatively new, and not marketed heavily and has not employed SEO people. It has had rather organic growth to date and so I am not suprised that there is little on Google. That said we were invited last week to demo our product at Microsoft's Social Computing Symposium 2005 being held in April. Being based in Australia, makes it a costly exercise so it is unlikely at this stage that we will attend. We also have local organisations that have shown significant interest and one in partuclar wants us to customise a site for us for musicians to share equipment.</p>
<p>If you have time have a look at the site, and I am willing to continue the discussion via my e-mail andrew.venn@cynf.com</p>

<p>If CYNF's entry is advertising what of the following?</p>
<p>MySpace...</p>
<p>Myspace (or MySpace) is a free service that uses the internet for online communication through an interactive network of photos, weblogs, user profiles, e-mail, web forums, groups, as well as many other communication devices. This all-inclusive service is sometimes called a social networking interface. It is an active site always updating or creating new features for their members. Myspace is also sometimes used to describe a user created webpage on the Myspace.com service.</p>
<p>Tribe</p>
<p>Tribe.net (often shortened to "Tribe") is a website that hosts a online community of friends, similar to Orkut or Friendster. Anyone may register as a new Tribe user, and may then define his or her immediate network of friends, either by choosing from existing members or by inviting new members to join. Each of these users may in turn define their own network of friends. (This process results in a type of user-driven viral marketing on behalf of Tribe.net.)</p>
<p>How are these any different. Given that these are there, how is it they are acceptable but ours not? Hell MySpace even goes as far as to put a graphic of their homepage. What about that for advertising?! What is it in particular that you do not like. Please be more specific. What sentence, what phrase, what elements. Because I am not seeing the difference between this entry and those sighted above. We are happy to make changes, but please give us some direction.</p>
<p>After all any information disemination could be labelled advertising. The question is, is this trying to inform or sell. I do not see this entry as a sales pitch, if you want to see sales pitches I can point you at those. We have not even mentioned that the service is free because we thought that was "advertising". We just believe that if an entry is given to Friendster, Orkut, LinkedIn, etc. etc. then we should be included with our peers. Especially as we are offering something of real value that is free. What about you have a look at the site?</p>
<p>As for the graphic, what do you want us to do? It is an illustration of the concept. Of course we are happy for it to be displayed on your site, but having it modified or co-opted by others as their work is hardly right. If it becomes a problem we will pull it. Which lessens the content that if offered to your users. I think the intention of the tagging process is one of making sure the authors of the articles do not steal or misrepresent work as their own. This is our work, our post so please explain the problem for me.</p>
<p>I must admit that for all the press about this being an open effort, it seems that there are far too many problems in entering information. There so far has been no comment about whether the entry is worthwhile in the first place, whether CYNF is valuable and should have an entry. The discussion has been purely about semantics of the entry. It is easy for people to critique others work but so far I have not seen one constructive suggestion. We are happy to make changes, but give us more direction.</p>

<li><b>Delete,</b> advertising, spam, non-notable. I've read the remarks below. It's all very easy: when CYNF is clearly notable we will need an article on it. If AndrewCYNF's judgement is correct, that should not be very long. But in the meantime, Wikipedia is not Wired and does not try to inform its readers of "memes on the rise." <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:07, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To answer people's questions and statements:</p>
<p>Riffsyphon I apologise if I offended I was merely try to point out that my page, put up against those others, doesn't read much differently. I chose to be honest and make it clear who I was it seems that I am being punished for that. I agree that suspicion should arise, but the article should be judged on its content and subject. So I am confused as to why it is not just being re-edited as opposed to VFD</p>
<p>Others</p>
<p>It is not a vanity page.</p>
<p>We have not spammed wikipedia by dumping CYNF links on the friendster &amp; myspace entries. Or asked our members or friends to vote or write entries for us.</p>
<p>As for advertising - tell me what to change. If the graphic is what offends then let me know what you want different. We do not even say that entry is free. We do not put our logo on the page, the graphic is not even from the website, it was created simply to describe the concept. Yes I am the co-founder, but felt that I have been very careful. The article talks about the concept.</p>
<p>As for non-notable, is size the criteria for notable/non-notable? In which case, do you want this encyclopedia to be able to provide information on nascent organisations or not? We are the only ones doing this anywhere and if people actually took time to see what the site has to offer then I think you would agree that what we are doing is at least interesting. No one anywhere is using social networks and combining it with lending and asset management or brought in the concept of trust into the equation.</p>
<p>If size is the sole criteria then show me where it says so and I will debate no more.</p>
<p>As for peers, in the last month we have been asked to demo our site/product at Microsoft's Social Computing Symposium 2005 held in April. If we can get invited to show our product at this symposium along with others then I think that we are entitled to use the word peer in relation to social networking/computing.</p>
<p>And yes, we are expected to make mistakes, we are new to this and so far it has been less than a pleasant experience.</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Andrew, it's not (supposed to be) personal. The sometimes-terse shorthand on this VfD page can seem rude to new Wikipedians, but usually the result of a desire for efficiency rather than deliberate incivility.</dd>
<dd>Right now, CYNF seems to be a company that very few people have heard of, and is without significant recognition on the Internet. The existence of the acronym YASNS (yet another social networking system) and the very long list of companies in the field in our article on <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_network.html" title="Social network">social networks</a> suggests that there are a <i>lot</i> of players in the field, each of whom believe their product contributes <i>some</i>thing unique and fills some niche. Wikipedia tends to report on notoriety; we don't like to be responsible for building it. A <i>lot</i> of organizations (not necessarily yours) have noticed that a very effective way to build Google recognition is through the creation of Wikipedia articles, so we tend to be very wary of small companies that haven't already gained a lot of public attention.</dd>
<dd>I would also ask you to examine your motives in adding the article. If it's not to advertise or build buzz for your company, then why? If you would like to share information about trust-based social networks, perhaps it would be appropriate to add a section to the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_network.html" title="Social network">social network</a> article, or to create articles on specific topics related to your technology. If you can cite peer-reviewed journal articles, so much the better.</dd>
<dd><s>A last point—have you considered creating a Wikipedia user account? It's very quick, and it might make it easier to keep some of this lengthy discussion off an already-large VfD page.</s> Cheers, <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a> 05:53, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC), amended 15:43, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC) (my mistake) <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../t/e/n/User_talk%7ETenOfAllTrades_2121.html" title="User talk:TenOfAllTrades">Talk</a>.</dd>

<p>TenOfAllTrades, thank you for your response. Perhaps I am a little testy. I understand people's concern regarding entries such as these from start-ups. But we have been around for 12 months now and are taking a rather laid back approach to marketing generally (although this was not an attempt to market). I understand the page ranking process of Google, but understood that Google bought out a tag so that references could be made to sites that you didn't want to "vote" for and naturally assumed that was the case here (as it is on many blogging sites). If the link to CYNF at the bottom is a problem then I am happy to remove it. If we were chasing linkage we would have done it a year ago. In fact it was not on the original post. And on top of that what we offer is for free, it is not like we are advertising viagra. Although the responses made me feel I might have been.</p>
<p>If you have a look at the social networking page, I had edited it and mentioned what is unique about our concept. This too was removed (and on reflection was too markety, if such a word exists). I must admit to sounding like a marketter from time to time because it is a new concept and I am probably too close to the topic.</p>
<p>We believe what we have is unique and significant enough to rate a mention. If we wanted to list purely for advertisment purposes we would have do so a year ago, but we waited until we got a significant nod, like the interest from Microsoft. Only then did we feel it was an appropriate time to make an entry. If nothing more than to let people know of a new application for social networking.</p>
<p>What I would ask is other than volume what have the other sites got to offer beyond the "dating" concept in one form or another.</p>
<p>I can tell you why CYNF is unique, but whatever I do it will come across as advertising:</p>
<p>CYNF is the first application of its kind that takes social networking to another level. It has the following very unique features:</p>
<p>1. Linking social networking to asset lending and management (we also have a business to business site, but did not think that was appropriate to mention)</p>
<p>2. Use of trust and levels of trust within a social network to control access to information (in this case lendable assets)</p>
<p>3. Asymetric trust within social networks</p>
<p>On top of that what I did not mention in the article as we felt these were selling points, it is free, works for all types of assets, DVDs, CDs, Games and so on... has warranty reminding, overdue loan reminders, calendarisation of all assets, full loan tracking, recommend to friend features, multiple locations, downloadable spreadsheets with valuations suitable for insurance companies, a sell/swap feature to enable you to swap or sell items privately within your social network, 128 bit encryption on login, server side scripted PHP / MySQL code, hand-coded, housed in a bulletproof, ram proof, datacentre with fingerprint ID, hi res closed circuit cameras, dual CISCO redundant firewalls, off site mirroring to two separate locations, we don't ask for full names or locations, we are developing mobile capabilities, barcode scanning and so much more.&#160;;-)</p>
<p>If it is volume and buzz that we need first then doesn't this tool you are all creating just become the vox pop of encyclopedias? I would suggest that obscure artists would be included but would not have over 2,000 people signed up.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do from here, I felt the article was more on the topic of social networking and our unique take on it than pushing ourselves. We felt it was worthy of mention as there is no other site on your list that uses a social network in the manner we do, with the underlying trust model as shown in the diagram. It kinda like a side entry on philips screwdrivers that says, and Phillips invented the another type of screwdriver that had benefits because.</p>
<p>Perhaps, as one of the other voters put it, we should just come back when we have made it and in the meantime be satisfied with being listed here with all the rest YASNs. But I can not help but feel our only difference to that of the MySpace or Friendster pages is that we do not have the volume of theirs, even though we are actually bringing new techniques to social networking not seen before.</p>
<p>By the way for your interest this concept was first created by us in 2000 and refined in 2001 before even Friendster was on the scene.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<li>Comment after later additions - he commands DART. That means he should be mentioned in the DART article. He is already. The annual budget of DART isn't impressive (the article says half a million Canadian dollars, which is just over 200,000 pounds), and does not suggest the Canadian government takes it that seriously, so while I'd keep the DART article, this doesn't convince me that the leader is notable.

In any case it should not be in the same article with the original band.

<li>Another <b>comment</b>: FWIW This probably could have been handled as a merge and redirect to the older article, rather than a VfD. If I had seen it myself I probably would have handled it that way, but since the user put it under a different title it slipped under the radar of my watchlist. (I wonder if this was deliberate? Similar variations on the name were already redirects.) As I mentioned, I'd been watching the other article, and the previous edits there are essentially the same content as this one.

<p>For the record, my count on <i>this</i> discussion was 22 clear "delete" votes, 9 "keep" votes and one ambiguous vote. I exercised my discretion and counted the one anonymous vote. The tone and context made it clear that this was not an attempt by a sockpuppet to bias the outcome of the vote. Despite the confusion over the various versions of this article, it is clear to me that all the voters in this decision were basing their decisions on the current version and were not merely reacting to the "out-of-process" accusations. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:50, 15 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Looks like a hoax to me. Firstly, the anon creator has regularly vandalised in the past. Secondly, a programme he apparently 'hosted' called 'BBC: 50 Years of Television' would have been made in 1986, twenty two years after he died (according to <a href="../../../s/e/w/Sewer_Rats_68dd.html" title="Sewer Rats">Sewer Rats</a>).

This resulted in several parodies of the game, which was itself rather bad.

<li>Just <b>Delete.</b> Words that are not worth their own entry in the dictionary are not worth a redirect in Wikipedia. This is just a regularly-derived inflected form of the word "prorogue" and means exactly what you'd expect it to mean. The dictionary just lists it under "prorogue" without comment. A redirect is not needed; it's almost inconceivable that anyone would search on "prorogued" rather than "prorogue." 02:41, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC) (<a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> typed one too many tildes <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 21:34, 2005 Mar 20 (UTC))

<p>What we have here seems to be a guy who shot a couple of videos which were shown at a few festivals. No distribution and no reported box office gross. "Expiration" was released on DVD, but as far as I can tell Hefferman released it himself, making it the equivalent of a vanity press book. Doesn't seem to be at amazon anyway. I'd call this article vanity or self promotion, but if Hefferman wrote it I'd expect he'd have more to say than this. Anyway, <b>delete</b> this as another guy with a video camera trying to get a start in the film industry.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I seem to disagree on the definition of "large". According to the festival's website, it lasts four days (in 2005, from April 7 to 10); only 10 feature films are involved - this year, Ivan Reitman's "Meatballs" will be shown, evidently hours-concours; it has no tradition either: the first edition took place last year, when the winner was Hefferman. I'm sorry, but IMHO more than this award is required to make someone notable. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">Vlad</font><font color="#989ACC">M</font><font color="#0000C0">V</font></a> <font color="#6F078D">٭</font> <sup><a href="../../../v/m/v/User_talk%7EVmv_5a55.html" title="User talk:Vmv"><font color="#0000C0">talk</font></a></sup> 18:51, 24 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was wondering, in general should not self-financed undistributed movies be treated much the same as vanity published books? I don't see a huge difference, except perhaps that a movie made along these lines is more likely to be purchased by a distributor than a self-published book is likely to be purchased by a publisher. Given that I'm not sure that's true, and that until such a movie <i>is</i> purchased the matter in inconsequential, I'm tempted to think movies like this, and the people who make them need to be held to some standard beyond some award at a small festival. Even the winners at Sundance and the like are basically significant only because the award guarantees them a commercial release. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:18, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not really. While the commercial aspect of cinema clearly is quite important, you'll find that there's a vast amount of interest in the art in general. For instance, google the indy in question, Gavin Heffernan, and you'll find quite a lot of hits, with many reviews of his commercially undistributed movies. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel11_f217.html" title="User:Daniel11">Daniel11</a> 00:29, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nonsense. When there are a bunch of articles on the same subject (schools) being deleted for the same reason ("non notable"), how would you rather people vote to keep all of them? Should the exact same reasons be rephrased for each article? Or are you saying I shouldn't be allowed to vote at all, because I found out about this vfd via GRider's "vote-swining" comments elsewhere? In either case, you are wrong, there is no policy that says my vote here shouldn't count and I highly doubt there ever will be one. <a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif"></a><tt><b>~</b><a href="../../../l/e/i/User%7ELeif_7e14.html" title="User:Leif">leif</a></tt> ☺ <a href="../../../l/e/i/User_talk%7ELeif_77cb.html" title="User talk:Leif"><sub>HELO</sub></a> 00:43, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The vote is about whether <i>this</i> school is notable, not whether schools gerneraly are notable. The exact same vote on several articles suggests to me that you haven't read the article in question. Whether you have or you haven't that is the impression I get. For the record my opinion is that many schools merit a mention on the article about the community they're in (or if that doesn't have its own artcile, then in the section deailing with the community in whatever article that is on). The most noteworthy schools do deserve articles of there own, just like most songs only merit a mention on the articles of the artist who sang them, and particluarly noteworthy songs ger an article about them. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 01:07, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>For the record, we have a community music project which catalogs commercial music albums far and wide, complete with track listings. There are even certain exceptions where a single song title warrants its own article independent of the album. Each of these albums merit their own article as much as any public educational institution does, IMHO.

<p>Biographical entry for Lance Brown. Libertarian Party activist in California. Not yet 35, it looks like he is running a vanity campaign for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination for 2008. Article doesn't establish notability, and as far as I can tell, neither do the Google hits. Looks like he is using Wikipedia for self-promotion, although it could be an associate doing it.

<dd>Not really. Check out what the hits actually are. From the ones I saw, they are mostly links to his blog. One does not find media interviews, biographical articles, etc, about this person. Blogging has a tendency to really run up the Google hits.

<li>In regard to the comment about Lance Brown or one of his associates using Wikipedia for self-promotion: I am the one who created this article and I am the one who added Lance Brown to the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._presidential_election%2C_2008_f751.html" title="U.S. presidential election, 2008">U.S. presidential election, 2008</a> page. I am neither Lance Brown nor an am I an associate of his. I found his campaign through the web in 2001. About Lance Brown not yet being 35, I don't think this should be an issue since he will be 35 by 2008. As for notability, I am not sure how to varify whether not not Lance Brown is notable enough for a Wikipedia article. I've tried looking through <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">Wikipedia's policies about this issue</a>, but the actual criteria seems somewhat vague. In my opinion, people prominent in their own local juristiction should be included, and Lance Brown has appeared regularly on local television <a href="http://www.freedom2008.com/blog/arc/002634.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.freedom2008.com/blog/arc/002634.html" rel="nofollow">[21]</a> and he is chairman of his own county's Libertarian Party. Also, I do believe his campaign is real, and I don't think it is a vanity campaign. I believe even if he loses the primary, running in the presidential primary as a third party candidate is notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 04:24, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Comment: The point is that it's not <i>deleted</i>, it has been <i>moved</i>. Moves are reversible and do not destroy history. If a transwiki turns out to be controversial, it can be reverted by any reader/editor. The "deletion at the end of the transwiki process" is an artificial artifact of the mechanics of a pagemove across the Wikipedia/Wiktionary boundary. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a>

</li>
<li>Actually it's the addition <i>of a speedy-deletion tag</i> that gets an article deleted without debate (even though "already exists on Wiktionary" isn't a speedy-deletion criterion), as both you and I have been attempting to counteract. The fact that some articles have had {{move to Wiktionary}} affixed to them for years is ample evidence that the addition of that tag <i>does not</i> get an article deleted <i>at all</i>, either with or without debate. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:32, 2005 Mar 21 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a>'s interpretation is that deletion is "the last step in a successful transwiki". That's also my interpretation, it says "move" not "copy". I've seen plenty of things show up in <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> tagged with "transferred to wiktionary or something like that, and they got deleted. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 09:32, 21 Mar 2005 (UTC)
