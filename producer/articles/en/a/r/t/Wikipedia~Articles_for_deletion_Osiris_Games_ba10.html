<p>I’ve done a Google search for Osiris Games and it reveals 655 results <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Osiris+Games%22&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Osiris+Games%22&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, for a notable game company that doesn’t seem enough. Further more, the article lacks sources. I can’t find many reliable sources for them. The games Chart Wars and Bestseller don’t seem notable, there’s big questions over their notability as well. The main Osiris Games article is created by Damien Russell, which to quote the article is one of the four members Osiris Games so it also looks like vanity. The other creators of the articles also have very little edits.</p>
<p>Myrtilus Games is the baby company of Osiris Games so god knows how small they are if Osiris Games has only has four members and that seems to be the parent company.</p>
<p>Myrtilus Games also has a page about it’s game Insider Tabloid Magazine, which also seems none notable.</p>
<p>Due these serious questions about notability, probable vanity and lack of independent sources, I am bring this up for AFD. Based on the lack of evidence I’ve found, my vote is <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../e/n/g/User%7EEnglishrose_b44b.html" title="User:Englishrose">Englishrose</a> 22:21, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b> I disagree.. of cause. Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games (baby company?) are two of the fastest growing freeware gaming companies on the web. The website (especially Osiris Games) registers hundreds of hits per day, and if the article's werent being looked over; why is everyone editing 'Bestseller'? If you have Bestseller, you need the Osiris Games, and Myrtilus Games articles. Chart Wars is also THE biggest freeware music simulation game on the internet. As for Insider; if you feel you must, fine.. but I still think there is nothing wrong with any of those articles and I would like them all to stay.Damien Russell 04:26, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Delete</b> I did a cursory look for any verifiable sources and found none that were reliable. Damien Russell, despite the <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, I'd suggest that your best bet to keep these articles up is to source independant, third party coverage in major news outlets. Staff reviews by places like IGN, Gamespot, 1UP.com, and other major gaming sites would help immensely as well. If sources exist, source the article. If they don't the article fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a>, probably has <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> issues, and according to those two policies must be deleted. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 13:40, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>There are no reviews from such places as IGN, Gamespot or 1UP.com because the games are not published to such a broad audience. They are indie games, and Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games are indie developers. Please see the websites for more information, but other than that, the site is mentioned and linked on other sites (freeware gaming sites, and download.com of cause) - but no major review sites (because they only review major releases). Look, fine; if you want to remove these articles from wikipedia then go right ahead, but you better be willing to remove every other indie-developer's page on wiki as well. I mean look at the links up for removal; all Osiris Games related articles.. why are these up for removal when theres a whole list here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_independent_game_developers</a>, that are happily being accepted?

<p><b>Keep</b> .. This is an indie company. The articles have been cleaned up remarkably since they were first introduced and people are continually trying to update it when new attributable sources are available. There is an interest in the game, and those who are wishing to learn more about it, and the companies, would benefit from having these articles on Wikipedia. To say that the fact that the articles were created by people who haven't had a long history of edits on Wikipedia is not only unfair, but a very slippery slope to start down. Subjecting your decision to a "Google" search and saying that Chart Wars nor Bestseller don't seem notable indicates your obvious lack of knowledge in these genre of games and their popularity. Perhaps maybe you should nominate your "Furniture (band)" article for deletion. I see no sources on there and I certainly haven't heard of them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../s/e/c/User%7ESecandido_01f7.html" title="User:Secandido">Secandido</a> (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Secandido_cac0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Secandido">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Feel free to nominate something for deletion if you feel it doesn't belong. As I stated, there's no indication of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> which indicate the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> of this indie developer. Just because you may <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">like something</a> doesn't mean it fits the requirements for notability. It doesn't matter if you like it or not, what matters if whether it fits the definitions of notability. Osiris Games and Myrtilus Games would both have to be improved with reliable sources proving their notability as outlined at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> or <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, while Chart Wars, Bestseller and Insider Tabloid Magazine would have to be improved with reliable sources proving their notability as outlined at <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 19:15, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
