<p>The result was <b>Delete.</b> Ignoring the potential copyright issues, and also ignoring the article's authors' and defenders' involvement with the organization, it is plain to see that the article's contents fail to establish the movement's notability aside from the involvement of certain notable individuals. This discussion also fails in this respect - notability and worthiness of an article based on our inclusion guidlines have not been established. While the existance of the organization is verifiable, some of the lofty claims made here are not. If the organization were to verifiably become truly notable like so many of the religions, groups, cults, movements, philosophies, and ways of life listed on Wikipedia, then inclusion would be a given. However, at this stage in the movement's existance, this is not the case. --Jeffrey O. Gustafson - <i><a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffrey_O._Gustafson_Shazaam_7ee3.html" title="User:Jeffrey O.

<dd>There are extensive articles on Wikipedia regarding the <a href="../../../i/c/o/ICOC_e2ba.html" title="ICOC">International Churches of Christ</a> (ICOC), and a recent addition of the biography of the individual (<a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_McKean_1c63.html" title="Kip McKean">Kip McKean</a>) who started the Boston Movement (which was renamed the ICOC in 1994). If these entries are considered encyclopedic, then Portland Movement content has it's place in this Wikipedia - the affiliation with McKean as well as the ICOC are factors which make the Portland International Church of Christ a notable congregation in the context of Wikipedia. Please assist by pointing out examples of "sermon-like" content in the article, they should be discussed, and then edited or removed appropriately. In the very least, this content has its place as a section in the <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_McKean_1c63.html" title="Kip McKean">Kip McKean</a> bio or perhaps somewhere in the ICOC content. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlynx_c005.html" title="User:Merlynx">Jeremy Ciaramella</a> 19:32, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Mr. Ciaramella, it's only fair to point out that you are self-described as a "cybervangelist" for Mr. McKean in your profile. As to pointing out examples of "sermon-like" content, here's a sentence I plucked out almost at random: <i>"Beginning with just nine disciples, God has increased the Latin Ministry to almost 70 disciples as of 2006."</i> --<a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 20:55, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Mr. "Plether", my affiliation does not change the aforementioned contextual facts. How do you recommend rewording the above quote, "Beginning with nine members, the Latin ministry grew to 70 members as of 2006?" Removing references of God's influence on the phenomenon of church growth, or references that are similar ("x" happened because of God) is feasible, albeit awkward given the religious subject matter of this article. This fact (the growth of a ministry) is related, as it illustrates the momentum that the Portland Church is creating, much like the Boston Church created during the formation of the Boston Movement (now the <a href="../../../i/c/o/ICOC_e2ba.html" title="ICOC">ICOC</a>). <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlynx_c005.html" title="User:Merlynx">Jeremy Ciaramella</a> 21:58, 14 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Pleather - I am sorry I assumed your gender. It's easier to communicate in a civil fashion with someone using their given name. I'd prefer "Jeremy." I do not disagree with you about the causality statements. I would rather see this content reworked and refined and made useful than deleted.

<dd>Sorry, I can't see why you would delete this. The ICOC became, at one time, the fastest growing religious movement in the world. That is a notable accomplishment. Kip McKean led this movement, and it began by breaking away from the traditional Churches of Christ. This is not a non-notable church, simply because it is the church in which Mr. McKean has again broken away from the 'organized' church - except this time he created the church from which he is breaking away. His prior break had great impact on the Churches of Christ and the world. This break may have similar results, and a thread should be maintained so this can be documented. Other persons notable for breaks with traditon: Martin Luther (using the above criteria, should we not delete the entry on Lutheran Church?), Jonh Wesley, John Calvin, William Tyndale - the list goes on. Kip McKean is a modern reformist - and the Portland Chrurch is certainly noteworthy enough to stay listed in Wikipedia. If you remove this article based on this complaint, you must then remove all protestant reformers and their resulting denominations on the same grounds.Scooterjonz 20:11, 14 September 2006 (UTC) <small>— Possible <b><a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">single purpose account</a></b>: Scooterjonz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Scooterjonz_04e4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Scooterjonz">contribs</a>) has made few or no other contributions outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>Article regarding the Portland Church of Christ. The Portland Church remains one of the fastest growing church's of Christ in the country. For all practical purposes the church attendance as of Jan. 2004 was 120 people with 1 baptized teen and 2 campus students. In two years time the church has multiplied three times its size to 360. They have grown the campus ministry to well over 55 people on 11 campus in the Portland area. They also have now built up a zealous teen/middleschool ministry with well over 45 people. All of this growth has been accomplished while simultaneously sending out and supporting numerous church plantings. For 2006 the church is on a pace to baptize over 100 people. There are many churches of Christ with larger numbers of members yet, unfortunately, are not as dynamic (dynamic meaning in a state of change and growth). Static churches remain the same for a period of time and than wither away. The Portland Church of Christ believes in praying for those churches and answering any call for help that might come. The church also believes in making positive changes for their community, state, country and world. These facts are true and verifiable. While any church such as Baptist, Catholic, and Methodist have their critics - not unlike the Portland Church of Christ - it behooves the Wickipedia researcher to have fair and accurate information available so that an intelligent and logical person can make a fair judgement.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. First of all, this was speedy-deleted yesterday as copyvio (it's a cut-and-paste from a church website), then reposted today. Secondly, the text hardly bears out evidence of a so-called "movement". There are vague references to "discipling relationships" in areas outside of Portland, but the only clear claim of organizational momentum is the growth of the Portland International Church of Christ from "approximately 275 disciples" ( i.e. congregation members) in 1996 to "Over 500 in attendance on Sundays" today. Those are the only hard numbers asserting notability, so far as I can tell.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Thirdly, for a mass movement with "the dream of evangelizing the entire world in a single generation," this one appears to have attracted almost no mention in the media. I get a grand total of 34 Google hits for "Portland Movement" in conjunction with "Kip McKean", its purported leader, of which ten are derived from Wikipedia. With all due respect, while this may well at some point become a notable mass reform trend, it isn't now. --<a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 22:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I was the one who reposted the article. The article was probably mistakenly thought of as a "copyvio." This article is not a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CSD#A8" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:CSD#A8" rel="nofollow">CSD A8 "copyvio"</a> however. Most of the article is original. I also was not notified by the editor concerning the copyvio as stated in the <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>. Some quotes and ideas were taken from some Portland Bulletin articles merely to better justify and back the ideas in this article. If this article is on another website please list the website's url as I do not belive this is possible since I have been in possesion of the writing until it's posting. As far as the "global movement," there is a clear listing of congregations around the world and the US that are affiliated with the Portland Movement. I can put a listing of affiliated congregations if this helps clear things up. With all that said, the Portland Movement is in it's infancy and therefore not as clear as say the former ICOC.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> The Portland Church currently is actively overseeing congregations in 8 different nations (Estonia, Northern Ireland, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Chile, Ukraine and the United States of America) as well as in seven states (Utah, Arizona, New York, Illinois, Georgia, Hawaii, and Oregon) demonstrating notable international status - as a religious movement. Is referring to these groups' websites considered proof of being notable - or is that considered an internal source? The Portland Church's initial activity and the Boston Church's initial activity are similar. The Portland Movement is also referred to as "Kip McKean's New Movement" (c.f. <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_Movement_f3bb.html" title="Boston Movement">Boston Movement</a> addtional links).

Wording is strangely similar in many places of the article as to be a coincidence. While the subject itself may be notable, the article needs to be completely rewritten as per our policies. -- <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Run</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="#339900">e</font></a> <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERune.welsh_2e22.html" title="User:Rune.welsh">Welsh</a> | <a href="../../../r/u/n/User_talk%7ERune.welsh_7599.html" title="User talk:Rune.welsh">ταλκ</a> 12:36, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b>: Please explain in detail how this church is non-notable compared to say, <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahu_Christian_churches_7d5c.html" title="Lahu Christian churches">Lahu Christian churches</a> or any other article such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_comic_strips.html" title="List of comic strips">List of comic strips</a>. My point is is that a notable church to one person may not be a notable church to another. Many people are watching what is going on in Portland. See: <a href="http://www.leebase.com/icocnews/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=324" class="external text" title="http://www.leebase.com/icocnews/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=324" rel="nofollow">"ICOCNews.com"</a> or <a href="http://icoccommentary.blogspot.com/2006/04/renovator-not-innovator.html" class="external text" title="http://icoccommentary.blogspot.com/2006/04/renovator-not-innovator.html" rel="nofollow">" A Renovator, not an Innovator."</a> for examples of others who are not affiliated with Portland that are interested in what is going on. The Movement is legitimate no matter how small it may be. As far as the copyvio, see above comment made by me. There were many church movements of the past that never really got very big yet are still considered notable. <a href="../../../c/d/h/User%7ECdHess_f044.html" title="User:CdHess">CdHess</a> 22:40, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Reply</b>: As has been explained, you have to show from verifiable, independent sources (ICOC is hardly independent) that the church or movement is notable. What is the total number of followers? It all seems very small and limited. I'm not comparing to other churches or other articles (perhaps they are deletable as well), and a list is a different thing, as that is (logically) a list of things that are themselves notable or non notable. The comics on that list (at least the Franco-Belgian ones) have sold millions of copies, have been constantly in print for decades, have been translated in many languages, ... All of them are the source of multiple independent reviews, articles, and often complete studies. They are clearly notable. And could you give some examples of the "many chruch movements of the past that never really got very big yet are still considered notable"? Exclude those that led to mass suicides or large court cases for sexual abuse and so on, as those are notable for those reasons, not for being a church movement as such... As for the copyvio, how are we to definitely know (in a legally safe way, according to Wikipedia policy) that it is the same person that has written the article, and not someone who has just copied it from that website? And an article written by one of its key subjects is often a bad idea and may easily violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, as you can see in sections like "Division" (calling the new vision "reactionary" is a clear example of POV. Forums "poisoned" the members is another example. The movement is less than a year old, and has no outside sources. It is non notable, not verifiable, written from a clear POV, and is technically a copyvio. More than enough reasons for a deletion. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 12:42, 16 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: It is <i>very</i> difficult to write from a perfectly NPOV. Everyone has built in biases and therefore will never <i>truly</i> write from a <i>perfectly</i> NPOV. I have tried my hardest to make sure that the article is NPOV. I welcome any suggestions and have already noted your previous suggestions. As far as the copyvio, a letter has been written to Wikimedia that states clearly that I have been comissioned by the Portland Church to write this article. I am not sure if that is good enough. <a href="../../../c/d/h/User%7ECdHess_f044.html" title="User:CdHess">CdHess</a> 16:33, 16 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment:</b> In the <a href="../../../a/c/m/WP%7EACM_ff3e.html" title="WP:ACM">WP:ACM</a> it mentions "deleting" - the first qualifier there is that something may be "poorly" written, but still have it's purpose. This content has purpose - it is a connection to the Wikipedia <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_McKean_1c63.html" title="Kip McKean">Kip McKean</a> and <a href="../../../i/c/o/ICOC_e2ba.html" title="ICOC">ICOC</a> entries. Ironically, <a href="../../../w/q/t/WP%7EWQT_eef8.html" title="WP:WQT">WP:WQT</a> mentions in the "How to avoid the abuse of talk pages" not to lable something as "poorly written."

<dd>Jeremy, I've moved your comment above to its own thread, as it's generally considered unproductive to insert comments, out of chronological order, in the middle of a thread. Also, you'll note that I added the <b>Comment</b> tag. This is a very useful tool for keeping these discussions readable, as it distinguishes additional information from one's original opinion on retention. Thanks! <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 17:28, 15 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Secondly, the debate at hand is NOT copyright violation; that was the criteria for the "speedy delete" process, which is now over. Please, please understand that the topic at hand is <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>. Just because something is described as a "movement" doesn't make it so: hard data--numbers and facts--make it so. I see "The Portland Church currently is actively overseeing congregations in 8 different nations" and "The Portland Movement is a part of the ethos of <a href="../../../k/i/p/Kip_McKean_1c63.html" title="Kip McKean">Kip McKean</a>". What, exactly, does "overseeing congregations" mean? How does "ethos" relate to notability? <a href="../../../p/l/e/User%7EPleather_9646.html" title="User:Pleather">Pleather</a> 18:49, 15 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> I did not realize that the debate for "speedy delete" process was over. Thank you again for clarification. To oversee a congregation means that the Portland Church directly influences, trains, and works with the given local congregation and its leadership. That local congregation shares the same goals as the Portland Movement, and the same/very similar church building methodologies. It also means that the local church does not practice <a href="../../../a/u/t/Autonomy.html" title="Autonomy">Autonomy</a>. Ethos is defined as "the character or disposition of a community, group, person, etc." and the ICOC is a large community of churches, with <a href="http://www.icocinfo.org/church_directory.html" class="external text" title="http://www.icocinfo.org/church_directory.html" rel="nofollow">thousands of members</a> - even after its upheavals. The Portland Movement is a part of this community - albeit contraversial - and recording its activity in relation to the ICOC community and a key individual (Kip McKean) rounds out the description of the ethos of the ICOC and Kip McKean. Futher defining both of these entries' dispositions in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerlynx_c005.html" title="User:Merlynx">Jeremy Ciaramella</a> 19:33, 15 September 2006 (</dd>
