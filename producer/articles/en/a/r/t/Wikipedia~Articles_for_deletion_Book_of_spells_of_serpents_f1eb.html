<p>There is a {{<a href="../../../h/o/a/Template%7EHoax_4655.html" title="Template:Hoax">hoax</a>}} tag on the article. I don't know if this is encyclopædic at all. I am thus nominating this article. It needs sources, etc. Hoax?

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not sure its a hoax in the sense that someone is playing a trick on Wikipedia (still might not be true though). I found it mentioned <a href="http://www.thenazareneway.com/apocrypha.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thenazareneway.com/apocrypha.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (not sure how that plays out as a source for an article though). All the rest for a google search are wiki-mirros. And I did a prelim search of more reputable-looking sites on "apocrypha" and could find no mention of this book. However, that doesn't mean its a hoax -- I know I have a book around here somewhere about Paul, but I doubt I'll find it. If someone with a real knowledge of the subject can provide a book cite, I'll stay with keep. If not, I think it's in violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> I posted a message on the talk page of one of the page's editors about this Afd, who according to user page studies theology. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 23:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>, but amend. As noted in Talk:Book of spells of serpents, there are signs that this lost book once existed and was ascribed to St. Paul. This much is all that is asserted by the first paragraph up to and including "no known text has survived". To that point, the page is not a hoax, and should be kept.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What remains in doubt is the subsequent text, the "citations needed" statements about that book's <b>contents</b>; if sources for these cannot be found, I think it would be better to delete them than the whole article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know whether these statements are true, but they don't seem implausible. If St. Paul actually wrote a book with that title (and the assertion that he did is an old assertion), the Ophite heresy (which is accurately described there) would have been its probable topic ("Ophite" coming from the Greek word for serpent), and Paul would have written against it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I wish the writer(s) who posted these statements would come back and source them, just so I can read the cited texts. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>23:32, 19 Nov 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

(The original was apparently found around 1960, and spent a couple of decades being shopped around before it found a wealthy buyer.) Come to think of it, the whole Nag Hammadi trove was "lost" until it was found. So were the locations of Troy and Knossos. Far from making these "non-notable" topics, it made them fascinating mysteries, that scholars dreamed of finding, and that made the discoverers famous. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>12:10, 21 Nov 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

<dd><i>Note: I refactored the heading formatting to be <b>bold</b> because I seem to recall that it causes problems with AfDs to have headings within discussions</i>.</dd>
<dd>I see your point about apocryphal books. However, there are two things we have to look at here:
<ol>
<li>Time at which the (encyclopedia) article is written.</li>
<li>Reliability of sources.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The thing is, a copy of this book has yet to be found. For all we know, it won't. Similarly, writing about existence of the Nag Hammadi scrolls <i>before they were found</i> would have been a bit weird, don't you think?</dd>
<dd>So, we then have to move on to reliable sources for the existence of the book at some stage. There are none. I see links to some neo-Nazarene site, but that, in my opinion, does not equate with a scholarly work.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I have my (private, very slight and quiet) doubts about the authenticity of this 'Gospel of Judas'. I find the timing to be awfully odd, coïnciding with that dreadful Da Vinci Code and the surrounding mass idiocy. The woman who 'found' it (in a safety deposit box or somesuch) also seems to be of the opinion that she was somehow 'destined' (by Judas!) to do so. It has not been offered up to the scholarly community at large to study, but has rather been ratified only by a small team (who were cherry-picked for the purpose).</dd>
<dd>Moreover, even to link this 'book of serpents' to Paul is problematic. For example, the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerald_Tablet_4cee.html" title="Emerald Tablet">Emerald Tablet</a> of Hermes Trismegistus was proven by the Renaissance philologist <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Casaubon_8896.html" title="Isaac Casaubon">Isaac Casaubon</a> to be a forgery perpetrated in the second or third century (as opposed to being of a more Mosaic epoch). Given that the article says that the mention of this 'serpent book' is on a 6th century list of heretical works, there is <i>no</i> proof that it was not just some cleric getting carried away in his fervour to condemn. Saying that it is mentioned in other works is worth nothing without specifying which works these actually are.</dd>
<dd>The 19th century Muslism piece is a tad more convincing, but because it is probably based on faulty documentation before it (like the 6th century list — I doubt the book got 'lost' in the 19th century) renders it equally unreliable.</dd>
<dd>So I am not saying that this should be deleted because it is a lost book. My point is that there is no reliable, verifiable way of differentiating it from a hoax (which it may or may not be — it may just be a symbol of man's ability to delude himself), and as such, it is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 12:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"Given that the article says that the mention of this 'serpent book' is on a 6th century list of heretical works"....</i> Whoa. Pause. Stop. Rewind. That's not what the article says. "[I]t appears in a 6th century list of works that were considered <b>non-canonical</b>", yes, but other texts have been non-canonical without being heretical. In fact, right under <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#Lost_works" title="New Testament apocrypha">New_Testament_apocrypha#Lost_works</a>, where this particular book is listed among others "mentioned in many ancient sources, but for which no known text has survived", the next section is <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#A_note_about_orthodoxy" title="New Testament apocrypha">A note about orthodoxy</a>: "While many of the books listed here were considered heretical (especially those belonging to the gnostic tradition--as this sect was considered heretical by most Christians of the early centuries), others were not considered particularly heretical in content, but in fact were well accepted as significant spiritual works." And then <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#Evaluation" title="New Testament apocrypha">Evaluation</a> points out: "among historians of early Christianity the books are considered invaluable". I think that makes the topic notable enough for inclusion. Drop the unsourced claims, sure. Leave the stub (up to "no known text has survived"), because that much was known already. Then if the claimants ever do come back with sources, they can simply revert the deletion of their text and add citations.</dd>
