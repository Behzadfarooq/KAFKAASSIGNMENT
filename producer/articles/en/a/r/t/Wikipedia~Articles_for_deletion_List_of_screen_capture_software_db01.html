<li><b>Delete both</b>, though I'll probably get accused again of being partial in a revert war over external links in pages that I haven't even edited. Such lists <i>might</i> be borderline useful, <i>if</i> there were more bluelinks, which in this case there are not. These pages aren't encyclopedic articles themselves, nor are they particularly related to any other articles, they are mere collections, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a> applies. <a href="../../../f/e/m/User%7EFemto_bb69.html" title="User:Femto">Femto</a> 13:12, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The guideline <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html#External_link_spamming" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM#External_link_spamming</a> says "adding external links to an article or user page for the purpose of promoting a website or a product is not allowed, and is considered to be spam."

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> In response to the advertisement allegations: This article is not complete (see ToDo List), but is a work in progress on a dynamic subject that is difficult to define and categorize (help is welcome). This list of screen recording software should not be misinterpreted as an advertisement due to pricing, prices are included because cost is significant when evaluating software. They were removed once before from another page, and put back because some found them useful... see the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Talk%7EScreencast_e04d.html#External_Links" title="Talk:Screencast">Screencast Discussion</a> page. Furthermore; it took quite a bit of time &amp; energy to research &amp; compile the pricing data and software links. When looking at other Comparison pages, prices apparently can be included and are helpful when comparing features and making evaluation decisions... <b>Price</b> data is prevalent in many other 'Comparison' articles like <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_video_editing_software.html" title="Comparison of video editing software">Comparison of video editing software</a> &amp; <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_clients.html" title="Comparison of instant messaging clients">Comparison of instant messaging clients</a>. Hopefully a 'Comparison of Screen Recording Software' article can be written soon that obsoletes some of the (price) information on this 'List' page. Please advise or help write a 'Comparison of Screen Recording Software' article (I'm not great with tables), but don't delete this work based on some editor in chief, soup-nazi mentality.

<li>Dude, <b>come on.</b> Merging minor articles into a list is a long standing action. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Trek_races_8de7.html" title="List of Star Trek races">List of Star Trek races</a> for one where most races are deemed not notable enough to have their own articles.

<li><b>Comment</b> List of Star Trek races are an aspect of fiction in a notable work of fiction; they have their <a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">own guidelines</a>. This isn't comparable. I'm not sure how you can keep an article with eternal redlinks without having it become a linkfarm. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 15:33, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree that the List of Star Trek races is not comparable to these two Lists of Software. The Star Trek lists have content, are informative, and they lack any promotional external links. These two lists up for AfD are different; they have no content and their sole purpose is to be promotional. I've found that keeping external links out of software lists requires a lot of diligence. The big problem here is that one user in particular has taken an oath to be disruptive when they said <i>"Remove it if you can! I will not let you to remove external links."</i> Unfortunately a happy medium is not possible when dealing with such individuals.

<li><b>Comment</b> for another example, think of all the minor relatives of celebrities. Such people are rarely notable enough for their own articles, but they can be mentioned on the celebrity's article. There's a big leap between "item is notable enough for its own article" and "item is notable enough to be mentioned briefly in an article along with a bunch of other stuff that also doesn't deserve individual articles". <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:02, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>These are the yellow pages and the contact information is the external links. You might not see the contact information (external links) in the current versions of both pages but that's because I've been fighting a losing battle to keep them clean. Take a look at these diffs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_screen_capture_software&amp;diff=110693466&amp;oldid=110685144" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_screen_capture_software&amp;diff=110693466&amp;oldid=110685144" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_screen_recording_software&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110648732" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_screen_recording_software&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=110648732" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> as examples of what both pages recently looked like and what they will look like in the future if this AfD is rejected. In the discussion about the edit war a particularly defiant user has said <i>"Remove it if you can! I will not let you to remove external links."</i> and just above in this AfD discussion the same user basically vowed to continue this course of action until they are stopped by an arbitration committee.

<li><b>Question: Close and RFC?</b>: It seems that the articles are a "linkfarm" due to a dispute between <a href="../../../u/r/o/User%7EUrod_afcd.html" title="User:Urod">User:Urod</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/q/User%7ERequestion_f172.html" title="User:Requestion">User:Requestion</a>. Based on the comments at Talk:List of screen capture software, the articles could be taken to <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html#Request_comment_on_articles" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC#Request comment on articles</a>. As far as I can tell, <a href="../../../u/r/o/User%7EUrod_afcd.html" title="User:Urod">User:Urod</a>'s desire to keep the links in the articles is not supported by Wikipedia guidelines (specifically <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#REPOSITORY" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#REPOSITORY</a>) and I am fairly confident that an RFC will decide that the links are not to be included (except a few relevant ones in "External links" sections). Perhaps the articles should be relisted for deletion after the external links issue has been settled and the articles given a chance for improvement? -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 07:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Write new article.</b> Yeah... Where is the article defining what screen recording/capture is&#160;? (Forgive me if I missed the link).Although obvious to many computer users ... to the novice the distinctions can be confusing. These links could then be incorporated into that definition page&#160;?

<li><b><a href="../../../s/c/r/Screen_recording.html" title="Screen recording">Screen_recording</a></b> redirects to <b><a href="../../../s/c/r/Screencast.html" title="Screencast">Screencast</a></b> and many see it as an integral part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Podcasting_23c1.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Podcasting">Podcasting Project</a>. Also if anyone cared they'd review the <b><a href="../../../s/c/r/Talk%7EScreencast_e04d.html" title="Talk:Screencast">Talk:Screencast</a></b> pages for some <b>history</b> as to how this <b>List</b> came about. I don't see how this List can be deleted, when <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_software" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lists_of_software" rel="nofollow">Lists of Software</a></b> are becoming a predominate category in WP. Many are not as well developed as this one. We simply need guidance &amp; templates as to how to create these <b>Lists and Comparison</b> pages properly (no one wants to see them become link-spam &amp; propaganda). It would be a shame to delete them all! Being an IT &amp; trying to keep track of software tools &amp; development is one of the main reasons I use WP... I find these Lists and Comparison pages most useful. As time allows, I would prefer to continue to work on this &amp; add stubs to wiki articles describing some of the significant software like <a href="../../../f/f/m/FFMPEG_6846.html" title="FFMPEG">FFMPEG</a> and Istanbul_software, which doesn't have a page yet. I don't think it is a black &amp; white issue (delete or keep), the Lists exist and are a necessary part of the process to create more in depth articles. There is a methodology to creating an article on a category of software like Screencasting. This is how it is evolving:</li>
<li>Define, List features and what the product is used for. <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a></li>
<li>Describe the process for creating a product, provide access to HOWTOs &amp; Examples. <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a></li>
<li>List tools for creating a product. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_video_editing_software.html" title="List of video editing software">List_of_video_editing_software</a></li>
<li>Compare the tools. <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comparison_of_video_editing_software.html" title="Comparison of video editing software">Comparison_of_video_editing_software</a></li>
</ul>

<dd>It was never the intention of this article to create a 'link-farm', rather a source of reference for organizing &amp; defining what is Screen Recording software (similar to <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_editing_software.html" title="Video editing software">Video editing software</a>) &amp; how it can be used to create computer based Tutorials, Screencasts, Netcasts, Podcasts, CBTs... (rather hot topics), which are evolving rapidly. Unfortunately sites like tucows and freshmeat don't have collaborative wikis or the ability to categorize items the way some of the software lists have evolved on WP. So is there a recommended way to create a List of software with references and 'blue' links, short of creating a WP entry for each item? I'm still learning &amp; some 'good' examples would help. <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwildman_714d.html" title="User:Awildman">Awildman</a> 16:26, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

As <a href="../../../a/w/i/User%7EAwildman_714d.html" title="User:Awildman">Awildman</a> states, I do believe such lists are useful to gather more information regarding different subjects. Prices could (and should?) be removed, but since it's a list of software I would suggest linking to the home pages. (On a sidenote, I've just added links to the freeware version of these programs, since I naturally thought they should be there. After reading this discussion I'm not sure I did the right thing.

What are the odds of that? Something crazy is going on here.

<li>The odds could be low, but it exists, and I'm the living and awaken proof of it. I haven't been extremely active on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/" class="extiw" title="w:">w:</a> but I've been hanging about for some years, reading and browsing.

<li>A different suggestion which occured to be earlier today: Would it be possible/feasible/desirable to extend the list pages, so that in addition to having good lists like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_countries.html" title="List of countries">List of countries</a>, one could add 'Links to screen recording software'? And then establish rules for how to populate those kind of link-lists (i.e. no prices, no advertising, ...)? Cause I still think it would be nice to have those lists of links, albeit I will respect the outcome of a discussion such as this one. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolroy_8a55.html" title="User:Holroy">Holroy</a> 22:47, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
