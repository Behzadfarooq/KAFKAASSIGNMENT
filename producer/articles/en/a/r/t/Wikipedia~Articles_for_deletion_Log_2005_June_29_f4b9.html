<li><b>Keep</b>. I think the author's organization of the article is unusual by calling the examples "case studies" but if you read what he/she has done, several real IT frauds have been summarized into an article on IT fraud. IT fraud is clearly a valid topic for an encyclopedia. This is a much better start to an article than the typical one sentence stub I am used to seeing. I do think the article needs a shorter name and more introduction. <i>See</i> <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bank_fraud.html" title="Bank fraud">Bank fraud</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Email_fraud.html" title="Email fraud">Email fraud</a>, and <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phone_fraud.html" title="Phone fraud">Phone fraud</a> to name a few other examples.

<p>The arguments for and against re-creating this article as a redirect only were less clear-cut. Reviewing the comments and the evidence, I do not personally find enough evidence that this particular phrase is in sufficient use to justify the creation of the redirect.

<p>The term is only faintly attested; a Google search brings up a whopping total of 25 pages, and even some of those only happen by pure circumstance to have the terms "Sault Ste. Marie" and "greater" coexisting separately within a single page. Also, it doesn't meet the usual understanding of a <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_area.html" title="Metropolitan area">metropolitan area</a>; all of the named population centres just barely scrape 90,000 in total combined population, and <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sault_Ste._Marie%2C_Ontario_9d48.html" title="Sault Ste.

(It's not large enough; to be designated a CMA, the urban core alone -- before even factoring the outlying communities -- has to be at least 100k.) I'd suggest that any worthwhile content could be <b>merged</b> into the disambig page that already exists at <a href="../../../s/a/u/Sault_Ste._Marie_f889.html" title="Sault Ste. Marie">Sault Ste.

<li>There's no such thing as an "unofficial metroplex"; something is either a metropolitan area or it isn't. With a total combined population of just 90,000, this isn't.

<p>Yes, it was too simple, too small. Needs more work. But does not need deletion. I am not a great writer. This issue is the GREATEST thing coming our way.</p>
<p>"if someone actually manages to build such a machine": This have already been done. Wakee, Wakee. That is why we NEED this NEW PAGE. The wall between nanotechnology and so-called LIVING SYSTEMS (LIFE) has already been broken through. Most of the "WALL" still stands in the way, but it's holes for seeing throw are now getting bigger. This wall is about to be completely removed very soon. Let's not be the last to know it. Repost topic with improved format, etc. We are all still learning about this. More information will soon be on the way.</p>

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>I count 7 clear "deletes", 2 "keeps" (one from an editor who was very new to Wikipedia at the time of voting) and 3 "redirects". From the comments, I consider it clear that the "redirect" voters oppose the idea of keeping this as an independent article. Reviewing the comments and the respective articles, I find no evidence proving that this is a related concept, only the unsubstantiated claim of the article itself. On such thin evidence, I decline to create the redirect.</p>

<dd>I would not say mainstream Muslims are not peaceful. They aren't bad people, they just aren't notable... we can't say "hey these are good guys, let's give them an article and remove those of Zarqawi" because, that's not how encyclopedias work.

<p>Quran Aloner- I dont like that view. Ok if you mean criticism of Hitler, then let the article be as long as can be. Every group or religious faction should have one article and a few of it's popular followers especially the very peaceful ones.</p>

<li><i>Comment:</i> There is in fact precedent for batch nominations when the articles are significantly similar in that the arguments for deletion are appliacable as a group (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Kanji_articles_1b3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Kanji articles">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Kanji articles</a> for one recent example).

<li><i>Comment:</i> While not common, it is a tool that is used at times. Another example is <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Bob_Burns_23b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bob Burns">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bob Burns</a>. Sometimes users see a group of articles "missing" and create them all in rapid fashion, before a discussion has a chance to decide what to do with such a group. Grouping them together in on VfD allows us an opportunity to discuss them as a whole, and not repeat the same discussions in a large array of VfDs. If there is a case to be made for some of the concerned articles, it will usually be made and that article or articles treated differently. Standard VfDs are easy affairs. This type of VfD is not; undoing the work of the original author is time consumptive, and requires a significant amount of attention to detail. Nevertheless, the outcome is productive, regardless of the voted result, as it pushes us ever on to a better version of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 30 June 2005 14:04 (UTC)

<li>Without wishing to attract censure for voting twice, may I comment that I find it an interesting version of a "better encyloapedia" that removes articles which a significant minority of its readers feel are worthwhile, when the main argument against them is merely non-notability. To a tone-deaf, boring old f*rt like me, endless articles on little-known rock bands are (effectively) "cruft", but I accept that someone somewhere will want to look them up. I happen to feel that the sam can be said for locales and structures which have existed for, in some cases, 50 years, under constant development. \endrant --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 30 June 2005 17:33 (UTC)

<dd>Should you believe that an article has been deleted inappropriately, you can ask an administrator to undelete it.

It isn't really relevant in this case, because it looks unlikely that these articles will be deleted (consensus seems to be to merge).

<li>Keep &#160;: 13</li>

<p>I realize the voting has been a bit contentious. If someone feels I've placed their votes in an inappropriate category, speak up and say so. Two voters (noted with an asterisk in the table below) had votes that were unclear regarding their opinions on articles other than Watford.</p>
<p><br />
We're eight days into this VfD now, and it is likely this will close soon. While we have consensus (keep Watford, merge others), it's not a glaringly clear consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li>35% want to delete Watford, 65% keep&#160;; if we include in this the 'keep' votes as also meaning keep Watford, then it's 20% delete Watford, 80% keep which is quite clear.</li>
<li>41% for keeping all of them, 59% for merging).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most likely candidate for a merge destination is <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area_%28UK%29_9f61.html" title="Motorway service area (UK)">Motorway service area (UK)</a> (which is a stub itself).</p>
<p><br />
If anyone wants to clarify their vote further, please do so now. If anyone who has not voted wishes to speak their minds, please do so as it may help gain further consensus.</p>

<dd>In what way is a 13:19 split a consensus? <a href="../../../p/i/g/User%7EPigsonthewing_3a5b.html" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> 8 July 2005 17:53 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a>. It is up to the administrator who closes this VfD to determine whether such concensus exists. In my opinion, there's somewhat weak concensus with 59% in favor of merging the articles. If I were an administrator, I would most likely close this VfD and indicate the contents of the articles (excepting Watford) should be merged into <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area_%28UK%29_9f61.html" title="Motorway service area (UK)">Motorway service area (UK)</a>. You are welcome to disagree with me. However, I'm not the person who will be closing this VfD. I'm simply trying to clarify the situation as it stands now, in a complex situation. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 8 July 2005 19:16 (UTC)</li>

<li>As the creator of that article on Parrot Harness, I rather not vote.</li>
<li>That article was first slated for deletion because of copyviolation. Since I was the author of that article that it was supposed to violate, I find it very strange that I was accused of plagiarising myself.</li>
<li>Harness for parrots is a very serious subject in the parrot world. Are the voters, one way or other, conversant with either parrots or harness? if not, are they qualified to decide it that should be merged or deleted? On what basis have people decided that "it is not notable either way'?</li>
<li>We even have an entry for Worshipful Company of Coachmakers and Coach Harness Makers and another entry for dildo harness which surely cannot be that relevant to the world. Those did not seem to be bad jokes (which I thought they were). Yet something which are of very serious concerns to parrot lovers are now being debated to be thrown out? --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a>
<ul>
<li>As to the copyvio notice and deletion: all you had to do was to explicitly release it under GFDL on its talk page (something like this: <a href="../../../t/o/m/Talk%7ETom_Campbell_Black_9761.html" title="Talk:Tom Campbell Black">Talk:Tom Campbell Black</a>).</li>
<li>Yes, WP is a mess regarding "(something) harness" articles. I found "parrot harness" while trying to figure a way to organise it a little. Mostly because there is no <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harness.html" title="Harness">harness</a> article <i>per se</i> (it a disambig pointing to «Horse tack»).</li>
<li>Just because there is something worse it is no immediate reason to keep an article (although it is an hint to) some strange keep/delete decisions happen in grey areas...</li>

<li>I am so new to WP that I even have problem in adding to this discussion officially with date and time stamp to authenticate myself. I tried at the beginning to releae it under GFDL. But it is only now with the example of Tom Cambell Black that I think I know how that is done. In a way, I am glad that was not allowed as that meant editing would also be allowed. I would not wish for any editing from people who never have that kind of practical experience on what I have written as I stand by what I said having walked that walk. --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a></li>
<li>WoW! I did a search for "dildo harness" on Google and found 69,100 hits. So is the number of hits meant Encyclopedia is only a repository of stuff that is desired by many people so that is politically correct? Techniques and information so new that few people heard of it meant those new stuff should be merged, canned and deleted? Perhaps a new defination of encyclopedia should also be made in this encycolopedia so that uninformed people like me be better educated --<a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShanlung_4498.html" title="User:Shanlung">shanlung</a></li>

Specifically, Wikipedia is not a directory. There are millions of businesses in the world. To have entries for all of them, even just medical offices, is no different than being a directory. What makes this office encyclopedic? That it is in a potentially interesting building is not enough; the building could have an article noting the current tenants, and that's where this information should be merged if such an article exists. Another potential merge location is an article on Wandsworth Primary Care Trust, which does not exist. Failing the existence of a merge location for this article, this medical office has no place here unless there is something encyclopedic about this office that has so far not come to light. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 7 July 2005 21:01 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is relevant, because the same "these are all by the same editor, I see" murmurings and comments about vandalism and "pranks" are beginning in several VFD discussions, in the pattern that occurred last time.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Nonencyclo.

<li>Based on my interactions with SamuraiClinton/SuperDude (I brought the RFC against him), I can assure you that this is not a prank, but, as Lucky says, an example of "out-of-the-box thinking." SuperDude is an eager and enthusiastic contributor, but just has a radically different idea of what makes an article encyclopedic. <i>Could</i> he be just another troll <i>pretending</i> to be autistic? Sure, but I find that highly unlikely, and there's always <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">the need to assume good faith</a>.

<p>The result of the debate was ambiguous.</p>
<p>The community concensus is clearly against the retention of this as an independent article. The decision is about split, however, between "merge back" and "straight delete". Noting that 1) this content is already present in the history of the parent article and 2) that it has no significant independent edit history, I am going to make the administrative call that this is a "delete" decision. GFDL attribution is preserved in the main article's edit history. Whether or not this content survives as a section of the main article is an appropriate discussion for that article's Talk page and is outside the scope of this VfD decision. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:35, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>I count 3 clear "delete" votes to 2 "keep" votes.</p>
<p>Doing my own investigation, I can find little evidence of the company other than their own website and a few product reviews. I was unable to <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiable_87f6.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiable">verify</a> their claims to be a "leading" anything. They do not release financial statements, etc. I did find evidence that they are part of the <a href="http://www.canopy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.canopy.com/" rel="nofollow">Canopy Group</a> which appears to be a venture capital company. According to <a href="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000922758&amp;owner=include" class="external text" title="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0000922758&amp;owner=include" rel="nofollow">SEC filings</a>, the venture capital firm as a whole is worth about $5 million. We don't have firm guidelines for the line where companies should be included or not but based on the evidence available, I think that Maxstream currently falls well below it. I'll add my own "delete" vote to the list.</p>
<p>That brings the decision to 4 to 2 which just barely qualifies for deletion. This decision should not be seen as precedent against re-creation of the article if/when it goes public or otherwise becomes more notable than the current evidence suggests. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:29, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Keep.</b> I disagree. Teso was significant. They didn't make perfect media stunts like others in the hacker groups category, but just ask anyone who monitored BUGTRAQ back then if they remember the group. They had impact because of their releases. Also they were started in 1998, not 2000 as you wrongly claim. They are responsible for discovering and releasing many exploits and tools that are still widely in use, and/or were revolutionary. They also made the media a few times, despite not trying to, and are still quite famous for repeatedly finding and/or exploiting bugs in openbsd.</p>
<p>The original article was flagged for deletion before i could add more references. I've added some now. Maybe the article requires restructuring, or should be marked as a stub while i'm still working on it. If you need more references to evaluate TESO's significance, please google for "teso security" and "team teso".</p>
<p>Also i'd like to note that TESO had been a dangling link from List_of_hacker_and_cracker_groups as Team Teso before i renamed it and started writing the article. However, I'm not sure of List_of_hacker_and_cracker_groups's significance, as categories should take care of automatic listing. --Enki 29 June 2005 20:14 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> seems objective to me. User:Twistedflatcat 30 June 2005 01:15</li>
<li>From the Author:
<ul>
<li>6/29/05 - As the writer of this article, I am also the founder. I intend to full run based on the principles I have outlined. Unfortunately, I live in Texas, which does not favor minor candidates (nor does any state in this Union). So it is my hope that these principles are adopted nationwide beginning at the local level (which are largely non-partisan) and eventually the national level. Yes, I am only one man, and yes, the system is stacked against me, but there is an article on George Galloway, the MP from the UK, who is also the only office holder of his party. Is there any objective reason why my article cannot remain if I am not overtly promoting my party? I am merely presenting the positions and hoping it sparks some interest. I am not directing them to my website, nor asking for money. I am more than willing to re-write this article if it means it can remain. This is my first submission, and as such, I am not familiar with all the technicalities (although I attempted to read them, which is why I left the webpage off of the original article). Contact me at jj4sad6@yahoo.com if responding.
<ul>
<li>Yes. There are political parties with 1 candidate in Wikipedia. I even saved one from deletion a while back (<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Pakistan_Social_Democratic_Party_9e1f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pakistan Social Democratic Party">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Pakistan Social Democratic Party</a>). The difference between them and you is the important thing about an encyclopaedia: We are not a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Primary_source.html" title="Primary source">primary source</a>. If no-one else has ever written about your political party, then the only source of information is <i>you</i>, and anything about the party is primary source material directly from you. Everything in Wikipedia must be <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>. Party aims, membership, and policies which we only have your word for are not verifiable. We only have your word that your party even exists. Be written about by newspapers. Field candidates at elections. Get officially registered as a political party. <i>Then</i> come back for an encyclopaedia article. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> June 30, 2005 13:16 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>6/30/05 - Added an infobox, added more background information, linked page to other articles. I'm not sure how famous I can make AMP in 4 more days, but if that's what it takes to save this article, then I'll try it. I'm trying to make it as objective and informational as possible. I am not saying "Vote for me!" or "Send me money!" I have asked my supporters to post here in favor of the party just so you know it's not just me. So far, my other good friend from San Antonio has left a comment. If I am required to collect 500 votes in favor of my party to keep this informational article alive, then again, I'll do it. Once again, this comes down to the fact that I see no difference between my article and one for say the American Nazi Party, who also do not have any candidates in office to my knowledge. The only difference I see is that my party does not have the history backing it up, but it wouldn't being only 2 months old. So again, I ask that if this can be edited, you tell me what you would suggest, and I am happy to do so.</li>
<li>As one who has edited <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Galloway_f81f.html" title="George Galloway">George Galloway</a> on occasion I can say that he is an entirely different prospect. He was notable when elected to Parliament in 1987 for the Labour Party, and probably before that as a charity organiser. His party, RESPECT, has a national organisation and obtained significant votes in the June 2004 elections in the UK. He is the only RESPECT MP but they have elected members of local authorities as well. It is therefore fundamentally different to this article which is about a party which has yet to establish notability. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> <a href="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArms-westminster-lb.jpg_d0e3.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/2/21/Arms-westminster-lb.jpg/25px-Arms-westminster-lb.jpg" alt="" width="25" height="19" longdesc="../../../a/r/m/Image%7EArms-westminster-lb.jpg_d0e3.html" /></a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 30 June 2005 08:14 (UTC)</li>
<li>6/30/05 - I understand the concerns of notability, but I have read the pages concerning the deletion policy and it is a little gray on that matter. My goal is to make this an encyclopedic entry. Several of you have stated it is not and needs to be re-written. Again, I am asking for HOW you would like it to be written so as to prevent the deletion. I have read the pages for the Reform Party, the Green Party, the American Nazi Party, and a few other parties with no candidates in office and I have attempted to base my article on their example. Again, I am not trying to promote myself, just merely attempting to present the information. If re-writting the article is required, I am again asking for how you would like it rewritten. I am new here, and I have attempted to make it as objective as possible. Please help me to make it an acceptable article.
<ul>
<li>Rendering the NPOV is a cleanup/rewrite task. If you can <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECite_your_sources_2f5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Cite your sources">cite sources</a> for information about your party <i>other</i> than your own web site(s), please do, and we can work on an article that convinces editors, with citations of independent sources, that your political party actually exists on the political radar. If you cannot cite sources, then it is <i>not</i> lack of objectivity that you fail on. You've made commendable efforts to be objective. But one important facet of "promotion" is that people come here to write articles about things that <i>no-one else knows about</i>, in an effort to introduce new things into human knowledge by having them in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">That's not what Wikipedia is for</a>, no matter how objectively it is done. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> June 30, 2005 13:32 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, I am working on getting some national blogs and websites to write about my party. Would that be sufficient? It is pretty much an impossibility that I can get attention from USA Today or the Washington Post (besides, an anti-Corporation party would be counter productive to their interests).
<ul>
<li>If you get officially registered as a political party, and actually field candidates listed on ballots at elections, then that would be enough for most editors for an article on a political party. (The bar for biographical articles on individual candidates is higher, though, and generally only includes the candidates that <i>win</i> elections.) But that's in the future as yet. This discussion is about <i>now</i>, and as of now that hasn't happened. When and if your party does gain traction, come back with cited sources. Cite <i>independent</i> coverage of your party, and its election fortunes, in newspapers. Cite government web sites listing registered political parties. Cite your election results. And so forth. You should have little to no problem then. The current text will have been deleted. However, it will not be lost. To re-gain access to it, once your party has gained traction, go to <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_undeletion_ecb6.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion">Wikipedia:Votes for undeletion</a> and present the cited sources as evidence that your party has become encyclopaedia-worthy in the interim and that its article should be undeleted on "new information" grounds. If the article is undeleted, it will save you writing this text over again. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> July 1, 2005 11:28 (UTC)</li>
