<li><b>Keep</b> This is a notable issue and popular position among free market economists, historians, and others. It's hardly "fringe." Even if it were, it's still notable and therefore needs a place where it can be discussed. There is little or no "original research" there. Most everything is sourced. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:29, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> -- Creator of article RJII has a long history of disruptive behaviour on Wikipedia and POV forks is one of his tactics (see <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a>). It's getting pretty clear that he is also probably a racist <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entryist.html" title="Entryist">entryist</a> from <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront.org.html" title="Stormfront.org">stormfront.org</a>. he seems to have a interest in creating articles like these and then abuses and provocates Wikipedians. Calling state intervention and the new deal part of a practice called 'economic fascism' is simply inaccurate, POV and not taken seriously by most historians or economists. This is about the 7th highly contentious article of his put up for deletion. On his talkpage I have asked him about his edits being those of an <a href="../../../a/g/e/Agent_provocateur.html" title="Agent provocateur">Agent provocateur</a> but has refused to confirm or deny or comment on my questions. -- <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMax_rspct_e7d2.html" title="User:Max rspct"><b><font color="#A0522D" face="Cartier Book"><big>max rspct</big></font></b></a> <font size="1"><a href="../../../m/a/x/User_talk%7EMax_rspct_c799.html" title="User talk:Max rspct"><font color="red">leave a message</font></a></font> 22:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Yes it probably is about the 7th article of mine put up for deletion. The previous was <a href="../../../e/c/o/Economic_fascism.html" title="Economic fascism">economic fascism</a> and the vote was overwhelmingly to keep. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think every article I've created has survived a deletion vote. So, I must be doing something valuable. If this one doesn't survive, oh well; you can't win 'em all. But, I'm hopeful others will see the value in the existence of this article. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:08, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Aside from your paranoia about me being a secret agent, on what basis are you calling me a racist? How dare you accuse me of being a white nationalist from stormfront.org. It was me that even created the <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_anarchism.html" title="Black anarchism">black anarchism</a> article, in order to give black anarchists a voice. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 14:12, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would support a merge, but it's inevitable that the article would be chopped down and information would be lost. I think it needs its own article so the topic can really be explored in depth. Was the New Deal really modeled on Mussolini's system? Let's explore it. If not, great. I don't understand what the POV'ers are worried about --are they afraid that it actually was modeled on fascism and don't want that revealed? If so, that's a horrible anti-intellectual reason to oppose the article. Don't fear the truth. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:03, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You can't fit it in the New Deal article. That's why I made a seperate article.

<li>The article on the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> has got a section "Interpretation of the New Deal" and another section "Legacies of the New Deal".

<li>All that information won't fit. It would be too large for the article. And, the view in not "fringe."

<li><b>Comment</b>: Comparison of the proposed New Deal with actually existing forms of economic planning, including the Soviet Union, was a commonplace of the early thirties. It did not, except among the kooks and hysterics, imply any non-economic similarity; and it should be remembered that Mussolini, in particular, was being mildly praised even by Winston Churchill. The attribution to Hayek is unsourced, and unlikely. (If it is an interpretation of <i>Road to Serfdom</i>, it is original research.) Most of the rest of the aources are either out-of-context partisan comments, or obscure rightwing flakes. A PoV screed. There may be something to be said on this topic, but this is not it -therefore no vote yet. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 04:03, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

If length of article is problem, then move this and sections from <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Deal_1f5e.html" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> to under a neutral title like Critisism of New Deal. <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJni_807c.html" title="User:Jni">jni</a> 10:51, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Delete. It certainly does not fit into the New Deal article which is much more sophisticated and complex than this. (and which goves the fascism article the three sentences it deserves. The problem is that people use "fascism" today in a highly negative sense referring to wartime atrocities, but in the 1930s it had a very different technical meaning (re government control of industry). <a href="../../../r/j/e/User%7ERjensen_b7df.html" title="User:Rjensen">Rjensen</a> 23:03, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
