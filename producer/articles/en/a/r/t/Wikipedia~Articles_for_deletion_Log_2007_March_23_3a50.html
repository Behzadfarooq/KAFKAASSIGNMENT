<p>am nominating his article fo deletion. The <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notabillity criteria</a> holds that "A topic is generally notable if it has been the subject of coverage that is independent of the subject, reliable, and attributable. The depth of coverage and quality of sources must be considered in determining the number of sources required and whether the coverage establishes notability."</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">quick google search</a> finds, the only entries relevant to the object of this topic are the persons own professional homepage, departmental homepage, and her publications. There is no record of notabillity or record to support the derivation of this article, ie, that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper. A <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search of notable profiles</a> in Nature describes APOBEC3G as the most famous work of somebody called Michael Malim. There is however mention of Ann Sheehy as his post-doctoral fellow. On the above criteria, I think the article should be deleted as it is both factually wrong and does not satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notabillitycriteria</a> <a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudewheresmywallet_f1a0.html" title="User:Dudewheresmywallet">Dudewheresmywallet</a> 11:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> She is only an assistant professor, and they are not always N unless the work is particularly N. With respect to that, "no record ... that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper" is a rather remarkable assertion. Post Doc advisors and their Associates often can reasonably claim joint credit. But she has published 10 papers in 5 years, all in the very highest quality journals, and with the highest ones having, respectively, 260, 165, and 90 times. I've added them. I think that's very high counts for this stage in the career, and reflects the notability of the discovery. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:14, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Response</b> I am not sure whether the promise of her career is a suitable ground or criteria to be entered into wikipedia. As DGG says, she is only an assistant proffessor. She is not notable in that she is not <i>famous</i>, either for APOBEC3G, or any other work. She maybe a very good proffessor and researcher, but I think you will find there are hundreds of Professors and researchers and scientists all over the world doing important work. They are not notable.</dd>
<dd>Re: <i>"no record ... that she is credited with discovering APOBEC3G, other than that she's the primary author of the original paper" is a rather remarkable assertion,"</i> I do not assert it, I have <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">provided a link</a> from the journal Nature which describes the work as the most famous achievement of a Michael Malim, and describes Sheehy as his Post-doctoral fellow. Per my knowledge, I would imagine that Sheehy was probably involved extensively in the ground work and (probably a lot of)intellectual input, but the thinking, designing, conducting, supervision, and interpreting the experiment was probably by done Malim. Primary authorship of a paper is merely indicative of the author having carried majority of the ground work.</dd>
<dd>Re: She has published 10 papers in 5 years in high quality journals. This is not ground for notabillity or fame. Again going back to above argument, there are a number of people doing high quality research who have found their work published in high quality journals this very month. It is the implications of the results, and their associations with the achievement of results. APOBEC3G is described by Nature and other search engines as such. However, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">we cannot decide</a> wether or not Sheehy should be credited with discovering APOBEC3G, and have to rely on external credible sources. Searching Google with "APOBEC3G, Ann Sheehy" gives <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">this result</a> among which the first is a citation of the original paper from her own homepage, and the rest are departmental homepages , wikipedia (or mirror website) entries, or subsequent publication citations. I have already provided a <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=Nature+profile%2C+Ann+Sheehy&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">search of profiles</a> from Nature with "Nature profile, Ann Sheehy" as criteria. The result points to a profile of Michael Malim and not to one of Ann Sheehy. Lastly, I have done an additional search of "APOBEC3G, Michael Malim", the results are more comprehensive, in particular, there is a feature from News@Nature. Without taking away any credit from Sheehy for her work guys, I think she's not yet as famous as to deserve a Wikipedia article, nor is she credited as much for APOBEC3G as the article would have us believe.<a href="../../../d/u/d/User%7EDudewheresmywallet_f1a0.html" title="User:Dudewheresmywallet">Dudewheresmywallet</a> 13:15, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The points of contention are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regarding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>- She is not (at least not yet), (per above search results in Google, which only finds her own own pages, publications, and institution pages and is not mentioned in any biographical or news article, as opposed to a different individual with regards to the same discovery). She is therefore not notable. By all means, if this changes in the future, I will change my opinion. Regarding her work and notabillity: (per WP:BIO); it states that;</li>
</ul>
<p>"Creative professionals: scientists, academics, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by their peers or successors.</i>-The paper co-authored by Sheehy and others is cited, yes, Sheehy is not. No newspaper,online or journal article regarding Ann Sheehy has been located yet.</li>
<li><i>The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.</i>- Closest it come to attributing the origination of the theory, concept, whatever you call it is <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G+news+and+features&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=APOBEC3G+news+and+features&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">to a different person</a>.</li>
<li><i>The person has created a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, which has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.</i>- Not sure of APOBEC3G yet falls into this category. In addition to the argument of the preceding point re:newpaper,journal and online articles, APOBEC3G does not yet seem that significant. Certainly not like <a href="../../../d/n/a/DNA_396c.html" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="../../../m/r/i/MRI_7148.html" title="MRI">MRI</a>,<a href="../../../m/a/s/Mass_spectrometry.html" title="Mass spectrometry">Mass spectrometry</a>,<a href="../../../v/a/c/Vaccine.html" title="Vaccine">Vaccine</a>.

<li><i>The person's work either</i> (a) <i>has been displayed in a significant exhibition or as a monument</i> (b) <i>has won significant critical attention,</i> or (c) <i>is represented within the permanent collection of a significant gallery or museum of more than local significance.</i>- Again, it doesn't satisfy the first and last, and the middle is very tight to be fitted in. The original paper certainly has found quite a few citations, but it might peter out. Lastly, by calling it <i>her paper</i>, we're saying she did the work (the work that hasn't really become that noted yet, except for it's potential in HIV scientists), where as nowehere does it credit her (alone) (the HIV vaccine page does say, as I had said before, that she did to the ground work, and indicates that she was involved in intellectual input)."</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><b>Delete</b>, weakly. On the page I saw, most of its text seems to belong on a talk page rather than in an article. This seems to have always been the case. Now, the actual list of frequencies was removed, wrongly: in the USA, all radio frequencies apart from cell phones are public property, and with that exception all are open to be received by the general public. Magazines for radio hobbyinsts publish frequency lists for private radio services all the time. I used to eavesdrop on fast food order windows, myself. On the other hand, I'm not sure that Wikipedia is the right place to publish this sort of data. This is not "indiscriminate data", though. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 13:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I have not heard of "licensed private secret radio frequencies." Places like Radio Shack have long sold big directories of all sorts of radio frequencies used by private companies, transportation companies, and government agencies. Anyone with a scanner can find them and publish them, and generally federally licensed use of the airwaves is public information. I could see deleting it as a violation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Wow, it was really hard to find the text of the article from the history file. The original source info was from <a href="http://www.kc8unj.com/vx6.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.kc8unj.com/vx6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kc8unj.com/vx6.htm</a> which, when you click on it, "Does not exist." So the info also fails <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> unless a reliable source is cited for it. We shouild discourage such frequency listing because of verification problems and because they change from time to time, making it a maintenance nightmare, and because of the literal millions of entries worldwide that might result. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 01:13, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the issue here is not whether it could be cleaned up or not, but whether the church is notable enough, at the moment, to warrant a page in an encyclopedia. Adding outside, independent sources that make a case that the church is notable in some way would help this article immensely. However, a quick Google search will show that the only sources other than Wikipedia mirrors and Wikipedia itself that mention Somanorth are the church's own website. This is patently not notable. It is entirely possible that you are a member of this church or some other interested party. Please understand that a desire to see this church have a page in Wikipedia is objectively not, in itself, a reason to have one. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScienter_8af3.html" title="User:Scienter">Scienter</a> 14:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I replaced the speedy tag the first time the creator removed it. The creator (wrongly of course) pulled the tag a second time. However, I did not replace it on this occasion because by then the article had been hanging around for two days and no admin had been prepared to touch it. I think it was correct not to speedy it; the page asserts notability and seems factual - no more of an advert than any article for a commercial organisation. As a Brit I have no expertise to judge gun clubs but if as the source says this is the 'nation's largest indoor shooting range' then, presuming there are a lot of them, that seems pretty notable to me. At present it needs a good dose of sourcing but that is a different issue. I am withholding a 'vote' until I have seen more discussion. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 03:17, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional keep</b> contingent on reliable sourcing. The assertion of notability is very weak - the claim is supported by <i>some</i> websites I found in a search. Confusing the issue however is the fact that numerous websites made varied claims regarding the size of the facility, ranging from "Largest indoor shooting range in the nation" to "Largest public shooting facility in the world". Which, if any, is left rather unclear by a lack of compelling authoratative evidence pointing one way or the other. If no reliable sourcing can be added by the end of this AfD then I support a <b>delete</b>, however. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 16:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I didn't see any counterclaims in a google search for "largest indoor shooting range," and that claim is cited in the article.

<li><b>Delete and Comment</b> While the article is patent listcruft and should be deleted, the shortcomings of Entertainment Weekly aren't what should be on trial here, but the fitness of the article to remain. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPat_Payne_b797.html" title="User:Pat Payne">Pat Payne</a> 20:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - must we be so paranoid-defensive here? If it was objectively measured - say, I dunno, by doing a LexusNexis style search, or by hooking people up to a sophiscated biorhythmic MRI contraption and having them watch movies - it'd be of an encyclopedic nature. For example, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_the_United_States_and_Canada_d6ed.html" title="List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada">List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada</a> is a <b>Keep</b>, even though I personally can only call four out of the fifty movies on the list "good movies". Thus, what you somehow gleam as "shortcomings" are in fact exactly what's on trial. Jesus. --Action Jackson IV 01:50, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - "final appearances" in comic books are rarely if ever final. Additionally, the list could theoretically capture any charatcer who appears in a single issue or handful of issues, making the list indiscriminate and nigh-boundless.

<p><b>Delete</b> - there are tens of thousands of characters in Marvel comics, making this list almost boundless in scope. Information on the origins of characters often appear in multiple issues, either with additional details emerging or origins being retconned completely. Unmaintainable list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 02:05, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> Actually, I'd say this list could be kept bounded, by limiting it to Marvel Comics characters with a Wikipedia article. It might eventually lead to a long list, as there's a lot of potential for content, but that can be said about almost any subject. Furthermore, I'd say that your characterization of this list is incorrect. It doesn't seem to be a page about the origins so much as the first appearances. Though in that case, it'd be redundant to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_first_appearances_in_Marvel_Comics_publications_5cef.html" title="List of first appearances in Marvel Comics publications">List of first appearances in Marvel Comics publications</a>. I suppose folks could be going for some sort of difference between the two, as there are some cases where the two things don't overlap, but I don't know if that warrants two separate pages. BTW, there was a prior discussion on this at this page <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:34, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as an indiscriminate collection of information. What next, List of costumes in Marvel Comics publications or List of secret identities in Marvel publications? Superheroes periodically have their origin stories changed; should this list contain the first story, the most recent story, or all of them?--<strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User%7ENydas_f9e8.html" title="User:Nydas">Nydas</a></strong><a href="../../../n/y/d/User_talk%7ENydas_f93e.html" title="User talk:Nydas"><sup>(Talk)</sup></a> 08:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The first example you give is a bit hard to fathom, since while it is something that should reasonably belong on the character's page, I don't think you could make it an effective list. The example of secret identities is certainly worth considering though, it might make for a good article. Don't see why having a changed origin matters, it's possible to cover a lot of information on a list. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 16:40, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Number of magazine features can contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see WP:BIO) and the prolificness of their work and can be used in conjunction with more valid criteria of either WP:PORNBIO or WP:BIO to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn in general, or anything else for that matter. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources in conjunction with other reliable sources, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites alone are not acceptable as reliable sources. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:41, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Copy-pasting my <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mia_Banggs_6904.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mia Banggs">EXACT wording from a different case where I voted delete</a>, especially in a case where it isn't even really relevant to the comment made or the discussion at hand, is not going to help prove your point. In fact, this comment further supports my argument for a keep. Granted, the sources are not entirely in place, but given that the magazine features exist, they could easily be found and added. I make a good faith effort to expand upon and/or confirm the notability of EACH of the articles that I vote on in ANY AfD, especially in cases where it could go either way. From now on, please at least form an original argument instead of spamming AfDs with someone else's words. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 22:22, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>With the exception of using a personalized reason for speedy deletion, I don't think I could do my usual tagging of this article as "unremarkable".

Also, this article has been around since September, 2005. It's the AfDs that are showing up, not the "porn."

<li><b>Delete</b> Number of films in a genre can contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see WP:BIO) and the prolificness of their work and can be used in conjunction with more valid criteria of either WP:PORNBIO or WP:BIO to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn in general, or anything else for that matter. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources in conjunction with other reliable sources, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites alone are not acceptable as reliable sources. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> digging around and pondering this issue, perhaps the problem is the name. A list with every appearance of a vampire would indeed be endless but there are also comics where the vampire if a major character in the series (like Blade, Angel, Fiends of the Eastern Front, etc.) and there aren't countless throngs of these. I am unsure if this was the intent of the list but I'd suggest it would be worthwhile refocusing this and moving it to Vampire comics where it could become a decent entry.

<li><b>Keep</b> although the article needs quite a lot of work. A chronological list would be of interest because until the early 1970's, the <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comics_Code_567f.html" title="Comics Code">Comics Code</a> forbade depictions of "living dead" in Code-approved comics, with the result that for example <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marvel_Comics_b294.html" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> was not permitted to depict a character called "the Zombie." I believe <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tomb_of_Dracula_e3d3.html" title="Tomb of Dracula">Tomb of Dracula</a> (1972) was the first post-Code comic from a mainstream publisher to depict a vampire after the rules were changed. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 23:57, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> Now this is interesting information. I am against this simply being a list but if you can source that information it could form part of a useful entry probably at Vampire comics. So I'd lean towards moving it or at least taking the information and starting another entry that isn't a list.

<li>Yes we do. Revising history in a discussion is strongly frowned upon throughout Wikipedia, see <a href="../../../t/a/l/WP%7ETALK_766c.html#Own_comments" title="WP:TALK">WP:TALK#Own comments</a>. And it helps make it clear that you're not an experienced editor, and may not be overly familiar with wikipedia policies, guidelines and precedents, which might well be relevant (at the least, it might affect how closely someone wants to study your nominations before forming a conclusion). LaMenta3 is quite right to point it out, although it doesn't seem unduly significant in this particular case. Anyway, please stop doing that.

<p><b>Delete</b> - trivial beyond belief. That Stan Lee or some other editor or whoever called someon by an adjectival name once or frequently is a ridiculous criterion for a list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - One can't dismiss the context. These endearments were part of the direct reason that Marvel went from a minor upstart with eight titles a month to a pop-culture conglomerate. It wasn't just the quality of the stores -- lots of critically acclaimed comics, movies, TV shows, etc. never find success -- but from the deliberately familial sense that these endearments created. Aside from the importance as an historical marketing tool, many (such as "Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man") have entered the popular lexicon. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 04:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Trivial. Tenebrae's argument would best apply to an article on the usage of the nicknames, provided sources discussing the phenomenom could be found. <a href="../../../m/a/x/User%7EMaxamegalon2000_b578.html" title="User:Maxamegalon2000">Maxamegalon2000</a> 05:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b> If all of these are by Stan Lee (and so far as I know they are), then <b>merge</b> to his article, or <b>rename</b> to make it clear that we're talking about his practices, not Marvel's per se, even if they have adopted them. I'd say that would be a reason to cover the practice in his article, since influencing a major comic book publisher is a notable act in itself. I don't know if somebody has covered this in any Stan Lee biographies off-hand, but it certainly seems possible. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 05:23, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I can see how this has some value. But that value is geared more towards an encyclopedia covering either comic books or marvel specifically. In a general use encyclopedia it seems out of place. Also, looking at the guide lines for the creator articles (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>) and character article (<a href="../../../c/m/c/WP%7ECMC_eb00.html" title="WP:CMC">WP:CMC</a>) it seems the inclusion of "nicknames" is frowned on in those places. Since that is where you would normally expect to find this stuff, this list begins to look very out of place.<br />
(<i>Note:</i> the character nicknames were not limited to use in the editorial texts, they permeate the scripted dialogues through out the comics in question. I'm surprised that Hulk's terms for other characters didn't make the list.) — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 05:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> You need to know the context. These are a bigger piece of comics history than people who haven't read as many comics might realize. I'm not sure "endearments" is the best term for these nicknames, but these expressions played a surprisingly important role in distinguishing Marvel Comics from its rivals back then. And to address Manticore's question, no, these do not all come from Stan. Often they were originated by Roy Thomas and other writers and editors of the time. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 05:42, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Comment</b></s> <b>Delete and Merge</b> All the points given above are correct as these endearments played an important role in recognizing these important comicbook people. But question is, do we need a separate endearment article? or couldnt we just <b>merge</b> these endearments to their respective owners? PS: i suggest that they be included in their infoboxes <a href="../../../b/l/o/User_talk%7EBloodpack_3533.html" title="User talk:Bloodpack"><span style="color:#fff;background:#800">†B<span style="background:#a00">lo<span style="background:#c00">o<span style="background:#d00">d</span>p</span>ac</span>k†</span></a> 05:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That <i>may</i> work for the real people under "Psuedonames", but I still believe that is not wholly in line the Biographies guides. The characters though is a non-starter. There is a strong sentiment in the Comics project <i>not</i> to have these types of nicknames in the 'box. — <a href="../../../j/_/g/User%7EJ_Greb_e233.html" title="User:J Greb">J Greb</a> 05:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think I already know why and its probably the <i>same</i> reason it shouldnt have an article about endearments. If it cant be included in infoboxes, then the more of it if it has an article (endearments).

<li><b>Keep</b> - One could also make a DC version of this page (though it'd likely be shorter). Just for Superman we have such names as: The big red S, The big blue boyscout, the man of steel, the man of tomorrow, the last son of krypton, etc. Then Batman: The Dark Knight, The Dark night detective, The caped crusader, etc. (And not forgetting the boy wonder, of course). How about Capt. Marvel as the Big red cheese? Or the Phantom as the ghost who walks? I think that a list of such names is a great way to be able to look them over as a group. And marvel (through Stan Lee) <i>did</i> have a "way with words" when it came to describing the characters. I do agree with the poster above though that I wouldn't mind a rename if we could come up with something better than "endearments". - <a href="../../../j/c/3/User%7EJc37_cfd0.html" title="User:Jc37">jc37</a> 09:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Move.</b> I'll grant that maybe the list doesn't deserve its own article, but it should be incorporated into another article. As for the importance of the endearments in boosting Marvel's popularity...I can't remember the actual title (so this isn't really much of a reference), but there was a coffee-table book on the history of Marvel up to about 1990 (I think it was released in 1991, as it was the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the Silver Age) and the author mentioned at one point about how personalising the Marvel bullpen endeared the staff to readers, and by implication, this increased the company's popularity.The Drainpipe 00:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Move</b> The above editor is thinking of <i>Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics</i>, by Les Daniels (Harry N. Abrams, New York, 1991) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-8109-3821-9</a>, which does, indeed, write about the catchphrases and endearments being part of "Marvelmania". "Origins of Marvel Comics" by Stan Lee (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1975) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-7851-0579-4</a>, and <i>Tales to Astonish: Jack Kirby, Stan Lee and the American Comic Book Revolution</i> by Ronin Ro (Bloomsbury, 2004) <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1-58234-345-4</a> also talk about it. I'm thinking the article might be more appropriate as a section with Marvel Comics.

<dd>Regardless of what else you argue, please don't argue that an article should be kept because some other article exists. Articles stand and fall on their own and the existence of one article has nothing to do with whether another article should exist. As far as the references go, they don't establish the necessity of a separate list article for the endearments themselves. The existence of the endearments may itself be somewhat notable but, again, a listing of every single time that an alliterative word got attached to someone's name in a comic is not. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:02, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and merge</b> - Normally I might say it needs to go, but these can be cited and put into context by being added to the Marvel Comics article as part of a style section. These are part of how Marvel defined itself in the 1960s, along with Stan's Soapbox and the interaction of the Marvel Bullpen with the fans and characters. It's actually a pretty important detail to Marvel Comics; it just needs to be put into context, which can be done. --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisGriswold_2071.html" title="User:ChrisGriswold">Chris Griswold</a> (<big><a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChrisGriswold_df5d.html" title="User talk:ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:red">☎</span></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_ChrisGriswold_d1f8.html" title="Special:Contributions/ChrisGriswold"><span style="color:black">☓</span></a></big>) 13:38, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The present text, title, (I brought its preciousness and vagueness up on the article's discussion page a while back), and treatment of the article is embarrassing, but the topic itself seems valid. The article attempts to describe part of a popular and distinctive literary style. Stan Lee the stylist has been appreciated, loved, imitated, disliked and mocked by writers, editors and readers for decades. If he's important in his sphere as a stylist, then that style should be relevant. In hindsight I regret exerting so little effort to improve some of the article's obvious defects: for example the article's current 'Cultural influence' section contains a sub trivial example. --AC 08:03, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Advertisement masquerading as an article". The "article" does not establish notability other than being a brand of creatine. The information used to assert notability is unsourced, or is simply marketing that was used by the manufacturer itself about its own product. There is already two articles about <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatine.html" title="Creatine">creatine</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creatine_supplements.html" title="Creatine supplements">creatine supplements</a>.

<p>A character created on a message board which doesn't seem to be verifiable or having. There was a VFD 2 years ago <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_1-san_6857.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/1-san">here</a>. Seems like if some sort of reliable source was available on the subject, it would've been noted already. There's already a mention of it in the 2ch article and I don't think this passes <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> on its own so <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 21:52, 16 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I've read over both the article and the previous deletion discussion, and I understand the arguments that led to the "keep" result. It might be notable, its totally out of my field of interest or expertise so I don't know, but the problem is it has no sources at all and therefore is deletable as original research. Correct me if I'm wrong. --<a href="../../../t/r/a/User%7ETractorkingsfan_8ee9.html" title="User:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="black">Tractor</font></a><a href="../../../t/r/a/User_talk%7ETractorkingsfan_0b20.html" title="User talk:Tractorkingsfan"><font color="green">kings</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Tractorkingsfan_5bb2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Tractorkingsfan"><font color="red">fan</font></a> 20:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If this is notable, someone with knowledge of the subject should be able to come up with references to prove it. <b>Delete</b> if that hasn't happened by the time this AfD expires. --<b><a href="../../../s/e/l/User%7ESelket_adc6.html" title="User:Selket">Selket</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/l/User_talk%7ESelket_51a5.html" title="User talk:Selket">Talk</a></sup> 01:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Ok I fixed the reference for the Japanese wiki as for some reason it was not showing up. I also added a few external links to flash pages with videos of 1-san and a small Java (i think its Java anyway) game. I am not sure what the policy on foreign language Wikipedia pages as references is but I hope this helps. I am not a huge fan of this character or anything, I'd just prefer to expand an article than to delete it if I can.

<li>I also just added the actual ASCII art in question. I feel it adds a bit to the article and as it is obviously not copyrighted I don't think there is a problem there. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColincbn_23f0.html" title="User:Colincbn">Colincbn</a> 13:42, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I honestly don't know why I am spending so much time on this (maybe be cause he's so darn cute) but I added some "see also" pages and a few more links. I would like to cite some more references but they are all in Japanese. I also did a bit of clean up. I hope this is enough to qualify as a "keepable" article now. If not I would appreciate a push in the right direction. Just let me know what is needed and I will try to find it before this AfD runs its course. I would hate to be wasting my time, however I have a bad feeling that that is exactly what I am doing. but, meh.

<p>Good Lord, I hardly know where to begin with this.

I was going to speedy delete them, but there's so many that I figured bundling them in an AfD would be better, just on the off chance they're legit.

<li><b>Delete</b> Refs have nothing to do with the subject of the page. The comparison of political data is inherently original research, and seems unrelated to sports rivalries. Should we have articles for every intraregional rivalry? South Jersey vs. North Jersey, Manhattan vs. Staten Island, Upper East Side vs. Upper West Side, etc. etc. etc.? <a href="../../../f/e/e/User%7EFeeeshboy_7ba0.html" title="User:Feeeshboy">Feeeshboy</a> 05:20, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. That there is a strong division in terms of political and social ideologies between North and South California is fairly beyond questioning. That they do not see eye to eye on every topic and some sort of "rivalry" exists is also fairly obvious. Even more blatant, however, is the fact that this is completely <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and should be deleted. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 17:13, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, an article on the <i>rivalry itself</i> is not notable as this sort of regional division is common in larger states; e.g. New York has <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_City_1428.html" title="New York City">New York City</a> and <a href="../../../u/p/s/Upstate_New_York_7a34.html" title="Upstate New York">Upstate New York</a>, but we don't have a "New York City-Upstate New York rivalry" article.

<p>I'm struggling to find the words to say. This article just seems so <i>stupid</i>. They're just common words that happen to end up said together, how does that warrant an article? What next? articles for good boy, good time, and good job? In technical terms, the article seems to be nothing more than dictdefs and an impossible to prove <s>entomology</s> etymology.

I think, however, that a merge to 1066 could lose other uses.

<p>Not notable. Completely unknown in Russia as a poet. Hasn't published a single collection of poems, nor has he poems published in any major Russian magazine. He has mostly published his ARTICLES and TRANSLATIONS from American poetry. I have no problems with him being gay but he is listed here as a well-known poet, which he isn't. Far from it. It is hard to understand how come this article has been here that long. Don't confuse him with Mikhail Kuzmin, the prominent Russian poet of the beginning of the 20th century who well deserves to be listed in Wikipedia (incidentally, Mikhail Kuzmin was also Homosexual). The only claim for notability is the Andrey Bely Prize for his contribution as an ORGANISER of literary events.

<li><b>Comment:</b> He has, indeed, and it is very critical of him. Quoting from there: "Dmitry Kuzmin is a former administrator of Russian Wikipedia (January 2006 - August 2006). He was banned from Wikipedia in August 2006 by the Arbitrary Board of Russian Wikipedia for repetedly offending writers and abusing his power as administrator. Several cases resulted in court cases against Dmirty Kuzmin". Further on, Russian Wiki says: "Many prominent Russian critics described him as untalented writer, notably Dmitry Bykov, Mikhail Kotomin, and Marina Kulakova. Dmitry Bykov calls his work "a schoolboy's poetry". In the quoted article the critic goes on to say that there's no point in discussing Dmitry Kuzmin, as this man only wrote a few poems lacking any glimpse of originality, and hasn't published anything significant yet. He hasn't authored even one book. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> 22:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Strong <b>Keep</b> for the same reasons he was kept the first time, but I want to add that the way he is quoted in <a href="http://www.berlinerzimmer.de/eliteratur/schmidt_russlit.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.berlinerzimmer.de/eliteratur/schmidt_russlit.htm" rel="nofollow">this German article</a>, suggests he was rather notable in 2001. Once notable, always notable - was that not the rule? It is true that Google does not tell the correct story when you google for "Dmitry Kuzmin" (there are others with that name, but he is also named Dimitri Kuzmin, Dmitri Vladimirovitch Kuzmin, ...) but when I google in Cyrillic for "Кузьмин Дмитрий Владимирович " -wiki -Караваев and "Кузьмин Дмитрий Владимирович " -wiki -Караваев (excluding Wikipedia and another older poet with the same name, I get 561 googles.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Disregard this! The German article is not about Dmitry Kuzmin. He is only mentioned briefly as "poet and critic Dmitry Kuzmin", that's all. He is NOT quoted in the article. The man quoted in that paragraph is Jewgeny Gorny, a reputable philologist who comments on the Russian Internet literature, and not on Kuzmin. Anyone who has German can check it up in the article. Any claim of Kuzmin's notability on these grounds is simply not on.<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> 22:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This is a German journalist interviewing Jewgeny Gorny and asking him out of the blue what he thinks about Dmitry Kuzmin's ideas about Russian literature and the internet. The name Kuzmin is thus mentioned three times in the article. In other words, if Jewgeny Gorny is deemed reputable, in the journalist's eyes Kuzmin is as reputable. This is proof that in 2001 people outside Russia and the former Soviet Union knew about him. Once reputable, always reputable. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 23:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment:</b>Google hits for Dmitry Kuzmin: 2 (two!) In Russian, "Кузьмин Дмитрий Владимирович": 15 (fifteen!). Pan Gerwazy comes up with 561 hits, however he counts the hits for everybody by the name Kuzmin, which is one of the most common names in Russia. This man is Kuzmin Dmitry Vladimirovich, but Pan Gerwazy counts the links also for Kuzmin Dmitry Valerievich, Dmitry Sergeevich, Dmitry Nikolaevich, etc. What have they got to do with our man? <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> 22:02, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"<b>Answer</b>: everything. Have a good look at my quote - if you put the three names together between quotation marks, you cannot find what <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> claims, because someone like Kuzmin Dmitry Valerievich will not show up. Note that my googles also exclude Wikipedia mirrors and a guy who by sheer coincidence happens to share the three same names, but who in order to be distinguished from our man, nowadays gets "Караваев" (Karavayev or Karavaev") added to his name. So that <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> understands what I am talking about, I add the two links (we need two links, because there are two <b>main</b> ways of ordering the names):</li>

<li>Tentative <b>keep</b>. Kevin Moss, editor of an English-language anthology of Russian gay verse, writes: "A few serious gay writers have appeared on the Russian literary scene as well. Among these, the most noteworthy are poets Dmitry Kuzmin and Yaroslav Mogutin, and Alexei Rybikov..." (p. 759 of <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0-815-31880-4</a>) So it appears he has some importance (as a big fish in a small pond perhaps, but even so). There may not be enough English-language sources to write much of an article, but sources don't have to be in English. His history with the Russian Wikipedia is neither here nor there, really. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 01:05, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> A poet can be chiefly notable as a translator. . I accept the view above as being a big fish in a little pond, and that is sufficient. We should not be second guessing the quality of his verse--or indeed of his translations. The ru WP article shows him to be a notably difficult literateur, but that's still notable. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 07:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> He might be a translator, but he isn't prolific, nor is he notable - none of his translations were published in book-form. One thing is quite clear: this man isn't a notable poet. Where are his books? His publications in reputable magazines? This pond you're talking about looks more like a puddle, and the smell coming from it isn't very enjoyable. You also talk about the quality of his verse - have you read them? I have (it was hard to find work of this "notable poet", though.) My teenage students write much better, I can assure you. So why is this article here, in the first place? What an amazing string of biased 'keep's!! <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickedPetya_2c0e.html" title="User:WickedPetya">WickedPetya</a> 11:39, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Previously deleted by <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Hannah_Hobley_4d38.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hannah Hobley">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hannah Hobley</a>. Two articles: one says that Hannah Hobley is an actress who plays Chantelle Garvey, the other says that Chantelle Garvey is a character played by Hannah Hobley. And that, literally, is it. No evidence that this (very young) actress has achieved multiple non-trivial coverage in reliable independent secondary sources. These, and one-liners on a couple of other characters, are the only work of the user who created them. Previous versions have been created by the actress herself, which invites suspicion when an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> is the creator this time round. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 07:32, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Actually there is considerable evidence that this actress has achieved mulitiple coverage. As well as her IMDB entry, just do a Google search on her name and there are umpteen references to the actress and the character she plays in online TV magazines such as the Radio Times etc. The ITV and Tiger Aspect websites have both references and pictures of her also.

<ul>
<li>Whereas I would define major as having been described as major by reliable secondary sources. And I would also describe a significant actress as having been described as significant by reliable secondary sources. You can see where this is headed, can't you? And that's cast <i>including</i> not cast <i>of</i> well-known British comic actors (and Johnny Vegas, who must have a talent for something, I just haven't spotted what it is yet). Appearing in a show with big names does not make you a big name. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well I wasn't suggesting that this actress was a 'big name' and I was actually replying to a question about Benidorm the TV series , not the actress under discussion. I would say that being a principal cast member in an ITV1 show certainly is notable under Wikipedia rules and those rules don't require you to be a 'big name' actor to be worthy of a wikipedia article. I notice you haven't replied to my questions about why the ITV website and Tiger Aspect website are not (in your opinion) good enough to be considered as reliable secondary sources. Oh and you also haven't responded to my question about you mentioning her age. I wonder, are you a frustrated performer of some kind? You can see where I'm heading with this can't you?

<li>Two things first, speedy keep is an invalid&#160;!vote here; second, who says major character? Not the reliable secondary sources (of which none are cited in the article). The <i>major</i> parts are listed in the article for the show. Who says major show? The time slot says otherwise.

<dd><b>Comment</b> "The time slot says otherwise" - Huh? <i>Benidorm</i> was on at 10pm, generally ITV's highest-rating slot after 7-8pm (which contains <a href="../../../c/o/r/Coronation_Street_d8ea.html" title="Coronation Street">Coronation Street</a> and <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmerdale.html" title="Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a>) - and had to go out after 9pm at any case due to the UK's watershed rules. Not saying it wasn't an <i>awful</i> programme but it was certainly a major one, given that it was flavour-of-the-month Johnny Vegas's first mainstream sitcom; the only issue is whether her part in it is enough to make her notable given her lack of other experience. IMO the fact that ITV lists her as one of the main credits on their website is enough to make her so, even if the article does need a huge fleshing-out. <font face="Trebuchet MS">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 22:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><small>Real96 The deletion policy is clear when it states "Pages that can be improved should be edited or tagged, not nominated for deletion". Also, What are you stating here? Because (Veteran Wika Archivist) is a "new" user he is not right in what he is/was doing? This user saw the need to edit this page, as it was obviously compiled by somebody within Break.com (with all the self back patting within its content). You have only been with us a few months yourself. This should never have been marked for deletion when only a clean up was necessary. I will recommend to Wiki admin that new members be restricted in these processes in future.</small></li>

<li><small>Veteran Wika Archivist 18:33, 23 March 2007 (UTC) Response to the statement above regarding my contributions. I have been with Wikipedia for over 3 years and due to the nature of the recent amendments I have made to the Break.com page, am unable to use my real username without exposing myself to Break.com. Hence, my commitment to Wikipedia has spanned longer than a few months! I believe in telling both sides of a story for TRUE historical value! The Break.com page was nothing more than an <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertisement.html" title="Advertisement">advertisement</a> before my amendments, and now reflect the true Break.com. Wikipedia has always been about ACCURACY, TRUTH and FACT! we cannot and MUST not show bias as editors!</small></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><small>A fine example of the bias I am refering to can be seen on the <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_Beattie_96de.html" title="Peter Beattie">Peter Beattie</a> page. This page is obviously edited by one of Mr Beatties 150 strong media entourage as it only reflects the few achievements of the Beattie government, not the current woes faced by Queensland under his rule. Editors need to have a very close look at this page. Whenever any of us try to ammend this page our work is undone within a matter of hours. Is this what Wikipedia is about? NO! Please have a good think about this. When you get to my age you will appreciate my concerns.</small></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Recent amendments I have added to this page have shown this site up for what it really is. I agree, it was originally an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement</a> probably set up by an employee of break.com, but now amongst the original self "back patting" the truths are coming out, thus, I strongly recomend we leave it in here. may teach them a valuable lesson! There are more to come! I also suggest that whilst these truths have been exposed, the page should be LOCKED. I also suggest Wikipedia barr the IP of the person who originally submitted this <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> from this page.</dd>

Break.com has always portrayed itself as a squeaky clean site for kids. My recent modifications to this <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">advertisement/spam</a> has exposed this site for what it really is.

<li><b>Keep</b> agree with DGG. Alexa rank of 73 in the US is a strong indicator of notability. I think many of the comments here reflect an anti-commercial bias.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While People coverage is generally a big deal, Disavian, I think in this case IMDB is wrong. Why would spanish language People magazine cover a Hungarian porn star?

<li>That's not what I said. She doesn't have an IMDB article because all of her work has either been in print or on the internet. The print work establishes her notability as a fitness model, as the magazines she posed for are relatively notable in their genre. She has a strong web presence with three separate sites which are mostly independent of each other. Her main website has been in existence and regularly updated for 5 years -- a long time for any website, let alone a porn website. This suggests that she has a rather significant following through this site if it has been able to sustain for so long. She also has a website where she offers video lessons and other resources teaching <a href="../../../f/e/l/Fellatio.html" title="Fellatio">fellatio</a> techniques and a non-spam/splog, regularly updated blog which makes references to her main website, but operates mostly independently of it.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 02:56, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Not notable. According to IMDb, she has appeared in 25 porn movies but by porn star standards, that isn't particularly notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> The filmography in the article shows two releases named after her (<a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> Q3), an the article also shows that she was on the cover of a magazine that is notable enough to have a Wikipedia article itself. This suggests the appearance in many other notable magazines, as this tends to be a prerequisite to getting on the cover of any notable magazine in any genre. So she also passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Only thing I can add to LaMenta's discussion is the fact that the Doc Johnson company has issued an artificial vagina named and modeled after her.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I've cleaned up and referenced this article a bit, and it appears that she has been in a large number of films (87 US releases and at least 26 European releases), which satisfies <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> Q2, and she appears to be rather prolific in both the big bust and anal subgenres.

<li>Number of films in a genre can contribute to a porn star's prolificness, and certainly more so than the Google test, which on its own is unquestionably invalid, but it does speak to both the size of an entertainer's fanbase/following (see WP:BIO) and the prolificness of their work and can be used in conjunction with more valid criteria of either WP:PORNBIO or WP:BIO to make a determination of whether they have a significant following and/or are prolific in any genre. This actress doesn't even seem to be prolific in porn in general, or anything else for that matter. I can't find anything about this actress other than her IMDB (and similar) profiles and some minor mentions/inclusions on spammish porn sites. She doesn't even have a website of her own. While even that is not an immediate grounds for inclusion/exclusion, again, it is a piece of evidence that needs to be looked at as a part of a whole. All of the sources in this article are IMDB (or similar) and while such sites may be used as sources in conjunction with other reliable sources, including the actress' own website, if she has one, as this is an article about a person and would be considered a primary source provided the information is neutral, and preferably at least one third-party reliable source, IMDB-ish sites alone are not acceptable as reliable sources. <a href="../../../e/p/b/User%7EEpbr123_cec0.html" title="User:Epbr123">Epbr123</a> 20:38, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I understand that. To elaborate: I am worried that his reputable academic work could be used as a Trojan horse to allow for his crankish material to be given space on the site. Look at his awards and grants: he basically drops off the radar at the beginning of this decade—I'm assuming because he decided "the extraterrestrial presence" was more important than peace studies.

<dd>Thank you for digging up reviews. I still tend toward "successful, but not exceptional" academic, but can see a contrary argument. His "conversion" only makes him more notable, IMO, if third parties have deemed it so.

<p>Jones' only appearance is Donald Duck comics, and the only info you can get there is how much he hates Donald, doesn't deserve his own article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheBlazikenMaster_31da.html" title="User:TheBlazikenMaster">TheBlazikenMaster</a> 11:22, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>He might be notable, but does he have any appearance besides the Donald Duck comics?

<dd>I know he appeared in both comic books and newspaper comic strips. I'm not sure whether the character was translated to animation (1952's "The New Neighbor" short uses another neighbour, Pete). Even if he appeared in print only, he has a long history and some worthy references, including <i>Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1578068584</a>) and <i>Carl Barks: Conversations</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1578065011</a>). Also, <a href="http://duckman.pettho.com/characters/jones.html" class="external text" title="http://duckman.pettho.com/characters/jones.html" rel="nofollow">this page</a> gives his name in some of the foreign-language versions, so it might be possible to find even more sources under some of those. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 18:11, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Unnecessary article with almost no content.

<dd>Uh-oh, this is bad.

<p>This list does not simply list Fellows of the Royal Society. It does not simply list, say, atheists. It does not simply list Christian apologists. It tries to synthesise information about people who fit into one category with what if anything they have said about religious matters, then does not simply list people who are both FRSs and willing to state their religious beliefs in public but also subcategorises them according to belief - all apparently to demonstrate some point (see the discussion on the talk page). This looks like someone's pet research project designed to push a point that they want to establish (apparently that most FRSs who have spoken up about religion have been favourable to it). Such an exercise is POV-pushing and inherently involves original research. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetamagician3000_fe68.html" title="User:Metamagician3000">Metamagician3000</a> 10:58, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I have no problem with a list of Jewish fellows unless it was then further grouped so instead of being alphabetical it was further sorted by what religion they were. For instance <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harold_Kroto_daa3.html" title="Harold Kroto">Harold_Kroto</a> is simply listed under <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Fellows_of_the_Royal_Society_2700.html#K" title="List of Jewish Fellows of the Royal Society">K</a> whereas you would have him under "Atheist". It is this further separation that is when the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> kicks in.

<dd><b>Comment</b> NBeale misses the point completely. The lists he shows are facts and inclusion is unequivocal - either they are or they aren't. For this list there is subjectivity (the font from which OR spills) as the term "public religious stances" could be interpreted many ways - could just attending church regularly be taken as a "public religious stance"? <a href="../../../s/o/p/User%7ESOPHIA_915a.html" title="User:SOPHIA"><font color="purple"><b>Sophia</b></font></a> 09:13, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Tks Sophia. If <b>that's</b> the problem let's clarify (rename if necessary) that the "stance" is that recorded in their WP Article (based on reliable sources)- hence no OR here. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 10:03, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> NBeale also fails to point out that the lists he uses as examples i.e. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_HIV-positive_people_232c.html" title="List of HIV-positive people">List of HIV-positive people</a> fails to include HIV-negative people, and that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dartmouth_College_alumni_c27d.html" title="List of Dartmouth College alumni">List of Dartmouth College alumni</a> fails to include other College alumni and that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Ohio_county_name_etymologies_5777.html" title="List of Ohio county name etymologies">List of Ohio county name etymologies</a> doesn't include other counties. I'm all for a list of religious stances but atheism isn't a religious stance. To be religious it has to have a belief in and worship of a supernatural entity (or entities and they need not be a "god" in the theist sense e.g. Buddhists). Dawkins (the target of this article) as far as I know is approaching this scientifically and it's misleading to call this stance a "religious stance". These stances are comparing apples and oranges. <a href="../../../t/t/i/User%7ETtiotsw_54d6.html" title="User:Ttiotsw">Ttiotsw</a> 10:01, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I seem to be almost alone, but--I would have said delete if it were FRSs by religion. But FRSs do tsomer of them take specifically religious public stances, and it is not OR to find out, because they will only belong here if obvious. It is further relevant, because most of the make specific use of the status as FRS when expressing religious views, or when others use the as examples: these are cases where both the status and the religion is clearly discernible. I personally do not care how tit will balance out -- I think that the majority wont think it worthwhile or appropriate to talk about their religion, so its not a poll.

<dd><b>Reply</b> Nbeale, the list is called "List of FRSs with public religious stances", not "List of FRSs with <i>current</i> public religious stances", and the only reference to it being for "current" FRSs in a footnote. That lack of confusion about the list's scope doesn't enhance its credibility.<br />
Your defence here is based on claiming a purpose for the list other than what this stated in the article, which again undermines credibility.<br />
In any case a list such as this will have constant changing content, as new FRSs are appointed and old ones die, as well as the changes in religious stance you have just instanced. So the list you describe here is journalistic rather than encyclopedic: it does not consist of durable knowledge. What is the encyclopedic logic for judging that the religious stance of someone is notable when they are alive but becomes non-notable when they die?

<li><b>Keep</b> Many of these people claim their status as FRS to give weight to their views on religious belief. The point of an institution such as the Royal Society is that its fellows speak for both themselves and the Academy to which they belong.

<dd>Homosexuality, as an alternate example, is not illegal in the UK any more (unlike a few years ago whereby Christians would support chemically altering sexuality of homosexuals) whereas it could be argued that a certain public support or stance on religion is still illegal. The still-extant UK Blasphemy laws only protect Christians and could (albeit unlikely) be used to imprison or cause hardship to those who highlight some of the more ludicrous nonsense promoted by Christians. To make a fair comparison you need to identify some human characteristic in which only 1 group is protected. Within religion, obviously women are discriminated against so that's a good candidate. The Catholic church actively rejects the equality of women with men, as does the Church of England and pretty much any other Christian organisation which fits under the papal thumb. I'm not, but wow a women atheist is screwed all ways by Christianity.</dd>
<dd>In the end my concerns are that we need not consider atheism or humanism to be a religion and thus not a religious belief but there does seem a drive towards equating the two for this list. Theism is about belief in a particular supernatural entity whereas atheism usually precludes this. It would be like having a list of astronomers with a stance of "aliens" and though implication that some support <a href="../../../s/e/t/SETI_0570.html" title="SETI">SETI</a> equate this with a belief (or not) in <a href="../../../u/f/o/UFO_9768.html" title="UFO">UFOs</a>. One side is an outright belief in "Area 51" nonsense and the other is a more scientific approach based on probabilities. With normal people this isn't an issue but FRS it is; the Christian FRS effectively believe in the existence of a supernatural being but cannot present any proof of this (or these) entities.

<dd><i>Comment</i> - isn't it precisely because it's a controversial subject that its methods must be above reproach? Part of the problem, as I see it, is that the list is doomed to failure because of insurmountable bias in the sources of information. You cannot get at the information you need for most of the people who might be included (whether or not they are alive!), and the likelihood of having the information is likely to be influenced by the stance of the person, producing seriously skewed data. <a href="../../../s/n/a/User%7ESnalwibma_ab74.html" title="User:Snalwibma">Snalwibma</a> 14:39, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The goal of the list does not appear to identify the scope of each persons religious or areligious belief. That information should be left for the individual to self-identify (ex Rees self-identifies) in a public capacity. If other names need to be added to columns, let this happen. The journalism "bias" suggested above is naturally favored against religious theism than say humanism. Over time, a useful list of scientific peoples who have SELF-IDENTIFIED religious or areligious views will be available with accompanying sources. The point is clear--there are a large number of theists who are scientists. This information may have nuances that are difficult to quantify but it does not necessitate deletion. Beginning the list by posting various Royal Society fellows is a decent place to start. This could be extended to anyone wanting to do the research from other academic scientific bodies who have self-identified.

I have no dog in this fight - I wasn't involved in the last round, so I'm not defending my own position here - I just see a request for deletion of an article about someone I've heard of (as opposed to the many, many, many articles that survive about which I have never heard), so my attention was piqued.

<li><b>Merge</b>, I hope you guys are not voting for delete merely because of a goofy phrase in the article, which is due to clumsy writing.

<dd>Goetia's an archaic word for making pacts with demons (as opposed to the devil himself) - eg the Devil might want your eternal soul in exchange for riches, but Amy would only want a small part of your soul in exchange for light housekeeping chores.

<li><b>Keep or Merge</b> - The nomination is essentially an "I've never heard of it" argument. I do believe that the list of stubs related to demons has gotten a bit excessive, but this is valid, verified information (and fairly well known in the circles familiar with the references cited) and should not simply be deleted. I think Demons in Goetia could be an alternative in the event of a merge, which would allow for slightly more information (such as is contained in this stub) to be provided above a mere list. Such a list, by the way, would be superfluous, since the list is already there in the <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goetia.html" title="Goetia">Goetia</a> article, which I assume those who voted for deletion based on <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLLOCKS_9aa6.html" title="WP:BOLLOCKS">WP:BOLLOCKS</a> and the like seem to have missed. To single out one of these listed and sourced 72 for deletion doesn't seem reasonable. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 03:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep or merge</b> We cant merge all of the demons, because a few are quite notable in their own right. The ones that have attracted less modern attention do not really justify articles, ass there is not that much to say, although there technically are sources. So I agree with the solution by Zahakiel, with separate articles when appropriate. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:24, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This is probably the best solution. We need to sort out what to do with the <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goetia.html" title="Goetia">Goetia</a> list of demons as a whole rather than piecemeal like this. Some of the spirits listed such as <a href="../../../a/s/t/Astaroth.html" title="Astaroth">Astaroth</a> and <a href="../../../b/e/l/Belial.html" title="Belial">Belial</a> occur frequently elsewhere in Western culture, many of the others only appear in <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Weyer_68a2.html" title="Johann Weyer">Johann Weyer</a>'s book. This needs to be treated like fiction, with the significant names having their own articles and the rest being catalogued on a single page as "Minor demons in goetia" (or whatever). --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 08:53, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. My suggestion would be to have a list that treats all of them briefly in the context of <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goetia.html" title="Goetia">Goetia</a>, using {{<a href="../../../d/e/t/Template%7EDetails_302f.html" title="Template:Details">details</a>}} links to point to the full articles on those with independent notability. <font face="Trebuchet MS"><i><b><a href="../../../c/e/l/User%7ECelithemis_11c2.html" title="User:Celithemis"><font color="red">—Cel</font></a><a href="../../../c/e/l/User_talk%7ECelithemis_923e.html" title="User talk:Celithemis"><font color="black">ithemis</font></a></b></i></font> 11:12, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b> - into list. Nothing here that asserts individual notability, but a list of these demons looks appropriate. Though I'm not sure <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is the right thing to talk about here...that guideline is for <i>people</i>, you know...but individually Amy probably does not pass <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. So listify. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreschi_31bb.html" title="User:Moreschi">Moreschi</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_recordings_a333.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested recordings">Request a recording?</a></sup> 10:53, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - For the people voting to merge or listify, note that this list <i>already</i> exists in the <a href="../../../g/o/e/Goetia.html" title="Goetia">Goetia</a> article, and there's a fair amount of information on each of the 72 that just collapsing into a single article would make it very long. My "keep or merge" vote above was holding out "merge" as a distant second choice to keeping, and after further consideraiton I really do not think that is the best solution. IF they are merged, several names are still going to need their own articles (possibly this one as well) for the amount of information provided, but that is a topic for a talk page (e.g., the Goetia talk area) not an AfD discussion on one of the 72. Folantin's idea of having an article "Minor Demons in Goetia" would probably work for cleaning up the ones that are merely stubs and not mentioned anywhere else, but again this would need to be discussed on a talk page somewhere else, not here. <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 18:02, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> - I think it would be best to shove this into another article/list until some sources (i.e. not online demon libraries with the apparent intent to market their products) and it doesn't fail <a href="../../../c/b/_/WP%7ECB_bcec.html" title="WP:CB">WP:CB</a>.

<p>Non-notable theory supported only by literature written by the author of the theory. The article makes no attempt to explain the theory - just that it is effective. Explaining the theory in the article would require an amount of detail inappropriate for the encyclopedia.

<dd>Fair enough. Lets start with the first film on the list. This article says "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen" had a budget of "$40,000,000":</dd>

<dd>It isn't a huge stretch to suggest that BoxOfficeMojo, <i>the explicit reference given in the article</i>, might very well be the source. So the numbers don't square? Correct it then; that's what we come to Wikipedia to do, correct typos and errors we find. Myself, given that the article is over three years old and has had many editors, I wouldn't venture to suggest when or by whom that particular figure was added, and in any event this is a discussion better suited for the article's talk page. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 18:18, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: I double-checked these numbers with www.boxofficemojo.com and they check out. As for this claim that they numbers come from IMDB, this is simply not true. Deleting this article simply because populist editors are mad that some of their favorite films are on this list is POV and flies in the face of Wiki's objectivity. The reason why some people here want to delete this page is because they think it's too negative. What's next? Are we supposed to delete the Nazi wiki page because it puts Germany in a negative light? Should we delete the penis wiki page because it might offend conservative people? Sorry... but box office bombs/flops are a known phenomena in the world of the moviegoing public. It deserves research like anything else in the world. Deleting this page is simply censorship from people who don't like to face the brutal reality that some business enterprises, like movies, are failures.

I see no reason to believe that this cannot be achieved. 2: A box office <i>failure</i> is one that fails to recoup expenses. What makes one movie a bomb and another merely a failure may be a bit subjective, but it seems like the list could just set an arbitrary threshold, like "Gross &lt; 30% of budget, or Gross less than budget by at least $10 million" that would pretty much accurately sum up the contents. Exceptions could be included if they were described in sources as bombs. Yes, this article needs some cleanup, but it's interesting, it's relevant, it's an appropriate topic, and it's a good start.

<ul>
<li>As far as a formal definition goes I am having trouble finding one. However, all sources assume the term is already understoond as being applied to a money-losing film such as <a href="http://ask.yahoo.com/20050722.html" class="external text" title="http://ask.yahoo.com/20050722.html" rel="nofollow">"for a film to lose money" (Yahoo)</a>, which is the industry and commonly accepted definition.</li>
<li>The term is not original research, the nominator's second of two arguments. The term is used widely, for example by <a href="http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-09-98/arts/arts2.html" class="external text" title="http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1998/sep/09-09-98/arts/arts2.html" rel="nofollow">The Michigan Daily</a>, <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0701230149jan23,1,2314395.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed" class="external text" title="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0701230149jan23,1,2314395.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed" rel="nofollow">The Chicago Tribune</a>, <a href="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13701" class="external text" title="http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/13701" rel="nofollow">Yale Daily News</a> and <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/02/sbt.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0508/02/sbt.01.html" rel="nofollow">CNN</a> as well as in specialized sites such as RottenTomatoes.com and BoxOfficeMojo.com.</li>

<p><b>No one is saying the term is original research.</b> If I thought the term was original research I'd have nominated the "Box office bomb" article for deletion. <b>This list of films is original research.</b> We are taking the budget and revenue figures, comparing them and saying "these films are bombs". We aren't referencing other people that say these films are bombs, Wikipedia is saying that.

<li>In that case we got sidetracked in the previous thread. If the industry definition of Box Office Bomb is a money-losing film and it is generally understood (as all these sources would suggest) then this is a list of films that fit the industry definition of Box Office Bomb or the generally accepted definition of Box Office Bomb (which is in fact the same, in any case). Then such list is not original research, as it would be if the list included non-money losing films. --<a href="../../../f/a/t/User%7EFateClub_8a45.html" title="User:FateClub">FateClub</a> 20:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I expect that very few lists on Wikipedia work that way; a POV-ridden opinion poll doesn't magically cease to be one just because someone who wasn't on Wikipedia made it up. I'd much rather take a list compiled from factual, reliable sources ... like this one. That being said, Mr. McMillan's interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is completely in error, if a common mistake. "Original research" as policy defines it is not "anything an editor compiles." The specific criteria valid here is "It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source." A money-losing movie is value-neutral, and the facts presented are attributed to reputable sources. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 20:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I certainly agree, most figures lack sources and <b>that</b> is the issue, and one that most of us (if not all) agree upon.

<dd>Where did you find advertisement-like text in the article? I can't see it. Radmin was created in 1999 just like <a href="../../../v/n/c/VNC_c6a3.html" title="VNC">VNC</a> so I think it deserved to have an article on wikipedia. Or maybe you think we should delete article about <a href="../../../v/n/c/VNC_c6a3.html" title="VNC">VNC</a> also? --Famatech 16:50, 27 March 2007 (GMT+3)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep!</b> I created the article stub. I don't work for Famatech, and I have no vested interest in it. This piece of software is notable for comparing favorably to other remote access solutions in terms of features, and having won a large number of <a href="http://www.radmin.com/products/radmin/awards.php" class="external text" title="http://www.radmin.com/products/radmin/awards.php" rel="nofollow">awards</a>. I don't know what their user count is, but it's way more than <a href="http://www.download.com/Radmin-Server-and-Viewer/3000-7240_4-10636609.html?tag=lst-4-4" class="external text" title="http://www.download.com/Radmin-Server-and-Viewer/3000-7240_4-10636609.html?tag=lst-4-4" rel="nofollow">873K on Download.com</a>, because (1) it only counts the new version that's been out for 6 weeks, while the product has been out since 1999, and (2) many users would obtain the client elsewhere, especially in large corporate environments. Also note that their Web-site is 2nd most popular in <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;CategoryID=240776" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse/general/?&amp;CategoryID=240776" rel="nofollow">Alexa.com's Remote Access category</a>.

<li><b>Keep it</b> Guys, I work for Famatech. My name is Eugene Lisovskiy and I didn't create this article from the beginning (AlexLibman did as already mentioned above). All I want is to improve this article according to wikipedia guidelines. As you can see I don't hide from publicity (as I have user account named Famatech) and I'm not intended to make an advertisement from this article. Just give me some time because it's a hard work to make a good article. By now there are no advertisement texts in this article. PS: I'm a Radmin user also and I have a higher technical education so I do know how to make a good article. Also I can ask for assistance the creator of Radmin - Dmitry Znosko: he knows Radmin better than any other man. --Famatech 16:21, 27 March 2007 (GMT+3)</li>

<dd>Done. As I already mentioned Famatech didn't create this article, thus we are not interested in any kind of advertising.

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Comment</b> (edit conflict) I consider there to be three main professional Christian music reviewing parties: <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/" class="external text" title="http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/" rel="nofollow">Christian Music Today</a>, <a href="http://www.crossrhythms.org.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.crossrhythms.org.uk" rel="nofollow">Cross Rhythms</a>, and <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jesus_Freak_Hideout_5d9d.html" title="Jesus Freak Hideout">Jesus Freak Hideout</a>... it is, AFAIK, strongly notable inside Christian music. Niche-marketed products such as Christian music are generally unlikely to be reviewed by the mainstream/"secular" media (with notable band exceptions, including <a href="../../../s/w/i/Switchfoot.html" title="Switchfoot">Switchfoot</a>, <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underoath.html" title="Underoath">underOATH</a>, and the more explicitly Christian <a href="../../../d/e/l/Delirious__bfd7.html" title="Delirious?">Delirious?</a>); should the guidelines for notability at least reflect this fact? Please correct me if I'm understanding incorrectly... (For the record, I am generally vehemently opposed to the partially self-imposed segregation between so-called "Christian" and "secular" music, but for some reason, I'm defending it here anyway...) <b>One last edit</b>: JFH doesn't only do music reviews, but meh... --<b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_88b7.html" title="User:MatheMezzaMorphis163">3M163</a></b>//<i><b><a href="../../../m/a/t/User_talk%7EMatheMezzaMorphis163_3007.html" title="User talk:MatheMezzaMorphis163">Complete Geek</a></b></i> 18:49, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> JFH is a major web site for doumenting subculture relating to Christian Music. Though it began as a non-notable <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelfire.html" title="Angelfire">Angelfire</a> based web site it has evolved into an exteremely important organization in this field. <i><a href="../../../a/l/l/All_Music_Guide_0e49.html" title="All Music Guide">All Music Guide</a></i> started as an un-notable gopher based site; this argument ins't about origin but place in it's own world - that is what denotes actual notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am one of the people that worked on this page, and I have never heard of the the "Xplicit" mentioned above. Explicit from Sac, the artist that this page refers to, is currently really hot in northern cali. I have a greater concern though, being that underground hip hop is greatly under represented on wikipedia, I was planning on starting pages for several more underground artists, some more popular and some less popular than Explicit, and was hoping that others would follow suit. T-Nutty, Loki, First Degree, Young Droop, C-Lim etc...all these artists have moved 50,000+ units and are not just kids with demos...they are notable if you are familiar with the scene and it is easy to verify. But the impression I'm getting is that it would be a waste of my time. You all seem to be far more familiar with the rules of wikipedia than I...so you tell me. LoloBounce 00:24, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>, Explicit passes the notabilty requirements easily. I just now saw the deletion tag, I am pressed for time tonight but will be referencing as much as possible tomorrow. I would hate to see this page go. 70.168.68.40 04:04, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and clean up this sad, sick article. I think I have to vote this way, but we're an encyclopedia and the subject itself is notable and, in theory, could be written without animus and actual racism. There simply are differences in crime rates by race (as well as by sex, age, ethnicity and just about every other way you could chop up a population; and other subjects besides crime could also be looked at that way). This article will always have to fight off the racists and the politically correct people. I guess you just can't avoid it. Nature of the Wikipedia beast. What a chore.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I have been trying to come up with an alternative merge suggestion...I'm surprised that the subject was not handed elsewhere in some (better) way. As an alternative proposal, perhaps the page could just be defered in favor of <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">Racial profiling</a>, which I think is the essence of the article here proposed for deleetion, that minorities are more likely to be involved in crime, although the racial profiling article does a much better job. If you would allow me one rant, in this (in my opinion racist) article, there is no mention of say, white-collar crime, which is almost exclusively committed by caucasians, and argueably has a much greater per-crime impact on society (I'm white myself, by the way). <a href="../../../j/a/k/User%7EJakerforever_a413.html" title="User:Jakerforever">Jakerforever</a> 13:45, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> per arguments above. Normally I would vote keep in this instance. The article itself is important, but a collection of statistics implying whitey is best is not helpful, and should not be used as a basis for this article.

<li><b>Keep with <i>massive</i> cleanup</b> - Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../b/o/w/Bowdlerized.html" title="Bowdlerized">bowdlerized</a>. Like it or not this topic is brought up often in the real world, regardless of how much distaste one may feel for even considering such a comparison. There is plenty of information out there on this topic, but the current revision reflects information that is either cherry-picked or from <a href="../../../f/r/i/WP%7EFRINGE_f64f.html" title="WP:FRINGE">fringe</a> sources. The POV of the article is <b>definitely</b> slanted, as almost every statistic is compared to the corresponding for "White" people. 90% of the current content needs to be thrown out, which would normally lead us to delete or merge the article. The problem is that a) <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia_is_not_censored.html" title="Wikipedia is not censored">Wikipedia is not censored</a> so we can't really salt it, and b) if we delete it some racist hack will just re-create it, probably with even worse sources. (As it is some of the sources are quite respectable, just summarized shoddily) A far better solution would be for some intelligent, well-reasoning editors to take an interest in this page and turn it into an unbiased, complete, speculation and conclusion free article. I'm willing to chip in a bit, but it'll definitely take several editors working together to make this article what it should be. On the positive side, it will likely turn into a good (if controversial) article. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai"><font color="blue"><b>ramble</b></font></a></sub> <small><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_Viewpoints_and_Arguments_65e4.html" title="User:Yukichigai/Viewpoints and Arguments"><font color="red"><b>argue</b></font></a></small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai"><font color="green"><b>check</b></font></a></sup>) 09:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think the racist stuff can or should be purged in a re-write, since that's part of the subject's significance. I remember when <a href="../../../j/2E/_/J._Philippe_Rushton_c22d.html" title="J. Philippe Rushton">J. Philippe Rushton</a> - a professor at a mainstream Canadian university - came out with his book. He was quickly and decisively denounced by other academics for using dubious methodology and scientifically invalid interpretations of the data (things like ignoring that variations were greater within his racial categories than across categories, which signifies that the racial categories were arbitrary). Normal criminologists deal with race as a sociological, not biological, phenomenon, which leads to something quite different than the contents of this article, but the biological determinism is still an aspect that merits encyclopedic treatment because the racists don't always stay on the fringes where they belong. Also, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Racial_profiling.html" title="Racial profiling">racial profiling</a> is something quite different, and is more about law enforcement than criminology. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 05:30, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn't suggesting that anyone's proposing censorship. I also don't think whoever does a rewrite needs to use what's already in the article as a starting point at all (per WP:NPOV and WP:NOR). However, the racist element here probably shouldn't be excluded as an irrelevant fringe perspective because it periodically sparks controversy and gets mainstream coverage <a href="http://www.psychology.uoguelph.ca/faculty/winston/papers/rushton.html" class="external text" title="http://www.psychology.uoguelph.ca/faculty/winston/papers/rushton.html" rel="nofollow">see here, for example</a>. On a practical note, dealing with the racist perspective encyclopedically would also make it easier to protect the article from it being highjacked with original research (inappropriate edits are more likely to be reverted in articles where the standards have been set high by proper citations, NPOV, etc.) I'm not arguing that the racist perspective should necessarily take up much space in the article; it'll ultimately take a bit of research to determine what the rewritten article should consist of and in what proportions. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobanny_136f.html" title="User:Bobanny">Bobanny</a> 19:00, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Notable? With no solo releases and only a single release as part of Profound Intent? No, sorry. As I've said all along, not notable <i>now</i>. Maybe in the future. In the meantime, this act lacks notability above the common garage band and the repeated attemtps at forcing an article onto Wikipedia about LaPret and Profound Intent are nothing more than advertising. If LaPret and Profound Intent are notable, they don't need to create the article themselves.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> After research addiong content and noting the criteria. I really beleive they are minor but notable. There are randomn little things all over wiki-world. Look if this is a knowledge base then let it be. I would no longer call this article a stub. This is not a garage band they had a deal with a major Christian Label and sold mid market for their genre even peaking at number 5 on the Christian Charts. I disagree with the previous posts. But there is a wikiproject on going for CCM and other Christian music. Personally I detest Christian Pop culture but it and it's compnents IE Bands make an impact on society. I say keep. But expand the article. BTW -- I think they were Dove award nominees (CCM Grammy equiv.). I'll have to check that though. <a href="../../../m/-/b/User%7EM-BMor_141b.html" title="User:M-BMor">M-BMor</a> 23:31, 25 March 2007 (UTC)<a href="../../../m/-/b/User%7EM-BMor_141b.html" title="User:M-BMor">M-BMor</a> 11:01, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

   * Update I added the Dove Award info to the site. I went to the CCM Project

<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). No just one on a major Christian Label.</li>
<li>Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. <b>In christian pop culture hard to define but no as of now.</b></li>
<li>Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city; note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability. <b>No</b></li>
<li>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury award. <b>Was nominated for a Dove Award (Christian Music Industry Grammies)</b></li>
<li>Has won or placed in a major music competition. O<b>nly Dove Awards Not a competition.</b></li>
<li>Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.) <b>No</b></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Club notable for its motivation for Sally Frank, who would be notable if anyone took the time to create a page regarding her feminist legal crusade. The case redlinked in this article is actually a very important one in Princeton and Ivy League history. In short, Princeton has eating clubs (cross between frats and dining halls). Some of them are selective in membership. Sally Frank brought suit against selective all male clubs. Eventually they became co-ed. This club was a rowdy bastion of testosterone during my days at Princeton. This club, Sally Frank and the case referenced in this article are all notable.<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_9324.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger">TonyTheTiger</a> <small>(<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETonyTheTiger_c92e.html" title="User talk:TonyTheTiger">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TonyTheTiger_dfd9.html" title="Special:Contributions/TonyTheTiger">cont</a>/<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETonyTheTiger_Antonio_Vernon_c5a1.html" title="User:TonyTheTiger/Antonio Vernon">bio</a>)</small> 19:00, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Concur with TonyTheTiger that there should be an entry on the matters he mentions. Separate articles on all 11 (originally 19) eating clubs might be a bit much, though. <a href="../../../n/e/w/User%7ENewyorkbrad_524d.html" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> 19:06, 23 March 2007 (UTC) <small>P.S. to Tony: Great username!</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This club is notable and the article should be kept. If someone creates "Frank v. Ivy Club" someday, then we can think about merging it in. Until then, this should stay. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:02, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep'</b> there is probably a good case that these and similar sorts of organizations at colleges of major <i>social</i> significance like Yale and Harvard are worth keeping, because they are institutions affecting the careers of people who play a major role in some areas of american economic life --possibly to an even greater extent in some instances than the universities they are associated with. The relative notability of the various clubs varies with time. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 08:47, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am the writer of that article, and I don't remember that I'v been registered in the name "Garcia-Fons". Regarding the article, don't accuse me in anything. I'v only translated that article from the article about the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict in the Hebrew Wikipedia. My only mistake is that I didn't translated from there the list of reasons to the opposition to the operation, which is:</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>The action of the IDF is not proportional in front of kidnapping of two soldiers.</li>
<li>The amount of civil killing in Lebanon - over about 300 civilians after a week, and over 600 after about 4 weeks - is not moral.</li>
<li>The IDF is harming in Lebanese civilian economic infrastructure and nearly doesn't succeed to harm in Hezbollah.</li>
<li>The harming in civilian population was meant to create pressure against Hezbollah. In practice, polls in Lebanon are testifying that the actions of the IDF actually increased the support in Hezbollah by the population.</li>
<li>The prime minister of Lebanon promised that the Lebanese army will spread out in the border with Israel, in return to cease-fire.</li>
<li>The war is reminding the <a href="../../../1/9/8/1982_Lebanon_War_97db.html" title="1982 Lebanon War">1982 Lebanon War</a> which is considered as a mistake in the eyes of many.</li>
<li>After the battles, Israel [in the source: the IDF (translator's remark)] will be have to negotiate about the soldiers which are held by Hezbollah from the same position.</li>
<li>The pictures of the innocent deads had increased the anger about Israel in the world and increased actions against Jewish and Israeli targets around the world.</li>
</ol>
<p>And two more things: this is an article about the Israeli home front, and Hezbollah is not the most admired organization in Israel. And once I read in the Hebrew Wikipedia that most of the articles that dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict (or was it the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?) in the English Wikipedia have a point of view against Israel, then this article is not the English Wikipedia's only problem.

<dd><b>Amazing!</b> Hjbhuvghgg admits that he translated this from the Hebrew wikipedia (very poorly, in my opinion), but decided to leave out any criticism of the war.

I have a few doubts about 2 of the articles, but I would !vote to keep them all. Allentown seems blessed with good high schools.

<dd>The argument that other articles exist that are similar in nature (in this case, a middle school) is not a reason for keeping this article. Just because one university professor is notable and deserves an article doesn't mean all university professors do. If you feel these other articles you are mentioning aren't notable, then nominate them for deletion as well. It is every editor's charge to cleanup and improve Wikipedia.

<dd><b>Rule of Thumb</b> When you find an article that's thin, don't automatically think "kill", think "improve." Stub articles should be left in place as inspiration for others to come and contribute to the article.

<dd><b>Reply</b> No major edits had been made in six months to this article, now it has been vastly improved. If it hadn't been improved then its deletion would have been justified, there is no point leaving half done articles on here.

<p>I am really really really reluctant to list this and have been watching it for a couple of months hoping someone references it, since I'd really like it to be true. However some very heavy searching has brought up <b>no</b> attribution at all - nothing from either party involved, a legitimate publication or law journal etc. Although (leaving out Wikipedia &amp; answers.com) Google brings up 893 hits, as far as I can tell <i>every single one</i> either has as its attribution a link back to this article or has no attribution at all. <font face="verdana">- <a href="../../../i/r/i/User%7EIridescenti_57e9.html" title="User:Iridescenti"><font color="orangered"><b>Irides</b></font><font color="darkviolet"><b>centi</b></font></a></font> 20:39, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep but investigate</b>: If it's a commonly used legal <i>phrase</i>, we should have a short article on it, even if the content of the article were to be "the phrase originates in a <i>myth</i> or <i>urban legend</i> about the satirical magazine...."

<li>In defence (or is it defense?) of this article, the magazine itself makes the claim that it is true. Since no action was ever filed, no official record was made. The only records would exist at Goodman Derrick and/or Private Eye. The main, and probably only, mention in print that would support this article is in the introduction to "The Life and Times of Private Eye", a large format soft cover compilation of articles from the first ten years of the magazine. Amazon lists the publication date as October 25th 1971, which is consistent with my memory of the time. The location of the copy I once owned is, alas, unknown. <a href="../../../d/j/d/User%7EDjdaedalus_ce55.html" title="User:Djdaedalus">Djdaedalus</a> 00:13, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The notability is not the supposedly famous wording, but its subsequent use. We have no documentation for that.

<li>In light of <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a>'s edits to the 1974 page, I'd like to <b>keep</b> it, but all of the other should be <b>deleted</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> the 1974 article and any others where there is "real" content. But leave the redlinks in the categories so that editors know which tours are missing and can come back to them with more content later. As ALoan says, it isn't difficult to get more content, and I've been working through some older tours – <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Zealand_cricket_team_in_England_in_1927_63d1.html" title="New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927">New Zealand cricket team in England in 1927</a> and the 1931 and 1937 equivalents, for instance.

<dd>Taking exception to my addition of 13 new articles once we were already into the debate is fair enough (and I do apologise for not including them in my initial AFD as I no doubt should have), but I take exception to your suggestion that just because the other articles *could* be expanded they need to be kept until they *are* expanded (also to the suggestion that people who want to delete content-free articles are somehow obligated to fill in the content themselves). Any of these that get expanded by you or anybody else, I'll be happy to see kept. However, the articles I've nominated are, in their present state, better redlinked. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 06:48, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Thanks for rising to the challenge, <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> (and thanks also for the "background" section that you added to this one - I have a few others that could do with that treatment :) It is a little disheartening, to say the least, to find that the reward for doing a little work is to be asked to do 13 times as much work. These articles will get there eventually - do we need to rush to delete them? You are simply encouraging me to do a quick and dirty expansion job, adding a few lines of summary, rather than doing the job properly. Who does that benefit? -- <a href="../../../a/l/o/User%7EALoan_b332.html" title="User:ALoan">ALoan</a> <a href="../../../a/l/o/User_talk%7EALoan_3527.html" title="User talk:ALoan">(Talk)</a> 13:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, I've probably been unclear - I'm not trying to suggest at all that the onus for filling out the other thirteen articles should be on you. You did what looks to me to be a good job with the 1974 one and, as a result, I no longer favour deleting it. If you want to do the others right away, that's great, and then I wouldn't want them deleted, either. If you want to do the others a couple of months from now, that's great too - I just think that, until Wikipedia has an article on the 1952 series, any links to the 1952 series should be redlinked (that's what redlinks are for - to indicate that, though a topic is sufficiently notable for an article, no such article yet exists). If you feel you've done your part and that somebody else should do the others when they have a chance, that's also great - but the articles should be redlinked until somebody actually does them. In answer to your question, the rush to delete them is owing to the fact that, in their present state, they're non-articles. I'm not proposing a quick and dirty expansion job, I'm proposing that, until somebody does a proper expansion job, these "placeholder" "articles" serve no purpose. As to why I haven't risen to your challenge as <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnlp_0f7e.html" title="User:Johnlp">Johnlp</a> has, it's because I don't know a damned thing about cricket. To answer in advance the question (not necessarily asked by you, but probably by somebody) as to why a guy who knows nothing about cricket is proposing cricket-related articles for deletion, it doesn't take a cricket expert to see that these articles (except for the ones that you and Johnlp have expanded) bring nothing to Wikipedia. In summary, I do appreciate your work, I'm not "asking" you to replicate it 13 more times, and I just think that articles that don't exist (which these ones don't) but might at some point in the future (which these ones might) should be redlinked. My sincere apologies if I've offended. <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcasticidealist_b731.html" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> 17:25, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>IP-removed Prod. Beyond the bare fact of existence and the fact that a student died of meningitis, there's a lack of notability (tragically, a lot of students die of meningitis worldwide).

<li>I might have missed the significance of the computing thing in the material you've added (being very much not a computer person, it's possible), but the article itself seems to be more of an off-hand "Oh and by the way, this place also does its computing in this way" mention. The award looks more promising, but I can't get a good handle on precisely what significance it has. As far as it being a specialist school in a particular field, certainly in Australia that argument wouldn't seem to wash - is there an added level of importance in the UK in declaring onself a specialist in X or Y area? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:15, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Good questions. In the UK micro-computing started with <a href="../../../b/b/c/BBC_Micro_b28d.html" title="BBC Micro">BBC Micros</a> that developed into <a href="../../../r/i/s/RISC_OS_7a2b.html" title="RISC OS">RISC OS</a> and all schools had BBCs (or its <a href="../../../a/c/o/Acorn_Computers_090e.html" title="Acorn Computers">Acorn</a> successor). Always more reliable than Windoze (the windows interface is hard-wired into the operating system rather than being soft loaded as with Windoze) it had its fervent advocates. However, the mighty marketing muscle of Mr Gates squashed RISC OS and progressively schools switched across. Any school that still uses RISC OS machines (that are still being sold and developed) in a major way (and there are hardly any now) is a notable remnant of the past. <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">Specialist schools</a> are an innovation whereby schools get extra funding if they show notability in a given area. To be fair, a good many secondary (high) schools now have this status but it still shows that they have significantly achieved in the given area. HTH. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 23:38, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As far as the specialist schools point goes, that's very useful to know. Here, the only system (AFAIK) is that a school needs to say "we're pretty good at X area" and have some classes in it. Admittedly, schools which do this for drama (for example) graduate a lot of people who end up working in drama, but there's more than a whiff of sel-fulfilling prophecy about the whole thing. Given that "a good many secondary schools now have this status", is it in fact viable evidence of notability? Where the computers are concerned, I'm seeing your point, but I'm not sure that that means the <i>school</i> in question gets its own article - why not just a mention in the article on the thing itself? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 23:56, 23 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you follow the link <a href="../../../s/p/e/Specialist_school.html" title="Specialist school">specialist school</a> you can read about them but being a specialist school is not, in itself, enough for notability. The way I look at things is this - we are not short of server space so why would we want to delete a high school article? Only if there is nothing interesting to say. Here, collectively, there is enough encyclopaedic content to make an article, ergo Keep. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 01:07, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Bsf is quite right - there is no consensus and the evidence adduced above - e.g. winning state championships - is an arbitrary measure of notability derived almost exclusively by people who think high schools are inherently notable anyway and thus have found whatever flimsy rationale they can as a means of justifying a position they would take regardless. That is not to say that those who wish to keep every high school article should not be able to justify their position, but it does mean that the raft of policy-waving that tends to accompany these discussions (I have showed you reliable, verifiable, etc... sources) is misplaced since, as with Alan's point above, it refers to events that do nothing to make a case for the notability of what is, after all, just a high school. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 09:38, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Alan, it's very simple. All schools default to being non-notable and therefore do not deserve inclusion in an encyclopedia. Reaching for this or that reason to explain notability simply fails to convince me. Two years ago editors like Tony and Nicodemus were running around dragging up every notable alum in a desperate bid to do much the same as you are doing not to mention frothing on about policy this and policy that - so there's nothing new here, just a fundamental disagreement on what merits inclusion. I still say, despite dual freq's discovery of a newspaper article or two, delete this cruft and I recognise that you will disagree with me. So leave it at that. <a href="../../../e/u/s/User%7EEusebeus_fe94.html" title="User:Eusebeus">Eusebeus</a> 10:05, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Wikipedia is very simple. We have policies. When there are issues as to whether articles need to be deleted, we refer to these policies. With a lot of words, you are still stating that this article must be deleted, simply because you have arbitrarily decided that it's <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">just not notable</a>. In your lengthy Wikipedia career, which consists almost exclusively of passing judgment on AfDs, you have used variations of the patently invalid <a href="../../../j/n/n/WP%7EJNN_e132.html" title="WP:JNN">just not notable</a> as an excuse to demand deletion of every single other school article AfD you have ever participated. If you want your vote to have any measure of validity, you need to start addressing specific articles and specifying why the specific article fails relevant Wikipedia policy. It's not that you disagree with me; the problem is that you refuse to follow Wikipedia policy as developed by our entire Wikipedia community. Until then, your vote is completely and utterly invalid. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 11:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Not necessarily (and sorry to pre-empt MetsFan if this was precisely the argument s/he was going to make). Colleges/Universities can achieve notability by having important scholars working at them, having research institutions based at them and so forth. I wouldn't go as far as MetsFan by saying that <i>all</i> high schools are non-notable (I've defended ones in the past simply because they have notable alumni), but it's easier for a tertiary institution to be notable than it is for a secondary one to be so. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 11:57, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Dual Freq, most colleges are notable per the reason BigHaz has eloquently stated. My issue is that I'm not quite sure what makes a middle school/high school notable. Is it because a famous person attended there? If that's the case, and if that's the only thing the school has going for them, then how is it notable? Maybe I jumped the gun by saying all high/middle schools should be deleted as there are some that are indeed exemplary, but having articles are every school in America (I think I saw an elementary school article) is just too much. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetsFan76_ea64.html" title="User:MetsFan76">MetsFan76</a> 12:34, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment</b>, The artificial wetland portion seems to have been widely reported in 2001 as well, from Lexis Nexis I see transcripts of Milwaukee channel 6 news reports about it, several Milwaukee State Journal articles mentioning it and at least one dedicated to it ("School's experimental sewage treatment plant is a growing success", July 7, 2002, News page 01B, 953 words and another "Windmill to pump air into sewage", August 2, 2002, News page 03B, 406 words). There is also a July 30, 2001, 402 word Associated Press news wire report about the wetland the school was constructing. Apparently they are fairly rare in the northern USA and all are considered experimental with the state of Wisconsin gathering efficiency data on them for wider usage. Another MSJ article from 1996 prior to the artificial wetland, "Marsh madness: School makes land a living lab", October 17, 1995, 506 words and 3 photos about the adjacent Wisconsin DNR wetlands being used as an outdoor classroom. There is also an article about Staff Sgt. Timothy La Sage, a 1993 graduate, who was wounded in Iraq, but I suppose many schools could say that. Also a short blurb from, 1997 about a graduate named Dawn Plitzuweit, two-time NCAA Division II All-American at Michigan Tech, UW assistant basketball coach and mentioned in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grand_Valley_State_University_d16e.html" title="Grand Valley State University">Grand Valley State University</a>.

In North America, <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_District_f005.html" title="School District">School Districts</a> are also notable as distinct geo-political divisions, and public High School articles can be merged to the school district article if there is insufficient content to establish notability.

<dd>A reliable source for a neologism must do more than just <i>use</i> the neologism. It would have to carefully analyze the usage and history of the neologism, etc. So I could be convinced that <i>google</i> as a verb is a notable neologism, because I have seen such articles (and see <a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/google" class="external text" title="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/google" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Moreover, even if this were not a neologism the article would still be a dictdef. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 12:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Please see my comment of 12:20, 26 March 2007 (UTC) above. Just because a few articles use a neologism doesn't mean it is notable or that there is enough attributable material to write an article. <a href="../../../c/m/u/User%7ECMummert_c108.html" title="User:CMummert">CMummert</a> · <small><a href="../../../c/m/u/User_talk%7ECMummert_57c7.html" title="User talk:CMummert">talk</a></small> 00:22, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I saw your comment, and I think your characterization of the news articles as "fluff" is a POV. The sources are otherwise considered reliable, and the stories seem to be intellectually independent. Therefore your assertion that there is no evidence that an article can be written on the subject is a self-fulfilling prophecy if you dismiss the evidence as fluff. I think your argument at bottom is <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. This article is a poor candidate for AfD because it is something that obviously exists, and is something people can relate to. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 13:54, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but isn't human interest the basis of notability? I think you are focusing on the word as a neologism, not the subject as a human experience. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 14:28, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Right. There are clear guidelines about notability and neologisms, but no counteracting guideline on human interest.

<li><b>keep</b>; "independent" sources is not required AFAIK (just 'original' sources), and fwiw if you look at the 'press' page on the website you'll see other sources that refer to it, review it, etc; I didn't feel it appropriate to add that (as the pages for other ling conferences I looked at don't have that), but I don't object to doing so if it's felt to be necessary. COI also is not AFAIK relevant for a VfD; sure I run it, and made a page for it, but how is that relevant to the quality of the article itself? Further, it is notable in that is the ONLY conference on constructed languages; this is equivalent to any other niche area of linguistics. --<a href="../../../s/a/i/User%7ESaizai_eaca.html" title="User:Saizai">Sai Emrys</a> 06:27, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, notable player in a semi-professional competition, the Queensland Cup is one of the second-tier competitions in the country, to be recognised at that level makes him notable. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankiveil_3447.html" title="User:Lankiveil">Lankiveil</a> 01:43, 24 March 2007 (UTC).</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Playing in the Queensland Cup makes him semi-pro at best. The Queensland Cup is not what it was 25 years ago. Rugby League is unlikely to be his sole or even main profession. He would not be selected playing in that competition for any <b>open</b> representative teams such as State of Origin or the national team.

<li>With all due respect, I find it impossible to believe that a single person in the world ever will develop any curiosity over who Ella Fitzgerald was because Lisa Simpson said "Ella Fitzjello."

<li>I think you doubt the curiousity of children! It can take a little thing like that to spark their curiousty, and such things give them something to identify with, rather than the machinations of Ella's meeting Chick Webb.

<li><s><b>Exceptionally weak keep</b> in that there seems (from Google) to be a "Journal of Sonnet Studies".</s> Claiming that the renamed term gets 650000 Ghits is disingenuous, since a search using quote marks (to make certain that the only results actually deal with such a field, and not someone who might be "reading <i>sonnets</i> as part of my <i>studies</i> in Elizabethan society") only nets 117 raw hits. Additionally, not only was the page moved but the AfD notice was <i>re</i>moved, which is a very sneaky thing to do. Given that the journal doesn't seem to exist (which was something I didn't notice during my research, compromised as it was by the need to restore the AfD notice), I'm now inclining towards <b>delete</b> as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 02:26, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> under the new name. The title of a journal is generally sufficient evidence fort the term being accepted. (not a mention in a journal, or the title of one article, but the title of a journal--it implies that numerous others will be able to tell what it includes).</li>

<dd>Looking at the article on Sonnet, the lede paragraph defines the study of sonnets as Sonnet studies (though earlier it had sonnetology), and sonnetology is the category, with a request to change to sonnet studies pending. However, both terms were introduced by the same ed. so the question is whether either of the terms is independent of WNYC. I think they are on the basis that the editor of the Journal is Laura Manuel from Boston University.(not the same person--see WassermannNYC's user page) I do not think the change of name is in bad faith--I think it is a change induced by discovering that there was a proposed journal with a different title. I want to check tomorrow to see if there is another name used in the field. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 10:17, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

The question is, Is the name of the proposed journal evidence that "sonnet studies" is the name of a recognized discipline, or merely evidence that studies are written about sonnets?

<li>In response to both claims: Firstly, the article in question has not "been deleted". You moved it. The AfD was not created saying "There should not be an article called 'Sonnetology'", but rather "the contents of this article (whatever it may be called) are not valid as an article". That's why the removal of the AfD notice was a problem, incidentally. Secondly, the fact that the category has not been deleted is only of borderline relevance (see <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS</a>, for example). Personally, I have no objection to a category which says "The people contained here wrote sonnets". What I do have an objection to is an article claiming that the study of sonnets is a field unto itself, which appears not to be the case. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:23, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes and no. Deor responded (after the renaming) that there was still little or no evidence that "sonnet studies" is a recognised field either. It's got orders of magnitude more hits than "sonnetology" ever did, but there's still no real evidence that it's caught on academically. Had it been created under its current title, I'd suggest that it would have eventually found its way here as well. Perhaps not as rapidly, since the name is less unusual-looking, but if the content were as it is now, I'd be surprised if it didn't turn up. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>(edit conflict) Again, though, what is there to say <i>about sonnet studies as a discipline</i>?

We need a topic heading and/or category to group those 30+ topics related to sonnets and sonnet studies; otherwise they are just scattered about with no real central idea (or 'discipline,' AKA <a href="../../../s/o/n/Sonnet_studies.html" title="Sonnet studies">sonnet studies</a>) grouping them together. --<a href="../../../w/a/s/User%7EWassermannNYC_d58e.html" title="User:WassermannNYC">WassermannNYC</a> 01:06, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>With respect, there's yet to be any real proof provided that there <i>is</i> a "central idea or discipline" under which they can be grouped. They all relate broadly to sonnets, yes, but there's no indication (aside from unsubstantiated claims) that there is a field unto itself which covers all these things. It would make sense if there is, but that's not the object of the exercise here. I can see the logic in having a category for "concepts relating to sonnets" separate from a category for "sonnets themselves", but that's not always a principle followed in other categorisation schemes. Additionally, there's no rule against having such a category scheme but doing away with the article on the field which would notionally cover one category. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 01:57, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I believe this articl;e should remain. I will continue to improve it, there are more references to cite, and the ones I have given are good (in my opinion). The BBC website is a good example of this. It is my belief that this tag should be removed.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 20:42, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><strike><b>Delete.</b></strike><b>Keep</b>. With the release of only two singles so far, this band does not meet <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">notability criteria for music</a>, not to mention it probably fails <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of interest</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">Autobiography</a>.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I change my vote to <b>Keep</b> as more reliable references have come to light. I did clean up and removed any links that were self-published/spam/adverts/blogs that are not considered reliable sources, but there are still plenty of reliable sources to consider this group to be influential in the local area and culture. Also, the author argues that although the article is within the scope of an <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAuto_aa00.html" title="WP:Auto">Autobiography</a>, it does not fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral point of view</a>, and I agree. <a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECricket02_ffdd.html" title="User:Cricket02">Cricket02</a> 02:46, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p><strike><b>Keep.</b></strike>*I would argue that it is written from a neutral viewpoint, and therefore not a conflict of interest. Also, the discography remains incomplete, as an album was released in 2005 (One Way Ticket). There are articles from the BBC, Radio Cornwall, and independent websites cited already, and the state of the artist is a large influence in the local area and culture, as can be seen from the wikipedia articles that already link to the page. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 21:57, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 21:58, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>The main point I believe them not to have failed WP: Music is "Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or of the local scene of a city". They are the most prominant and wellknown anti-folk band in Cornwall, and lead the movement with bands on the local scene. They also have toured in England "at least a medium sized country", and therefore I argue do not fail this criteria. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2645.html" title="User talk:The Red Army Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_The_Red_Army_Band_5e11.html" title="Special:Contributions/The Red Army Band">contribs</a>) 22:33, 13 February 2007 (UTC).</small>--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 22:34, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I find the comment "come back in a year" frustrating. The artist in question have been around since 2004 (that's three years now) and the references I have cited list from a range of times. True, the impending release of their new album in the summwe will elevate their notability, but the article can just be edited then surely?--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Red_Army_Band_2174.html" title="User:The Red Army Band">The Red Army Band</a> 22:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: The article's got good references, is better written than many articles and pertains to a band who are somewhat more significant than certain others with Wikipedia articles. It'll likely be improved further soon, as will the band's real-world profile (inevitable after recent developments) and therefore should be kept. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenphillips_a268.html" title="User:Benphillips">Benphillips</a> 23:03, 13 February 2007 (GMT)</li>

Obviously the results of this afd should also probably be applied to that article. I'd recommend adding it to this afd nomination. (Note: Even if the band article is kept, as it currently appears might happen, the Philip Burley article might still be a good candidate for merger into the band's article.) <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:52, 14 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comment:</b> The article that has been added so far on Philip Burley appears to me to be biographical and fairly irrelevent to that of the bands page.
