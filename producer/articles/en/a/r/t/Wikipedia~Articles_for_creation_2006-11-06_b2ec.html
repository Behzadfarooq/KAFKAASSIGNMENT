Jack’s Game of 10.<br />
<br />
OFFICIAL RULES<br />
JGOT is an original and highly addictive game that can be played by anyone, anywhere, anytime. You will need: 2 packs of cards with jokers, extra jokers optional Aim of the Game: The aim of the game is to draw cards from your Jack Hand and place them on the Jack Stack to try and match with the pre-stated Jack Card. When you are out of cards in your Jack Hand you are out of the game. The winner is the last person left with the remaining Jack Pack.<br />
Setup: Shuffle the two packs of the cards with the jokers until you have one full and completely random Jack Pack. Deal out all the cards to each person until everyone has a similar amount of cards in their Jack Hand. Choose a player to start who places their first card from the top of their Jack Hand. The next player then places another card on top face up and so on, moving around clockwise until someone places down a 10 which is the first default Jack Card. When the Jack Card is found the first round is over and that player then takes all the cards on the table and places them at the bottom of their Jack Hand. That player then states a new Jack Hand of their choice and begins the next round by placing the 1st card from the top of their Jack Hand.<br />
When a player runs out of cards in their Jack Hand, they are out of the game. The winner is the last player left. However JGOT is not as simple as it first seems. There are many trick cards that can help and hinder or completely alter the games dynamics.<br />
Trick Cards:<br />
A ♠♥♣♦<br />
When an ace card is played, each player must knock on the playing surface as quickly as possible. The last player to knock is the ‘Jack in the Box’ and cannot win the current round even if they produce the Jack Card. They may only ‘Pop-up’ back into the round if another ace card is played and they do not knock last or if the round ends.<br />
Ace Round: If a player chooses ace as the Jack Card, then the round becomes an Ace Round and if the ace is played then the first player to knock wins the round. If the knocking is too close to humanly judge, players must come to a mutual decision.<br />
3 ♠♣<br />
When a Black 3 is played, all subsequent cards must be drawn from the opposite side of the Jack Hand.<br />
6 ♠♥♣♦<br />
All 6’s are ‘invisible’. If a player plays a 6 then the same player must then play another card directly on the top of the 6. Since the 6 is ‘invisible’, it cannot be chosen as the Jack Card.<br />
8 ♥♦<br />
Red 8’s are “miss a go” cards. When a Red 8 is played, the next player cannot play a card for one go.<br />
J ♣<br />
When a Jack of Clubs is played it immediately triggers a “Snap Round”. For the remainder of that round, players continue placing cards as before until 2 cards of matching value’s are placed inconsecutively. When this happens, the first player to slap their hand down on top of the Jack Stack wins the round and all the cards on the Jack Stack. During a “Snap Round” all card rules are ignored except for jokers. When the round is over, the rules are put back in place.<br />
Q ♠♣<br />
If a player plays a Black Queen they may change the Jack Card to a new Jack Card of their choice. This is optional.<br />
Q ♦<br />
When the Queen of Diamonds is played, all players must pass their entire Jack Hand to the player on their immediate left regardless of their size or volume of their Jack Hand.<br />
K ♠<br />
When the King of Spades is played, all the players must say “Beans” quickly and clearly. The last player to say “Beans” must discard 4 cards from their Jack Hand and take them out of the game.<br />
Jokers<br />
If a Joker is player, all cards in the Jack Stack including the Joker are taken out of the game. Players are suggested to say “bang” when the cards are removed.<br />
Bamboozled<br />
If 3 cards of the same value are played consecutively then the player who deals the 3rd card is “bamboozled” and is out of the game and all their Jack Hand is discarded.<br />
Hints and Tips:<br />
• When playing JGOT it can be very confusing trying to learn and use all the rules at once. If playing as or with a beginner, start with only basic rules and add more rules as players become more experienced in the game until all rules are being used and JGOT is being played at full potential.<br />
• Play at a slow speed. Do not speed through rounds as vital cards may easily go un-noticed.<br />
• Do not knock the playing surface too hard when cards are played (especially Aces) because it hurts.<br />
<br />
These rules are Template Rules for the Original Game of JGOT. Although no rules may be deleted, rules may be added for personal versions of the game.<br />
<br />
This game was officially made up by certain members of the fox family and partners.<br /></p>

<p>Mary Frohman was a member of the Dehorn Crew, and she sand with Leslie Fish on meny of the early songs. She sang the choras of "Toast for unsung heroes", "Turn and Belive", Iorn Mistress", "Hope Erie" (a famous Filk song), "The Thousandth man", "Few days", "Thoughts on strange visitors", and "Neutral Zone, Romulian veiw". She also lived with Leslie Fish and had a romantic relationship with her. Mary Frohman did not like the fan-songs that Leslie Fish did, and her band, the Dehorn Crew, soon stopped singing with Leslie. Mary's favorite songs were "Wobblies from space", "Thousandth man" and "Tost for unsung heroes". She prefered songs about unions, and human accopleshment. She once wrote a peice that she called "The mother of all fan-fics" one month while dopped up of cough syrup. It was written to make fun of her freind/lover's fan-fiction and fan-song habits. The two eventualy broke up, and Mary moved to her home-city of Detroit. There she cared for a freind of her's who had become parapoligic in a car accedent. Under her care he became much more healthy then he was before. In 2000 Her brother, Tom Frohman, did a google person serch for her. The faimly had belived that she had died sometime during the Veitnam-Era... Possibly in the Chicago Riots which she had been involved in. Not only did he find her, but it turned out that her current residence was only two miles from Tom Frohman's, Elsa Frohman (her sister's) and her parents' residences. She was welcomed back to the faimly with open arms. Her other brother, a mathamatition named Charlie Frohman, drove up from Iowa to see her. He took along his wife and son. After that, life was pretty quiet, and she made preserves with her brother Charlie every year in the fall untill the day she died, June 4th 2005, of a heart attack.</p>

<p>Born Terence Alan MacNeil on June 13, 1944 in Wichita, Kansas. "It was raining babies" (said his father) that day in the hospital where Terry was born, so much so that Terry was abandoned on the stainless steel table he was left on while the presiding doctor was dealing with other births. Terry was so angry at the lack of attention that he bloodied one heel with so much kicking (a scar he still has to this day) and his first photograph showed him looking like a wrinkled old man due to dehydration from of crying. Terry teamed up with Peter Kraemer in 1965 to form the San Francisco psychedelic band The Sopwith Camel, and later record their only hit "Hello, Hello" which was released in January of 1967. It reached #26 nationally, according to Billboard Magazine. Terry MacNeil changed his name to Nandi Devam in 1979 when he and his wife and two daughters formally converted to Hinduism, in a ceremony at the Kadavul Hindu Temple on the Garden Island of Kauai. Nandi Devam now owns Camel Records, which records and produces budding enthusiastic singer/songwriters. Nandi is also arranging, singing and performing songs that he and Peter Kraemer wrote but never recorded for release on Camel Records.</p>

His life as the son of an officer in the british army led to his early life being full of different cultural experiences as they moved from one country to another. He started life in Scotland, moved to Ireland where he was christened and has since been to Germany, England, France, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Belgium, Austria and the Czech Republic. He has just finished his education from Perrott Hill, Somerset, where he learnt to despise the french, and then Kings School Bruton, again in somerset, where he came away with some impeccable results, an all round education, particularly in his guitar playing and his fine taste for many a beverage. He is now currently in a gap year intending to depart in January for South America to seek a life on the ranches, meanwhile having settled down in Islandanagh near Ballycastle in Northern Ireland he has set about building a grand establishment.</p>

<p>James Dawson: "Charlie Cole is a great man, and I forsee great things to come not only in his fight to save Britishness, but also in his aims of maintaining a beatiful life for all those who grace this potentially beautiful nation. I feel however that his life cannot be explained in such little space."</p>

<p><b>Cricket</b> is one of the best sports played in the world. It has various form of the game but three of them is recognized by the ICC- Test cricket, One-day International cricket and last but not least Twenty20 International Cricket. Since the ICC don't want twenty20 to take over ODI's but still be formal, the ICC should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put a twenty20 raking system into affect for it.</li>
<li>There mandatory minimum requirements of at least 1 Twenty20 International,home and away, against every other Full Member over that period while still scheduling rest periods for their players.</li>
<li>It should have a limit of 10 Twenty20 Internationals (instead of the confusing 3 home Twenty20 matches/year), just like 15 Tests and 30 One Day Internationals per calendar year per country averaged out over a period of four years.</li>
<li>Associate teams right now works hard to get ODI status then eventually Test status, what if ICC created Twenty20 status. This form of the game can be played competitively between any side be it a full member vs a associate. ICC should give twenty20 status out to a broader number of nations who could compete in the twenty20 level then try to gain ODI status then eventually test status!</li>
<li>The second Twenty20 World Championship should be a knockout tournament(the form being fast pacing so should it's tournament) consisting 32 teams making cricket really a global sport; ten full members and the top 22 associates from the ranking. Even though this tournament would have more teams, it would not have more value than the world cup, first of all because the world cup is the most pure tournament with the best teams(currently 16) playing the more pure form of the sport ever to be played in a tournament for more than 30 years. Secondly while the world cup is played every four years, which is like sacred, the twenty20 world championship would be played every 2 years making it the junior tournament.Twenty20 is a junior compared to it's older brothers ODI's and Tests so it's tournament would also be a junior to the world cup; sort of like a mini world cup for the mini form of ODI. But the ICC still needs to take advantage of what they can, which is more teams can participate competitively in it. So the knockout tournament with 32 teams would have 29 matches played in 18 days and have its own values that would make it different from the world cup.</li>

The ICC needs money for their Development Program to spread the sport. But the only events they get the financial help is from the ICC Cricket World cup and ICC Champions Trophy. Unfortunately, the <b>Champions Trophy is not really helping cricket and does not have any value because it's very similar and only four months away from the biggest thing in cricket- the world Cup. But the ICC needs the money, luckily they have another tournament to replace it- ICC Twenty20 World Championship. From 2012 the ICC Twenty20 Championship should be played every 2 years</b>. The winner of the tournament would be referred as the World Twenty20 Champions and world Champions would be the winners of the world cup as it is now. The ICC cricket world cup should be heading the same path as it is heading to now- the tournament is expending as more teams have the quality play in it but there should be a limit at one point where it wont expand anymore.</p>
<p>Though Test cricket is too long for a tournament, the ICC has done a good job with LG ICC Test Championship, But dont you think crowning best test cricket team deserves same amount of value as the world cup. Well here's another idea why not hold the crowning the of best test team every four years from 2013 then again in 2017 and so on. <b>The team that was the number 1 team the most, meaning for the longest time combined in the last four years would win the Trophy for the LG ICC Test Championship. Crowning the best team in the world would be held at the ICC Awards every four years with the best team crowned and refered as the Champions Champion.</b></p>
<p>The more you have something the less value it gets so please, for the sake of all forms of the sport don't, overplay it and reduce it's value. Even playing all three forms half of their limit would be enough to please the crowd. Nothing would really affect cricket in a negative way in these changes- Champions trophy which is decaying position would be replace with the exciting twenty20 championship, more nations playing cricket, more value to the best test team and the world cup still being the most valued tournament in cricket. <b>Cricket truly is one of the best and global sport of the world. In most of the world the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd is awarded, well it would be the same in cricket- 1st. LG ICC Test Championship winners, the champions champion; 2nd. ICC World Cup winners, the world champions; 3rd. ICC Twenty20 world Championship winners, the World Twenty20 Champions! The ICC Cricket World Cup will always be the top event played and twenty20 will help it spread the game!</b></p>

<p>C. R. Parker</p>
<p>Most art or museum publications that mention C. R. Parker identify him as an itinerant portrait painter from England who traveled the South. One claims that although he had a studio in New Orleans his mother had a plantation in East Feliciana, Louisiana. His period when actively painting is given widely varying dates from 1825 to 1862. Some Parker portraits in a New Orleans museum are assigned a date of 1855. Yet another publication states that the “…artist’s last known work was executed in 1862 … where Parker painted a portrait of Colonel James Bowie in his hunting suit, with his knife, made from a rasp, at his belt.”</p>
<p>Parker did travel the South painting portraits and he sometimes had a studio in New Orleans as well as Mobile, Alabama, and St. Louis, Missouri, among other cities. Nothing else above quoted from various museum and art publications is true. Charles Parker was not from England, he was born / baptized in Cheshire, Connecticut, on 30 September 1799; his sister Juliana (“Julia”) was baptized there on 15 February 1795 (she ended up in Alexandria, Louisiana). There was no Louisiana plantation, and he did not paint James Bowie in 1862 because Bowie died at the Alamo on March 6th, 1836. C. R. Parker died in New Orleans on February 1st, 1849. We do not yet know where he received his earliest art training. What we do know is that whatever that training was, it put him in contact with the best antique American models as well as the most recently painted ones.</p>
<p>C. R. Parker is first reported as an artist in New Orleans in 1825. By 1826 he was exhibiting his portraits of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the Marquis de Lafayette and Benjamin Franklin, some on commission for the Louisiana Capitol. By 1827 a set of the same portraits had been hung in the Georgia Capitol building in Milledgeville, Georgia, but Parker had been given an additional commission – to paint the portrait of the late General James Oglethorpe, the founder of Georgia.</p>
<p>These first known paintings by Parker are taken from other paintings of the four national leaders that Parker had seen. The most common source for the backgrounds of all except Thomas Jefferson, is the Washington portrait by Gilbert Stuart known as the “Lansdowne” portrait. All of Parker’s portraits demonstrate great facility with the background setting, draperies, furniture and landscape views seen behind, and to the side, of the subject. However, when it came to the human figure and particularly the identifiable faces of his subjects, Parker had greater difficulty. His early figures were invariably wooden and malproportioned, and his heads always too small for the bodies on which they sat.</p>
<p>Immediately after his sale of these large portraits Parker left New Orleans for England. He studied there at least from 1828 until 1832. The Royal Society of British Artists was one of the several arts related organizations with which he exhibited in 1828 and 1829. In 1828, John James Audubon also arrived in London and that August “… He met a Mr. Parker whom he had known formerly in Natchez, and agreed to sit while Parker did a picture of him as a woodsman. This took more time than he had expected, time that he resented having to give up, but he was pleased with the final results.”</p>
<p>In the fall of 1828 Audubon went to Paris and there Parker again joined him: “So far it had been a wonderful trip, and it became even better the following day [Sunday], when he and Parker, his friend from Natchez, who had also joined him, went to Saint-Cloud to attend the fete.”</p>
<p>Through Audubon, Parker was introduced to Baron Georges Cuvier, secretary of the National Institute, Professor of Natural History in the College de France, and member of the Council of the Imperial University, who sat for a portrait by Parker.</p>
<p>Parker returned to New Orleans in 1832 and re-established his studio there for at least a year while he also resumed his travels across the South from the Carolinas to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Missouri. He received substantial praise in the press because of his portraiture which had improved dramatically, most notably in his more realistic rendering of the human body, the facial features, rich color palette and a sense of depth or three-dimensionality.</p>
<p>When C. R. Parker returned to New Orleans in 1832 he re-established contact with Joshua D. Waterman [b. 11 March 1784, d. 1857], his cousin from Wallingford, Connecticut, who was prominent in New Orleans as a managing partner in the firm of Newton &amp; Co. There exists a certificate / note for John Jacob Astor, dated May 23, 1819, endorsed on the reverse by Waterman, who was actively in business in New Orleans before the first arrival of Stephen F. Austin and still in business when Austin returned in 1835.</p>
<p>Between 1832 and 1835 Parker was making frequent forays across the South seeking new clients, particularly the wealthy and powerful. Parker would obviously be passed around from household to household, via friends and relatives of satisfied clients, some of whom would prove to be active in the creation of the Republic of Texas. No where is this more clear than the web of connections between Texas and Milledgeville, Georgia, the state capital whose Capitol building held five of Parker’s first paintings. Milledgeville was the home of Mirabeau B. Lamar and Joanna Troutman, the creator of the Lone Star Flag, and congressman Hines Holt (below) among many others.</p>
<p>One of the most famous incidents in the War for Texas Independence, aside from the affair at the Alamo, was the massacre at Goliad when so many of James W. Fannin ‘s men were slaughtered. Fannin was from Morgan County, Georgia, just north of Milledgeville, and was married to Minerva Fort, a member of the family of Congressman Tomlinson Fort of Milledgeville. They were well acquainted with C. R. Parker’s paintings, both in the Capitol building in Milledgeville as well as among their relatives and friends.</p>
<p>To go to Morgan County meant taking the post road right past the Lamar plantation “Fairfield,” the home of Mirabeau B. Lamar and his siblings, including Mirabeau’s sister, Loretto, whose portrait was painted by Parker. However, on the way out of Milledgeville the traveler had to first pass “Jackson Hill”, the plantation of Green Hill Jordan, and then the plantation of his brother, Benjamin Smith Jordan, “Westover.”</p>
<p>One of the few men from the Texas command who did not die in the Goliad massacre was Basil Lamar, Mirabeau Lamar’s cousin, who was a lieutenant and had been sent as a courier to the capital at Washington, Texas.</p>
<p>John Troutman settled in Milledgeville soon after its founding in 1803 and by 1810 operated the only local grist mill and was proprietor of an inn. He had two children: Joanna Troutman who married Jeremiah Lamar of Milledgeville in 1812, and Hiram B. Troutman, whose daughter, also named Joanna, was born in Milledgeville in 1820. The younger Joanna Troutman designed and made a flag which she presented to the volunteers as they marched off to join the fight for Texas independence. Some believe that it is upon the suggestion of her kinsman Mirabeau Lamar that the flag was created. That banner became the “Lone Star Flag” of Texas.</p>
<p>Mirabeau’s sister, Loretto Lamar, married Congressman Absalom Chappell of Georgia; their portraits are also attributed to C. R. Parker. Indeed, the portrait of Absalom Chappell is strikingly similar to that of Stephen F. Austin, excepting the fact that Chappell was older his hair longer and his forehead higher than Austin’s.</p>
<p>Mirabeau B. Lamar was certainly well known to Stephen F. Austin, and Mirabeau certainly knew the work of C. R. Parker. Mirabeau Lamar first arrived in Texas in 1835 about the time that Austin was released from prison in Mexico and in very short order became an intimate of the leaders of Texas that were most attached to Austin, including Lorenzo de Zavala, the vice-president, and Jane Long, “The Mother of Texas.”</p>
<p>From the Lamar family records: “Mirabeau followed his friend James W. Fannin, Jr., to Texas to collect historical data. A journal of his trip records that he left Columbus, Georgia by stage on 15 June 1835.” He was so enthused about Texas that after helping build a fort at Velasco he returned briefly to Georgia to settle his affairs and move to Texas. He had left his trunks and documents in Texas with Jane Long while he made the hurried trip to Georgia. Then he heard about the Alamo and dashed back to Texas.</p>
<p>Following is Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar’s letter to his brother, Jefferson Jackson Lamar, immediately after Mirabeau arrived back in Texas in April 1836.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Jefferson J. Lamar, Esqr.</i></p>
<p>Macon State of Georgia, US</p>
<p>Harrisburg, 10th April 1836</p>
<p>Dear Brother</p>
<p>I leave this morning for the army; a dreadful Battle is to be fought in three or four days on the Brazos, decisive of the fate of Texas; I shall of course have to be in it. Wm. D. REDD of Columbus is with me. Texas is in a dreadful state of confusion; the Mexicans thus far are prevailing. St. antonio has been retaken by them and every man in the fort murdered - CROCKET was among the number. FANNIN's army is entirely destroyed. After fighting four or five hours, the enemy held out the white flag and proposed terms of capitulation to which FANNIN yielded. The terms of surrender was that they were all to be transported to New Orleans, not again to engage in the war; they were about four hundred, including WARDS's men, and Capt. MILLER's first arrived &amp; taken at Copano. They were kept prisoners 9 days, then marched out and fired upon &amp; all butchered with the exception of two or three who escaped by flight. Almost the whole of the Americans from Georgia and Alabama have perished. The citizens of Texas are flying in every direction; houses, farms &amp; c. are deserted and every thing left behind. HOUSTON's Army has retreated from the Colorado to the Brazos; the Mexican army is in San Fillipe, ours 20 miles from them; they will come together in a few days. I shall reach HOUSTON day after tomorrow, a distance from this place about 50 miles - In the event of my falling in Battle, you will find my trunks, papers &amp;c in the posession of Mrs. Jane LONG who has temporarily fled from Brazoria to Boliver point at Galveston Bay. The money brought by me to be laid out in Lands, I have of course, in the present confused state of things, not been able to lay out. Govt has no authority to sell lands, and from individuals no purchase can be yet made with safety. I have therefore been much embarrassed to know what to do with so large a sum of money; it is too dangerous to keep it about me, especially as I am going in to Battle. After due consideration, I have placed it in the hands of Lorenzo ZAVALA, the vice President of the Government, the most responsible and probably the most honest among them. His receipt for the money, I know not how to dispose of other than to keep it about me with instructions to Wm D REDD to take it to you in the event of my falling &amp; his escaping - The amt placed in ZAVALA's hands is six thousand dollars; REDD, the president D. G. BURNET, POTTER &amp; others saw me give the money to him, and can be evidence of the fact if I should loose the receipt. I hope the gentleman for whom I am acting will believe that I have acted for the best; it is true, I might fly precipitately to the U. S. and return them their money without trusting it with any one here, or exposing my self to danger, but a course so unpatriotic and disgraceful, I know they would not require of me; if in addition to the facts of envolving an equal amt with each of them, and also peril my life, I am confident they will acquit me of any selfish disregard of their interest –</p>
<p>If I fall I shall leave either with ZAVALA something in the shape of a will which you will have to execute; I shall leave it either with ZAVALA or Mrs. LONG. If not drawn up with the formalities of law, I know that it will nevertheless be fulfilled. My health at present is good. I feel much solicitude for my mother; If she was well and cheerful &amp; could bear affliction with more fortitude I should be happy - Tell Rebecca Ann, that she must learn to write read &amp; spell well, and that is the best education - I have petitioned to Govt for my League of Land as a citizen of Texas in 1835; but the Govt will do nothing in it; I think however the testimony of Hoxey &amp; Christman, the surveyor, of my intention to return to the Country as a citizen will hereafter secure the Land when the war is over. I write in Great haste.</p>
<p>Your affectionate Brother</p>
<p>M. B. Lamar</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-06_b2ec.html" title="Edit section: C.R. Parker and Stephen F. Austin">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">C.R. Parker and Stephen F. Austin</span></h2>
<p>The painting is signed in red “C. R. P.” a typical abbreviation of his standard signature, “C. R. Parker.” The canvas is early 19th century as should be expected. The colors, background features and the elegantly posed asymmetrical composition, are all hallmarks of Parker’s portraits in the 1830’s - 1840’s.</p>
<p>Is this really a portrait of Stephen F. Austin? That question has been addressed by the foremost authority on Stephen F. Austin and biographer, Dr. Gregg Cantrell of Texas Christian University, who consulted other historians in the matter and compared the physical characteristics in this portrait with all known extant Austin likenesses. With this portrait conforming all identifiable characteristics of Austin and Dr. Cantrell personally convinced it is an authenticate portrait, there seems to be little doubt that this is indeed a portrait of Stephen F. Austin, “The Father of Texas.”</p>
<p>When, where and how could the painter and subject have been brought together to produce this portrait? If Parker’s and Austin’s travels and activities prevented them from being in the same place at the same time, then the attribution is questionable. If it can be shown that they were in the same city simultaneously, the possibility increases substantially. Since there is little or no probability that Austin just indiscriminately walked into Parker’s studio and asked for his portrait to be painted, it suggests that there had to be a common contact, someone to introduce the painter and the subject. If Parker and Austin found themselves in the same city at the same time and there was a common factor between the two men that would have led to an introduction, then the final question of authenticity is essentially answered.</p>
<p>There are four probable ways in which C. R. Parker and Stephen F. Austin could have come together. First, having read that Austin was in town, Parker could have approached him and requested that he sit for a portrait. Second, that there was a relationship between the Austin and Parker families which could have led them to seek out each other while in the same town, probably New Orleans. Third, that there was an acquaintance linked to both men in the town who could have introduced them. Fourth, that C. R. Parker and his abilities were known to Austin’s acquaintances in Texas and they were thus introduced.</p>
<p>In fact, all four scenarios were not only possible but equally probable. We may never know which did cause the meeting, but there can be little question about it happening and that it most likely happened in the winter of 1835-36 when Stephen F. Austin was in New Orleans from December 1835 to January 1836. Austin had been in New Orleans earlier in 1835 but that was in the hot season and he would not have sat for a portrait in winter garb as he is presented in this portrait.</p>
<p>Stephen F. Austin came to Texas in 1821 in response to the deathbed request his father, Moses Austin,. At that time Stephen Austin was working at a New Orleans newspaper and attending law school. C. R. Parker had not yet arrived in New Orleans so there is no chance of them meeting at that early date. However, Moses Austin and the Austin family were from Durham, Connecticut, which was home to several generations of Austins and the site of the family graveyard. There are still Austins living in the area, including the nearby towns of Wallingford (six miles distant) and Cheshire, Connecticut, six miles from Wallingford and twelve miles from Durham.</p>
<p>Durham, Wallingford and Cheshire, Connecticut were all villages, or at most, small towns. In 1800, after Moses Austin left for a more promising future elsewhere, the town of Durham had a population of 1,029; Cheshire had 2,288; and, Wallingford had 3,214. The families in all three towns had been intermarrying for generations, leaving many if not most of them related in some form to everyone else.</p>
<p>Similar relationships between the clients of C. R. Parker and the sympathizer / activists in the Texas cause abound throughout the South. These few examples are chosen to suggest the web of patrons and clients of Parker who could have, and in many cases did, directly touch on the life and career of Stephen F. Austin. From their home towns in Connecticut to their interrelated families and friends, C. R. Parker and Stephen F. Austin, who were nearly the same age, shared business, social and political connections. Similar relationships are found in New Orleans, along the Natchez Trace, and many other areas.</p>
<p>Thus, Austin and Parker were in New Orleans at the same time. Any of these relationships could have been the catalyst for the introduction of Austin and Parker that resulted in the painting of Austin’s portrait. Indeed, it may very well be that the simplest answer is the correct answer: Parker could have seen in the newspaper that Austin was in New Orleans during December 1835 / January 1836, and sought out someone among his friends and relatives who could introduce him to the famous man. Parker could then have offered to paint Stephen F. Austin’s portrait for free. He was known to have done that for other illustrious personages. We will probably never know for certain but one thing is abundantly clear: the possibility of a personal introduction between Austin and Parker is certain, and the purported portrait of Stephen F. Austin by C.R. Parker is the result.</p>

David W. Butler High School is located in Matthews, NC. It is part of Charlotte Mecklenburg School district (also known as CMS). The school's mascot is the Bulldog and it's colors are red and black. The school has been rated as one of the top high schools in the nation by Newsweek Magazine <a href="http://www.newsweek.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newsweek.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. The football team has come under the local spotlight recently because of their double overtime game with crosstown rival Independence High (which Butler lost by a touchdown) and the team's place in the Charlotte Observer's Sweet 16 High School football rankings. A win for the Bulldogs would have broken the longest winning streak of any active high school football team in the nation. The construction of the school was completed in 1997. The school is named after David W. Butler, a former CMS teacher who died in a fire while saving his family.</p>

<p>The Oakridge School is a coeducational, college preparatory day school enrolling students in Preschool through Grade 12. Located in Arlington, Texas, the School is readily accessible by car to students from the greater Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex area.</p>
<p>The Oakridge School was founded in 1979 by a group of parents and educators concerned with offering a challenging college preparatory curriculum. Emphasizing personal development, the School aims "to provide....an education of highest quality to academically qualified students, to motivate each student to perform at his or her maximum potential, and to prepare students for a life of achievement in a global society."</p>
<p>Oakridge was founded in 1979 by a group of concerned parents and educators who sought a comprehensive approach to education. The school opened in the 1979-1980 academic year with eighty-five students in the Handley United Methodist Church. Headmaster Andy J. Broadus was selected in March 1981.</p>
<p>In March 1982, the school moved into the Handley Middle School Building. Oakridge opened its Early Childhood Center at the present thirty-six acre Pioneer Parkway campus in 1984 and added the Upper School in 1985. The 1986-1987 school year saw the completion of the Lower, Middle School Building and Student Activity Center. In 1994, a new library and multipurpose activity center were constructed. The Information Center and Fine Arts buildings were constructed during the 1999-2000 school year and were fully operational for the beginning of the 2000-2001 school year. In 2006 the school purchased over fifty acres adjacent to the school to guarantee future growth and stability of the school.</p>
<p>Oakridge students are successful in academics, the arts, and athletics. Among the members of the Class of 2006 were 1 National Merit Finalist, 4 National Hispanic Scholars, 1 National Achievement Scholar, and 25 AP Scholars. This class was awarded over 4.1 million dollars in merit based scholarships. In athletics, the varsity boys' soccer team was 1st runner up in Division 1 in the Southwest Preparatory Conference and 5 seniors will go on to play intercollegiate sports. In fine arts, 2 seniors were named to the Texas Music Educator's Association All State Choir, 7 students were named to the Texas Private School Music Educator's Association Choir, and 1 student was named to the Texas Private School Music Educator's Association All State Orchestra. In addition, the Upper School a Capella Choir returned for the 5th time to sing at Carnegie Hall. The theater arts division received 9 nominations for the Betty Buckley Awards and was awarded 6 of these nominations, including best musical. In the art division, 3 students were recognized this year in the 2006 Twelve County Art Competition.</p>
<p>THE CAMPUS. The School’s 85-acre campus currently consists of nine buildings. The Early Childhood Center houses Preschool, Pre-Kindergarten, and Kindergarten, a large multipurpose room, and a computer lab and features an expansive playground.

Scandinavia Online AB</i> is a <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a> US District Court civil case, numbered 00-cv10488-EFH, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. It received considerable attention in the online community because it involved <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverse_engineering.html" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineering</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content-control_software.html" title="Content-control software">content-control software</a>, allegedly in violation of <a href="../../../c/o/p/Copyright.html" title="Copyright">copyright</a> law and a <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clickwrap.html" title="Clickwrap">clickwrap</a> license agreement.</p>
<p>In early <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000.html" title="2000">2000</a>, Eddy L. O. Jansson and Matthew Skala reverse engineered the content-control package Cyber Patrol and published a report titled <i>The Breaking of Cyber Patrol® 4</i> detailing what they found, including a <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptanalysis.html" title="Cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> of the <a href="../../../c/r/c/CRC-32_5917.html" title="CRC-32">CRC-32</a>-based <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hash_function.html" title="Hash function">hash function</a> that concealed the configuration password and Web site and <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> newsgroup blacklists. They commented critically on the content of the blacklist, and highlighted apparent errors in it, innocuous sites and newsgroups blocked as objectionable for no visible reason. Along with the essay, they included software in C and Delphi demonstrating the attacks and allowing users to disable the package, change its configuration, or browse the blacklists in decrypted form. The break was widely reported on March 11, 2000. <a href="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://slashdot.org/yro/00/03/11/117240.shtml" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p>On March 15, Microsystems Software, the publisher of Cyber Patrol, and <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mattel.html" title="Mattel">Mattel</a>, its parent company, filed suit against Jansson, Skala, and the ISPs that hosted their personal Web sites, Scandinavia Online and Islandnet. They filed in US court, though Jansson and Scandinavia Online were located in <a href="../../../s/w/e/Sweden.html" title="Sweden">Sweden</a> and Skala and Islandnet were located in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a>. They alleged that the reverse engineering was copyright infringement by Jansson and Skala; that distributing the essay and software (or, in the case of Islandnet, the link on Skala's site pointing to the essay and software on Jansson's site) was copyright infringement by the ISPs; and that Jansson and Skala's actions constituted breach of the <a href="../../../c/l/i/Clickwrap.html" title="Clickwrap">clickwrap</a> license agreement on Cyber Patrol, interference with advantageous business relations, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conversion_%28law%29.html" title="Conversion (law)">conversion</a>, and theft of <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_secret.html" title="Trade secret">trade secrets</a>. <a href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims" class="external autonumber" title="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/lawpoli/youthrights/cpbfaq.php#whatclaims" rel="nofollow">[3]</a> Once the lawsuit became known, it attracted considerable attention from the online community, far overshadowing the discussion of the reverse engineering itself. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,34998,00.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a></p>
<p>In response to demands from the plaintiffs, Scandinavia Online deleted Jansson's Web site and Islandnet asked Skala to remove his link to Jansson's (now non-existent anyway) Web site. The document and software had already been mirrored on many sites worldwide, however. The plaintiffs asked for, and received, a temporary restraining order against distribution of what they termed the "bypass code", and were authorized to serve it by email on mirror sites, along with a subpoena demanding the identities of every Web user who accessed the information. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,35196,00.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Some commentators dubbed these email-distributed subpoenas "spampoenas"; use of email for official service of court documents was, and remains, highly unusual if not absolutely unheard of. <a href="http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena" class="external autonumber" title="http://tbtf.com/jargon-scout.html#spampoena" rel="nofollow">[6]</a></p>
<p>On March 27, Skala announced that he had settled the cases against him (including one filed in a Canadian court as well as the US case) out of court and that Jansson was close to doing the same, with an agreement to stop distributing the essay and software and assign its copyrights to the plaintiffs. <a href="http://cryptome.org/skala.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://cryptome.org/skala.htm" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> Other parties had become involved, however, including three mirror site operators associated with <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peacefire.html" title="Peacefire">Peacefire</a> and backed by the <a href="../../../a/c/l/ACLU_cdbb.html" title="ACLU">ACLU</a>. The suit continued with the main issue being whether those mirror sites would also be forced to stop distributing the material. When their motions on that topic were dismissed, the mirror sites took that as an indication that they could continue to distribute it safely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some controversy erupted when news sources suggested that the exploit software had been released under the <a href="../../../g/p/l/GPL_a75a.html" title="GPL">GPL</a>, making any restriction on its distribution problematic. <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,35226,00.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> Statements from Jansson and Skala denying any intention to place it under the GPL, the lack of any copyright notice in Skala's code, and a vague nonstandard GPL notice in Jansson's code, made it fall apart as a possible GPL test case. In <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, Jansson stated on his Web site that he had in fact intended his code to be under the GPL after all, even if he had not put in the proper notices to make that stick. <a href="http://gazonk.org/~eloj/articles/the_breaking_revisited.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://gazonk.org/~eloj/articles/the_breaking_revisited.html" rel="nofollow">[9]</a></p>
<p>At the time of the case, the <a href="../../../d/m/c/DMCA_bb76.html" title="DMCA">DMCA</a> was not relevant because its enforcement was under suspension pending a review by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Copyright_Office_6a2c.html" title="United States Copyright Office">United States Copyright Office</a> of whether exceptions to its provisions should be made. <a href="../../../l/a/w/Lawrence_Lessig_0ce0.html" title="Lawrence Lessig">Lawrence Lessig</a> nonetheless used the Microsystems case as an example of tension between the DMCA and the <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_8cc4.html" title="First Amendment">First Amendment</a> in his essay <a href="http://www.lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,13533,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.lessig.org/content/standard/0,1902,13533,00.html" rel="nofollow">Battling Censorware</a>; and when the Copyright Office issued their rulemaking on DMCA exemptions, they also cited this case in their discussion of why reverse engineering of content-filter blacklists was one of only two categories of activities exempted.</p>

<p>Shintokukai Karate-Do is one of the largest and most established traditional martial arts organizations in British Columbia, Canada with locations in: Burnaby, Vancouver, New Westminster, Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, and Port Moody.</p>
<p>The sophisticated and multi-layered style of karate taught by this school: Matsukaze-ryu, is known for both its aesthetic qualities as well as its extremely high practicality as a fighting art.</p>
<p>Matsukaze-ryu was founded by David Walker: a former Butokukan karate stylist: a style known particularly for its rough and tumble sparring techniques. The style has been further influenced by various other martial arts, including Judo and Aikido, making it a highly comprehensive system.</p>
<p>Michelle Brooks is the current director of the Shintokukai Karate Association (SKA), which comprises all of the organizations numerous locations (currently 11) across British Columbia, with the main location being in Burnaby.</p>
<p>Shintokukai classes are generally strict and taught in a disciplined atmosphere of rigorous training and respect for tradition. Although recreational practitioners are welcome, this school emphasizes a more serious outlook toward training than many others.</p>
<p>Among adults there are only 3 belt levels: White, Brown and Black, although the time interval between them is quite long, with Black Belt taking anywhere from 3 to 5 years to achieve. Among children there are numerous coloured belts.</p>
<p>They are also a non-competitive school believing karate to be purely a martial art and not a sport, further identifying this school for its more traditional qualities.</p>

<p>Milton Rogovin was born in New York City in 1909. After graduating from Columbia University, Milton moved to Buffalo in 1938, setting up his own optometry business. In 1942, he married a woman by the name of Anne Snetsky. In that same year, he was inducted into the army, working as an optometrist. After being discharged from the army, Milton and his wife Anne had three children: two daughters (Ellen and Paula), and one son (Mark). He was called before the House un-American Activities Committee in 1952. Along with many other Americans, Milton was subject and victim of the Communist witch-hunts. The incident inspired Milton to turn to photography as a means of expression. For Milton, photography was a means to, above all else, keep his voice from being silenced. In his life, Milton has traveled throughout the world, taking numerous photographs, and earning highly-accredited awards. Still, out of all his work, his most impressive feat was in the development of “The Forgotten One’s.” In the work, Milton captured over a hundred families from Buffalo’s lower west side. Milton’s started the project in 1972, completing it more than thirty years later (in 2003), at the age of 92. In 1999, the Library of Congress collected more than one thousand of Rogovin’s prints. Today, Rogovin is acknowledged not only as an exceptional artist, but as a hero of working class people.</p>

<p>The original Star Wars Gangsta Rap or classic edition was made in 1996. Compared to the special edition, the animation was poorly done and it followed the original Star Wars films very loosely. Eight years later, in 2004, the people at Bentframe TV decided to completely redo the animation, adding shaded colors and thiner lines, and added several animated versions of scenes in the actual Star Wars film. In addition, there were entirely new credits added, showing small animated clips from <a href="../../../r/e/t/Episode_VI%7E_Return_of_the_Jedi_609d.html" title="Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>. However, the lyrics were left untouched except for some sound effects from the real movies.</p>

<p>The Star Wars Gangsta Rap Special Edition follows along parts of the basic plotlines for Star Wars Episode IV and V, along with a small addition of Episode VI unlike in the original one.</p>
<p>The opening of the music video shows the <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tantive_IV_b228.html" title="Tantive IV">Tantive IV</a> station flying just past the camera as a Star Destroyer follows, as seen at the very beginning of <a href="../../../a/_/n/Episode_IV%7E_A_New_Hope_8963.html" title="Episode IV: A New Hope">Episode IV: A New Hope</a> except for the fact that it's animated. <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darth_Sidious_b029.html" title="Darth Sidious">Darth Sidious</a>'s face then appears in the upper left corner saying "It's not the East or the West Side."

You then see the crew of Tantive IV and several stormtroopers fighting each other just as the movie shows, however Darth Sidious and Darth Vader can be heard trading off lines in the midst of it.</p>
<p>The camera then shows an animated version of the scene in Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back in which Darth Sidious's hologram and Darth Vader converse. However, they are instead trading off even more lines for the first verse. Then Darth Vader is shown repeatedly saying "We got Death Star!" as images of the <a href="../../../d/e/a/Death_Star_82ed.html" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, along with a line of <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormtroopers.html" title="Stormtroopers">stormtroopers</a> in front of it, flash by until the explosion of <a href="../../../a/l/d/Alderaan.html" title="Alderaan">Alderaan</a> ends it.</p>
<p>The camera then cuts to the planet of <a href="../../../t/a/t/Tatooine.html" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> where <a href="../../../l/u/k/Luke_Skywalker_d1fc.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a> is shown fixing his landspeeder while his <a href="../../../u/n/c/Uncle_Owen_812d.html" title="Uncle Owen">Uncle Owen</a> shouts commands to him for the spoken interlude. Luke then raps the second verse while he is shown standing over the courtyard, working on <a href="../../../r/2/d/R2D2_f23a.html" title="R2D2">R2D2</a> and <a href="../../../c/3/p/C3P0_17b4.html" title="C3P0">C3P0</a>, having a whole line of <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jawas.html" title="Jawas">Jawas</a> surrounding him, and finally sitting at the Lars dinner table.</p>
<p>The ghost of <a href="../../../o/b/i/Obi-Wan_Kenobi_fb34.html" title="Obi-Wan Kenobi">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> then appears over Luke's <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-wing.html" title="X-wing">X-wing</a> for the first bridge telling Luke to "Run to <a href="../../../d/a/g/Dagobah.html" title="Dagobah">Dagobah</a>." <a href="../../../y/o/d/Yoda.html" title="Yoda">Yoda</a> is then shown doing a flip in the air with his lightsaber as he raps the third verse which ends with him using the Force to pull Luke's X-wing out of a bog as he sings "You won't believe your eyes once the X-wing rise." Luke then stands up behind Yoda the two begin trading off raps for the fourth verse about whether or not Luke should go to <a href="../../../c/l/o/Cloud_City_0075.html" title="Cloud City">Cloud City</a> and for a moment a background with the floating metropolis appears right behind Luke. He then hops into his cockpit and takes off.</p>
<p>The second interlude then takes place showing Luke in the cockpit of his X-wing, which right afterwards is shown swooping towards Cloud City. Luke is then shown inside Cloud City walking up to meet Darth Vader and the famous duel between Darth Vader and Luke which took place in Episode V begins while the two are singing the fifth verse, leading up to Darth Vader continuously singing "I'm yo fatha, I'm yo fatha!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, several <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_Fighters_665f.html" title="TIE Fighters">TIE Fighters</a> are shown chasing after the <a href="../../../m/i/l/Millenium_Falcon_c708.html" title="Millenium Falcon">Millenium Falcon</a> in space while <a href="../../../h/a/n/Han_Solo_1c62.html" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> sings the outro by repeating the line:"Knock 'em out the box, Luke. Knock him out!" As he repeats this line, an animated Luke is shown destroying the Death Star in Episode IV, making an AT-AT walker fall over in the <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Hoth_76f2.html" title="Battle of Hoth">Battle of Hoth</a>, and then cutting off Darth Vader's robotic hand just as in Episode VI. The end credits (which purposly look like those of the real Star Wars films) appear and behind them is the fireworks show above <a href="../../../e/n/d/Endor.html" title="Endor">Endor</a> in Episode VI, several <a href="../../../e/w/o/Ewoks.html" title="Ewoks">Ewoks</a> jumping up and down because of their victory, the ghosts of Anakin, Obi-Wan Kenobi,and Yoda (along with two more Jedi ghosts), and finally <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess_Leia_d504.html" title="Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a> in her slave girl outfit.</p>

IRA SCHNAPP was born on October 10, 1895, in the small, rural village of Sassow, Ukraine. Schnapp's parents, Sadie and Max, had four sons: Jacob (born in 1888), Samuel (1890), Joseph (1893), and Israel (1895). "Israel" later changed his name first "Ira." The Schnapp family emigrated to America in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>At age 16, Ira Schnapp hand-carved stone inscriptions in New York City’s Public Library and Post Office. In 1934, he became a logo designer and letterer for dime-novel fantasy fiction “pulp” magazines. In 1938, he joined National Periodical Publications, Inc., where he designed numerous logos and hundreds of hand-lettered house ads for DC comic books.</p>
<p>Schnapp designed the original logo for “<b>Action Comics</b>” featuring the first appearance of Superman, and also created the definitive <b>“Superman”</b> logo, a masterpiece which has remained virtually unaltered for six decades. Schnapp also designed classic logos for <b>Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Justice League of America</b>, and hundreds of other DC comics.</p>
<p>Schnapp left DC in the late 1960s. According to DC writer Marv Wolfman, "DC kept Ira employed doing miscellaneous things around the production department because, I was told, the management felt they owed him for all his great work.” But DC's loyalty apparently had its limits. According to DC artist Neal Adams, in the end, the company "forcibly retired Schnapp, and he went to Florida [from his home in Manhattan]. He wasn't sick a day in his life, but within a half-year, he was dead."</p>
<p>Ira Schnapp died in 1970, at age 75, of unknown causes. (It is unknown if his wife, Beatrice, son Martin, or daughter Theresa survived him.) Modified versions of many of the logos Schnapp designed for DC are still in use by the company, and his inscriptions on New York City’s Public Library and Post Office still stand as the legacy of this visionary designer.</p>

<p>Moogli is a term that denotes (or at least was supposed to denote) happiness. Moogli is supposed to be pronounced "MooGlee", and stands for "Mooing Gleefully". The reasoning behind it is unknown, but it would most certainly seem like it came from either a childish or drunken person or people.</p>

<p>Section 3A is a section in Norelius Hall (a.k.a. Co-Ed) at Gustavus Adolphus College, located in St. Peter, MN, United States. As of the 2006-2007 school year, this section contains 23 girls who have chosen a substance-free life style, which goes along with the choice to have a great deal of fun. The activities in Section 3A range in variety, but all center around one common theme: Laughter. The girls are recognized for their enthusiasm towards life, along with giant games of Uno, Spoons, or Apples to Apples. Their claim to fame is the new, bigger table which was brought up to their section in October of 2006. It is a rare weekend when there is not a movie playing in the common area, and even with a bigger table, it seems there is never enough chairs for everyone to sit comfortable while working on homework with their laptops and textbooks. The girls from this section are not only welcomed, but expected to be a part of just about any fun activity on campus, especially when Frost-Your-Own cookies are offered. The highlights of the section are the white board in the common area and the quote wall. The white board is always filled with funny quotes girls have said (usually on accident) and the quotes are both inspirational and humorous.</p>
<p>The section's CF (which is much like an RA in other schools) is Cassie Cunningham. She's known for many things, including but not limited to: Cooking baked goods, painting her nails frequently, going out of her way to help others, being at the butt of jokes, and being an amazing person. The rest of the residents in section 3A absolutely love Cassie and can’t wait to send their kids to her kindergarten room.</p>
<p>The other residents will be listed next, in no particular order:</p>
<p>The comedian of the group is notably Diana Scott. Whether she is making Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves fall in love on the Sims, telling her famous stories that end in finding five dollars, or some other crazy act that only she would think of like running around with a blanket for a cape or sliding down the railings on the stairs, Diana is continuously making the other residents laugh. The highlight of Diana's time at Gustavus so far has been her moment of glory when she allowed the other girls in the section to straighten her curly and puffy hair, along with applying a little make-up to add to her beauty.</p>
<p>Diana's roommate, Elizabeth Olson, is an early-to-bed, early-to-rise kind of girl. She plays multiple instruments and is extremely smart. In fact, when she gets together with Kirsten to work on Cal. 2, the rest of the section can't even tell what language they are speaking.</p>
<p>Kirsten Bouma is another crazy Calc. 2 participant, along with a familiar face in the music building. She enjoys time to herself, but when she makes appearances in the common area, the girls tend to be floored by her intelligence, especially when it comes to games of Boggle.</p>
<p>Alyssa Becklin, Kirsten's roommate, is the owner of a massive laptop, lovingly named Lappy from a movie on homestarrunner. The rest of the girls love Lappy almost as much as Alyssa herself, and it seems to spend almost as much time in the common area as Alyssa does. If Aly is not wasting time chatting online, checking her email, or posting comments on facebook, she will most likely be found in other places on campus with the rest of the girls from 3A having a lot of fun and convincing them all to stop for ice cream.</p>
<p>Marlene Kvitrud, pronounced Mar-len-ay, has been unofficially voted "Most Likely to Be Found Sleeping on the Couch at 3 a.m." The girl is a bundle of fun and energy, but never seems to have enough time to finish all the things required by her many classes and extracurriculars. Therefore, she is often found taking a quick power nap in the middle of the night between her Brit. Lit. reading and an FTS paper.</p>
<p>Marlene’s roommate is Ashley Tibbits. She can be spotted from a mile away because of her long, beautiful, dark red hair.</p>
<p>Gabriel (Abby) Smith, nicknamed Fast Hands Smith, is the advocator of watching good movies. She has the biggest movie collection ever recorded and can spit out the general plot and actors from just about any movie ever made. Abby is adored by her section for her friendly smiles and general ability to make the world a better place, but is often disliked in the middle of a game of Spoons when she is winning (as always).</p>
<p>Jamie Snyder, Abby’s roommate, is a section favorite. She is known for playing Disney movies or music, her love for Spiderman, and her love for her boyfriend, Grant. The rest of the girls in the section cut out and colored balloons for her on her 20th birthday (because of her fear of balloons) and they still hang around the door frame. The rest of the girls like to think it symbolizes their celebration of Jamie everyday.</p>
<p>Jillian Korbas and Miranda Swanson are the roomies that the rest of the girls are jealous of. Both have amazing personalities, and the two spend tons of quality time together. When they come out of their room-o’-fun and hang out with the rest of the section, it tends to turn the already loud and obnoxious group towards even more noise. Those two girls are a blast.</p>
<p>Jessica Johnson, lovingly called j-johns, is the would-be-shy-girl. However, even though she is not yelling all the time, she still gets her voce heard by raising her hand before she speaks. She is also a pro at organizing fun stuff for the girls to do, like the upcoming Mainstay and The Afters concert, and organizing the weekly Bible study.</p>
<p>Jessica’s roommate, Alysha Dicke, is also known for organizing activities, but her claim to fame is the trip to the corn maze the group took last month (October). Alysha is a chemistry buff, and spends a lot of time at the end of the big table explaining equations to the other crazies who took chemistry as well. Alysha is also recognized for her big, fluffy, multi-colored pillows.</p>
<p>Katelyn Pederson, a.k.a. Dance Superstar, spends a lot of time practicing with the dance team. (Which is good, because she is awesome). When she’s not practicing, however, she can be found wandering around in the section with her cute clothes and hair. She’s super crafty, always amazing the section with her supply of colorful ribbon or adorable cards for holidays.</p>
<p>Katelyn’s roommate is Laura Walz. Laura loves to shop, and can be seen sporting the latest styles. When Laura comes through the section, she always has a big smile and lights up the room.</p>
<p>Lisa Julin is the cross-stitch queen. She is also recognized for her beautiful singing voice, random snacks, and good word games like Boggle and Scrabble. Her fish, Alfred, lives happily in her dorm room, along with her roommate, Jenny Story.</p>
<p>Jenny is the bringer of all good things—especially the Mary Kay party. While biology tends to kick Jenny’s butt, when she puts her away her studying and hangs out with the rest of the section, they love her down-to-earth personality and random comments.</p>
<p>Abby Tinberg’s screen name is crabbyabby, but that couldn’t be any opposite of her actual personality. Abby comes up with the funniest things and the craziest quotes, and is also the winner of the “Weirdest Things Written on Her White Board” award. The section is lonely without Abby.</p>
<p>Jenna Bullock is Abby’s roommate. A hockey player, the section is fascinated by Jenna’s bruises. Whether she’s on the ice, or looking gorgeous with straightened hair and a smile, Section 3A loves their Number 11!</p>
<p>Rachel Anderson is known for her memorable appearances in the common area. While she spends a lot of time studying, working, and exercising, when Rachel hangs out with the group she always has something to add—especially the time the girls were watching a movie and she blurted out, “Oh, my cousin’s in this movie!” but not until over halfway through.</p>
<p>Jamie Mitchell is Rachel’s roommate.</p>
<p>Kelsey Brugger is the section’s famous tennis player. For a while, the only Kelsey the other girls knew was tired, sweaty Kelsey. However, now that tennis season is over, Kelsey is tons of fun to have around (not that she wasn’t before) and chills out in the commons a lot more. Plus, she’s not as sweaty. That’s always good.</p>
<p>Kelsey’s roommate is Laurie Callaway. Laurie is known for coming and going in the middle of the night, but always up for good conversation as she wanders through the commons. Her quotes have even been known to make it onto the white board.</p>
<p><br />
Section 3A is unofficially the coolest and most loved section in the history of the world. The 22 girls and their amazing CF have so much fun they don’t know what to do with it all, and there is no one who can say they’re not jealous without lying.</p>

<p>Mary Frohman was a member of the Dehorn Crew, and she sand with Leslie Fish on meny of the early songs. She sang the choras of "Toast for unsung heroes", "Turn and Belive", Iorn Mistress", "Hope Erie" (a famous Filk song), "The Thousandth man", "Few days", "Thoughts on strange visitors", and "Neutral Zone, Romulian veiw". She also lived with Leslie Fish and had a romantic relationship with her. Mary Frohman did not like the fan-songs that Leslie Fish did, and her band, the Dehorn Crew, soon stopped singing with Leslie. Mary's favorite songs were "Wobblies from space", "Thousandth man" and "Tost for unsung heroes". She prefered songs about unions, and human accopleshment. She once wrote a peice that she called "The mother of all fan-fics" one month while dopped up of cough syrup. It was written to make fun of her freind/lover's fan-fiction and fan-song habits. The two eventualy broke up, and Mary moved to her home-city of Detroit. There she cared for a freind of her's who had become parapoligic in a car accedent. Under her care he became much more healthy then he was before. In 2000 Her brother, Tom Frohman, did a google person serch for her. The faimly had belived that she had died sometime during the Veitnam-Era... Possibly in the Chicago Riots which she had been involved in. Not only did he find her, but it turned out that her current residence was only two miles from Tom Frohman's, Elsa Frohman (her sister's) and her parents' residences. She was welcomed back to the faimly with open arms. Her other brother, a mathamatition named Charlie Frohman, drove up from Iowa to see her. He took along his wife and son. After that, life was pretty quiet, and she made preserves with her brother Charlie every year in the fall untill the day she died, June 4th 2005, of a heart attack.</p>
<p>Politicle Veiws:</p>
<p>Mary Frohman was a member of the Wobblies, and was also a member of the group that later became the weathermen. She was an anarchist, and would often tell stories about the chicago riots. Her specific vision of anarchy was micro-goverment as opposed to no goverment, and she was more for free-enterprise then for the more socoalistic visions of anarchy. She was an avid reader of sci-Fi, especialy Henry Turtledove.</p>
