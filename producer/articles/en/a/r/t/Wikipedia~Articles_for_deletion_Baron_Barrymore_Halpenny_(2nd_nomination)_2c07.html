<ul>
<li><b>PLEASE DELETE!!!</b> Alas I have had to come on here and I must point out that I have come on here only because this debate/discussion is about me, I have no intentions of using my sign in name/ID whatever, for any other purpose. This is a waste of my time, but as they say, necessities must. I would much rather be enjoying a walk in the countryside, which I love. Computers and Internet can waste so much time and are so artificial, that is why I love nature.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I would very much like the article Baron Barrymore Halpenny to be deleted. I never asked to be on this website or listed here and the first I knew about it was from an e-mail to me from Mr. Goldburg. I now find it through Google when checking my Websites. I appreciate Mr. Goldburg’s intentions and maybe he’s right and maybe he’s not, but as I made clear to him in an e-mail (part of which he put on here and I was a little annoyed as the e-mail was to him only), I would much rather people come to my website if they want to know about me or my art.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I’m very angry that on Google, this website called wikipedia appears when “googling” my name and has detrimental and damaging references to me regarding being “not notable”, deleting etc. this for something I had nothing to do with. Before this wiki thing came onto the scene, my name brought a clean list on Google for my websites, making it easy for people to access my material etc.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As it is, I want the article about me deleting as it serves me no purpose being on here and I have explained my reasons. As to being notable? If only you really knew, but I’m not saying here as I know Mr. Goldburg would use it to list me again and that would defeat my object of getting the Article removed.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I encountered from an early age, jealousy and bitterness. People who did not know me had already made up their minds about me. I was brought up not to be jealous and to be open-minded. All coins have two sides and before you open your mouth look at both sides.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>So I actually set out to control as much as possible, what’s written about me when I was in my late teens. This is why I don’t do interviews now (if I did do one I would have to have the right to vet it), and why information is funnelled through my websites that I control.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I will have an art agent for my commercial work and galleries that deal with my paintings. And I like it this way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have done a few book covers for my father and for other people. I have also done illustrations for books. I love cartoons and use pseudonyms for certain ones. I enjoy my art and you may well have seen my work without knowing it. It is my Art I want you to see, like and enjoy. I want you to know my Art … not me.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t really want to come on here again, so I don’t want to see these annoying references on Google again. So I would very much like an Administrator to REMOVE the Article about me and also all these daft references of deletion etc and stop Google and other search engines picking them up. Thank you!</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>YOU HAVE TO KEEP</b> Well I seem to be left a bit alone on this one. But I know that I am right. The problem is that the other editors are too lazy and rely on Google too much. I can understand Baron Barrymore Halpenny’s point and I am deeply sorry for helping to bring about the unwanted statements by editors on the Wikipedia. I never intended this. But with all due respect to Halpenny, and I admire his work very much, he is notable and should be included in the Wikipedia for the Work he has done, if not for his paintings which I know will become more well known, but certainly for his illustrations and book cover designs.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>A thought</b>. If we are all going to just use Google and rely only on Google then why do we need the Wikipedia? Encyclopaedias are built up using many sources for reference. If your form of research is just Google, then it just shows how poor and lazy you are for doing proper serious work. If Google disappeared, then so would 95% of the editors on Wikipedia. I think this debate is showing how weak the Wikipedia is in how the editors research. The Wikipedia to be a truly independent Encyclopaedia must stand on its own two feet and focus on hard facts and reality. It maybe on the Internet, but it should not rely on the Internet for its information and certainly not google! Nor should it remove an article that is neutral in content, just because the artist would like it to be. But like I say I can understand that the unwanted statements have probably swayed the artist’s opinion.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd><b>To remove this article will show Googles strength and Wikipedia’s weakness.</b></dd>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>KEEP?</b> Things seem to have changed since I last stumbled on this area, and from what I can gather we are on a second debate? I was asked by Goldburg to provide a list of books that I know Baron Barrymore Halpenny has worked on, though I note the Ghost Stations have already been listed. He has as well done illustrations in most of his fathers books and others. In <i>Wartime Poems (Paperback)</i> (<a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 978-0907595694</a>) he has done all the illustrations as well as the book cover. He has done quite a few book covers and not just his fathers books and has a significant body of work that I believe is to the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Actually if you google the books of Bruce Barrymore Halpenny, you will inadvertently google the work of Baron Barrymore Halpenny as he has most likely done the Artwork and this I feel would be the same for the books he does for other authors. So really his artwork is right across google, just his name isn’t.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don’t know much about art as it does not interest me, but I can verify the work of Baron in his father’s books, if that helps in this discussion? Anyone can if they just get a copy of the books, esp. Wartime Poems. <b>In this discussion that is as far as I can go.</b> I would just like to say that Goldburg has put a very good case here and is right in a way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>However, if the artist himself does not want to be here and I should say he is doing very well without being on here, would it not be best to close this chapter? Baron Barrymore Halpenny is a talented young man and obviously knows what he is doing. But then as his work does become better known, if not by Goldburg, then certainly someone else will once again list him. I’m unsure whether to remove or maybe wisest to just leave the stub, which at present is pretty neutral?</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I’ll leave that to an Administrator. Maybe the administrators should discuss this topic? --James Dunston 10:30, 20 March 2007 (UTC)
