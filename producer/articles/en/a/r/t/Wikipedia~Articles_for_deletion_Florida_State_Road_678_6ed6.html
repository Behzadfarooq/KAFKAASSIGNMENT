<p>I've been driving that particular stretch of road for something like a decade, and I never knew it was a numbered state road. Now I know and I still don't care. Seriously, this is half a mile! <i>Half a mile</i> of a road that doesn't even have it's own article and probably doesn't deserve one. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 04:29, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It's pretty hard to imagine many half-mile rural roads that do deserve their own article. I have no difficulty accepting Gamaliel's judgement that this doesn't. The article does nothing to convince otherwise. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperm401_861f.html" title="User:Superm401">Superm401</a> | <a href="../../../s/u/p/User_talk%7ESuperm401_06a9.html" title="User talk:Superm401">Talk</a> 04:56, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I'm not against state road articles if there's something to say about them besides their location and size. This article seems more like an excuse for a picture. Can it at least lay claim to being the shortest Florida state route (like Highway 26 in Vermont)? ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 05:09, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I noticed a large number of Florida State Roads that are in the same league as this one: small, not notable, and provide no real information.

<li><b>Keep</b> because "size doesn't matter"&#160;:). Seriously, give it the benefit of the doubt as per B.Wind.

<li>Does a Florida State Road really meet the precedent as a highway? I would take that precedent as referring to limited access highways since the other qualifying word is "Interstates". <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 13:33, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The precedent states "Highways and interstates." State signed and maintained roads are "highways." The word "highway" long predates the Interstate system. See <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln_Highway_6e05.html" title="Lincoln Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 05:44, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Articles on numbered highways are OK. This article isn't all that bad, with a picture and a fair description of why the road was built. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 09:28, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If there are enough people interested in roads to produce a complete guide to roads there is no harm in incorporating one into wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 10:13, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Delete: It's a half a mile. If I can walk it in 15 minutes, it's probably not much of a road. Having a description of the road in a larger article is fine, but having individual articles on what are actually segments seems wasteful and useless. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:48, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>True, but as you say, it's <i>famous</i>. Used to be that was one of the criteria for being included in an encyclopaedia. And cat food cost 50p a tin too. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 09:18, 29 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Famous" hasn't been a requirement since every elementary school this side of Pokemon started getting a consensus to keep. I'm a general deletionist but I won't allow state highways (even minor state highways) to be seen as less noteworthy or important or encyclopedic than the private K-8 school I attended a decade ago. Yes, I'm biased, I like roads and highways and I think their impact on our culture is underrated. This half-mile state highway has as much claim to encyclopedicity as <a href="../../../a/d/d/Addison_Elementary_School_136c.html" title="Addison Elementary School">Addison Elementary School</a>. The fact that Florida State Road 678 was built as a connector route between other major highways is at least as interesting as the fact that Addison Elementary School holds a Harvest Hoedown and has a Book Fair. <a href="../../../f/c/y/User%7EFCYTravis_fb85.html" title="User:FCYTravis">FCYTravis</a> 10:09, 29 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> There's ample precedent that if a road in the U.S. is a state highway and is numbered in a statewide (rather than merely countywide) system, it deserves its own article. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoctor_Whom_df83.html" title="User:Doctor Whom">Doctor Whom</a> 18:53, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Even the author doesn't think it's worth keeping; I agree with other arguments brought forward against the article. Also, I don't see how being part of a noteable project justifies an extra article. Kreydon 21:48, 28 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>: It doesn't bother me that this will never be a particularly long or informational article.

<li>That reference is a joke. All you have proved is that there exists a road with a number in Florida. This is not seriously worth an article.
