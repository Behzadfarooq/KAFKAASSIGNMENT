<p>The American Hearing Impaired Hockey Association (AHIHA) was established in 1973 by [[Chicago Blackhawks] great Stan Mikita, and a local business man by the name of Irv Tiahnybik, after Irv discovered the difficulties his hard-of-hearing son was having with his hearing teammates. The hockey camp grew quickly, and drew deaf and hard-of-hearing ice hockey players from all over the country.</p>
<p>The organization hosts the annual, week-long Stan Mikita Hockey Camp in Woodrige, IL at the Seven Bridges Ice Arena. The camp itself is free, though players do have to supply their own equipment and pay for their hotel room.</p>
<p>In addition to sponsoring the camp, AHIHA also helps advocate for its players, provides scholarships, and helps children obtain hearing aids. The Deaflympics ice hockey team is typically comprised almost solely of AHIHA players, and will be representing the USA once again in 2007 in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>The Lotus Bridge between mainland China and the former Portuguese colony of Macau was completed in 1999 and is a fantastically elaborate construction, featuring three lanes in each direction and dual bridges which loop around each other by 360¬∞ to swap the direction of the traffic. Amazing.</p>

In this e-mail you can also find the information about names of several other asteroids discovered by Elst. The initial e-mail was from Brian Marsden from the Minor Planets Center.

&gt; Dear Eric, &gt; &gt; Thanks for your greetings and for the upcoming copy of "Cuistre". I &gt; wish you a happy birthday this month and all the best for Christmas and &gt; 2006-- &gt; when I hope I shall perhaps see you at the IAU in Prague. &gt; &gt; I give below your names as they will appear in the December MPCs. &gt; &gt; Yes, indeed, I have been working harder than ever on the MPC in recent &gt; months. This is because some members of the MPC staff refuse to work more &gt; than 40 hours per week. Therefore Gareth (he does all the computer &gt; programming &gt; and most of the work on MBAs by the large surveys) and I have to work 80 &gt; hours and more per week, or things would just not get done, particularly &gt; on &gt; Sundays and holidays. Not only does the MPC continue to have financial &gt; problems, but there are obviously now local personnel and management &gt; problems. &gt; &gt; But, anyway, I am going away on Dec. 24 to California and New Zealand &gt; and shall not be back in the office until Feb. 1. And Gareth will be away &gt; for ten days in February... &gt; &gt; Regards &gt; Brian &gt; &gt; -- &gt; &gt; (6437) Stroganov = 1987 QS7 &gt; Discovered 1987 Aug. 28 by E. W.

<p>I am not positive but I think that the historic communities founded by the Rappites and Owenites at the present day site of New Harmony, Indiana were actually called "Harmonie" and "New Harmonie" respectively, much like the spelling of the nearby Harmonie State Park. Also it is notable that the New Harmony School (NHS) consisiting of grades K-12 has the smallest enrollment of any public school in Indiana.</p>

<p>The American G.I. refers to the American Servicemen, in particular, those that fought World War II. They provided a face to the world of far away America in both Europe and the Far East. They were also the faces and stories you would see in magazines or newspapers; the individual characters you would hear about. It was a symbol of normal people doing impossible things. Tom Brokaw described them as: "... the greatest generation any society has ever produced."</p>
<p>The acronym G.I. stands for "Government Issue".</p>

<p><b>Peter Kirsten</b> was one of the very less famous batsmen in South African cricket history. Born on May 14, 1955 he made a very late start to his cricketing career at the age of 37 because of the ban on South Africa which delayed its cricketing greats from being exposed to the world.</p>

<p>Interpetation of roman law as principles</p>
<p>Interpetation of roman law as principles concist the possibilties of making conclusions of hypothesis. There is no god on earth, if there where, there would be no need for belives. Therefore the human mind shall be able to forsee her actions to plausable conclusions. What you do not know as a free man should not be held against you when knowledge are concidered as true. Principles of law are held in good faith if you are cautios in off to charige them. From this comes normal reason in civilisations where everyone do not know eachother. Questions of morality, wich constitutes specific laws, always relates to an interest to answer them. Choices of interests, made by human beings in accordiance with the laws or in fields where there are no specific laws, can therefore not be choosen for them, claiming unlawful choises.</p>

<p>Spacial Enumeration is a technique used in computer graphics programming that uses data structures that exploit the spacial layout of the scene in order to optimise access to the data. It can be used to handle very complex models for rendering and interaction in virtual environments and games. Another application of Spacial Enumeration is in the acceleration of ray tracing.</p>

<p>Pilrig is bounded by the railway line in the Southwest, Broughton and Bonnington Road in the Northwest, Pilrig Park in the North, the gardens at the back of Springfield and Balfour Street in the Northeast, Leith Walk, including Shrub Place, in the Southeast.</p>
<p>In 2002 there were an estimated 1200 households in Pilrig with 2500 residents.</p>
<p>The streets of Pilrig:</p>
<p>Arthur Street and Street Lane Balfour Street and Place Cambridge Avenue and Gardens Dryden Street and Gardens and Gait Hawthornden Place Inchkeith Court Middlefield Pilrig Heights Pilrig Park Pilrig Street and Gardens and Glebe and Cottages Rosslyn Crescent and Terrace Shaw's Place and Street and Terrace Spey Street and Street Lane and Terrace Springfield</p>
<p>The area is essentially coterminous with the Pilrig estate of the Balfour family (of Stevenson and Darien scheme fame) which centred on the still existing Pilrig House. Land was gradually feued to eager buyers until the remainder of the land (essentially today's Pilrig Park) was sold to the local authority in 1948 with certain conditions.</p>

<p>A person in the Church, generally the Roman Catholic Church who climbs to power by being totally committed to petty church regulations. Very commonly seen in the Archdiocese of Dublin in Ireland, where a noted ecclesiocrat would be POD aka the Prince of Darkness, who serves as one of the Auxilliary Bishops in the above Diocese. Taken from Ecclesia Gk for Chruch and Crat is in Burocrat. Ecclesiocrats generally are spineless nasty males, often surrounded by lesbian nuns. Although Ecclesiocrts are naturally stupid, they mimic those above them thus preserving their status and also ensuring that their continued rise to greatness is not threatened by being unmasked for what they are - pure natural idiot. Althought thought to be extinct since the eunochs were expelled from the Forbidden City by the Last Emperor of China. Ecclesiocrats are alive and well in the Archdiocese of Dublin in Ireland</p>

<p>Tim Bevis Syndrome is an observation of the state of mind, which has been noticed in some particular teenagers. The syndrome was first observed critically by a university psychologist who noticed certain tendencies of a student of his, Tim Bevis, hence the name. The syndrome itself has the following specific traits (though, some cases may not have ALL the traits, and there can be variants): - Desperate individuality, by which the person will attempt to be seen in a different light from their peers in order to stand out from them. - Artificial taste, whereby the person will express their often profound taste in art and music, in order to be individual, which often means liking works for the sake of being different. - Fear of belonging, where the person will desperately try to do obscure and obscene acts in order to not be branded as part of the majority (and therefore retain individuality). - Disgust of what the person perceives to be "lesser" beings. This involves the person deliberately avoiding certain social spots or even culture (such as "popular" TV shows) in order to never be seen conforming to normal practices. - Openness and readiness of their uniqueness, whereby, at any available opportunity, they will show off their pretentious non-conformity to their peers and siblings, to greater their own ego and individuality.</p>
<p>The syndrome itself has been noticed in many teenagers of the last two generations, but has only recently come to light following studies.</p>

<p>Jane Creba was a 15-year-old, Riverdale Collegiate Grade 10 student who was shot on the evening of December 26, 2005. She was killed while shopping with her sister on one of Toronto‚Äôs busiest streets (Yonge), just a few blocks north of the Eaton Centre. Six others ‚Äì four men and two women - were wounded. The girl‚Äôs death was the result of a shootout between two youth gangs.</p>
<p>Police arrested two men on several gun charges at Castle Frank subway station minutes after the shooting: Andre Thompson, 20, who was on probation at the time; and a 17-year-old male who cannot be identified due to Canada‚Äôs Young Offenders Act. Mr. Thompson was released just before Christmas from Maplehurst prison near Milton, Ontario, where he had served 30 days for his role in a convenience-store robbery. He declined a bail hearing for his current charges. Police believe as many as 10 to 15 people were involved in the shooting and that more than one gun was fired. As of January 13th, 2006, police are still actively looking for the gunman who fired the shot that killed Creba.</p>
<p>Creba is described by friends and family as a top student and excellent athlete, a warm person who was full of enthusiasm, a ‚Äòbright light‚Äô, and ‚Äòa loving and caring soul with a cheerful open heart‚Äô. A makeshift memorial of flowers, candles, and stuffed animals was set up at the site of her death, and was removed with her family‚Äôs consent on January 9, 2006.</p>
<p>The ‚ÄòBoxing Day Shooting‚Äô has been the subject of intense media coverage, particularly after a year of 78 homicides and a record 52 shootings. Only one month earlier on November 18, 2005, Amon Beckles was killed outside the sanctuary of a church while attending the funeral of a friend whose shooting death he may have witnessed a week earlier. Some see Creba‚Äôs death as a sign of the beginnings of a big-city crime problem in Toronto. Detective Sergeant Savas Kyriacou of the Toronto Police Service spoke for these people in saying, "Toronto has finally lost its innocence. I think we're going to feel this day for a long time to come."</p>
<p>Creba‚Äôs death has also caused much controversy: over the causes of gun crime and the ways to handle the problem; over race and the lack of response to minority killings; and over the issue of capital punishment. Also controversial is a resurgence of the Guardian Angels in Toronto ‚Äì they arrived in mid-January to visit the city, and as of January 16, 2006, have found over 100 volunteers and a local leader in Lou Hoffer, a former Toronto police officer.</p>

<p>The Halton Waldorf school was founded in 1984 and was originally in the town of Campbellville Ontario. After years of fundraising, planning and roadblocks, the Halton Waldorf school moved to its dream home in Burlington Ontario. They now sit on 5 acres of land that backs onto environmentally protected land. The Halton Waldorf school currently has approximately 150 students enrolled in kindergarten through to grade 8. The curriculum for the school is based on Rudolph Steiner's philosophy of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthroposophy.html" title="Anthroposophy">Anthroposophy</a> which focuses on educating a 'whole child'. In the years ahead, the Halton Waldorf school hopes to expand to teach all the way up until grade 12 so children in the Halton region can benefit from a complete Waldorf education.</p>

<p>Bonkers was a candy offering from Nabisco featuring a soft chewy and fruity outside, with a soft chewy, even fruitier inside. The candies came with several of them individually wrapped inside a long rectangular package. They came in various flavors, including orange, strawberry, grape, and shockingly at the time, watermelon, and chocolate. They were very popular in the mid-eighties, due to a series of unusual television commercials, where one or more straitlaced stick-in-the-mud characters would say how much they loved their Bonkers candy. When the character took a bite of the candy, the explosion of flavor was so intense that a large human-sized fruit, such as a bunch of grapes, would fall from above, landing on them and causing a hysterical fit of laughter from the victim. The popularity of Bonkers waned over the following decade until they became a rarity and were discontinued by the manufacturer. However, they were so popular in their heyday that they still have quite a large nostalgic following among candy lovers.</p>

<p>Holland Middle School is located in the <a href="../../../c/o/u/Council_Rock_School_District_237d.html" title="Council Rock School District">Council Rock School District</a>. It is the only Middle School with two floors, and is also the newest, as it was built in 1975. It has a key-operated elevator for staff and students with the inability to access the stairs. It is a 7th and 8th grade school, and has three teams for each grade. It doesn't share lockers, unlike Richboro and Newtown Middle Schools.</p>

<p>A planet that may have exploded in our solar system eighteen million years ago. The asteroid belt is all the remains. Often cited by cultists as the origin of Atlantis.</p>
<p>The theory behind the past existence of this planet is found in bodes law:</p>
<p>Look at the sequence 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 192.</p>
<p>Notice that after the 0, each number is doubled to give the next. Now add 4 to each number and divide by 10. The results are: .4, .7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2, 10.0 and 19.6.</p>
<p>These are, within a few percent, the exact number of astronomical units (AU) each planet is from the sun. The only exception is at 2.8 AU, where we find the asteroid belt exactly where Bode's Law predicted a planet.</p>
<p>This theory is not accepted by most of the scientific community.</p>
<p>However, there are scientists who are analyzing the asteroid belt to see if it was once part of a single planet.</p>

<p>Tamriel-Rebuilt is a mod, made by voluteers, for the computer game Morrowind. It is currently on the verge of collasping due to lack of modders to work on it and the general stiff rules of the Core. All atempts at pointing out the nearing fall of the project are ingored or deleted.</p>
