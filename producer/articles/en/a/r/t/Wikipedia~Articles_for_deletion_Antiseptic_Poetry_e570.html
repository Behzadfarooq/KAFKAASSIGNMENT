<li>Look, I'm the author of the comic in question and I don't care if you delete its entry. I didn't even add it in the first place (I did add an example comic though). However, if you're going to delete it, delete it. I'm not about to play the "not notable and lets not list why other than Alexa which is just spyware anyway" bullshit game. Hahnchen, if you think my comic is gonna be another notch on your deletion belt you're sadly mistaken. I'll delete the page myself (and I did) before I let you use it for your own obnoxious purposes. Also, let me submit that what is and isn't notable is subjective. I'm not saying my comic is. Its four months old, thats barely enough time to have gotten a solid footing reader wise let alone gain notability. However, using stuff like Alexa and going "I dun rede it" and acting like having a page on the Wiki is some sort of holy goal for webcomics to achieve is just plain idiotic. What ego! We're not important enough to decide what should go on the Wiki but YOU are. If you're serious about Webcomics on Wikipedia then get some real standards and stop playing childish "I'm king of the hill" type games with it. At any rate, I deleted the page myself and I will continue to do so until its gone for good. Play your stupid ass games with some other comic.Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>If everyone here ignored the Alexa data used in the nomination, it'd still get deleted, it's here as circumstantial evidence, take it or leave it, some might find it helpful. I don't read <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a> either, and don't plan to nominate it. A Wikipedia page is NOT the holy grail for webcomics, it is at the top of the checklist, not some impossible goal. We do have real standards, Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a web directory. Yeah, editing an encyclopedia using an internet pseudonym is all ego. I'd like others to get rid of and nominate webcomics too, but no one ever does this. I nominate them in bursts, and in between every one, the list has grown and the signal to noise ratio fallen. If you didn't care so much about your Wikipedia page, you wouldn't have bothered with your petty inter protest on it, telling everyone how much you don't care and how alternative you are. Save it for Petition Online. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 01:08, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My problem isn't that its up for deletion. I don't care. DELETE if it isn't wanted. Just don't act like it was hubris on MY part for it being up in the first place. Also, your nominations of comics seem by and large rather arbitrary. Need I remind you the thrashing the webcomic community gave you when you nominated Checkerboard Nightmare for deletion? I also made no mention of how "alternative" I am or think I am. But I digress. I guess you and webcomics in regards notability are like Congress and porn eh? You know nothing about them but you know it when you see it. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>No you didn't claim how alternative you were, maybe you should? I never claimed it was hubris or vanity on your part. I wasn't even involved in the CxN nomination. Well, the list of webcomics is so incredulously large, it has been claimed that I was just "shooting fish in a barrel", this time I just picked 4 random unnotable webcomics beginning with the letter A. Arbitrary grouping? Maybe, but they're pretty accurate nominations. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:21, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Heres the thing: If you're picking them AT RANDOM then you are being ARBITRARY. End of story. You can't use Alexa and you can't actually make an argument AGAINST most of the comics you nominate. And "not notable" isn't an acceptible argument considering the vast scope of information available on wikipedia. Admit it. You're just a troll who found his niche and anyone be damned who tries to fight him on it. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>You're being incredibly petty and quite bitter here, its a wikipedia article. I can actually make up very good arguments against the comics that I nominate, hence their ensuing deletion. I'm not being arbitrary, I'm not going to go nominate Megatokyo or Penny Arcade, nor would I want to really. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, you'll see that Wikipedia isn't a web directory. Just as it isn't a phone book, nor is it an index of living people. You may want to see a list of hundreds of George Bushes on the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Bush_24e4.html" title="George Bush">George Bush</a> disambiguation page, I don't. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:35, 12 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And yet you actually never do. Its always "ALEXA! NOT WEB DIRECTORY!!! BLARGH!! STOPA PICKING ON ME!!111" If you had a leg to stand on people wouldn't get so mad at you. Championing an un-popular opinion (all the while playing the role of the vigilint watchman) doesn't qualify it, sorry. We're not talking about listing every variation of the "whacky Megaman recolor adventures" here so stop being obtuse. If you can't actually make an argument, just say so. If lack of information is the problem (and thats the ONLY wiki rule web comics entries seem to be in violation of) then contact the people who run the comic and ask them if they want to expand it, or delete it. I don't see how you can claim to be acting in the best interest of this catagory when you're not willing to work with the people who actually MAKE the stuff being catagorized. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li>If by people you mean some easily incensed webcomic fans, you'd be correct. It's to do with the harsh way I put my nominations across, I'm not the only one to nominate webcomic articles, Abe Dashiell does it a lot too, but he's a nice guy about it. I've probably never come out with the "stop picking on me" line, being that my arguments are generally a lot better than whoever wants to pick on me, and that I care just a little bit less. I'm sure my actions don't qualify with you, but remember, I do care just that little bit less. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>(after edit conflict)</i> - I see you've altered your comment to include some "whacky megaman recolor adventures" in. So they're not notable are they, is yours? You never mentioned it. The point you make about rational arguments? Try it out yourself. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 03:54, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, I don't care if my comic is included and if you noticed, I even say my comic isn't notible. I just don't like the way idiots like you go about removing stuff like this. -Lessthankate</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, per Hahnchen's webcomics expertise and persuasive arguments. This article clearly does not meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> and is unverifiable through reliable sources.

<ul>
<li>Of course, lets ignore the fact that of the two arguments he has made, one was rejected and the other is highly subjective in regards webcomics. Just delete the damn page and be done with it. I'm sure you'll feel just as good about it as if a vote had gone through. -Lessthankate
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: This isn't a "vote," and I don't see any "argument" that has been "rejected." Could you be more clear on what you mean? The nominator's point seems to me to be that "nothing I can find tells me that this 4 month old webcomic is any more notable than a myspace page." Do you have any verifiable information from reliable sources that indicates otherwise? If you're new here, you may want to review the content policies of this encyclopedia, begining with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 04:48, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
