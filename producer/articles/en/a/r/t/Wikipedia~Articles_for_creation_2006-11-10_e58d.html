<p>Radio transmission and reception started out as am (amplitude modulation) from the early work of Hertz, Tesla and Marconi in the late 1800's. The crystal sets of the early 1900's and the tube sets of the 20's and 30's were all am sets. Fm (frequency modulation) receivers didn't appear in any numbers until after the 2nd world war and even then it took until the 1960's to offer serious competition to am. By about 1970, most receivers offered both am and fm. Tube type sets had essentially disappeared and the transistor (and by 1990 the integrated circuit) held the spotlight. Most manufacturers had discontinued am-only type radios by 1980 with the exception of a curious little shirtpocket sized radio made by Radio Shack called the 'flavoradio' because it was offered in at least 10 different flavors )colors). This am-only anomaly, introduced in 1972, survived until 2001, when it finally disappeared from the catalog. Probably unnoticed at the time, this marked the end of the era of am-only crystal receivers begun 100 years earlier.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-10_e58d.html" title="Edit section: Athrogate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Athrogate</span></h2>
<p>Athrogate is a fictional character from the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgotten_Realms_8486.html" title="Forgotten Realms">Forgotten Realms</a> setting. He is depicted as a boisterous and irrepressible <a href="../../../d/w/a/Dwarf.html" title="Dwarf">dwarf</a> who favours using rhyming verses when he speaks, generally finishing his rhyme with a loud peal of laughter, "Bwahaha!" Created by <a href="../../../r/2E/a/R.A._Salvatore_07c6.html" title="R.A. Salvatore">R.A. Salvatore</a> in the novel Promise of the Witch King, Athrogate later appeared in the sequel, [[Road of the Patriarch]. Though never developped nearly as fully as some other characters, Athrogate was still a fairly solid character in his own right, though his main function seemed to be as comic relief to the more serious events occuring around him.</p>
<p><b>Appearance</b> Athrogate looks much like any other dwarf, short and stocky, with a thick black beard, parted in the middle into two long braids, each tied off at the end with a band of blue gemstones. He is possessed of dark eyes, bushy brows, and large ears.</p>
<p><b>Combat/Weapons</b> A fierce warrior, Athrogate relies mostly on sheer strength and fury, though these are coupled with a surprising level of finesse. In battle, Athrogate wields two glassteel morning stars (mace-and-chains) with magical properties. The first weapon oozes a brownish-red liquid from the nubs of the striking head which will rust any metal it comes into contact with, softening up Athrogate's target for when the dwarfs follows through with his second weapon, which oozes explosive oil of impact, pulverizing whatever it strikes. While Athrogate seems to lack subtlety in combat, the sheer fact that he can employ two morningstars at once (and to such devastating effect) demonstrates a great skill and profficiency that cannot be underestimated. While already ferociously strong on his own, Athrogate wears a large belt engraved with crossed bolts of lightning, which imbues him with the strength of a <a href="../../../s/t/o/Storm_giant.html" title="Storm giant">storm giant</a>, making him even more formidable. Towards the end of Road of the Patriarch, Athrogate is given a magical gift from the <a href="../../../d/r/o/Drow.html" title="Drow">drow</a> mercenary <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarlaxle.html" title="Jarlaxle">Jarlaxle</a> - a statue of a boar able to summon a demonic boar-like creature apply named "Snort" for the dwarf to ride, a fierce and chaotic mount which Athrogate takes a great liking to.</p>
<p><b>Spoiler Warning:</b> <i>Plot and/or ending details follow.</i></p>
<p><b>Story</b> Athrogate was once a member of Citadel Felbarr, but his familly was destroyed with the coming of an <a href="../../../o/r/c/Orc.html" title="Orc">orc</a> tribe. Unable to return home thanks to the painful memories, Athrogate was called a coward by the rest of his clan for refusing to participate in the reclaiming of Felbarr. The dwarf took to wandering, and eventually found himself a member of the Citadel of <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assassins.html" title="Assassins">Assassins</a>, figuring that it was "Better that than fight the dogs." Eventually, after the fight at Castle Perilous, Athrogate found himself in company with Jarlaxle and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Artemis_Entreri_8dba.html" title="Artemis Entreri">Artemis Entreri</a>. After Entreri "retires" from his old way of life and turns back to Calimport, Jarlaxle and Athrogate are left alone, presumably to continue their travels and adventures on the surface (some rumors speculating that Athrogate may appear in later <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drizzt.html" title="Drizzt">Drizzt</a> books to aid in the fight against <a href="../../../o/b/o/Obould_Many-Arrows_334d.html" title="Obould Many-Arrows">Obould Many-Arrows</a> presumably the orc who sacked Felbarr in the first place).</p>

<p>Hansj√∂rg Martin (born Nov 1, 1920 in Leipzig, died March 11, 1999 in Mallorca) was a German author of crime fiction.</p>
<p>Life:</p>
<p>Hansj√∂rg Martin graduated as an art major from the Leipzig Art Academy. After World War II he worked as an artist, stage-builder, decorater, and clown. In 1963 he began working as a free author. The publication of his first cime novel, Dangerous Curiosity (1955) was the start of a new genre, the "new German crime novels."</p>
<p>In a period of creativity spanning more than 30 years, Martin penned 35 crime novels, several of which were made the basis for made-for-TV movies (for example, Crime Scene: The Trembling of the Tenors and The Culprit on the Tracks). He also wrote scripts for crime series like Hamburg: Transit and It Doesn't Always Have To Be Murder. He also wrote children's literature. He was also an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), serving as a municipal politician in Hamburg St. George.</p>
<p>In 1986 he received the Federal Cross of Merit (Bundesverdienstkreuz ) for founding the genre of New German Crime Novels. In 1999, he died on the Spanish island of Mallorca.

<p>Every Topic in the Universe, Except Chickens is a solution propsed by Ryan North (Author of &lt;&lt;dinosaur comics&gt;&gt;, a comic published in some Canadian and US newspapers, available online at www.qwantz.com) to the frequent vandalism of Wikipedia. In the solution he reccomends that vandalism to all topics, except chickens on wikipedia be ceased. These disruptions, which are considered humorous by some, troublesome by others, would all be focused on the wikipedia article for chickens, because in the words of Ryan North "Dudes already know about chickens."</p>
<p>Wikipedia editors would be expected to turn a blind eye on the constant vandalism of the chickens article making it into "The Forbidden Topic" in exchange for the reduced vandalism in other topics. One of the main problems is that not all vandalism would be redirected at the topic about chickens; likewise not all wikipedia editors would accept the loss of the article on chickens in exchange for alleviation of problems in other articles. The wikipedia article on chickens was locked (protected from editing) the day that the idea was proposed.</p>
<p>A website Every Topic in the Universe, Except Chickens (dot com) was created to help with the popularization of the concept.

North sites the support of "Fictional Jimbo Wales" (Fictional founder and creator of Wikipedia) on his site. The idea was also publicized when it was displayed in the Dinosaur Comic published November 8, 2006 ( viewable online at <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=879" class="external free" title="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=879" rel="nofollow">http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=879</a> ).</p>

<p>Circus, whose real name is Jerome Holman, said to a few other reporters mere minutes after being announced as the 2006 AND1 endorsement deal winner:</p>
<p>On winning the deal: It felt great, man. It seemed like it was almost set up for me as far as the stage. It was a long, long three months, playing against some of the great guys, getting into feuds, but I'm just... man, to go from L.A. all the way to New York, 25 cities, nine elimination games where I could possibly get back to New York not doing nothing again, it felt great. Family and friends out there. I can't even explain it, man.</p>
<p>On doing it in his home city of New York: Yeah, it's very special. I told myself, coming on, my goal was to get to this point, give fans around the country a chance to vote for me and just leave it in God's hands like that. So, I accomplished my goal and it came out the way I wanted it to turn out.</p>
<p>On why he's popular and what what sets his game apart from other streetballers: Because it's so entertaining, man. I'm usually a lot more entertaining than I was tonight. I was trying to be focused and make sure to keep the game close. That's why I think these guys feel I'm going to fit in, because the entertainment value, I'm always going to be able to sell tickets and help out with the fans and things like that.</p>
<p>On if this is the highlight for him of the whole tour: I had a lot of big, 40-point, 30-point games, but this is definitely the highlight, because the whole presentation and all that, it was overwelming. Like I said, it's just good to do it back at home, in my home city. It was a great feeling.</p>
<p>On the popularity of streetball: Because with the different leagues and the pros, everybody can't make it. So it's a lot of talent still out there on the street. AND1 is the best, man. Just knowing, going through this summer, being around all the AND1 guys, they work hard but at the same time they've got a great job. It's good to get out there, it's a lot of fun and entertainment. Streetball is going higher and higher and I'm glad to be a part of it.</p>
<p>On competition with the two other players: The last whole week... they kind of knew I had a little bit of an edge because I've been on since the first city, but anybody ask me, I'll be like, one day I might say Springs might win, or, we were just banking on each other to win. We hope that everybody gets signed, but just one person was able to get the $25,000 and I'm happy it was me.</p>
<p>The 5-10, 175-pound Brooklyn point guard went to St. Patrick's high school in New Jersey, Witchita State, and has some ABA minor league experience.</p>

<p>The Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Association, or MALCA, is an international scholalry orgganization which focuses on the study of Austrian literature, culture, art and film. Originally founded in 1961 as The International <a href="../../../a/r/t/Arthur_Schnitzler_efa5.html" title="Arthur Schnitzler">Arthur Schnitzler</a> Research Association (IASRA), it is the only organization in the United States devoted to the promotion and study of Austrian literature and culture. The organization moved rapidly from being a study forum on Schnitzler to a wider venue for Austrian scholarship under <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_California%2C_Riverside_00b7.html" title="University of California, Riverside">University of California, Riverside</a> Professor Donald G. Daviau, who as IASRA president, organized an annual and popular international Austrian symposium series held at the university beginning in 1980. In addition to its conferences and publications, the IASRA was known for its quarterly journal, Modern Austrian Literature or MAL (formerly known as The Journal of the International Arthur Schnitzler Research Association).</p>
<p>IASRA was converted into the current Modern Austrian Literature and Culture Organization in 2001 to solidify and expand its specific mission within U.S. and international <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanophone.html" title="Germanophone">Germanophone</a> studies and to parallel the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_Studies_Association_a3f3.html" title="German Studies Association">German Studies Association</a> or GSA, which also includes Austrianists but concentrates largely on the literature and culture of Germany. MALCA continues the publication of its international journal MAL and promotes the research of Austrian literature and culture at annual conferences now held at various universities throughout the U.S. and Canada. Additionally, it continues its association with the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_Language_Association_1f8c.html" title="Modern Language Association">Modern Language Association</a> and presents various sections at that association's annual conference in December. In 2005, MALCA launched its e-journal, Teaching Austria which is devoted to the teaching of <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a>, <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austro-Hungarian_31a0.html" title="Austro-Hungarian">Austro-Hungarian</a>, and <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habsburg.html" title="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> culture, history and society. MALCA's website also features an Austria Portal with useful links to offical, educational, pedagogical, cultural, artistic and other Austrian sites.</p>

<p><i><b>(T)Raumschiff Surprise</b></i> is a <a href="../../../g/e/r/German.html" title="German">German</a> motion picture written, produced, directed by and starring <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Herbig_8526.html" title="Michael Herbig">Michael "Bully" Herbig</a>, along with Rick Kavanian (who also acted as a co-author) and Christian Tramitz, who have also worked together in Herbig‚Äôs previous motion picture <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a></i>. In 2004 it became the third highest-grossing German movie following <i><a href="../../../o/t/t/Otto_Waalkes_9440.html" title="Otto Waalkes">Otto - Der Film</a></i> and <i>Der Schuh des Manitu</i>.</p>

The main characters <b>Mr. Spuck</b> (affectionally called ‚ÄúSpucky‚Äù) (Herbig), <b>Captain Kork</b> (Tramitz) and <b>Schrotty</b> (Kavanian) are based on characters from the <i>(T)Raumschiff</i> sketches in Herbig‚Äôs comedy show <i>Die Bullyparade</i>.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Story / Plot</b></p>
<p>The year is 2004. In the <a href="../../../n/e/v/Nevada.html" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> desert, a pig music box is crushed under the wheel of a car which transports a general to the facility called <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_51.html" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>. An alien has been apprehended, and the experts are quite confused about its nature. The general decides to have a personal look ‚Äì and beholds a human-like figure with pointed ears wearing cowboy attire, an iron neck collar with chain, and who greets him with an affected ‚ÄúHey, what‚Äôcha looking at?‚Äù</p>
<p>Three hundred years in the future. The Earth is attacked by the Martian colonists under the command of the Regulator and his <a href="../../../a/s/t/Asthma.html" title="Asthma">asthmatic</a> second-in-command, Jens Maul (Kavanian), and they are winning. The Ruling Council under Queen Metapha (<a href="../../../a/n/j/Anja_Kling_8002.html" title="Anja Kling">Anja Kling</a>) is desperate enough to undertake time travel to undo the past: in the year 2054, <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mars.html" title="Mars">Mars</a> had been colonized thanks to alien technology which had landed into human hands in Nevada, in the year 2004. And they are all desperate enough to have the most unlikely candidates attempt this dangerous mission: the crew of the (T)Raumschiff <i>Surprise</i> ‚Äì desperate simply because the crew commanders Captain Kork, Mr. Spuck (‚ÄúMr. Spit‚Äù, a 35 year old ‚ÄòVulcanette‚Äô) and Mr. Schrotty (‚ÄúMr. Junky‚Äù) are extremely gay!</p>
<p>At the very moment, the <i>Surprise</i> commanders have other difficulties to take care of: they have entered themselves for the <i>Miss Waikiki</i> election in Honululu and are ‚Äòtraining‚Äô hard to keep in shape, which includes affected singing, weight-measuring in anti-gravity conditions (for which Mr. Spuck proves even more than ‚Äúfar too fat to fly‚Äù). For that reason, they don‚Äôt want to be disturbed and at first ignore the calls from Earth; only an urgent fax ‚Äì and the prospect for having their leave cancelled for disobeying orders ‚Äì make them change their mind. But since it is too far for beaming, and the ship‚Äôs drives cannot make ‚ÄúMopsgeschwindigkeit‚Äù (‚Äúpug dog speed‚Äù) because of a ‚Äúmarten problem‚Äù, they decide to take a taxi.</p>
<p>Soon a cab hovers into the taxi bay, with a hunk of a man ‚Äì for whom Spuck immediately falls for ‚Äì at the steering wheel: Rock (<a href="../../../t/i/l/Til_Schweiger_7c16.html" title="Til Schweiger">Til Schweiger</a>). Rock proves to be good enough to drive his gay clients through the blockade, but his taxi gets wrecked in the process and he steadfastly refuses to part company with the trio unless he gets a new one, so he accompanies them into the Council chamber. When he meets Queen Metapha, however, his resolve for getting compensation is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The crew is instructed in the use of the time machine (in the shape of a sofa) and given two additional tools for the operation: a <a href="../../../s/w/i/Swiss_Army_Knife_69fa.html" title="Swiss Army Knife">Swiss Army Laser</a> and the manual for the time machine. But just as the preparations are complete, the Martian army attacks the capital, and commando units break into the Council Chamber. Schrotty is lost when he dives off the sofa to retrieve the manual (and is later executed by getting hit with a frying pan on the head); Rock decides not to stick around after all and hitchhikes a ride in the machine; and Metapha is urged to join the expedition as well to get her out of the enemy‚Äôs hands. However, Maul‚Äôs men find the manual, and this enables the villain to build his own time machine ‚Äì a hover <a href="../../../m/o/p/Moped.html" title="Moped">moped</a> ‚Äì and follow the fugitives.</p>
<p>When the travelers come around, they find themselves in the year 1304 (Rock: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so far off‚Äù) ‚Äì right into a tournament in England, held by Lord William the Last (<a href="../../../s/k/y/Sky_Dumont_3328.html" title="Sky Dumont">Sky Dumont</a>)! After a short fight with the attending guards, they are overpowered and the men thrown into prison; William takes a fancy on Metapha, however, and wishes to marry her. He also confiscated Spucky‚Äôs <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polaroid.html" title="Polaroid">Polaroid</a> camera, with which he zestily takes a lot of pictures. Rock is sentenced to fight in tomorrow‚Äôs jousting competition against a rival champion, as William‚Äôs oily herald is quick to suggest.</p>
<p>In the dungeons, Spucky and Rock are having a most intimate ‚Äì and ambiguous ‚Äì talk (though on Rock‚Äôs side it remains strictly non-sexual) which fans Kork‚Äôs jealousy (he sits in an inconvenient position, which makes him see only shadows). On this occasion, Rock produces a music box with a piggy figure, his most treasured memento from home.</p>
<p>The next day, Spucky and Kork, chained together at their necks, are set onto the sofa, and the sofa onto a <a href="../../../p/y/r/Pyre.html" title="Pyre">pyre</a> to have them burned as warlocks. Rock competes at the joust clad in a shockingly pink armor suit, courtesy of Mr. Spuck. But the expected adversary is missing, in his stead none other than Jens Maul appears as a Black Knight. When Rock (who is, of course, a bloody amateur in jousting) loses and is sentenced to join the others on the pyre, Metapha impulsively persuades William to have her go along. Maul, as the hero of the competiton, is unable to prevent them from activating the time machine as he is being hoisted into the air by the celebrating crowd, and William makes a few last pictures with the camera. When the sofa vanishes right with the flash of the last picture, however, the herald is quick to denounce William as a warlock and assume the throne for himself.</p>
<p>The next station is Nevada, all right ‚Äì but the Nevada of the 19th century, the era of the <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_West_dfa6.html" title="Wild West">Wild West</a>. While Rock and Metapha begin to have an argument about their growing feelings for each other and the time machine is wrecked by a speeding train, Kork ‚Äì who is in need to relieve himself ‚Äì and Spucky ‚Äì because he is still chained to the captain ‚Äì go into a wooden box, which seems to be a <a href="../../../p/r/i/Privy.html" title="Privy">privy</a> but turns out to be the wardrobe of the new sheriff (who does not appear in this movie). While inside, the two quickly change clothes (Kork gets the sheriff‚Äôs star) and then quickly fall into an argument about Spucky and Rock‚Äôs ‚Äúamorous‚Äù talk back in the dungeon. The debate is broken up by the arrivals of Jens Maul ‚Äì still in his medieval black armor ‚Äì and the most notorious bandit in the area: Santa Maria (Sky Dumont in a cameo of his role in <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a>).</i></p>
<p>While Santa has a meeting with a bunch of nice old ladies before he goes off to sell a pub for a ‚ÄúStammlokal‚Äù, one of his henchmen takes on Spucky and Kork (ostensibly the new sheriff). The only thing he manages to do, however, is to sever the chain connecting the two; any other action is forestalled by Metapha, who knocks him out from behind. In the meantime, Maul tries to steal the groups Swiss Army Laser (which they have accidentally dropped) and to escape on his time moped, but its conventional top speed leaves something to be desired; rock is able to catch up with him on horseback, catch him with a lasso and capture the laser and the moped, which the group uses to escape this inhospitable era. But in the timestream they realize that they cannot properly control the vehicle; in a brief moment in which it returns to reality, they jump off, and the moped vanishes once more in time.</p>
<p>Just as the quartet is about to take their bearings (as it turns out, it is finally 2004 Nevada), Jens Maul shows up once more, having painstakingly re-assembled the pieces of the smashed time sofa with the help of the manual. He and Rock come to blows with their Swiss Army Lasers, and just when Maul is ready to deliver the coup de grace, the UFO arrives and hits him on the head, knocking him cleanly out.</p>
<p>To everyone‚Äôs surprise, the UFO turns out to be not bigger than a tablet ‚Äì and from within a boisterous, beer-drinking and very rude alien hardly taller than a human hand emerges. When the creature chokes on a sip of beer, Spucky tries to help by offering him Maul‚Äôs asthma spray; but the device creates serious over-pressure and ‚Äì well, scrap one alien.</p>
<p>Before the local authorities arrive, Rock disintegrates the UFO with the laser, and the group scrambles onto the sofa. But the control panel shows that it is overloaded with exactly 76,375 <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilogram.html" title="Kilogram">kilograms</a> ‚Äì just as much as Spucky happens to weigh. With a heavy heart, Spucky decides to remain behind, and after a tearful farewell and a farewell gift from Rock (the music box) the rest of the group activates the time sofa.</p>
<p>Back (and now) in the present, Spucky tires to convince the military that he is a time-traveling alien having come to save the world. The big wigs don‚Äôt believe him ‚Äì until a buzzing reveals a futuristic gadget Spucky had pocketed just before departing the Surprise and stashed into a most private place: a thermometer with a vibratory alarm.</p>
<p>When Kork, Rock and Metapha return to 2304, they find the Surprise crew giving them a hearty welcome, among them Schrotty (alive again) and Spucky, now at the age of 335 (Vulcanettes can age up to 400 years). Of course, with his presence in the altered timestream, Spucky has not hesitated to bestow his own personal touch upon the new world. And so the Surprise commanders get to attend the <i>Miss Waikiki</i> competition after all, not suspecting that Jens Maul is ready to have the last word about this‚Ä¶.</p>
<p><b>Trivia</b></p>
<ul>
<li>After the release of <i>Der Schuh des Manitu</i>, Herbig had asked the audience in his show <i>Bullyparade</i> about their choice of the name of his next movie project. The choices offered were: a sequel of <i>Der Schuh des Manitu</i>; <i>(T)Raumschiff Surprise</i>; a "Movie No One Would Have Counted On"; a movie about "Sissi" (<a href="../../../e/l/i/Elisabeth_of_Bavaria_f57e.html" title="Elisabeth of Bavaria">Elisabeth of Bavaria</a>), which was another regular in the show; and an advice to Bully to keep his hands off making movies.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Awards</b></p>
<p>2004 - <a href="../../../b/a/m/Bambi_%28prize%29.html" title="Bambi (prize)">Bambi</a> 2004 - Deutscher Comedypreis (Bester Comedian: Michael ‚ÄûBully‚Äú Herbig) 2004 - Deutscher Comedypreis (Beste Kino-Kom√∂die) 2004 - Goldene Leinwand mit Stern 2004 - Box Office Germany Award (Bogey) in platinum 2005 - DIVA-Award - Der Deutsche Kinopreis (Publikumspreis)</p>
<p><b>Critical Response</b></p>
<p>While popular at large with the audience, some negative criticism has been mad about the movie as well. Some critics complained about the lack of witticism which had made <i><a href="../../../d/e/r/Der_Schuh_des_Manitu_649a.html" title="Der Schuh des Manitu">Der Schuh des Manitu</a></i> popular, while homosexual associations criticised its protrayal of gay people, claiming that it would reinforce stereotype impressions.</p>

<p>Kevin Navayne ‚Äì Born August 20, 1977 in Spanish Town, Jamaica 15 miles outside the capital of Kingston, Kevin is the middle child from his father a retired Jamaican Police officer and his mother a 2nd grade math teacher. In order to give Kevin and his brothers a better life his parents picked up and left the only place they called home and moved the 1200 miles to a blue collar suburban town called East Hartford, Connecticut for a better life and education.</p>
<p>Kevin grew up as any middle class kid does in ‚Äúany town‚Äù USA. His parents are Jamaican, while his maternal great grandmother is Jewish. Though he grew up like a lot of other middle class kids in the suburbs Kevin was attracted to the fast life and faster money. Instead of worrying about what colleges to go to and the prom, he was into selling marijuana and crack cocaine. He looked up to the guys in school who drove the nicer cars and had the nicer clothes. He didn‚Äôt worry about the future he worried about the present. He says that the only reason why he attended school was for the fact that he was allowed to play baseball.</p>
<p>Kevin Navayne was a very gifted baseball player. Leading the semi-pro American Legion of East Hartford baseball team to the World Series and leading his East Hartford High School team to state champion status 2 out of 3 years while there. Baseball was his only salvation. His junior year in high school however he was expelled from East Hartford High for his fifth (5th) fist fight of the year. It was in May when the newly appointed Principal in an effort to clean up the school from its problem children which included Kevin Navayne had enough and kicked him out of school.</p>
<p>With few options but very stern parents Kevin‚Äôs father gave him an ultimatum. Either straighten out or get out. With a little bit of trickery his father was able to fake an address in a neighboring but affluent town and was able to get Kevin into Glastonbury High School. Over the year Kevin proved himself to not only fit in, but to get his grades up so that he would be able to graduate on time with his peers.</p>
<p>In 2000 Kevin moved to New York and on his very first acting audition earned a part as a construction worker in the HBO movie Disappearing Acts starring Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Lathan. In 2002 discovered by model super agent Beth Ann Moore he did photo shoots for Lacoste and IZOD. Over the next 4 years he did fashion shows for countless designers. In mid 2006 he was signed to the international modeling agency Limited Model Management. Known as their top model at the moment he is in talks to model for LL Cool J‚Äôs fashion line Todd Smith, Sean John (P.Diddy‚Äôs clothing line) and Phat Farm along with Ralph Lauren‚Äôs Black Label. He is also looking to get back into acting.</p>
<p>Kevin has been labeled a cross between Tyson Beckford, and Tyrese Gibson but with a sharper look. Kevin loves to jet ski, loves motorcycles, watching cartoons and eating cereal. He states that he‚Äôs a pretty down to earth guy.</p>

<p>J.F.A.</p>
<p>Jace Angell was born in San Antonio Texas on August 8, 1989. He is the Battalion Executive Officer at Texas Military Institute. Angell was nicknamed J.F.A. by his friends because of all the things Jace Has been able to do. Jace is a very outspoken individual with substantiated beliefs. He disagrees with current education and is sickened by the fact that students now go to school for a grade and a piece of paper and not to truly learn. Here are two of many papers Jace has written on various beliefs.</p>
<p><br />
‚ÄúPatrick just asked God, in his prayer, to open our ears and help you hear the words I am about to say. That concept, the concept to open your-self up to the vast knowledge that is out there, is one of the greatest opportunities and privileges we all so casually neglect. We neglect this concept, neglect the spirit of learning, everyday. It is overlooked individually when we pass up that good book we heard about and it is overlooked when we seek the current education system.</p>
<p>Aristotle said, ‚ÄúAll men, by nature, desire to know.‚Äù If this is so, which I believe it is, then the problem in education is not in our desire, but rather in our pursuit to quench our thirst for information and the quest for knowledge. We look to be taught rather than to learn. And we look to know instead of how to know. The dilemma, consequently, is us. It is in our acceptance of superficial learning. It is in our intrinsic draw toward instant gratification; the immaturity to accept the fish rather than learn how to fish.</p>
<p>I believe as Malcolm Forbes did in that ‚Äúeducation‚Äôs purpose is to replace an empty mind with an open one‚Äù; an empty mind with an open mind not one filled with pre-digested facts. This is where education in America falls short. The open mind is one which seeks to find the answers, not knows them, a mind which questions and has the ‚Äúability to entertain a thought without accepting it‚Äù, Aristotle. We are not taught to, but we all must question; we must question facts, theories, and the accepted way of life. If we don‚Äôt, if we simply follow the crowd, learn the answers, memorize trivial information, then I say again, we have neglected the spirit of learning and we have insulted what education once was and should be.</p>
<p>It is said by William Chace, the President of Emory University, that ‚Äúeducation is sometimes wasted on the young.‚Äù What a profound statement. But some of you have zoned out, stopped listening to my crass rant on cosmetic education, and you have accredited William Chace‚Äôs remark. Education is about an open mind, one which looks for knowledge, even if it is not going to help you get a better grade on your next period‚Äôs test. Education is about learning and not about a piece of paper or a grade, and so too many students have forgotten that. It is accepted now, that we read, do our homework, study, all these things asked of us and more so we can get that grade. Get the grade and forget all that useless information; to quote Chace, what a waste. What a waste that we don‚Äôt go to school to learn but we do because that‚Äôs what you do, and you make good grades so you can go to a good college and get a good job. It is a waste and shame that this is rarely questioned, because this is the plague of developing minds, and as long as society follows these shallow steps without iconoclasm, without question, and without individuality, education will not be wasted on the youth but education will be wasted itself.</p>
<p>We need individuality. In our students, in our teachers, in education, individuality is the beginning of true knowledge, because true knowledge is obtained by those who seek it. The lost student, who is trampled by the stampede of forced curriculums and judged by impersonal numbers, is found when he finds himself as an individual and steps out from the herd so he may take the less traveled path to knowledge; a path that is overgrown with the branches of curiosity and the flowers of comprehension, a path where learning and understanding are sought after as the precious commodities that they are. You can no longer sit back expect to be taught, because you wont be. The hardest thing for a teacher to do is teach those who don‚Äôt desire to truly learn. We as the future leaders of this world, future reformers, and philosophers, must find ourselves in a curiosity for something more, step out as individuals and open our minds to the great wonders of this world so that we may, someday, understand it.</p>
<p>I challenge everyone in here to walk through the halls of learning and embrace the spirit of a true education. I ask that you go and learn something new today, learn something that you find interesting, and once you do, share it with some one else, for this is what the greatest minds in all of history did then and may it be what the great minds of today do now. I‚Äôd like to close in a quote by Oscar Wilde: ‚ÄúEducation is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember, from time to time, that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.‚Äù</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt would be too hard for you.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not capable of that level of work.‚Äù In a society where ‚Äúthe sky is the limit‚Äù, and ‚Äúyou can be whatever you want to be‚Äù; what hypocrisy, what a contradiction in the path to success, education and, most importantly, learning. Who has the power to judge the capabilities of others, who can say what I am capable of?</p>
<p>Not you. Not a school administration, neither a boss nor a parent. I believe one‚Äôs will and strength of heart and mind are the only means of measure for success; not a past, not a grade, or a report, only a drive to be better and a desire to learn.</p>
<p>I have had such a desire, I have a desire to learn something new, to experience rather than be taught, and to run rather than walk. Though in our cookie cutter society and education system, students like myself are hindered. We must conform to strict curriculum and spoon fed education. We are told that we don‚Äôt prove ourselves in the classroom, nor do we act as though an honor student would. In rebuttal, I shouldn‚Äôt have to prove myself, and thank you. Thank you for recognizing the difference between the vast majority of students and those like myself; those who go to school for a piece of paper and those who go to learn. So too often do student want to go to ‚ÄúYale‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarvard‚Äù just for degree which will be titled with such a weighted and ostentatious name. If ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt proved myself in the classroom‚Äù why keep me from advanced classes? Maybe I don‚Äôt want advanced classes for the letters ‚ÄúAP‚Äù to be on my college application. Maybe I have a desire to learn. One which is left unsatisfied by the narrow minded ideal that, since I haven‚Äôt been the best student ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not capable of Advanced work‚Äù, won‚Äôt even give me, the wanting student, a chance.</p>
<p>A model of hypocrisy in education is the application process by which students ask to be in advanced courses, ask for a better education and ask to learn more than the average student. The mere fact that some students are denied this privilege, no, right is an outrage and an insult to what education once was, and should be.</p>
<p>I side with learning, by whatever means. My transcript has suffered, yes, and though I might not know the etymology of a word, I understand how a generator works, tax codes, and some basic structural engineering. I have hands on experiences building houses with my grandfather or discussing real world issues with a political advisor. I have single handedly, at age sixteen, designed and developed a profitable and successful business. I won‚Äôt ever let someone else tell me what I am capable of, and I won‚Äôt ever stop learning. In the words of a devoted learner, Mark Twain, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let a formal education get in the way of your learning‚Äù</p>
<p>Jace Angell was almost asked to leave TMI when his absences from school were far beyond acceptable. Jace justifies his absences with the belief that he was doing something more useful with his time as a student. Angell would skip school to listen in on an economics, psychology, business, or another class at a local college. In 2005 Jace designed an investment plan which he developed into a small investment firm, J&amp;J Endeavors. J&amp;J Endeavors has produced returns triple that of the S&amp;P 500 by proving true their slogan "A disciplined Approach to Investing". Jace plans to attend Notre Dame or Emory University so that he may further his learning and expand his business.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-10_e58d.html" title="Edit section: Snowbus">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Snowbus</span></h2>
<p><b>Snowbus</b></p>
<p>Snowbus is a seasonal bus company in Vancouver, British Columbia. During the winter, it transports downhill skiers and snowboarders from Vancouver and Richmond to the mountains of Whistler.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2001 by local entrepreneur Joktan Elbert, then 24 years-old. Complaints from bussing giant, Greyhound Lines forced Elbert to temporarily shut down his business after one season. A two and a half year battle to obtain a permit from the B.C. Motor Carrier Commission finally ended in a victory for Snowbus.</p>
<p>Now in its third season, the company busses skiers and snowboarders to Whistler at a discount price from late November until late April.</p>
<p><b>History</b></p>
<p>When Elbert first started Snowbus in 2001, it was under the name SnowClub. The idea was to bring people to Whistler in a fun and affordable way. SnowClub members paid a fee of $5 to become part of the club and paid $25 for each round trip. Members also got newsletters, movies during the trip, chances at giveaways and discounts at retail stores.</p>
<p>The service was greeted with enthusiasm from many snowboarders and skiers, but not from Greyhound bus lines. They filed a complaint with the B.C. Motor Carrier Commission, saying Snowbus was operating illegally. The commission found that the company was running without a proper license and temporarily forced them to shut down. According to the Motor Carrier Act, companies aren‚Äôt allowed to run regularly scheduled bus services that charge a fare unless they have a license.</p>
<p>Elbert made an appeal to the commission. As part of the process, he had to collect signatures from residents and small businesses saying Snowbus is a unique and valuable business. The support came in and, after two and a half years, Elbert was granted his license. About Snowbus</p>
<p>According to its website, the underlying premise of Snowbus is to bring people to Whistler in an affordable and fun way. As a result, many of their customers are younger people with no access to cars and a limited budget.</p>
<p>On the luxury bus, they provide beverages, snacks, movies and an on board host. As part of their services, customers can also purchase Whistler lift tickets and ski and snowboard rentals.</p>
<p><b>About Joktan Elbert</b></p>
<p>Elbert has been working in the hospitality and customer service industry for eight years. The 28 year-old has traveled through Central and North America and Europe. He has lived in France, Mexico and the U.S. and speaks French, English and Spanish fluently. He was recently the chairman of the Young Entrepreneurs Association (YEA) of Vancouver. He currently coaches young new entrepreneurs and supported Vancouver‚Äôs bid for the 2010 Olympics.</p>

<p>Elected to the New York State Senate in 1965 to represent the New York's 45th District, Ronald B. Stafford represented the North Country for a 37-year Senate career which included membership on several committees before ending his career as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

Ayurveda (pronounced eye-yer-vay-duh) is the art of healthy living that enables you to create harmony in daily life by applying self- knowledge and self-care. The word, Ayurveda, is from the ancient Indian language, Sanskrit, and literally means "Knowledge of Life". Inherent in Ayurvedic principles is the concept that you are capable of taking charge of your own life and healing.</p>
<p>Ayurveda may come from ancient texts, but these principles are just as applicable today in our society as they were when they were originally recorded in India. Ayurvedic living occurs when you recognize your basic nature and live according to this true self.</p>
<p>The Ayurvedic approach to life involves listening to and addressing the unique needs of your body, recognizing and balancing your mental and emotional states and deepening your connection with your spirit your essential self. You are the only one who can do this, because you are the only one who will truly benefit from your actions or suffer from your abuses.</p>

<p>Urban phoenix is a Parkour team based in Basingstoke. The team started on the 10th September 2006 after the 9th September Basingstoke jam with toxic PK and Mecca Free Flow. Urban phoenix was founded by James Tiltman otherwise known as titman or the one with the hat and Josiah Richardson, otherwise known as Joey. The founding pair started Parkour together in June 2006, and started off with little knowledge of what the sport was really about. They had of course looked at Parkour sites and gained a vague understanding of Parkour or freerunning. Their entire course of their path in Parkour was changed however when they met up with Jordan Watkins of toxic PK, he was a distant friend of ‚ÄòTitman‚Äô and agreed to meet up with the pair and do PK (Parkour) together along with Richard Ferreday on the 3rd of august 2006, Jordan and Richard showed the pair around the local PK spots in the town centre and proceeded to give them tips and a better overall understanding of Parkour in itself. On the same day the pair met guy constable, now a member of urban phoenix, simply by chance. Guy was walking past and asked them if they were freerunners, they said yes and he began doing a bit of PK with them, he was shown the spots also and phone numbers were exchanged. The pair had no idea that they would in fact become good friends with Guy or whether they would even meet up with him again. They met up, however several times after that; eventually asking him to join the team on the 18th September 2006 8 days after it was formed making him the third member. The team practiced together more and more toward the end of the summer until Guy Constable damaged his knee putting him temporarily out of action until the operation in December 2006. This was a large blow for the team especially when they were making so much progress, with a growing portfolio of pictures on their website.</p>
<p>Cormac Lisle Fenwick joined the team as a camera man on the 4th November 2006 this was a great lift for the team after Guys Knee injury. Cormac had started PK just a few days earlier and was already friends with them so they agreed for him to come out and PK with them just as Jordan had those months ago when they were just starting. Cormac was starting with a huge advantage as he got into the scene of a lot quicker than the other members of the team and this meant his progress and knowledge in the sport would expand far more quickly.</p>
<p>Urban Phoenix is still running strong today; there is a hunt for more new members and their links in the Parkour world and their recognition as a team is expanding quickly.</p>

<p>Edward Murray Bassett, born 1863 in Brooklyn, New York, was one of the founding fathers of modern day urban planning. Known as "The Father of American Zoning," Edward Bassett wrote the first comprehensive zoning ordinance in the United States, adopted by New York City in 1916.</p>
<p>Bassett served as a United States House of Representatives congressman from 1902/1903 to 1905 and on the Public Service Commission of New York, and during this time he aided in the development of the dual subway plan in New York City. He was vice-chairman of the Brooklyn Committee on City Plan, whose report was published in 1914; chairman of the Heights of Buildings Commission in New York City, whose final report, 1916, presented the first Zoning Resolution of the City of New York, also the first comprehensive zoning ordinance in the United States. He was appointed by Governor Charles Evans Hughes to the Public Service Commission, where he served from 1907 to 1911. He served posts of counsel to the Zoning Committee of New York, the Regional Plan of New York and Its Environs, and the (New York) City Planning Commission. A member of the Advisory Committee on City Planning and Zoning, Bassett was appointed by then U.S. Commerce Department Secretary Herbert Hoover to serve as president of the National Conference on City Planning.</p>
<p>Most of his work, both private and on committees, concerns city planning, zoning and the legal issues surrounding these fields.</p>
<p>Bassett is also credited with developing the "freeway" and "parkway" concepts, and for coining the term "freeway" to describe a controlled access urban highway, based on the parkway concept but open to commercial traffic.</p>
<p>Bassett graduated from Amherst College in 1884 and worked as a teacher while attending Columbia University Law School. After graduating Columbia University in 1886, Bassett began practicing law in 1892.</p>

Nichi Bei Times: Northern California's Oldest Japanese American Bilingual Newspaper</p>
<p>The Nichi Bei Times, which printed its first edition on May 18, 1946, is the oldest Japanese American bilingual newspaper in Northern California. It was established in 1946 to get the Japanese American community ‚Äúreconnected‚Äù after their wartime incarceration in American concentration camps.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we came back out here after the war, we didn‚Äôt know where everyone was,‚Äù recalled late former President Tsutomu Umezu in the late 1990s. ‚ÄúSo we got together to make a newspaper‚Ä¶It was a way to reconnect.‚Äù</p>
<p>Nichi Bei Times founder Shichinosuke Asano, in a 1976 San Francisco Chronicle article, recalled the early beginnings.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome of us who had worked for newspapers before pooled our money, and the community wanted a paper again so much that about 100 people put their own money, as an investment, into the Nichi Bei,‚Äù he told the Chronicle.</p>
<p>Although it retained some of the same staff as the pre-war Nichi Bei Shimbun ‚Äî founded by legendary newspaperman Kyutaro Abiko ‚Äî the Nichi Bei Times was set up as a totally different corporation.</p>
<p>According to Umezu, the Nichi Bei Times was founded by six main individuals: Shichinosuke Asano, the long-time head of the company; Yasuo Abiko, Kyutaro‚Äôs only child and long-time vice president; Tsugio Kobayashi and Kazumi Kawaoka, treasurers; Umezu, who initially served as secretary; and Kando Ikeda, a board member.</p>
<p>On the editorial staff was Asano, who served as chief editor and was also a long-time correspondent to Japan‚Äôs Asahi Shimbun; Shiro Uyeno, Japanese editor; Iwao Namekawa, Japanese editorial staff; Yasuo Abiko, English section editor; and Iwao Kawakami, sports editor.</p>
<p>Since the paper‚Äôs inception, it has been situated at three different locations. Initially, the Nichi Bei Times office was located at 1775 Sutter St. in San Francisco‚Äôs Japantown. Within a year, the business had relocated to 1375 Eddy St. in the Western Addition. Due to the redevelopment of the area, the Nichi Bei Times was forced to relocate to its present location, 2211 Bush St., in November of 1972.</p>
<p>When it first began, the Nichi Bei Times was printed every other day on painstaking linotype ‚Äî with three pages in Japanese and one in English. Soon thereafter, the production was increased to six days a week.</p>
<p>Over the years, the newspaper has covered wide areas of community interest and concern, including myriad topics reflective of a vibrant immigrant community and a rapidly expanding Japanese American population.</p>
<p>Issues covered have included Japanese American redress, struggle for community buildings in Japantowns, and many other stories.</p>
<p>Today, the Nichi Bei Times strives to be the glue that holds the community together ‚Äî culturally, historically, socially, emotionally, spiritually and politically.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A Legacy of Building Bridges Between the U.S. and Japan</p>
<p>The year 2006 marks the 60th anniversary of the Nichi Bei Times. The Nichi Bei legacy ‚Äî both pre-war and post-war ‚Äî is one filled with strong leaders who forged new paths in U.S.-Japan relations.</p>
<p>In 1946, Nichi Bei Times founder Shichinosuke Asano led Bay Area efforts to raise money for post-war relief goods for a war-devastated Japan under the Licensed Agencies for Relief in Asia (LARA) program.</p>
<p>Some 16 tons of relief goods ‚Äî including food, dry milk, clothing, medicine, shoes, soap and school products ‚Äî were sent to the war-torn country, with 20 percent of the goods coming from some 36 Japanese American groups throughout North and South America. The rest came from established agencies such as the Salvation Army, YMCA/YWCA, Catholic Relief Societies, etc.</p>
<p>While the Japanese American community had very little themselves ‚Äî having just come out of wartime concentration camps in America ‚Äî leaders such as Asano realized that those in Japan had less.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, the Nihon Nanmin Kyusai Kai (Association for the Relief of Displaced People in Japan) was one of the Nikkei groups formed to support relief efforts.</p>
<p>Asano wrote the group‚Äôs prospectus and used the Nichi Bei Times as a vehicle to inform the public of relief efforts, said historian Masako Iino.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe was trying to call Japanese Americans in the community to pay attention to how the Japanese people were suffering in Japan,‚Äù said Iino, the president of Tsuda College in Tokyo who has written a scholarly article on the LARA program.</p>
<p>For his efforts to bridge U.S.-Japan relations, Asano received an unusual three kunsho, or medals of honor, from the Japanese government. In 2004 he was enshrined in the Morioka Memorial Museum of Great Predecessors in his native prefecture of Iwate, Japan.</p>
<p>Asano was a prot√©g√© of Takashi (Kei) Hara, regarded as the first democratic prime minister of Japan, who was assassinated in 1921 by a Japanese nationalist.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe helped me get my first newspaper job in Japan,‚Äù Asano said of Hara in the 1976 San Francisco Chronicle article. ‚ÄúWhen I left for America, he told me, ‚ÄòDo not go just to make money. Help people.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>While almost completely forgotten or unknown by today‚Äôs Japanese American community, the efforts by Japanese Americans such as Asano have not gone unnoticed in Japan.</p>
<p>At the Yokohama Pier, a stone memorial stands in appreciation of Japanese American efforts to help a war-devastated Japan, which includes a poem written by the late empress. An owner of a kimono factory in Tokyo has, over the years, donated more than $1 million in kimonos to the Northern California Cherry Blossom Festival queens in appreciation for the post-war efforts by Japanese Americans.</p>

<p>New Directions</p>
<p>In response to changing demographics and community interests the Nichi Bei Times launched an new all-English weekly edition in January 2006 while changing its Japanese edition to three days a week. The paper remains a bilingual publication, with each section more sharply focused on their respective readerships, with an added option for those who wish to subscribe to the English edition only.</p>
<p>The English Weekly is geared towards younger and succeeding generations of Japanese Americans, and includes new sections such as Entertainment and the Arts, Food and Health, and expanded sports. There are also more youth and family-oriented features such as Japanese lessons, activities, and comics, as well as a new Community Service Directory.</p>
<p>The Nichi Bei Times strives to be the glue that holds the community together, continuing its mission of keeping the Japanese American community connected, informed and empowered.</p>
<p><br />
The 'Nichi Bei' Legacy</p>
<p>The Nichi Bei legacy is filled with examples of community leadership and bridging U.S.-Japan ties.</p>
<p>Kyutaro Abiko, the founder of the Nichi Bei Shimbun on April 3, 1899, remains one of Japanese America‚Äôs most legendary Issei pioneers. He reportedly ran away to Tokyo at the age of 14, and arrived in 1885 in San Francisco with only a dollar in his pocket.</p>
<p>He became a labor contractor and one of the founders of the Japanese American Industrial Corporation. His company, founded in 1902, became one of the largest labor contracting agencies in California, supplying Japanese laborers to various industries.</p>
<p>In addition to founding the Nichi Bei Shimbun ‚Äî the most influential pre-war Japanese American newspaper ‚Äî he founded the American Land and Produce Company, which purchased 3,200 acres of underdeveloped desert land near the San Joaquin Valley town of Livingston. They were parceled into 40-acre lots and sold to Japanese farmers. In total he helped to formed three Japanese farming colonies in the Central California towns of Cortez, Cressey and Livingston (also known as the Yamato Colony).</p>
<p>At its peak in the 1920s, the Nichi Bei Shimbun was the most widely read Issei newspaper with a reported circulation of 25,000 and an office in Los Angeles. It reflected Abiko‚Äôs beliefs that the Issei should shun intentions of returning to Japan in favor of setting up roots in America. The Nichi Bei Shimbun decried California‚Äôs Alien Land Laws of 1913 and 1920, and championed the fight for naturalization.</p>
<p>Kyutaro Abiko‚Äôs wife, Yona (Tsuda) Abiko, took over as publisher of the Nichi Bei Shimbun after his death in the 1930s. She raised money in Japan to help purchase the Japanese YWCA in San Francisco‚Äôs Japantown. The building was the subject of some struggle in recent years, as when the YWCA decided to sell the building in 1996, community members found evidence that the property was purchased by the YWCA ‚Äúin trust‚Äù for the Japanese American community, since Japanese immigrants themselves could not buy land due to the racist alien land laws of the time. A settlement was reached, and today it serves as the home to Nihonmachi Little Friends.</p>
<p>Mrs. Abiko‚Äôs older sister, Umeko Tsuda, remains a historical figure in Japan. After Commodore Matthew Perry forced Japan open in the 1850s, the government of Japan ‚Äî which had been in self-isolation for several decades ‚Äî sent a delegation to the U.S. and Europe in an attempt to renegotiate what it thought to be unfair treaties and to learn from the industrialized countries in what was referred to as the Iwakura Mission.</p>
<p>Among the five young girls sent to study in America was 7-year-old Umeko Tsuda, the older sister of Yona Abiko. Tsuda would study at Bryn Mawr College, and returned to Japan to be a pioneer of women‚Äôs education in Japan. The college she founded for women in 1900, Tsuda College in Tokyo, remains to be a well-known institution of higher learning recognized by most Japanese.</p>
<p>Yasuo Abiko, the only child of Yona and Kyutaro Abiko, was one of the founders of the post-war Nichi Bei Times, serving as its long-time vice president and English section editor. His wife, Lily (Tani) Abiko, was also deeply involved with the company.</p>
<p>Ken Abiko, the son of Yasuo and Lily Abiko, grandson of Kyutaro and Yona Abiko and grand nephew of Umeko Tsuda, is the current chairperson of the Nichi Bei Times Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The current Japanese edition editor and president is Mikio Okada. The current English edition editor and vice president is Kenji G. Taguma.</p>

<p>A Schwefe is a man or woman who would rather go off with a member of the opposite sex than hang out with their mates. There are other ways of saying this for example if you are a guy and your mate goes off to get some play with some random chick and does not chill with you, he is being 'muff before mates'. This is because he is putting his sexual desires before his mates. When you dont want him to do this you say, "Mate, bros before hoe's". Schwefes are a big problem and im sure you have all come across them in your lives unless you are like 10 or something. Schwefes are bad because any guy who would rather get some play off some skanky ho than chilling and having a couple of drinks with his/her mates, is a dick. Lets try and keep them off the streets.</p>
<p>Other uses of the word: Schwefage:- a large number of schwefes in one area at one time. Megaschwefe:- Self explanitory. Ogilvie-Haris:- ultra schwefe.</p>

<p>The Alberti Cipher was the first ever polyalphabetic Cipher.</p>
<p>Created in the late 15th century, circa.1470, by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Battista_Alberti_70e1.html" title="Leon Battista Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, it was the peak of cryptographics at that time.</p>

<p>Its creator was <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leon_Battista_Alberti_70e1.html" title="Leon Battista Alberti">Leon Battista Alberti</a>, an illegitimate son of an Italian nobleman, was also interested in architecture, painting and writing, though his influence upon Western cryptography was probably his greatest acheivement.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-11-10_e58d.html" title="Edit section: The Cipher">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Cipher</span></h3>
<p>The Alberti Cipher initially consisted of two <a href="../../../c/a/e/Caesar_cipher.html" title="Caesar cipher">Caesar Shift</a> cipher performed on the plain text, alternating at random between the two shifts. The change between ciphers was marked by the Capitalisation of the first letter of the section of text to be encrypted with the new shift.</p>
<p>The cipher was later made more complicated by using 3 or 4 different Caesar shifts alternating between them in alphabetical order, again highlighted by a Capital Letter.</p>
<p>Finally, Alberti started using more random substitutions, but the substitution cipher would be shifted about, once again denoted by the presence of a capital.</p>
<p>As holding several Casar Alphabets in one's head at the same time is difficult at the least, Alberti used a Cipher Disc consisting of two metal discs, one mobile, and one fixed, both connected to a central spindle so that the inner disc may be rotated. Around the outside of the outer disc are inscribed the lowercase letters of the alphabet, which you would look at according to which letter came next in the text you were trying to encrypt. Around the inside, mobile, disc the UPPERCASE Letters the of the alphabet were written, so that when the inside disc was rotated to the relevant position, the cipher text chracter could be read off from the inner wheel.</p>
<p>To use this Cipher Disc to encrypt a message one would simply chose a starting letter, rotate the wheel until A was encrypted as that chosen letter, encrypt a set of letters, (normally about two sentences worth), then rotate the wheel to a new position and continue encrypitng, remembering to write the first letter of the new cipher as a capital.</p>

<p>Compared to previous ciphers of the time the Alberti Cipher was all but impossible to break without knowledge of the method.</p>
<p>This was because the Frequency Distribution of the letters - the only known technique for attacking ciphers at that time - was ruined. Thus <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_Analysis_6db4.html" title="Frequency Analysis">Frequency Analysis</a> was no help.</p>
<p>Each of the Caesar Shifts would have its only, highly recognisable, frequency pattern, but when the two were combined the result was all but meaningless. Thus for a long time Alberti had an unbreakable cipher.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the weakness of the cipher was the need to indicate to the intended receipient where the cipher alphabet was changed. This was done by using a Capital Letter at the start of each change of alphabet. However, if some one who knew of Alberti's method intercepted his message, he could decipher it even if he neither knew the specific Casesar shifts used, nor had any crib.</p>
<p>This deciphering of the text could be done by splittin it in two: You would take all the text up to the first Capital, then separate out all the text up to the next capital, then put the next section of text with the first, and the next section of text with the second, and so on until all the text had been separated into two groups. Now, each group has been encrypted with the same cipher, which can be very easily broken by the use of <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_Analysis_6db4.html" title="Frequency Analysis">Frequency Analysis</a>, as its Frequency Distribution is no longer disguised. Once each section has been decoded, the two sections can be "stuck" back together again, to give the entire decrypted message.</p>

<p>Michael Walsh, (born June 20, 1956 in Manchester) was an exceptional defender who played for many clubs. He was probably best known as an exemplary captain of Bolton Wanderers F.C and also for gaining honours representing the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Manchester, Walsh was snapped up as a 17 year old by Bolton Wanderers F.C. He made his debut as an 18 year old and quickly established a reputation as a no-nonsense defender with incredible bravery and attitude. This was rewarded by his manager Ian Greaves who made him captain. This was no mean feat in a team that included characters such as Peter Reid, Sam Allardyce and Frank Worthington. Walsh stayed with Bolton from 1974-1981. During this time he made 169 league appearances (+8 as sub), scored 4 goals, and in 1978 lead the club to the top flight as champions of the old second division, after narrowly missing promotion the season before.</p>
<p>In 1981, Walsh was snapped up by Howard Kendall at Everton for ¬£90,000 plus Seamus McDonagh. Walsh was one of Howard Kendall's famous 'magnificent seven' signings. During his spell here he was also regularly called up for the Republic of Ireland playing alongside the greats of Mark Lawrenson, David O'Leary, Liam Brady and Ronnie Whelan. Later on at Everton he was in and out of the team on a regular basis so took up loan spells at Norwich City and Burnley. In 1983 he was offered the opportunity to play in Florida for George Best's old team Fort Lauderdale Strikers, which he accepted. The club went bust within a season though so Walsh was quickly back home. Next stop was a brief spell at Manchester City, but within four months he signed for Blackpool where he went on to give a further 144 league appearances.</p>

<p>Walsh followed his Blackpool manager Sam Ellis to Bury F.C as a coach. Upon Ellis' departure to Maine Road to join Peter Reid as his assistant, Walsh took up the reigns as manager in September 1990. His time as manager lasted five years, during which he took the club to the play-offs three times, including the club's first appearance at Wembley. All this was during a time where the club had a massive financial burden and many players had to be sold to keep the club afloat. Just five games after losing in the Wembley play-off final, Walsh was cruely sacked as the Chairman became impatient despite the club having no finances to improve the team.</p>
<p>After a brief spell of taking Barrow to the top of their division, Walsh's old Everton team mate Steve McMahon asked him to join him at Swindon Town F.C as his assistant in 1997. Walsh also stayed on to assist Jimmy Quinn after McMahon's resignation late in 1998. After being made redundant by Swindon Town, he became Peter Reid's Chief Scout at Sunderland. In 2003 he had a brief spell as manager of Southport where he unfortunately couldn't save a sinking ship and the club suffered relegation out of the Conference. Walsh was then asked back to Swindon Town as Andy King's assistant in 2004 and decided to retire from the game a year later.</p>
