<p>Another "X is a song by Y" article, this time about a genuinely <i>un</i>notable song. If we're going to have an "article" about "Hitsville U.K." we might as well have an "article" on every song ever recorded. This one wasn't even a single. Even the new template tells is nothing worthwhile. "<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Magnificent_Seven_%28song%29_26e3.html" title="The Magnificent Seven (song)">The Magnificent Seven (song)</a>" has also been created in much the same way, but I won't VfD that (at least not now) because it <i>might</i> at least pass notability requirements, though it needs, to say the least, addition of content. And just to make my vote clear here: <b>delete</b>. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 05:43, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I hate The Clash. I hate people who say they like The Clash. The same people instinctively say they like Bob Marley and Beethoven, because they want people to think kindly of them; but <i>I alone</i> know their game, I can see through their disguise of lies, their pies. I hate triple albums. I hate words which end in -ville. I hate Seville, for example, filthy town. I also hate people who say they like a certain band's second-best album, because they think that if they say they like that band's best album, people will think that they are shallow, but at the same time they don't want to pick something <i>too</i> unusual because they don't want to lose the audience. 'Hitsville UK' was a single from 'Sandinista', the Clash's most reviled and longest album, and it sold no copies and meant nothing to anybody and didn't change anybody's opinion about anything, certainly not my opinion about The Clash, who I hate. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I hate the socio-medial crust which has built up around the Clash. With my vote here, I will destroy this crust. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 21:04, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>My mistake then. I guess it was a single. This further confirms my theory that bands often release many of their worst songs as singles. Why is that? Anyway, I still don't think this qualifies as a terribly noteworthy song. I'm a Clash fan, many of my friends are Clash fans, and none of us have ever paid this song any notice. Just 4 mintues and 21 seconds to get through between The Magnicifent Seven and Junco Partner. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think there is a connection in title, but not much in content.

<li><b>Delete</b> - stupidity on my part. It is not very notable and unless the page begins to include the meaning of the song and its relevance (like the Washington Bullets page) then it should be deleted. I was not thinking in the creation of this page about notability as I should have been. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> 03:03, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Putting my serious hat back on, and about 'the meaning of the song and its relevance', which struck me as I edited bits of the Sex Pistols' <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_the_Queen_%28Sex_Pistols_song%29_d865.html" title="God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)">God Save the Queen</a>, and the thought which comes to my mind is that even if we write 'many people consider that the song is about X' or 'the third line of the second verse is probably a reference to Y', well we can't do that, can we? Because it would be original research; the editorial voice is asserting something to be so. We can only quote external sources, sources of merit and substance, which makes it <i>dashed hard</i> to write articles about pop songs. Even if the song semi-explicitly makes reference to a specific event, such as <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_on_the_Water_a66d.html" title="Smoke on the Water">Smoke on the Water</a> for example, we still have to cite sources. In fact, <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_on_the_Water_a66d.html" title="Smoke on the Water">Smoke on the Water</a> itself is unacceptable in its current form, because it has no sources, has lots of bald statements, and uses value judgements all over the place ("despite the heaviness of the guitar part, constant movement and interplay within the supporting parts keeps the feel of the song from becoming leaden"). And it doesn't have any useful chart information, only something about a chart in America, a foreign market. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 22:58, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Overall I'm tempted to give a little leeway in articles on songs in terms of what qualifies as "original research". It's well known that many songs are widely rumored to have certain meanings (true or not), that are almost universally known. Citing rumors can be difficult, at times impossible. We can't really have "that guy I was talking to in the cafeteria in my high school" as a source. Even posts on messageboards, which can be linked to, are hardly the sort of sources you'd want to include in an encyclopedia. Certainly just about everyone knows the rumor behind the Phil Collins song "In the Air Tonight", about the guy drowning and the other guy not doing anything to help. It's completley bogus, but it's such a common rumor that any article on the song would have to mention it, and I'm not exactly sure what one would use as a source. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples much like this. That's not to say we should open up the floor to any crank to write about what he thinks any given song is about (I once tried to convince a friend that the Franz Ferdinand song "The Dark of the Matinee" was about Lee Harvey Oswald, but I certainly wouldn't write that here, nor do I believe it). Well, that's my two cents anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:34, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
