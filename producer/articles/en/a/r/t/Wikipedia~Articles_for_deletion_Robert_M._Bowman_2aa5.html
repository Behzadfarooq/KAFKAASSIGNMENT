<p>Judge notability for yourself. His primary claim to fame is his self-proclaimed directorship of the "Star Wars" program under "Republican and Democratic" administrations, when in fact he headed up a space defense program under Presidents Carter and Ford, prior to the proposal by President Reagan in 1983. We do not need a page for every program administrator, particularly as the program was non-notable prior to Reagan's 1983 proposal. On the basis of military service alone we also do not need a page for every person who attained the rank of O-5; there are Generals and Admirals who may not be considered notable enough for Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 03:44, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Respectfully disagree. Which criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> would this article pass? The subject has 2 major claims to notability:
<ul>
<li>Director of "Star Wars" under "Republican and Democratic" administrations, which turns out to be hyperbole</li>
<li>His claims regarding 9-11.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>How would this article be expanded? The autobiographical info on the link is heavy on non-notable details "In his wife's chancel drama ministry, Dr. Bowman has portrayed Peter, John the Baptist, and Caiaphus, among others." The preponderance of information on google about him is autobiographical, and outside of a few articles quoting him or his appearances, no one has seen fit to write about him. From what source would this article be expanded? The lack of verifiable third-party sources is for me a sign of non-notability. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 04:28, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

Kennan Peace Prize, the President's Medal of Veterans for Peace, the Republic Aviation Airpower Award, The Society of American Military Engineers' Gold Medal (twice), the Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters, and numerous other awards." He was an Associate Professor, Department Head, and Assistant Dean. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 04:48, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>That criteria is for academic achievements. There are none listed here. Remember that this is essentially a campaign ad so take the claims with a grain of salt.
<ul>
<li>I'm not familiar with the Eisenhower Medal, but there appears to be a prestigious one awarded by the Eisenhower Foundation, starting in 1988. I find no indication he received one from the Eisenhower Foundation. Other recipients of the Dwight Eisenhower Medal from the Eisenhower Foundation are <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Annenberg_418e.html" title="Walter Annenberg">Walter Annenberg</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_Powell_f293.html" title="Colin Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_HW_Bush_9b49.html" title="George HW Bush">George HW Bush</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Shultz_369a.html" title="George Shultz">George Shultz</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donald_Rumsfeld_67a3.html" title="Donald Rumsfeld">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_Ford_de6d.html" title="Gerald Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, and <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Greenspan_c1c0.html" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>. Does Robert Bowman's resume compare in any way to the other recipients?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Most likely he received another award (e.g. Johns Hopkins has a Milton S. Eisenhower medal) but did not cite the organization that gave it.
<ul>
<li>Google for the George F. Kennan Peace Prize only turns up Bowman's own sites and articles quoting that bio (bad sign).</li>
<li>Republic Aviation Airpower Medal, I imagine, would be from the firm Republic Aviation.</li>
<li>The President's Medal of Veterans for Peace is an award from a PAC, given by the President of Veterans for Peace, not the President of the US.</li>
<li>SAME is a professional organization like ACM or ICEE</li>
</ul>

<dd>He is still a recipient of the Air Medal with five oak leaf clusters, which is unusual for a professor (note. the awards do not have to be for academic achievement). Other than that he is running for congress. That is notable in and of itself. I know, I know the WP:BIO page specifies <b>holding</b> office, but it also says that the list is not exclusionary. I think that a decent article may come from this, but I agree with you that what is there now serves no encyclopedic purpose. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby1011_3500.html" title="User:Bobby1011">Bobby1011</a> 05:40, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Come on, you're going in circles here. Elsewhere you claim this is a notable supporter of the 9/11_Bin_Laden_conspiracy_theory, then you claim he is notable because he is a supporter of such a theory. You want to know what he is? He's a retired Air Force administrator trying to prop up a mediocre political campaign with exaggerated claims about working on "Star Wars" and grossly inflating his awards. Claiming by ommission to have won the Eisenhower Medal when in fact he did not win the prestigious Dwight Eisenhower Medal to me constitutes borderline fraud. It's akin to the doctor in the Schiavo case claiming on his resume to be "Nobel-nominated" to try to hitch on the prestige of the Nobel when in fact the phrase "Nobel-nominated" is complete bunk (nominations are never disclosed and can be submitted by anyone)--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 16:22, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The other issue I have is that when I went out and independently tried to source and verify the claims in this article, I found his autobiographical site. He makes a bunch of claims there, but as Mmx1 and Cdcon have pointed out, these claims cannot be independently verified. As for running for congress, he has declared himself a candidate and anyone can do that. He doesn't even have the requisite signatures to be a primary candidate at this time. Until that has happened, IMO he is not a serious candidate. It's the equivelent of me going onto my blog and declaring that I'm running for Congress at this point.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:30, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From his campaign website <a href="http://bowman2006.com/about.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://bowman2006.com/about.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, where the claims are toned down, Col. Bowman was Director of Advanced Space Programs Development for the Air Force Space Division." This may or may not have included the forerunner to SDI, but the term "Star Wars" was not even coined until the mid-80's. There was no significant work on SDI until Reagan was informed of the theory in 1983, five years after Col. Bowman retired. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 19:17, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Striver has a point. When people say that somebody is not notable, sometimes I think they mean "not notable to me." I have seen articles on this list who are notable in fundamentalist Christian circles, which apparently some people think disqualifies them for notability. I have seen musicians listed because they are "not notable," even though they may be the principal player in a well-known orchestra and have several recordings. Because they are not pop singers, they are "not notable" to some people. Let's be careful. On the other hand, I would like to see the information verified. If it isn't, then the article should be highly revised or scrapped. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogophile_6192.html" title="User:Logophile">Logophile</a> 11:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

Mentioning the obvious motivation behind the AfD has little or nothing to do with whether or not the nominator is acting in good faith, as everyone is entitled to their own pov on what falls within the bounds of good faith.

<p>Ok, ill start again. Basicly, he is among the people holding my view of 9/11 that has the highest social status. Sure, anyone can run for congress, but not many that hold my view of 9/11 do. Also, he is a member of <a href="../../../s/9/2F/S9_11T_8864.html" title="S9/11T">S9/11T</a>. So, by deleting this guy, you are in fact shrinking some of "cabal" that hold my view of 9/11, and right now, they arent all over the place. So, based on this, i argue he is notable.</p>
<p><br />
I mean, how many other people with like him do you find that hold that view?</p>
<p>He might not be notable in the big world, but he is notable among people that hold my view of 9/11. Comments? --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 21:41, 24 February 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b>: As you admit, you have very specific and uncommon views of 9/11. Also you admit having a personal stake in this: deleting his article shrinks the group agreeing with your views.

<p>You see, i view my self as a representative of the people sharing my view, at least here in WP. I belive the policy you are mentioning is about not using Wikipedia to gain personaly from it, for example, selling a product one has created, or further some theory i have inveted.</p>
<p>But that is not the case. I do not try to sell anyting, or make comercial for anyting, or further any theory i have invented, neither partialy nor completly.</p>
<p>My personal interest is comparable to the personal interest a <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon.html" title="Mormon">Mormon</a> has in trying to keep a prominent mormon from bein excluded from wikipedia. The only argument he can offer is that the person in question is a prominen mormon.</p>
<p>And that is my arguement. <b>Robert M. Bowman</b> is a prominent "Mormon", if you get my point.</p>
<p>Please dont delete my "Mormon". --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:05, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I mean, i found this guy in the list: <a href="../../../i/t/u/Itula_Mili_50dd.html" title="Itula Mili">Itula Mili</a>. He is nothing to mormons, compared to what <b>Robert M. Bowman</b> is to those of my view. Still, nobody is suggesting to delete his article. And this is not a anomaly, the rule is that people corresponding to minorities are compared to others in their own group, not to everyone else.</p>
<p>And <b>Robert M. Bowman</b> is very notable AMONG the people holding my view. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 01:11, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views.

<dd><i>Self-promotion.

<dd>Judging from the above postings, it appears to be several people's opinion you are soapboxing. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoema_807b.html" title="User:Joema">Joema</a> 18:55, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Which conflicts with the Wiki contention that <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carol_Rosin_8b4c.html" title="Carol Rosin">Carol Rosin</a> originated the term "Star Wars". I'll pull his 1985 book from the library and see what it says. Would like an SDI expert to weigh in on who was more prominent at the time, Bowman or Rosin and where the term originated. Maybe I'm cynical, but since when did news stories plug the subject's website? Mr. Bowman has pushed a lot of propaganda about his involvement in the SDI, but he was apparently never worth a mention on the SDI nor does his ISS appear to be any more than a one-man press release machine.--<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 17:32, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>When was Rosin supposed to have originated it? Whoever did it, I'm sure it happened early on, it's a fairly obvious nickname. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Schizombie</a> 20:04, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>1983, I believe, according to the SDI article; it is unfortunately not very good. Have posted on <a href="../../../s/t/r/Talk%7EStrategic_Defense_Initiative_cf29.html" title="Talk:Strategic Defense Initiative">Talk:Strategic Defense Initiative</a> asking for feedback. Have lexis-nexised him and found 1 NYT and 1 CSR editorial; the other articles quote him as a consultant and aren't very useful for notability. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 20:11, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
