<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_theft.html" title="Edit section: Individual theft">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Individual theft</span></h2>
<p>Many thieves are motivated by the fact that reasonably valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms, at most. Transportation is also trivial, assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier. While most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places hosting multimillion dollar works have disproportionately poor security measures<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since February 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i>citation needed</i>]</span></a></sup>. That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash-and-grab, but with huge payoff. However, because the ownership of high profile art is easily tracked, potential buyers are very hard to find. Typically, a thief will steal a work, only to find out that there are no buyers. For the same reason, the stolen piece cannot be put on display publicly, which essentially defeats the purpose of having it. Unfortunately, while no thief can hope to get the actual value of the stolen work, even as little as 5% of the real value can be worthwhile for the thief. Most art is resold at <a href="../../../a/u/c/Auction_house.html" title="Auction house">auction houses</a>; major reputable houses such as <a href="../../../s/o/t/Sotheby%27s.html" title="Sotheby's">Sotheby's</a> or <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christie%27s.html" title="Christie's">Christie's</a> demand proof of art ownership before listing. Many lost art pieces that become found and sold at auction have later been exposed as <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forgery.html" title="Forgery">forgery</a> or <a href="../../../i/m/i/Imitation.html" title="Imitation">imitation</a>.</p>
<p>A likely scenario in famous art theft is "theft for hire" or similar situations in which buyers have already been found. Some buyers may enjoy possessing famous art secretly. Fossil theft is an easier form of purchase as identification techniques are not as well established as art theft.</p>

<p>Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures, there are numerous cases where artworks (often displayed in the acquiring country for decades) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy. One prominent example is the case of the <a href="../../../e/l/g/Elgin_Marbles_d588.html" title="Elgin Marbles">Elgin Marbles</a>, which were removed from Greece to the <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Museum_7dce.html" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> in 1816 by <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Bruce%2C_7th_Earl_of_Elgin_ec0e.html" title="Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin">Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin</a>. Many different <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greece.html" title="Greece">Greek</a> governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft.</p>
<p>Similar controversies have arisen over <a href="../../../e/t/r/Etruscan_civilization.html" title="Etruscan civilization">Etruscan</a>, <a href="../../../a/z/t/Aztec.html" title="Aztec">Aztec</a> and <a href="../../../i/t/a/Italian_culture.html" title="Italian culture">Italian</a> artworks, with advocates of the originating countries generally alleging that the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cultural_imperialism.html" title="Cultural imperialism">cultural imperialism</a>. <a href="../../../y/a/l/Yale_University_757c.html" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>'s <a href="../../../p/e/a/Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History_a561.html" title="Peabody Museum of Natural History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a> is engaged (as of November 2006) in talks with the government of <a href="../../../p/e/r/Peru.html" title="Peru">Peru</a> about possible repatriation of artifacts taken during the excavation of <a href="../../../m/a/c/Machu_Picchu_a695.html" title="Machu Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> by Yale's <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiram_Bingham_e1d7.html" title="Hiram Bingham">Hiram Bingham</a>.</p>
<p>In 2006, New York's <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metropolitan_Museum_2093.html" title="Metropolitan Museum">Metropolitan Museum</a> reached an agreement with Italy to return many disputed pieces.The <a href="../../../g/e/t/Getty_Museum_6060.html" title="Getty Museum">Getty Museum</a> in Los Angeles is also involved in a series of cases of this nature. The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin. The museum agreed on 20 November 2006 to return 26 contested pieces to Italy. One of the Getty's signature pieces, a statue of the goddess <a href="../../../a/p/h/Aphrodite.html" title="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>, is the subject of particular scrutiny (as described in this story from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-aphrodite3jan03,0,3301024.story?coll=la-home-headlines" class="external text" title="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-aphrodite3jan03,0,3301024.story?coll=la-home-headlines" rel="nofollow">Los Angeles Times</a>.)</p>
<p>From 1933 through the end of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_War_II_d045.html" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the <a href="../../../n/a/z/Nazi.html" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> regime maintained a policy of looting art for sale or for removal to museums in the Third Reich. <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_Goering_986d.html" title="Hermann Goering">Hermann Goering</a>, head of the <a href="../../../l/u/f/Luftwaffe.html" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>, personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces, generally stolen from <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews.html" title="Jews">Jews</a> and other victims of <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genocide.html" title="Genocide">genocide</a>. Members of the families of the original owners of these artworks have, in many cases, persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property. In 2006, title to the gilt painting <i>Portrait of <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adele_Bloch-Bauer_9419.html" title="Adele Bloch-Bauer">Adele Bloch-Bauer</a> I</i>, by <a href="../../../a/u/s/Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> artist <a href="../../../g/u/s/Gustav_Klimt_283b.html" title="Gustav Klimt">Gustav Klimt</a>, was restored to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maria_Altmann_61c9.html" title="Maria Altmann">Maria Altmann</a>, an heir of the prewar owner. Provenance in this case was easy to establish; Bloch Bauer, the subject of the painting, was Altmann's aunt. Altmann almost immediately sold the painting at auction and it was resold to <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Lauder_2839.html" title="Ronald Lauder">Ronald Lauder</a> for $135 million. At the time of the latter sale this was the highest known price ever paid for a painting.</p>

<p>A highlight of <a href="../../../e/a/r/Early_Netherlandish_painting_bb18.html" title="Early Netherlandish painting">Early Netherlandish painting</a> was stolen several centuries prior to the later theft of two panels from the <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i> in 1934: <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hans_Memling_8447.html" title="Hans Memling">Hans Memling</a>'s <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Last_Judgment_%28Memling%29_d772.html" title="The Last Judgment (Memling)">Last Judgment</a></i> altarpiece was commissioned in <a href="../../../1/4/6/1467.html" title="1467">1467</a>, and was to become the central art piece in a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Medici.html" title="Medici">de'Medici</a> chapel in <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a>. The ship transporting the painting in <a href="../../../1/4/7/1473.html" title="1473">1473</a> was looted by a "pious" <a href="../../../p/i/r/Pirate.html" title="Pirate">pirate</a>, offering the painting to the <a href="../../../g/d/a/Gdansk.html" title="Gdansk">Gdansk</a> cathedral. Although authenticity is undoubted, the story is plainly documented, and the now priceless painting is one of Memling's greatest masterpieces, some catalogues of the painter's work scarcely mention it. Negotiations with the city of Gdansk to restore the theft keep failing. Nonetheless, the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triptych.html" title="Triptych">triptych</a> was temporarily shown at a Memling exhibition in <a href="../../../b/r/u/Bruges.html" title="Bruges">Bruges</a>, celebrating the 500th anniversary of the painter's death. The case is famous because it allotted the <i>receivers</i> of the stolen goods not only the profit of owning the art work, but also the profit of copyright-like earnings (e.g. when lending it for expositions or photography), without needing to make any expense for hiding its whereabouts, over an extended period.</p>

<p>In 1878, burglar <a href="../../../a/d/a/Adam_Worth_fe42.html" title="Adam Worth">Adam Worth</a> stole Gainsborough's <i>The Duchess of Devonshire</i> from London art dealers Agnew &amp; Agnew which he used to negotiate the release of an accomplice from prison.

<p>Perhaps the most famous case of art theft occurred on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_21.html" title="August 21">August 21</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/1/1911.html" title="1911">1911</a>, when the <i><a href="../../../m/o/n/Mona_Lisa_763f.html" title="Mona Lisa">Mona Lisa</a></i> was stolen out of the <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louvre.html" title="Louvre">Louvre</a>.

<p>At the time, the painting was believed to be lost forever. It turned out that Louvre employee <a href="../../../v/i/n/Vincenzo_Peruggia_8d16.html" title="Vincenzo Peruggia">Vincenzo Peruggia</a> stole it by simply walking out the door with it hidden under his coat. The theft was master-minded by Eduardo de Valfierno, a con-man who had commissioned the French <a href="../../../a/r/t/Art_forgery.html" title="Art forgery">art forger</a> <a href="../../../y/v/e/Yves_Chaudron_2946.html" title="Yves Chaudron">Yves Chaudron</a> to make copies of the painting so he could sell them as the missing original. Because he didn't need the original for his con, he never contacted Peruggia again after the crime. After having kept the painting in his apartment for two years, Peruggia grew impatient and was finally caught when he attempted to sell it to a <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florence.html" title="Florence">Florence</a> art dealer; it was exhibited all over Italy and returned to the Louvre in <a href="../../../1/9/1/1913.html" title="1913">1913</a>.</p>
