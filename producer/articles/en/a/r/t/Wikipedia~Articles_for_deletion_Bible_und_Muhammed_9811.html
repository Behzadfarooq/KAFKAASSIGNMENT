<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. The way I count it out, the votes are as follows: Delete: 11 Keep: 5 Delete and Merge: 2. Counting the 2 Deletes and Merges with the Deletes, that come to approximately 70percent in favor of deletion. I find the arguments for Deletion very convincing. The article is not well cited, and checking of what citations do exist by others has raised questions of the credibility of the sources cited. I do not find the arguments for Keep nearly as convincing. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvilphoenix_c3c7.html" title="User:Evilphoenix">Ëvilphoenix</a> <sup><small><b><a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvilphoenix_c095.html" title="User talk:Evilphoenix">Burn!</a></b></small></sup> 17:57, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>A very, very confusing article formerly known as <i>Islam in the Bible</i>, which at least made some sense as a title. Hard to do this justice, but basically it seems to be about a genuine encyclopaedic topic, <b>Islam and Christianity</b>, that has been spread over a walled garden of articles including Bible und Muhammed, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_view_of_the_Bible_674f.html" title="Islamic view of the Bible">Islamic view of the Bible</a>, <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Christianity_studies_dec5.html" title="Islamic Christianity studies">Islamic Christianity studies</a> and others, most of which bear the hallmark of <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">User:Striver</a>.

<dd>Er, sorry, but I took a look at the websites that are linked to as "sources". And let me tell you, I don't think it's a good sign if <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/isaiah_mecca.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-christianity.com/isaiah_mecca.htm" rel="nofollow">one source</a> chosen at random begins: "The following is an email I received from brother Silent Wisdom" and then rambles on in terrible English about something that, while not quite clear, consists largely of quotes from the Bible and the Qur'an trying to show how they connect. Or <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.org/predict.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.answering-christianity.org/predict.htm" rel="nofollow">another</a> whose title is, in what I assume is <i>150 point size type</i>, "The lie of the crucifixion!". Indeed, all "sources" that are not Bible verse links go to <a href="http://www.answering-christianity.com/ac.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.answering-christianity.com/ac.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, which at first glance is one individual's ranting website about how the Bible is supposed to prove that Islam is the true religion.</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong: I am completely in favor of having an article on how Islam views Christianity, or on why Muslims think the Bible proves that Islam is the true religion. But this rambling, unintelligible mess of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> violations is not it.

<li><b>Comment</b> The very title "Islam in the Bible" to which some editors have proposed to rename the article back is horribly POV, as it reflects the Muslim POV by stating as fact that there is indeed some Islam in the Bible. This view is ridiculous for any Jewish, Christian, or secular scholar, who all believe that Islam emerged only in the 7th century, much later than the Bible assumed its current shape.

<li>Exactly.

<dd>Yes, but the problem with the title is that it presents an existing POV without attribtuion. Had it been called "Islamic view of the Bible", the would be no problem about it.

<dd>What i mean is that it does not state that Islam is in the bible. Its like talking about "cookies in the jar", it is a valid frase even if the jar is empty.

<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I think "cookies in the jar" would in fact mean cookies are in the jar (any grammarians here?). Anyway, I'm not sure it's a good analogy, because a jar (particularly a cookie jar) would be expected to have cookies in it at times, whereas the claim that islam is in the bible is a controversial one. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchizombie_a829.html" title="User:Schizombie">Esquizombi</a> 00:02, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
