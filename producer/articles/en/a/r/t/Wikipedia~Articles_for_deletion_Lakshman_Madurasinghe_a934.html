<dd><b>Comment</b>- This seems an erroneous conclusion about the reference being to Freedom Bible College because he is the President of Maharishi University of Management ,USA- Sri Lanka branch- Incorporated in Dec 1999 as mentioned in the detailed version that was there before. MUM is a fully accredited University in Iowa, USA.I think our focus should be on verifiability and not make pronouncements on other isuues. User: DrVijayantha 10:30, 23 October 2006 (GMT)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>- There was never a mention of a Maharishi University sri lanka branch web site so there was no reference to look for it.The comments of some others stated the legal reference to its registration and details filed in Govt registry regarding its operations since Dec 1999 when it was incorporated in Sri Lanka.

<p>Thank you for all your observations. If the consensus is to delete because it doesn't meet wiki norms then please do so. I thought of adding a note that we have contacted the Director General of SUNFO who has confirmed the following;</p>
<p>Prof.Madurasinghe is the Chairman of the Board of Trustees as well as the Adviser on Human rights and also the Dean of their Centre for full human potential developemnt(CFHPD).Their old free site is still valid and they are in the process of transferring data to the official site .</p>
<p>The Director General himself has been in the Board of Maharishi Univerity Sri Lanka Chapter and is well aware of its operations. It had been having dialogues with the government to allocate land for University buildings which had not materialized hence they had conducted modular units on consciousness conducted by prof.Madurasinghe. A large delegation of scientists had visited Sri Lanka in 1999 and held public sessions. This may be a reason why it is not in the main web page of MUM identified as a fully operational university.</p>
<p>There is with them a document signed by Dr.Bevan Morris addressed to H.E.The President of Sri Lanka dated 3 Jan 2000, in which he says " Dr.Lakshman Madurasinghe is now heading the Mahrishi University of management &amp; Maharishi Global Administration- Sri Lanka , which has been legally incorporated".</p>
<p>The Board of Directors had nine foreigners and six Sri Lankans. Dr Bevan Morris's name is also among them. The offical documents are all available with them for inspection by anyone interested. mahindaintellect 12:12, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>
<dl>
<dd>In that case, this information should be available with MUM authorities. Right? If you agree, we shall verify this information by sending an e-mail to <a href="http://www.mum.edu/phone/" class="external text" title="http://www.mum.edu/phone/" rel="nofollow">relevant authorities</a>. <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> | <a href="../../../u/t/c/User_talk%7EUtcursch_83a1.html" title="User talk:Utcursch">talk</a> 07:45, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The Board of Directors had nine foreigners and six Sri Lankans. Dr Bevan Morris's name is also among them. The offical documents are all available with them for inspection by anyone interested.</p>
<p><b>We Have the names of foreigners as follows:</b> Dr.Bevan Morris; Dr.Nand Kishore; Prof.Tony Nader; Dr.Neil Patterson; Dr.Volker Schanbacher; Dr.Benjamin Feldman; Dr.Hartmann; Dr. W Bosch; Dr.T Eickhoff;</p>
<p><b>Original letter dated 12 Nov 1999 giving the names of the board has been signed by Dr.Bevan Morris;</b></p>
<p>We also understood from Director General SUNFO that the Institution has been in operation since 31 Dec 1999 and still exists as a legally incoporated body with annual returns furnished to Sri Lankan government until last year ,2005. He said he would make available copies of both letters for review as and when needed. The memorandum &amp; articles legally incorporating are also available.</p>
<p><b>He further confirmed that Prof.Madurasinghe visited Vlodrop , Holland in 2000 when he met Maharishi, Dr.Morris and Dr.Tony Nader. His interview with Dr.Tony Nader was telecast worldwide via satellite through their channel. SUNFO has a copy of the interview on CD in which Dr.Nader confirms that Prof.nadurasinghe is the Head of Mah Uni in Sri Lanka and displays the land area photo identified where the university Buildings will one day be put up based on funding.</b></p>
<p>We are sure that Dr.Morris has a copy of same. mahindaintellect 14:36, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>

<li><b>Not sure</b> OK, it's a partially rewritten CV but, on the face of it, describing a notable person. I do have a problem with the educational background though. In 1972 he takes GCE A Levels. Four years later, he's a lawyer, but no mention of any studying/qualifications in between. Could be an oversight.........but he lists son many other segrees and diplomas that he can't have had time to do anything except gather qualifications, or buy them??? The "Open International University for Complementary Medicines" does not look like a genuine institution.

<p><b>Sheikh Mohammed Shakir</b></p>
<p>Sheikh Mohammed Shakir b. Ahmad b. ‘Abd al-Qadir was born in 1282 Hijri/1866 CE in Jirja, a city in Upper Egypt. He studied and graduated from Al Azhar University. He died in 1358 Hijri/1939 CE in Cairo. <b>Where is evidence to suport this&#160;?</b></p>
<p>His son, Sheikh Ahmad Mohammed Shakir, wrote his biography in a treatise entitled Mohammed Shakir ‘Alam min A‘lam al-‘Asr. Positions • Sudan's Supreme Judge for four years (1990-1993) • Dean of Alexandria's Scholars • Al-Azhar Secretary General ("Wakil") and a member of its board of directors • Member of Al-Azhar Corps of High Scholars • Member of Al Azhar legislative Society ("al-Jam‘iyya al-Tashri‘iyya") References 1. ^ Works by M. H. Shakir at Project Gutenberg- <b>Gutenburg has no entry in his name. Islam online biography of translator- is just a page -Who created it&#160;?</b></p>
<p><b>Thomas Nedunthally</b></p>
<p>Thomas Harris Nedunthally was born in Trivandrum, Kerala, India on December 12th, 1982. He is in his own little world although well read and socialized. He believes that he would be the divine force in making a change. He is yet to accomplish anything that could affect peoples lives. But if you would like to know more about him do read on. <b>( IS THIS VERFIABLE EVIDENCE?)</b></p>
<p>He moved to Abu Dhabi Indian School (ADIS), where he began his maturing stage. In the 9th, 10th and 11th standard he got the 2nd place in his school for the Gulf Mathematics Olympiad (GMO). That seemed to be the first stage of his growing and keen interest in mathematics due to the relative ease in which he achieved it. <b>WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE&#160;?</b></p>
<p>After an eventful and enjoyable 11th and 12th standard he wrote the SAT II and got into Electrical Engineering at IIT Madras in 2000. He did pretty well in his first year but he was a slacker. He had an attention problem and couldn't attend classes properly. In his 2nd year, after his 3rd semester he didn't write 3 exams due to the boring nature of the courses. He saw the lack of future of the lazy students at IIT, and decided that he had to move on. He knew that the only courses he could concentrate are theoretical ones such as Math and Computer Science. So that seemed to be the best option for him.</p>
<p>Compared to a students entry like Nedunthally do you think the article under discussion has no contribution or unverifiable evidence&#160;?</p>
<p>I am just surprised why we don't look at what is available. <b>I recommend to keep it.</b></p>

<p>In an earlier version there was a statement that he had followed therapeutic jurisprudence at Cambridge which may well account for how he is a member of the society which is for cambridge alumni.In one of his web sites he mentions a clear e-mail which is a cantab.net used only by alumni.

<p>You shouldn't again jump to conclusions without finding out what Law college system is .This is very well explained in their site <a href="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm</a> I suggest you study that carefully to understand what happens to those who have completed GCE A/Level exams and how to become a lawyer in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>As regards your personal opinion on CIPD-Lond is another example of a hasty conclusion and a totally misleading comment that anyone can join as a fully qualified professional member.I know many who are membes of CIPD and none of them were ever able to get there without years of study and assessment.I suggest to enlighten others and also add humour that you apply and tell the world what happens.Getting it will be better than simply assuming such falasies.At most you will join as a trainee or affiliate member only.

<li>For your information, I <i>had</i> looked carefully at all of the sites, and others, and I become more suspicious the more I saw. Regarding CIDP London, from their website: Chartered Member (Chartered MCIPD) - "Must demonstrate three years' relevant experience at management level as well as CPD over the last year." Of course, this man is a Chartered Fellow (Chartered FCIPD) - "Available for upgrade from Chartered MCIPD membership" i.e., it is possible to easily progress through the ranks on the basis if experience and accreditation of previous experience, which could include questionable awards from abroad. Regardless, achieving fellowship of the CIDP would not mean notabilty. Regarding IBC Cambridge: No comment from you because it is a paid-to-be-included publication that has no value. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 19:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Thank you for visiting CIPD site as mentioned. Here are some details about them and if you are interested you may visit the link to get their annual report which provides more details.</p>
<p>Like any other professional body, members progress over a period of time but as far as we are aware CIPD has assessments and direct supervision of record and work places to verifiy service details and they are not follish enough to go by mere assumptions to upgrade a member.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/" class="external free" title="http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cipd.co.uk/about/areport/</a></p>
<p>It has been another successful year for the CIPD. Membership has continued to grow. A 2.3% increase in the last year took total CIPD membership to over 127,500, of whom 47,000 are chartered members. We’ve met all our financial objectives, as well as adding to the range and quality of services we offer to our members – this three-pronged approach underpins our continuing success.</p>
<p>The educational route is the most popular way to become a member of the CIPD. It will help you develop the skills and knowledge you need to launch your professional career. Our Professional Standards govern entry to CIPD membership and form the basis of all our qualifications. They act as a benchmark for the profession. They define levels of knowledge and competence you need to demonstrate when operating in a support role, practitioner or at an advanced level.</p>
<p>To be eligible you must hold one of the following: • a CIPD-approved or accredited qualification • an MBA • a National or Scottish Vocational qualification (NVQ/SVQ) at level 3 or above in a relevant occupational area • a SQA HNC in Human Resource Management or Learning and Development • a Certificate in Training and Development (CTD) • a Diploma in Training Management User:mahindaintellect 13:08, 24 October 2006 (IT)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no need to quote huge chunks of the CIPD website - we can all read it for ourselves. But seeing as you have, let me take a couple of points from your quotes. (1) "To be eligible you must hold one of the following.... NVQ/SVQ level 3". Not impressive. For people outside UK who do not understand British qualifications, let me explain that NVQ 3 is roughly equivalent to A Levels. It is a vocational qualification that would typically be held by an 18 year old hairdresser, plumber, baker, care worker. Worth having, but NOT impressive. (2) "Last year took total CIPD membership to over 127,500". How many? Not an exclusive club giving notability to its members then. <a href="../../../e/m/e/User%7EEmeraude_2af2.html" title="User:Emeraude">Emeraude</a> 10:26, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Note</b> Perhaps initially when our team worked on this biography the noteworthy contributions may not have been adequately captured by our analysts.

<p>We have also managed to take a 2 mt video clip out of the 40 mt interview which he had with Prof.Tony Nader , International President of Maharishi University when he visited the campus in Holland in March 2000.
