<li>In all seriousness, you really don't have a sense of humor. This was only put up for fun and to see if it would last. It was obvious from the beginning that it wasn't going anywhere. I don't even know why it's still up. In other news, Saberwyn clearly indicated that it shows potential to be a 'real' article, which goes against all the other's proclamations that it is a cut and dry removal piece. Clearly the standards need to be worked on. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 209.81.166.99 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_209.81.166.99_0e5e.html" title="Special:Contributions/209.81.166.99">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li><i>May</i>. The key word is <i>may</i>. I originally did not believe personally that there was potential in this article. Mind you, my judgement is hampered in this case because I live on a different continent. I was only stating the possibility that someone who knew the place better that I did (and wasn't an original contributor to the article) could possibly have looked at the piece and given the rest of us informed advice. Jacqui has given us that informed decision, and I see no evidence here to counter her claims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If there was any desire by the original contributors to make this into a decent article (which there apparently wasn't according to the comment above) that effort has been completely blown out of the water by the behaviour of the article's contributors and their allies during this AfD. Mind you, some of the accusations by the regualar users are almost as bad.</dd>
<dd>I've made my decision. I'm no longer abstaining, now voting for <b>delete</b> as a serious failure of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, and also as a breach of the spirit of the <a href="../../../d/o/n/Wikipedia%7EDon%27t_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point_8268.html" title="Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point">Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point</a> policy, as attested to above by anon user 209.81.166.99. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 10:12, 3 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, Well, Well. Looks like we gots ourselves a bunch of retarted moderators here. Seen um before I have. Yup, they go around getting a sick high off deleting enjoyable articles. Yeah, them some nasty buggers. They pretend to be high n' mighty while striking down the weak and unedumicated. Bastards. Nope, you just can't get rid of them. They hang around like flies on dead bodies. We can only pray that someday, maybe, they will understand harmless humor, and find something better to do with their time. But for now, we all must put up with their stank.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Very cute...</li>
<li>Does anyone know anything about calculus? I'm having a hard time with one of my homework problems and I was hoping someone could help me out. The problem reads: We are planning to put a space shuttle in gepsynchronous orbit at a distance above the earth`s equator of 22, 300 miles. It`s objective is a point in space 240,000 miles from the earth`s center. We know that the best time to leave earth`s orbit is a little more than 3/4 of an orbit past the point,C, which is the closest point in the shuttle`s orbit to the object, M, However, we need a bit more accuracy that that. A) How long from the time when it is closest to the objective, M, should it fire its rockets so as to be on a direct course toward the objective? B) How fast will the shuttle be traveling toward the objective just before firing the rockets to leave earth orbit. The picture given has earth inside of this larger circle. The point C is directly below E on the circle and the point S, is directle to the left and down, like at 280 degrees on the circle. I know that: you have to use the radius of the earth, divide by 24 to get how fast the space shuttle travels in one hour, and that the circle is the orbit of the shuttle. I would really appreciate your help. Thanks for taking time out to help.</li>
