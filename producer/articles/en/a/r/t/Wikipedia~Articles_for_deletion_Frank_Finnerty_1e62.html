<li><b>Speedy Keep</b> - I had stepped away from my computer for lunch only to see that during my brief break, the article had reached a no consensus for an AfD, and that it was being resubmitted for deletion, all within a span of 46 minutes. While I will do my best to <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, it is very hard to accept that this is not just another attempt to undo an AfD that just failed. As with the <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Schilling_5e6a.html" title="Sue Schilling">Sue Schilling</a> AfD, can I politely suggest that as a genuine show of good faith this AfD be withdrawn and that a period of time — say several weeks or a few months — be allowed after the rejected AfD to allow the article sufficient time to be improved to allow the article to better meet the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> concerns. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 17:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> No consensus was reached, and no effort has really been made to improve the article. The article as it is has been that way since March. That's plenty of time. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 20:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> - In addition to addressing the other 4,500 articles on my watchlist, and dealing with this and other AfD's, I have not had the opportunity to improve these articles. I had hoped to do so after the AfD was complete, but I was not around in the 38 minute period (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Finnerty&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">check article history</a>) before your new AfD was created. I had attempted to contact the author of the article by leaving a message on his talk page, which went unanswered, there was no email address available and the user's last edit was in March 2006. I will as respectfully as possible ask yet one more time for a simple demonstration of good faith by requesting that this AfD be withdrawn to allow sufficient time to address the concerns you have raised and bring it up to your standards. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 21:42, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Five months is plenty of time. The article sat untouched until the AfD. And then it was still untouched. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 23:56, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joe_Kelly_%28Freeholder%29_2dcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)</a>, the result of which was keep. <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 21:39, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That is not the article under discussion. I might also add no effort whatsoever was made to expand that article, in spite of the claims of notability 'on Google'. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 23:53, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Indeed; if the original nomination of this article was bundled with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joe_Kelly_%28Freeholder%29_2dcc.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joe Kelly (Freeholder)</a> instead of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Atlantic_County_Board_of_Chosen_Freeholders_5bca.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Atlantic County Board of Chosen Freeholders</a>, it is more than likely that the outcome of the previous discussion for this article would have been "keep" instead of "no consensus". In any event, good editors who are part of a WikiProject intend to expand this article and deserve a reasonable period of time to do so. This renom also does not seem consistent with the spirit of <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Nominating_an_article_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Nominating an article for deletion</a>, which states: "In general, although there is no strict policy or consensus for a specific time between nominations, articles that have survived a nomination for deletion should not be immediately renominated." <a href="../../../a/c/c/User%7EAccurizer_605d.html" title="User:Accurizer">Accurizer</a> 13:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The 'keep' for Joe Kelly is based on the results of a google search, none of which was brought up in either the AfD or the article in question. I therefore have reason to doubt the verdict of the AfD as entirely valid. The other two were not ruled 'keep', so I take the 'no consensus' as no decision. The articles in question still do not pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The keep arguments are based on the rapid renomination, and not on the merits of the articles. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 16:20, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>delete</b> Those who qualify as notable per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> are "Political figures holding international, national or statewide/provincewide office or members of a national, state or provincial legislature". The subject is a county official, and as I understand it is not even remotely close to that and would appear not to satisfy the criterion above, notwithstanding articles covering those holding similar positions who have survived AfD. There appear to be few other critera for his inclusion as notable. What is more, it appears that the sbject was not elected but merely appointed to fill a vacancy. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:41, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The additions to the page are still local positions that do not meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. A <i>county</i> officeholder does not meet the standards for political office, and there has still not been any assertions of notability beyond the local offices or 'significant press coverage' that would rise to the standards set forth in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The keep arguments are for the timing of the renomination. The article still fails to meet Wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 19:23, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
