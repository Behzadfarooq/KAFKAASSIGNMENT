<li><b>Keep</b> - The topic of CIA prison aircraft has been active in public debate for the past few years so it is a notable topic. The article includes two independent references from major media outlets (i.e. not fringe media prone to hyperbole) to a CIA aircraft with this tail number and the articles allege use as a CIA prison aircraft. Perhaps the term "rumored" should be changed to "alleged" to provide a more professional tone. <a href="../../../e/p/o/User%7EEpolk_d8a6.html" title="User:Epolk">Epolk</a> 19:22, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please do not clutter the aircraft's article with subject matter related to the operation of a single aircraft. If we are to retain this article (which I still oppose), perhaps a name such as "CIA rendition scandal" or what ever would be better. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 20:46, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> If it is about that aircraft, that's where it belongs. This is not clutter. That's like saying, "Don't include anything but acting/technical information in an article about <a href="../../../a/n/g/Angelina_Jolie_ff96.html" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, make it all its own article." If it's about the aircraft, it should be mentioned in the article, if it's mentioned at all. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 00:45, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Uhh, why? Shouldn't the focus be less about the model of the aircraft and more about the subject of contention, which in this case is the alleged act of transporting prisoners? Why should your average reader care about the <i>type</i> or <i>registration</i> of the aircraft involved? They're more interested in what is occurring and why. Let's put it this way. If it were a <a href="../../../b/o/e/Boeing_737.html" title="Boeing 737">Boeing 737-700</a>, an <i>extremely</i> common aircraft, do you think this content would then belong in the article for that type? It would quickly get booted out for distracting from the core subject. Why should a small article about the Learjet 35 be any different? The answer to a weak article is not to lump it into another only passingly-related article. I suggest this article be given a proper name related to the act of rendition, and beefed up with proper sources. —<a href="../../../n/3/2/User%7EN328KF_2ea6.html" title="User:N328KF">Joseph/N328KF</a> <a href="../../../n/3/2/User_talk%7EN328KF_4c65.html" title="User talk:N328KF">(Talk)</a> 00:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> But that appears to be what the article is about the rumor of the type of airplane. If it's a <i>rumor</i> about Angelina Jolie, does it get its own article? No, it's in <i>her</i> article, although if it is a big rumor or hoax that gains serious notoriety it may get its own article in addition to being mentioned in hers. This is <i>what</i> the rumor is about, the type of aircraft. It may not be as common as a 737, but Learjet 35s <i>are</i> rather common aircraft. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 01:49, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> I think you misunderstand...the rumor isn't about the <i>type</i> of aircraft, it's about one specific aircraft, one of hundreds of Lear 35s. There are not hundreds of Angelinas, just one. And, most importantly, rumor goes against the verifiability that's the core of Wikipedia. That having been said, some aircraft model articles have a "trivia" section, and maybe a one or two sentence summary of this article in the Lear 35 article (or instead of "trivia", maybe under the heading of "specific aircraft of note"?), with this article then becoming a redirect is a compromise that can be lived with. Thoughts Joseph? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 02:31, 10 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> Yes, it is certainly trivial, and I do understand, or had thought that it was about one particular plane that happens to be a Learjet 35. The rumor is tied directly to Angelina, one single actress, which is why I switched from battleships as analogies, because I couldn't remember the correct title for a particular one, and this rumor is tied directly to <i>a</i> Learjet 35. Yes, a trivia section or specific aircraft or note or some such is appropriate with a redirect--but, in this case, if and only if it is correctly sourced. Without sources, delete. Rumors do get articles on Wikipedia, if they are of note, just like nonexistent animals (<a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryptozoology.html" title="Cryptozoology">Cryptozoology</a>) and scientific hoaxes (<a href="../../../p/i/l/Piltdown_man.html" title="Piltdown man">Piltdown man</a>). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> (<a href="../../../k/p/_/User_talk%7EKP_Botany_1d80.html" title="User talk:KP Botany">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_KP_Botany_6fca.html" title="Special:Contributions/KP Botany">contribs</a>) 02:53, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p><b>Comment</b> - In response to all the above, including several suggestions for an article on and listing rendition aircraft, I have created just such an article, <a href="../../../r/e/n/Rendition_aircraft.html" title="Rendition aircraft">Rendition aircraft</a>, which includes the info from the individual aircraft articles Joseph identified (these have then been merged and redirected). In doing so, I tried to cull out all the rumors. Where I could, I documented with references to verifiable media articles. Where I couldn't, but where the information seemed like it might be important, I added {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}} tags. I will leave these in place for a while, allowing other editors the opportunity to help cite the statements. Eventually, if no citations are generated, I will then go back though and deleted the uncited information in accordance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I have also included the appropriate info from the N221SG article, and if this AfD does not result in deletion, I strongly suggest that it be redirected to the Rendition aircraft article. In doing this, I hope I have satisified everyone's concerns about not having unverified information and rumor in the encyclopedia, while still providing users with valuable information.

<dd>No darts, you seem to have actually read what people wrote here, considered it, and related it to the articles of concern and Wikipedia policies and the value of an article--I'm not even going to check the article you created as I might have a heart attack from the shock. On that extraordinarily positive note (Akradecki's consideration of the material and concerns about the article, not my sarcastic note), I bow out of the contentious and purposeless atmosphere of WP:AfD. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 22:38, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
