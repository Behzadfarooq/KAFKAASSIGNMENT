<li><b>Delete</b> - Sorry for causing this discussion. This article was only created on a bet that i could create an article about myself and have it last atleast a week. It has made it a week so this articale can be deleted. I thought it was cool to have a page at frist, but i am tired of fixing random changes my friends make. The movies have all been released under our small film studio and were made for school projects or just our personal enjoyment. I am in NHS good job Isotope23. Chris, being a high school senior i really doubt that you would have heard of me. Again sorry for causing you guys the trouble of having to go through this to delete my article -- Phantom_Effect 08:37, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no, it's exactly the opposite; just because the band has an article doesn't mean every album needs one too.

<li><b>Keep</b> - May not be a band I have heard of but there are already a huge numnber of other articles similar to this one. <a href="../../../a/w/a/Away_from_the_Sun_21d2.html" title="Away from the Sun">Away_from_the_Sun</a>, from the more reknowned band, <a href="../../../3/_/d/3_Doors_Down_fabd.html" title="3 Doors Down">3 Doors Down</a>, has about same amount of content but no AFD tag on it. I am sure there are alot of others that have similar content that are by more popular bands. The band does have an article, and that is one reason why I think we should keep it. If there was no band article, or no track listing, or even the info at the bottom for the band members and there positions leads me to a keep. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 13:39, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b> - Is the article List of unique high school mascots sorted by state also not notable? Unique high school mascots have quirky, offbeat names that that tell a lot about the local culture. There are at least two websites that attempt to catalog he unique names that are often funny if you have a sense of humor. Spoofhound was highlighted on an ESPN segment. Little stub articles like this will tell the stories of these quirky names. It's pretty clear from the comments thus far that the article is going to disappear. Too bad.

This debate is not about the validity of that list, and linking a topic to another article does not make the original topic notable. Also, given how the discussion has gone, the information on Spoofhound will not be going, it will be merged into the school's article. In fact, it already has, so this article can either be deleted, or turned into a redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryville_High_School_e429.html" title="Maryville High School">Maryville High School</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 03:59, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

This is non-encyclopedic and Wikipedia is not a source for random bits of information.

<li><b>Delete</b> to me, there are 2 things to look at here. First, is the concept of the "Spoof Hound" Carnival Toy and the stated origin of the team name notable and verifiable. I think the answer to that is clearly no. All sources for this definition and explanation of a spoof hound are from <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascoths3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascoths3.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a> (which apparently is based on submissions from the general public and is not in any way vetted or verified), the school website, and Wikipedia mirrors. I just don't see enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to consider the supposed carnival toy and name origin to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements. That said, the second thing to consider is if a high school mascot is notable enough to have a standalone article. I think the answer to that is no as well and it appears to be pretty common practice that mascots are only mentioned in the school article. I'd say merge, but the information has already been integrated into the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryville_High_School_e429.html" title="Maryville High School">Maryville High School</a> article.

I'm an alumnus, and when we participated in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1989, every interview conducted with the band focused on the mascot above everything else. I've met strangers who have heard of Maryville High School only because of the Spoofhound. I'm always surprised at how often it is mentioned in national media. Personally, to me, its just a mascot, but it certainly gets a lot of attention.

<dd>Answering that deleting this article benefits the encyclopedia because it is unencyclopedic is tautological. The real issue is why the article is unencyclopedic. You are asserting that it is because it is not "notable" or "important". This seems to me a very arbitrary and subjective criteria for removing someone's work from Wikipedia. There are many, many articles on Wikipedia that most people would find neither notable or important (trivia for a particular Babylon 5 epsiode, for example), but they are significant enough to enough people that they warrant inclusion under the prevailing standards of Wikipedia. If this work is to be removed, it should be for a specific (and compelling) reason. I don't feel that such a reason has been outlined. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelixstrange_9f57.html" title="User:Felixstrange">Felixstrange</a> 02:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> In regards to Felixstrange's response to IrishGuy: Saying 'deleting this article benefits the encyclopedia because it is unencyclopedic' is actually not a tautology, one being a noun and the other being an adjective which descripes specific attributes that make something acceptable for inclusion within that particular noun. Aside from that, Wikipedia has pretty good and clear guidelines as to what qualifies something as being notable enough for inclusion and it seems many people here agree that this article does not meet those standards. Sometimes these standards aren't always the best, but they work quite well and without them AfD couldn't function. If you disagree with notability standards I believe it is appropriate to go to the pages outlining them and making a case for change on their talk pages. Finally, in regards to your statement that other things, such as Babylon 5 trivia, are kept: these are articles that have so far slipped through the cracks. AfD is run by average editors and they nominate things when found, things can last awhile before someone who knows about AfD and cares finds them. There is a lot of inappropriate articles out there that do need to be removed and that's what we're here for. An article on Babylon 5 trivia certainly would warrant an AfD nomination. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 03:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that is a textbook example of tautology. By definition something which is "unencyclopedic" is bad for an encyclopedia. My only point here is that the notability/non-notability of the subject of this article is not as clear as its being made out to be. I've certainly read about it in newspapers and heard about it on TV (some one has mentioned an ESPN feature). The main thrust of the notability guidelines Ptkfgs posted is preventing Wikipedia from becoming a directory, which is certainly not a danger in this case (the MHS article is another story). I mentioned the Babylon 5 example to point out that while in writing guidlines may seem very specific, in practice they can be very subjective. To be too literal and severe with the application of standards would result in deletion of a substantial portion of Wikipedia (as well as a lot of angry Babylon 5 fans). I just don't think the case is clear for this article. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelixstrange_9f57.html" title="User:Felixstrange">Felixstrange</a> 04:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> The reason that film articles get <i>deleted</i> for crystal balling is that we can't guarantee a film <i>will</i> be made. We don't keep articles of project announcements around just in case one day it finally takes off. It can't be for certain that the film will come around again, so a recreation may never happen anyway. --<a href="../../../e/r/i/User%7EErikster_b4a3.html" title="User:Erikster">Erik</a> (<small><b><sup><a href="../../../e/r/i/User_talk%7EErikster_fbba.html" title="User talk:Erikster">talk</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Erikster_523f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Erikster">contrib</a></sub></b></small>) @ 02:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> Even if it were never made, I'd say given that there is information from reputable sources out there (such as <i>Variety</i>), I would say that Wikipedia shold have information on it anyway. Either it would be "This movie happened" or "This movie was planned, but it didn't happen" and both should be on Wikipedia, given the circumstances (Of course a Jerry Bruckheimer film is going to get an article, even if it wasn't a fairly notable franchise). At the most, you might convince me of a merge, but this is AfD, not a proposal to merge. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:47, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Does it? WP:NOT doesn't say where information about expected future events can be placed.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Thanks for the education in how this all works. I am fascinated and appreciate how this process unfolds. I did remove the db-tag in error. Michael Greiner states "The article does not assert notability above the rest for the numerous art galleries in the LA area." There are other galleries from Los Angeles in Wikipedia. What are the specific criteria that must be met to warrant inclusion? "Notability above the rest" seems to be an imprecise guage for inclusion. Alexdc 06:46, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Yes this is a real place, mentioned in the local paper. So are many small businesses. While I am sure it is a very nice gallery, it is still non-notable.

<li><b>Delete</b>: There is no indication that this gallery stands out among items of its kind. A "notable" business is one that stands out in some fashion -- either through fame or infamy or uniqueness or importance to the industry. In most of these, the various NYC galleries will stand out, and yet we rightly do not cover them all. Any business that is operating in the middle of the pack and doing a good job is certainly admirable, but not probably encyclopedic. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:45, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> wiki is not a directory nor a listings magazine, which is what the links in the articles are, in actual fact.

<li>Hi, thanks for the suggestions. I agree that I need to add more articles of some of the musicians, but the problem is that many of those articles will only link to other bands they've played in. A page on Jazz in Belgium isn't something I could produce because I only know about avantgarde jazz, not mainstream. The Belgian music scene is very complicated, and bands don't stick to specific genres at all. I'll try to add more information, based on my own (out-of-date) website, but it's difficult to be verifiable in this kind of things. Maybe I should write a general article first? <a href="../../../s/v/a/User%7ESvanimpe_ecfe.html" title="User:Svanimpe">Svanimpe</a> 20:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> the problem with basing it on your own website is that that may not be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and your website may not count as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>, I cannot endorse a move to a general article that does not exist yet. I think the answer to the question above is that if an avante-garde jazz group from a small country is influential in the world of jazz, that will have an impact in terms of reliable sources writing about it. I don't see why an avante-garde jazz group from a small country is different from, say, an avante-garde rock group from a small US state, for instance, but nobody would suggest that the US state is suffering some sort of discrimination against its music. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 06:14, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. As the founder of the Tuck Profit (and relatively new to Wikipedia), not sure whether it's appropriate for me to comment in this forum (obviously I'm biased). I'm wondering how to prove that The Tuck Times is a real student newspaper at Dartmouth, as they do not have an online presence. Would scanned copies of the print publication be acceptable? By the way, the site receives between 30 and 400 unique visitors/day and is achieving notoriety among the <a href="../../../t/u/c/Tuck_School_of_Business_60c8.html" title="Tuck School of Business">Tuck School of Business</a> alumni community. But I guess the relevant questions are 1) 'does this make it notable?' (yes, it's one of the top ranked business schools in the world) and 2) 'how can I prove this?' (which is where I need help!).

<p>Looks to me like a self-promotional piece more than an informative article. Even in articles on more widely known bands they do not typically post sizable graphics of all their album covers. I don't know if this violates wikipedia's policy but it seems more like an advert.</p>

<dd>Now what's this all about then? If you guys want to delete this article. Whatever I don't really care. I mainly added it because someone else had mentioned my project in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_steampunk_works.html" title="List of steampunk works">list of steampunk works</a> article. So I wanted to create a basic encyclopedic entry for this site. I will admit that perhaps the inclusion of cover art came off as <a href="../../../a/d/v/Advertising.html" title="Advertising">advertising</a> so I removed them. I don't know what requires my project to be considered notable? Especially since it's mostly free.

<p>Though it does read like an advert and needs some work to meet up to Wikipedia's standards, I believe it should be kept because <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not paper</a>.

<dd>I have edited the article into a more encyclopedic style. I agree that it did read a bit like an advertisement (which I really wasn't intending).

<dd>In order to be considered a notable band/music project, you have to be signed? What happened to artistic freedom? I guess being the first musician to tackle an otherwise untapped musical genre (see: <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steampunk.html" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a>) isn't notable enough? So as long as I just keep giving my music away for free, and avoid working with record labels, my work will never be considered notable? If that is the case I'll delete the article myself.

<dd>it's not about being fascist. If there are enough reliable, independent sources (like music magazines or prominent websites) writing about an unsigned artist, then they're taking note of them. If they're signed to a label, obviously at least the label has taken note of them. But, if we don't have these guidelines, we can end up with articles based on what every kid in a garage has had published in his friends' blog about himself. It's about having reliable, sourced information. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_e65d.html" title="User:Night Gyr">Night Gyr</a> (<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENight_Gyr_84bc.html" title="User talk:Night Gyr">talk</a>/<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENight_Gyr_Over_74df.html" title="User:Night Gyr/Over">Oy</a>) 04:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes I understand that, and I understand why you don't want every garage band listed on the site. However, reliable sources have written about this project. I mean as far as music in this genre, it doesn't get much more official than if <a href="../../../m/i/c/Mick_Mercer_7d76.html" title="Mick Mercer">Mick Mercer</a> has written about it multiple times. He is the author of pretty much every book on the Gothic/Darkwave/Ethereal subculture. This project has also been featured in print media, that is available nationally. Nothing like SPIN, or any major magazines. You kind of have to be signed or tour year round to be noticed on a large scale. But whatever, I know that I have created something genuinely unique. It just sucks that the worlds free encyclopedia doesn't include things unless they are recognized nationally. Even if there are other music projects (i.e. <a href="../../../a/b/n/Abney_Park_%28band%29_569e.html" title="Abney Park (band)">Abney Park (band)</a>) that have been inspired by this project who have valid wikipedia articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article lists notable alumni. It is linked from a list of high schools in Missouri. It is integrated into the history of Northwest Missouri State University. I didn't create the article (or the Spoofhound article). I just tried to bring it up the wiki ladder (and unfortunately got the Spoofhound noticed). Comments on afd on Spoofhound is urging it be redirected to the school. I copied the spoofhound write up and pasted it in since the Spoofhound is probably not going to survive the afd debate.

Thus, they aren't going to be the linchpin in this argument. I think it would be ridiculous to have articles for all high schools.

<dd>Also, I want to point out that the two 'notable' individuals who are claimed to be alumni of the school aren't really all that notable and, furthermore, they aren't sourced. The article does not cite anything that shows that they actually attended the school.

<dd>Comment: Way, I don't understand your obsession with this -- especially coming from somebody who is using Wikipedia to post personal photographs of yourself. Are you notable? Should we be careful to avoid the even worse floodgates of millions of individual users using Wikipedia bandwidth for personal scrapbooks? As mentioned the article meets the current draft of criteria: a school with notable alumni, something unique about its mascot, and a school history going back more than 50 years. You say that most schools have notable alumni. Well, if they do, I look forward to their articles being written. The argument is being made in the Spoofhound afd to redirect to this article. Now you're turning around and trying to eliminate this article. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 19:17, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Discussions should be about the articles and the deletion policy, not "all schools" or "people like you" or "deletionists" or anything else. Does an article about a school doing what schools do fit with an encyclopedia as well as a Yellow Pages, almanack, and census report? What makes it more fitting than, say, the red light at 86th and Lexington in NYC, which is doing its job, is seen by thousands, and has had many famous people use it?

<dd><b>Comment</b> I attempted to upload a single picture to my userpage, which is, as far as I know, acceptable and if its not I'm more than willing to remove (I've certainly seen it done on a number of userpages). And anyways, the upload didn't work and I'd like to delete the attempt though I'm not entirely sure how to go about doing that. That aside, my editing on the site, and I feel I've been by and large a good editor, is not relevant to this particular debate and it seems to be an attempt by yourself to draw attention away from actually pertinent information. There is a major disagreement here about what should determine notability. The school notability guidelines remain a work in progress, they are not yet official and therefore do not necessarily hold. A unique mascot does not create any notability, one could make an argument that every mascot is unique. The criteria of uniqueness are inherently subjective and one look at the article that's a 'list of unique high school mascots' shows that a ridiculous number of schools make this claim. Anyways, that list article is up for deletion and it appears that it will be deleted. I simply do not believe that high schools, unless they are very well known, deserve articles. A lot of other editors agree, a lot disagree. Its a legitimate position and its up to the administrator to decide. Please refrain from personally attacking myself and focus on the argument at hand. You make good points, I hope I do as well; the issue is not clear cut. I just don't like the precedent it sets and think that having articles for every school (and what about every hospital? shopping mall? grade school?) will open the floodgates and is a waste of space.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Thanks Moby, my tast in music is great, isn't it&#160;;) I also just wanted to say, as a final means of defending myself (which probably isn't necessary, but please indulge me for a moment) I've only nominated two articles for deletion ever, this being one of them, and the other was not a school. If this article is kept I'll refrain from nominating high schools in the future.

<li><b>Keep</b> As a longstanding public high school, we have near-complete consensus that such schools are notable. The prominent alumni and unique nickname are all explicit claims of notability that justify retention. The article can only benefit from further expansion and improvement. If we all work together to improve existing articles and create new ones, there's no reason that the nominator's dream of an article for "for every high school in the country" can't be fulfilled. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 23:57, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: Let's not be silly with the word "vandalism". I removed the two alum names, because they are not sourced. People are (apparently) "voting" based on the presence of these names. That was wrong. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> is a core principal of Wikipedia. When signficant claims are made, with no sources, or indication sources are likely, and the claims aren't "obvious", or universally known (e.g. "sky is blue") then removal is appropriate, as they are unverifiable. Leaving unsourced alums during the AFD is harmful. We do not want people to add unsourced claims to articles, to save them from AFD. Its difficult (or impossible) to prove most claims false, so the onus of proof is on those who advance a claim. Anybody wishing to keep an article could just make-up something that sounds good. Finally: if we have no waying of knowing if something is true why would we wish to publish it? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 02:53, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Again, please note that there are thousands of high schools in the US alone and when you take in all secondary schools across the globe (can't even imagine how many there are in India or China, for example) do we really need to have articles for all of them? This is not a directory, we don't have articles for every hospital, every business, every police station, etc. nor do we need them for all high schools. High schools are are relatively the same and Wikipedia is not the proper source to look up there differences.

<li><b>Comment - Note to closing administrator:</b> I though I was done arguing for retention but there seem to be a few embers of deletion still glowing dimly. There has been criticism of those who have supported retention of this article who have made reference to <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>, an effort to create clear objective standards for which school articles should be retained, and which should be deleted. While the guideline did not achieve consensus, it is light years ahead of any other guideline, and stands in stark contrast to the utter lack of any meaningful Wikipedia guideline used by school deletion voters, who must resort to rather insightful "arguments" for deletion, such as "Secondary school, ergo not notable" or "Delete all schools below the university level" or "a random public high school", with the helpful suggestion that redirecting from the schools "to really offensive sex acts" would be an acceptable alternative. It's time that we stopped the staggering waste of time playing AfD Roulette, in which nearly every high school article, with few exceptions, with any meaningful content are retained, demonstrating a clear consensus and explicit precedent for retaining such articles. I recognize that there are those who prefer some arbitrarily high standard for retaining such articles, but unfortunately we have no consensus on these self-imposed made-up standards, let alone anything that approaches the comprehensive, good faith effort to do so at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>. If <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a> is unsatisfactory, let's see an alternative standard that will achieve consensus in the community. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 16:51, 30 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: alternative standard? Just use a similar standard for schools as we use for people or even better corporations and companies. Are they run-of-the-mill, or are they exceptional? Are there multiple non-trivial references in secondary, major publications (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>)? Taking this school as an example: the only reason I can see for keeping it are the School championships. Having a unique mascotte is quite trivial. Now, I can't find a source for e.g. the wrestling titles, so I can't judge if this is true, and how important this is. And this is a problem with many school articles I have supported the deletion of: either they have no non-trivial info at all, or it is all unreferenced and stays so even after asked for verification. As <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> clearly says, it is up to those wanting to keep something (either a claim or a whole article) to provide references, not for those wanting to delete it. So in general, my school standards are a combination of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and the general idea of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<li>Ah, the poor man's choice for justifying deletion: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. Basically, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> is almost always used to mean "anything I think doesn't belong on Wikipedia, but I'm unwilling to come up with an actual argument."

If you insist on pursuing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> as an excuse, can you please share which clause this article (and all other school articles) fail. I see ample information and sources in this article, in full compliance with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Have you read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>? is it a "product, company, corporation or other economic entity "?

<li>No, you are wrong. Wikipedia is not a directory is often a very good description of what school articles are: nothing but an entry from school directory website. I dod not say (or certainly did not mean) that "every school" fails <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, that would be ridiculous. But articles like <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flynn_Park_School_6458.html" title="Flynn Park School">Flynn Park School</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/2E/St._Catherine_Laboure_dcf4.html" title="St. Catherine Laboure">St. Catherine Laboure</a>, <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fairfax_High_School_%28Fairfax%2C_Missouri%29_f3b1.html" title="Fairfax High School (Fairfax, Missouri)">Fairfax High School (Fairfax, Missouri)</a> or <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayless_Senior_High_School_3745.html" title="Bayless Senior High School">Bayless Senior High School</a> (to name some random examples from Missouri alone) are nothing but directory articles. And I explicitly said "the general idea of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, as it does not literally apply (no accepted guideline does). Then again, why would a school not be a corporation?<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corporation" class="external autonumber" title="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corporation" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> As for your other comments: where are the ample sources per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? "Marc's distinctive high school mascotte collection" (two of the four sources) is not really a "reliable source" for our purposes (and the mascotte is quite trivial anyway): then we have one bary notable alumnus mentioned in his obituary in the local newspaper, and the school website (again not a secondary source per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>).

If there are no other verifiable reasons for inclusion (and not trivial ones, like having students, a uniform, a mascotte, a nickname, a motto, and regular inspections), if the school is not remarkable among schools, then why should we have an article for it? The only "category" of articles that merit semi-automatic inclusion for me are towns (villages, cities, ...): all other subjects need to be verifiably remarkable, exceptional, noteworthy, notable, ... withing their "category": for people to have an article, they need to be remarkable people: for companies, they need to be somehow noteworthy: for schools, the same reasoning should apply.

<p>Contested Prod, and a contested prod based on good reasoning, rather than just the removal of a prod tag by someone unhappy with the issue. Simply put, there is no evidence that Norfolk Island (a non-sovereign dependency of Australia) has a national football team. The best that can be found are links such as <a href="http://www.sportingpulse.com/select_node.cgi?cID=335&amp;p=2#n908" class="external text" title="http://www.sportingpulse.com/select_node.cgi?cID=335&amp;p=2#n908" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which list a "Norfolk Island Soccer Association" and then have no results when that link is clicked and <a href="http://www.national-football-teams.com/php/clubland_new.php?landid=228" class="external text" title="http://www.national-football-teams.com/php/clubland_new.php?landid=228" rel="nofollow">this</a>, which seems to assume that a team exists, however it isn't listed in any of the other pages of the site, most importantly <a href="http://www.national-football-teams.com/php/oceania.php" class="external text" title="http://www.national-football-teams.com/php/oceania.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where one would expect members and non-members to appear.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think what Vic Sinclair is trying to say is that the news articles are reprints of press releases, a common-enough occurance in newspapers by the way, not because they are biased but because they republish chunks of well-written press releases when they need to find filler articles in a hurry. When they do this they will not put a reporter's name next to the story as you've seen. I agree that the newspapers are not trivial but the fact that they are not national papers or major business papers coupled with the fact that the articles have no real depth suggest they are not enough to justify GENCO's inclusion. <b>Strong Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaganaki-_6a70.html" title="User:Saganaki-">Saganaki-</a> 01:10, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>Unless an article in a respected newspaper is acknowledged as a press release and there is an accusation that it is, that is an accusation not in good faith. Non-national newspapers are allowed under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>.

<dd><b>Comment</b> In my view its not an accusation of bad faith, but that's just my view and I'm sure the user can speak for himself. As for the debate regarding deletion, my proposal stems from the fact that we have a badly written article, lack of sourcing, POV, etc and perhaps we can agree - marginal media coverage at best. (Note that I am making no assumptions about the quality of any of these new sources, but they all, associated press included, republish press release chunks at some time.) That's why I think its simply a company I would not expect to read about in an enclopedia.<a href="../../../s/a/g/User%7ESaganaki-_6a70.html" title="User:Saganaki-">Saganaki-</a> 01:37, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I google searched "Vik Vaz" and most of the information in the article seems accurate. That "desi Ken Jennings" sentence seems like a dubious claim and i have edited it out. Gillain, the creator of the article, should source it since it seems relatively easy to do. I disagree with deleting this article given that many other contestants on Jeopardy! (and other game shows) seem to be listed as well. Its analogous to other minor show biz personalities in Wikipedia in my view. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.112.106.218 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.112.106.218_fc6f.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.112.106.218">contribs</a>) 02:40, 15 October 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>I think the user is making the point that excluding one minor showbiz personality while letting other Jeopardy! contestants who are hardly household names (Bernie Cullen? Eddie Timanus?

<li><b>reply</b> To expand on Uncle G's point a bit, if you think that another article is worthy of deletion, then nominate it for AfD. There are thousands of deletable articles here on WikiPedia. We can't get to them all right now. Therefore, the existance of another deletable article does NOT make this article keepable. If other VERY similar articles have SURVIVED previous AfDs, you might be able to claim precedence; however, merely citing other articles you think might be unworthy of keeping as a justification for keeping THIS one is entirely faulty logic. This is a discussion of THIS PARTICULAR article. What about THIS ARTICLE makes it either keepable or deletable. Provide evidence within the confines of THIS ARTICLE to back up your point one way or the other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Is there a clearly defined line that excludes BOTH Article X and Article Y? I assume this is the point of the fallacious claim and while perfectly reasonable to remove this article as non-notable if there is, it is NOT reasonable to argue that this is a rules-based (rather than arbitrary) decision unless there is a way to show that the notability criteria exclude the entire class of significant Jeopardy! winners (the exception for this Jennings guy is somewhat questionable)...As it stands, until some clarity on this central point is present, I disagree with deleting it or any of the other hundreds of tv show entries.</li>
<li>I agree that the facts of this article stand on their own and the entry fits within the general entries of minor personalities. Also, as strange as the condition may sound, Vik is a spokesman for TMS, a very serious matter.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Just winning games on the show itself does not make one notable; one must transcend the boundaries of the show, have people talk about you at the water cooler, etc., in order to be notable enough for Wikipedia (like Ken Jennings, Frank Spangenberg, Chuck Forrest, Brad Rutter, Eddie Timanus, etc.) -- and Vik Vaz definitely did not have that happen. To 70.112.136.9 -- if Nico Martinez has an article, I'll be sending it to AfD immediately. He has less notability than Vaz. <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 16:29, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> until/unless Andy Saunders' rule is approved by the rest of the commenters. Vaz in fact got much media attention in our area of the country (East and Central Texas) but I agree he did not transcend the show to any significant extent (and definitely not even in the same league as Jennings' level of exposure). However, the Saunders rule has the problem that Jennings would be the only contestant worthy of Wiki since I can't find any real evidence that the others you mention were notable (ie Spangenberg, Forrest, Eddie Timanus, etc.) outside of the Jeopardy/quiz show context. In fact, there are tons of minor celebrities (or politicians even) who don't really spark water cooler conversations or in any way transcend their very limited entertainment niche. To help get to a consensus, I will go with the mass opinion on this if everyone thinks that subjective water cooler standard is fair and agree to the multiple deletions.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.112.136.9 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.112.136.9_06af.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.112.136.9">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Hm according to your standard Timanus should stay then but I don't see how the records of Weikle, Walsh, etc. necessarily helps your rule since no doubt Jeopardy or any other show has innumerable records that are held by a many different contestants, most of whom are probably very obscure.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.112.136.9 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.112.136.9_06af.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.112.136.9">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>By citing the previous standard, that does not mean I am in 100% agreeance with the standard; I am just citing the standard that other contributors to past AfDs have used. In fact, I would probably lean towards deleting both the Walsh and Weikle articles if they re-appeared on AfD (though I think that some sort of catch-all article encompassing the gray area of tenuously notable champions would be ideal, in this case. With any new articles that come up, they'd simply be merged and redirected into the catch-all article.). <a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">Andy Saund</a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_Esperanza_290e.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../o/n/t/User%7EOntarioQuizzer_65f8.html" title="User:OntarioQuizzer">rs</a> 05:52, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Another suggestion a friend made about this was that why doesn't everyone just agree to a numerical standard? Say 100 grand or any figure that would put a gameshow contestant in the top 100 or so game show winners amongst Americans. It might be easier than arguing about the nontrivial coverage in multiple, reliable sources standard or the google standard, etc. While it would put in quite a few people who don't really achieve much notability, at least it would be an objective standard.
<ul>
<li><b>reply</b> We have a standard. It is: multiple, nontrivial references in reliable sources. All other arbitrary standards or guidelines are inadequate as being too unreliable as standards. All other guidelines, if applied, either include obviously unnotable subjects, or eliminate from consideration otherwise highly notable subjects. We don't have any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">evidence</a> that this guy meets the basic notability baseline of NONTRIVIAL coverage in MULTIPLE, and RELIABLE sources. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 22:22, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm puzzled, so if any book that was ever published makes mention of any term, that it is automatically notable for an article? Something doesn't seem right about that.

<dd>Only the ones in "non-trivial published works." You agreed in your nom that the article is verifiable, so it would be contradictory to suggest that the book is otherwise. All I'm saying that a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Wikipedia%7ESearch_engine_test_390d.html" title="Wikipedia:Search engine test">Search engine test</a> is not intended as the sole proof against notability. The book, the Savage interview and the accounts in the Wicks, Toland, and Mailhot articles, (which admittedly could be added to the article,) provide for the basic test of "multiple, non-trivial published works." Remember, just because an article's scope is limited doesn't mean it can't be included in Wikipedia.

The subject is a self-styled religious leader who claims to be a perfectly enlightened <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddha.html" title="Buddha">Buddha</a>. There is no official training which can be sourced anywhere, so his claims of mastering texts cannot be seconded by any other religious authorities. The only sources are the official website of his organisation, which cannot be considered to be at all reliable or neutral (the other source available is simply a reprint of the stated info on his website for a religion report) - the only other info is a pile of attack blogs about his alleged rape of a disciple or other pages by random groups critical of his claims. So the only sources are himself, which could only lead to a hagiography of a religious leader who is already making grandiose claims. This person is very notable, but there is no way that an article could be NPOV, unless it also uses attack blogs. <b><a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a></b> (<a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">bananabucket</a>) 05:22, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So it is ok to talk slander GM Lu, Blnguyen? All we have is pictures of Master Lu being honored at the Tibetan Monestaries in Tibet, my personal witness of Ganden Tri Rinpoche (among others) honoring Master Lu. What kind of proof are you looking for? Can you give me MahaRishi Mahesh Yogi's "verafiable" authenticity? What kind of proof do you need? You say you cannot stand that Master Lu's page is talking highly of the True Buddha School but you think its ok to emphasize a womans rediculous claim that she was rapped by him? Ok did you know that HH Kalu Rinpoche (whom I have a picture of him honoring Master Lu) was accused of being raped by an american journalist? In his Biography it lightly mentions this but does not focus on that in his webpage. What kind of "proof" do you have of Buddha even existing other than millions of followers? He is one of the most popular sects in Taiwan and an enormous benefactor of charities and was accused ONE TIME of sexual misconduct and you think this should be the focus of his bio? All of his claims of having lineage can be backed up by photographs (that have been tested for authenticity). Why dont you look up the pro TBS blogs are ask a local TBS chapter instead of having a preconcieved, close minded bias. Have some respect for people you might not agree with. Its called human decency. Because Blnguyen doesnt believe! then we should all think like him and slander who he doesnt believe in.

<p>Seemingly non-notable British BDSM club, article hasn't been really touched in over half a year. Proposed for deletion contested, with the argument:</p>
<dl>
<dd>Removed "Delete" tag: "Violate Glasgow" on google returns this club, and website link on article connects to club too: according to clubs web page it still meeets monthly. If nothing changes re club, entry won't need updating either, though I agree it should be expanded.</dd>
</dl>
<p>So what? If compared to <a href="../../../s/m/f/SMFR_7375.html" title="SMFR">SMFR</a> (which was deleted), it is found on Google among the first hits, the external link connected to the club's official site, and the club organises events every month or every two months. Still the article was deleted. The only thing that makes Violate more notable than SMFR is its involvement in Scottish politics.

<li><b>Delete</b>: It's an obvious deletion candidate. If you search "violate" on Google, you get the verb. Ignore that, though. Is this club famous? Is it being written about outside of its niche community? Is it the first of its kind? Is it the leader in some area (nipple clamps or wet leather or something)? Are they the meanest, nicest, biggest, smallest, or any other -est? Are they in the news? Are they anything other than a club for a small segment of the population of a city? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:32, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have been trying to edit out the bias here and there and I'm not so sure I agree with you saying unverifiable, but there is regular vandalism or at least bad editing and I agree that Uber is in decline. I've been a member of Ubersite for a long time and I'd like to see the article remain, but unless someone prooves its notability in some other way I have to agree that based on its alexa ranking it shouldn't be here.

<li>There has to be something funky about the results Google is giving. I don't know what results you got on that first search, but I got 164K hits. After adding another filter to exclude the site's own results, I still got 36K hits. Neither of those counts strikes me as an obvious flunk of the Google test, so I presume you must have gotten some much lower number. As for the second search, it's telling me that Ubersite has ZERO inbound links, but that can't be right. For one thing, it should be showing an inbound link from the Wikipedia article! It has a link, and calling up the cached page confirms that the version Google has includes the link. Also, you'd have to believe that NONE of the Wikipedia rippers took the Ubersite entry (or that all who did took some version that didn't have the link). Thus, those results have to be considered unreliable due to some quirk of Google. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 17:04, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b>. Taking the heavy meat weight into account, it's still 2-to-1 in favor of deletion with the 1 side having pretty poor arguments.

<dd>As I posted before, the specific reason that I feel this article needs to be deleted is because it does not appear to be notable outside of the webcomic community. The recent edits concerning its notability do nothing to dissuade me from this opinion as, aside from a mention of being published "several times" in a college newspaper, they only assert its prominence from other webcomic sites such as Comixpedia and DigitalStrips.com. Has it ever been published in a national publication? Highlighted on CNN? The New York Times? USA Today? Fish and Stream magazine? To illustrate the importance of this, there is not a wikipedia article for every professional international chess player. There are articles on <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garry_Kasparov_1370.html" title="Garry Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a>, but not Alexander Riazantsev who may certainly be considered notable within the chess playing community, is certainly <i>not</i> internationally or even regionally notable.

<li><b>Keep</b> - If it were a book of chracters, would there be deletion? If it were Leonard Maltin, would it be deleted? JLCM provides not only entertainment but reviews of current movies with periodic departures into past themed topics aka the 10 on the 10th. The stub doesn't rave about how good this site is - only that such a site exists. Already, there is precedent set by other Wiki entries on traditional comics like Peanuts, and webcomics (Sluggy Freelance for instance). Why single out THIS one for deletion?

<dd>Do you have a cite that it is well-known amongst people in the motion picture industry?

This webcomic is part of Keenspot, an independent and prestigious online publisher of webcomics. A Holy Grail for many webcomic creators, to be Spotted is to be great and notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> Exactly. ComicGenisis is not Keenspot nor was it ever Keenspot. It -is- owned by Keenspot as a freehosting space for webcomics. Whereas Keenspot is not a freehosting space, and is by invite only to make money. As for my single purpose possibility, it's true I've only recently created the account.

<p>This guy is not just an author/journalist, he is also the founder of an international non-profit organization, which the one naysayer above failed to note at all. I checked out that Web site and it’s pretty prominent. A quick google of his name shows maybe a thousand or more sites where he’s mentioned. I’d keep it.</p>

<p>What separates a themed concept album from a well-assembled record by someone with an idiosyncratic range of topical songwriting interest? This page is entirely uncited, mostly uncitable, original research, and vastly fancruft. People want their favorite artists to be intelligent, and so as fans they often slap the now near-meaningless label of "concept album" on a given work so that it seems more Important and Impressive. That is fancruft, and very usually unsupported. Not to mention non-NPOV.</p>

<li>On first look, I disagree with many of the entries but I don't disagree with the idea of the article as such, although it may be an unneccesary overlap with other articles. The word "themed" bothered me a bit but I'm aware of albums where the overriding concept was the recording method rather than the lyrical content so it's not so outlandish. An album is a concept album if the artist says it is so if there is a source available for the listed albums making it clear that the artist has made such a statement then that must stand as verification and remove any POV concerns. I don't think this requires deletion but it requires a lot of citation work. Is it worth it? I'm <b>neutral</b> on that.... <a href="../../../a/c/40/User%7EAc%40osr_1e03.html" title="User:Ac@osr">Ac@osr</a> 20:30, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>This page should be kept because many people like to research themed concept albums. However I would say it needs some editing and citations.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as a combination of an inherently POV list, a list with very shaky criteria for inclusion which would make it hard to maintain (most surf-rock albums would be included as being about "surfing", "cars", "girls" or "surf culture", for example, and we'll leave aside the fact that most hip-hop albums are about "partying", "drugs", "girls", "money" or something along those lines) and also for having a <i>soupçon</i> of OR to the whole thing - I doubt that many of these acts actually believed they were making a concept album at the time, and the term almost certainly dates from later than some of these in the list, which makes it very odd. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 07:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

The significance of MoboVivo as a download service in Canada is that it is the first and currently only such service making a bit of historical claim - perhaps even encyclopedic - in a world of technology culture anyway. As compared to other much bigger services which have entries on Wikipedia (Apple ITunes, Google Video) this service works outside of the US and not just in one country. This in itself is noteworthy - maybe encyclopedic. This page is no more corporate vanity that those sites cited like iTunes and Google Video, I suggest that if MoboVivo could be edited to sound less like an advert and note the significant fact that US only services, however large, should be noted as such - US only and to do so one must mention those companies with broad appeal and relevance beyond the US.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sorry, but I'm not seeing a mass of appropriate press, at least not from my own google search ^ - after the first few pages it drops away into random snatches of text from blogs. Of the sites remaining, most are psuedo-adverts - filler 'news' splashed with company quotes, what appears to be press-releases and pricing information. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are what I'm basing my arguments on.</li>

<dd>There's nothing wrong in a company drumming-up some business and getting attention, but we're a tertiary source taking information from reliable secondary sources (see <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). The competitors mentioned stand or fall on their own merits, exclusively of the inclusion or lack of presence of competitive services. If Mobovivo is a genuinely innovative service, it will undergo critical analysis from the press, from which we make articles. Articles that read like adverts are a <i>concern</i>, which is why I raised it, particularly with other circumstances to take into consideration. However, articles can be cleaned-up, that in itself is neither a reason to delete the article nor something which you should spend time trying to rectify during this discussion. In retrospect, my 'speedy' suggestion was over-zealous, if nothing else Mobovivo does not resemble the kind of subject mentioned in the 'call to arms' cited, and a full discussion is deserved. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 02:53, 12 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I guess your right about the press coverage -google search results in a lot of non press releases. This was not the case a few months ago - for better or worse. Going through these a bit closer and knowing the industry press outlets here are a few links that show up in a google search that show third party reviews. These are the ones that don't just re-hash a company press release.</p>

<p>Although this article is clearly a work in progress (as is the company, apparently), removing it when the articles posted regarding iTunes and Google Video (among other U.S. "big media" entries) are permitted to subsist smacks of corporate favoritism and being a big bully to a small Canadian company. It looks to me like there are enough mentions in the public press (e.g. canada.com is one of Canada's biggest news sites) to provide some confirmation of the details, so I would let it be and remove it from AfD consideration.</p>

<p>This isn't a particularly notable subculture that exists within the gay community. Although the term <i>is</i> loosely attested by a <i>few</i> Google hits (but you'll find far more for G0Y as the first half of a <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_postal_code.html" title="Canadian postal code">Canadian postal code</a> range in central <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quebec.html" title="Quebec">Quebec</a>), it appears to be a non-notable website trying to <i>build</i> a subculture around a <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologism</a>. Fails both <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>, and skirts the edge of <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICDEF_eedd.html" title="WP:DICDEF">WP:DICDEF</a>, to boot. Was previously AFD'd (see <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_G0y_b045.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/G0y">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/G0y</a>), but this version is at least different enough from the first one to not call it a G4. And as for the couple of claims in the previous AFD that it's common in gay chat forums, it certainly doesn't exist in the ones <i>I</i> frequent, so I'd need to see some actual evidence of that. And even if the evidence can be provided, <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> is pretty clear on the difference between citing <i>examples</i> of a word in use (which isn't good enough for our needs) and citing actual verifiable sources <i>about</i> the word. And as for <a href="../../../f/r/o/Frot.html" title="Frot">frot</a>, it's also a silly little neologism for a sex act that the G0y movement didn't even invent, and which already has other names in genuine use anyway. <b>Delete</b> both. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 08:24, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

Gawd, this is like when that girl friend of mine who runs a Hairy Armpits forum was telling me about this influx of guys who feel "persecuted" by adverts in fashion magazines because a model trying to sell them colonge has a shaved body. <i>Get over yourself!</i> This is not about how "gays get to have their space while persecuting g0yz" -- it's about the lack of legitimate and original sources bringing the validity of this article into question. Wikipedia is not a message-board nor is it an Internet community like <a href="../../../l/i/v/LiveJournal_40d6.html" title="LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> where "everybody" gets to have their say (within reason), no matter how asinine one feels another's opinions are.

<li><b>Delete</b> Primary Notability Criteria: Nontrivial coverage in multiple reliable sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> Roselands is over 40 years old, was Australia's first large shopping centre of its type, was the largest in the southern hemisphere for many years, had Australia's first "food court", and we have a wonderful old image in Commons. There was a lot of text about it in <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grace_Bros._ce45.html" title="Grace Bros.">Grace Bros.</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/s/Roselands%2C_New_South_Wales_fae2.html" title="Roselands, New South Wales">Roselands, New South Wales</a>, so maybe this article was previously merged? Anyway, I've added the above to hopefully shore up its notability a bit. I have to agree with Rebecca... the article was a bit of a mess, but I think Wikipedia stands to miss out on a lot of interesting historical information if articles like this are constantly merged and deleted under <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or G11 or whatever, rather than people cleaning up or researching. <s>PS. is that ballot warning really necessary or justified?

<dd>Encyclopaedias are not for "interesting". Encyclopaedias are for "<i>notable</i>".

<dd>Canley has given you five very good reasons why it is notable, including at least one that should be indisputable (largest in the Southern Hemisphere for a long period).

<dd>(after edit conflict) I <i>have</i> provided "multiple" (2), "independent" (local govt and trade association) and "non-trivial" (see previous) references, and that's just online ones. So what's the problem? I don't think "all shopping malls should be kept", and I don't think they should "all be deleted or merged". I think this one, as is stated in the intro, is verifiably notable (historically, culturally and commercially) on its own merits, and these are backed up by the references.</dd>

<p>Another ethnic animosities page. Unfortunately there are precedents for such pages that have been kept (and this one has evidently used one of those as a blueprint). But this is particularly weak specimen. It doesn't even attempt to make a case that its subject-matter constitutes a coherent phenomenon and that it has been discussed in such terms in the literature. Its main assertions are entirely unsourced. The largest part of the article is taken up by a discussion not of "Anti-Georgianism", but of "Russification" (in Georgia but mainly elsewhere) - but if the author wants to imply that Russification is ipso facto Anti-Georgianism, that would be an OR argument <i>par excellence</i>. Apart from that, the article features a propaganda poster illustrating Georgian animosity against Russian political interventionism - but that, if anything, reflects Anti-Russian propaganda by Georgians, not Anti-Georgianism by Russians. All in all, just another case of the "Anti-X'ism" article format being misused for OR listings of just any and all grievances ethnicity X may have against its neighbours, and as such almost certainly a POV-fork (though I'm not sure of what). <a href="../../../f/u/t/User%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_a39b.html" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="../../../f/u/t/User_talk%7EFuture_Perfect_at_Sunrise_2505.html" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 11:31, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

If anti-Georgianism does in fact exist as something of a similar significance as some of the other "anti-Xisms" of history and culture, no prejudice at all against recreating an article reflecting this. Likewise, if citations and the like can be provided, no objections to a move to another title, although I can't for the life of me think what yet. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 12:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - not quite. "Anti-Georgia" is an adjective (in that one can have "anti-Georgia policies"), while "anti-Georgianism" should by rights be the noun and the preferable article title of the two. Further, some of the Google hits for "anti-Georgia" are in fact dealing with biases against the US state of the same name, particularly in a College Football sense. The bulk seem to be about Russia's perceived view of the state in the Caucasus, but it's still being used adjectivally. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 00:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

A keep arguement might be able to be made based on his College career (He did average almost a point a game during his senior year), but such an arguement could not be made on a 4-game NHL career.

<li><b>Comment</b> For those of you who are troubled by the nominator, just pretend I nominated this bit of trivia instead and go from there.

<li><b>Comment</b> <i>Ad hominem</i> defenses are faulty ways to provide evidence for your point of view. <i>Ad hominem</i> means against the person: We are not debating the qualities of the person who nominated the AfD. That discussion can go on elsewhere on Wikipedia, like Requests for Intervention or other such places. The only valid means for deciding whether to keep or delete this article lie in the subject of the article itself. Not the quality of the writing. Not the people who have edited or created it. And certainly not in the personality of the original nominator. The article in question is subjective and and random. It lacks notability. Porn actresses are notable. Models are notable. Lists of random porn actresses and models by a random physical trait is NONNOTABLE. Stop trying to defend the "keep" position by <i>ad hominem</i> means. Defend the article itself on its own terms. Provide evidence. You can sway opinions by making a good case, not by attacking the original nom. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:10, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think anyone here is attacking the nominator. They're attacking the nomination itself. <i>Ad hominem</i> would mean saying that the nominator is a bad person, therefore his nomination is bad. We've simply said the nomination is bad. Sockpuppetry and bad faith administrative actions are real problems on Wikipedia, and it's not necessary to follow through with a problematic action if we know it to be unsound. -- <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikeblas_16be.html" title="User:Mikeblas">Mikeblas</a> 14:18, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>reply</b> 1) <i>Ad hominem</i> defenses are faulty (don't base your defense on the personality of the person who nominated the article) 2) the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers_5a5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of big-bust models and performers">prior AfD</a> was NO CONSENSUS. This is not the same as keep. It means exactly what it says. There was no consensus reached to do anything, so the <i>status quo</i> was kept by default. It doesn't mean that there was ever widespread consensus that this article is notable. 3) Valoem's arguement above is faulty because it merely says that it is interesting and useful. Neither is a "keep" defense. Lots of things are interesting and useful, but not entirely encyclopedic. As a "category" it might be worthwhile to categorize models by bust size, but as an article, it is a pointless list. The only person voting for keep who made ANYTHING of a credible arguement is Charlam about two votes above. I respectfully disagree; but at LEAST he is making a keep vote on notability grounds. Also of note, THE ARTICLE IS ENTIRELY UNREFERENCED... Thus it is original research, and thus it is also deletable. If EACH performer or model listed could be linked to an appropriate third-party reference that identified her as the cup size the article claimed to be, then we MIGHT have something, but as it stands now, it is Orignial Research, a direct violation of Wikipedia policy, and thus it must go... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:05, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>reply</b> First of all an unreferenced article is hardly a reason to delete. If an article is unreferenced you add references. It is only when an article is unreferenced and references can not be made that you delete under WP:V. Secondly, this article is referenced in the links to the persons in question. If you click on anyone one of the people listed on that page their own articles have both references and their stated bust size. You also didn't mention any of the other points that I have made including my arguments against listcruft and WP:V. Therefore this article is not original research. Lastly, even you have stated that this nomination was bad faith, these are all the more reasons to keep. <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 19:09, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>reply to reply</b> Ok, I will concede that the references can be found in the respective articles. I retract that the article is original research, but it is still NOT NOTABLE. It is still nothing more than a listing of people by a random and arbitrary physical statistic. Good lists can be made of adult models; this is not one of them. One more point: As i said before</li>

<p>" <font size="20">IF</font> the nomination was in bad faith" (note the use of the conditional word IF. It means that we are discussing a possibility, not a certainty. I have no idea of the mindset or intent of the original nominator, NOR DO I CARE) such a defense is still an <i>ad hominem</i> defense; it is a deflection of the actual issue, and a means of avoiding having to enter the actual debate on THIS article. If you belive bad faith to have been exercised here, then go to Requests for Intervention and ask to have the user blocked. It has NO BEARING on the inherant notability of this article. MAKE ARGUEMENTS RELATING TO THE CONTENT OF THIS ARTICLE. I apologize for "shouting", but so far only one person, Charlam, has done so; though it would be nice to see any proof that his assertion is true... Are adult models routinely catagorized in this way and is such catagorization used (note the past tense: not useful, but <i>used</i> in the sense that others have used this information before it appeared on wikipedia) routinely in reliable sources. If anyone could make a credible arguement of the MERITS of this article, and could make some proof as to actual notability, I would change my vote. As yet, we have 1 unverified assertion that I would call a claim of notability. EVERYONE else has avoided discussing the merits of this article by deflecting the debate away from the contents of the article. They make arguements against other lists, or they make arguements against people involved in the debate. Neither kind of arguement brings anything to the discussion. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 22:14, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>reply to reply</b> Not sure if this is what you're asking for, but as far as I can think of, to prove cup size is a valid standard measurement in aduly models would be to cite publications specializing only in models that would fit in this category, such as: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Score_%28magazine%29</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustler_Busty_Beauties</a>, Gent, a specialiazed title series of Playboy (Playboy's Voluptuous Vixens) which is based solely on the models having larger then "average" bustlines. Aside from this, numerous websites featuring models specifically of D cup or larger, the fact that many Feature Dancers are booked by cup size and to some degree even the article on Breast Fetishism (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_fetishism</a>) would point to the relevance of this particular measurement standing out versus other physical characteristics. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlam_00_1901.html" title="User:Charlam 00">Charlam 00</a> 18:13, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>"Keep" as it is information but the title should be changed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change vote to <b>Keep</b>. Thank you to Charlam. Homework has been done. Article looks like it <i>can be made</i> to pass the threshold. Suggestions to make it better:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Use the {{main}} tag to direct readers to the Breast Fetishism article. Perhaps a sentance or two from that article applied here will help establish context.</li>
<li>REFERENCE the notability of this article using the same references as the Breast Fetishism article. Also indicate the most notable magazines and film series to focus on Breast Fetishism, perhaps under a "see also" section. There appears to be reputable sources that indicate the notability of this particular kink, and so those references apply equally as well to both articles.</li>
<li>Rename the list article to indicate better that we are talking about Porn Actresses. Perhaps "List of Adult Film Actresses with Large Breasts" or some such. The title is misleading, as it could refer to non-adult film stars or models. I will still hold that OUTSIDE of porn, the catagorization of breast size is a non notable trait. The article needs to indicate its own context to make itself notable. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 19:48, 31 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia excels in treatments of popular culture not treated in academia. The topic is of interest to many, even if 'vulgar'.

<p>The result was <b>Delete</b> The one legitimate keep vote here suggested that the result in Cheeseweb (begun on the 25 October and closed by me just a moment ago) must logically apply here. I agree, and close this a bit early for consistency.

<p><b>I'm not voting</b> As a newcomer to Wikipedia, perhaps one of the few in-words I know is "deletionist". I personally think it is a real word which although possibly mostly found in Wikipedia does deserve an entry on its own.</p>
<p>I tried to find the "suggest an article" link, but its gone (or I couldn't find it).</p>
<p>My reason for suggesting this article is that I came across the term before I really knew anything about Wikipedia. So, unlike many other inventions it does have an external scope to Wikipedia. This is not a frivolous suggestion, I'm being serious that I think it exists as something that is worthy of an entry, and not knowing how else to discuss it I created the article for deletion! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 13:25, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> 42,000 Google hits supports notability. Inclusionist/deletionist dichotomy is an important aspect of all online encyclopedias and other Wiki-like collections of information.

<dd>Using wiki links to link to a promotion article is still link spamming, even if it is a bit indirect.

<dd>Well, it was a new page and it was mentioned as a stub, and wikipedia encourage to introduce links to it. So, I went out to find the most relevant article to link to this page. And I chose "engineers" and "engineering". I have to introduce links to my page eventually, right? Does that count as link spam? Other than that, I do admit that it's new.

<p>This article should be deleted beciase it is an unexpandable stub. GAOTU is nothing more than a specialized Masonic (and possibly Calvinist) term for <a href="../../../s/u/p/Supreme_Being_b2f5.html" title="Supreme Being">Supreme Being</a>, and it would be better to state the usage there. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 15:50, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Withdraw AfD</b> if possible. I'm very annoyed that this sat for over <i>six months</i> with no real work on it (it was also duplicated as <a href="../../../t/g/a/TGAOTU_b2e5.html" title="TGAOTU">TGAOTU</a>), and was a bad sub-stub until this AfD was filed, and never mind the fact that the person who removed the prod did nothing to the article either. It's very convenient timing for information to surface. If the current material had been part of the article months (or even a week) ago, this AfD would have been totally unnecessary. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 03:06, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then why didn't you work on it <i>yourself</i> during all of that time? No information has surfaced. It was all already available, months and even years ago. The only tools that were required to create the content as it now stands were Google Web, Google Scholar, and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Special%7EWhatlinkshere_Great_Architect_of_the_Universe_7612.html" title="Special:Whatlinkshere/Great Architect of the Universe">Special:Whatlinkshere/Great Architect of the Universe</a>. Before asserting that something is unexpandable, it is wise to perform the research to actually <i>check</i> whether there is scope for expansion.

<ul>
<li>Because I never saw the article until I was doing a category cleanup on Freemasonry the other day, and as far as the article was concerned, it was about GAOTU in Freemasonry. Thus, the idea to expand it to Calvin and other non-Masonic usages never occurred to me, because that did not appear to be the intent of the article. <a href="../../../m/s/j/User%7EMSJapan_e913.html" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> 12:55, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This, and a bunch of redirects, were created by User:Matsimons as pretty much a forum advertisement.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This "article" doesn't really tell us anything, and could easily be summarized thusly: "Previously it was hard to learn about magic because magicians kept their secrets. Then there were books, but the books were supplanted by videos because they are more modern. Then there were clubs and societies that people could join to learn magic. Then there were web discussion boards and you can visit this one right now. It's your choice." It takes up an awful lot of space to say absolutely nothing at all. The same user has also posted exactly the same text in its own section in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28illusion%29.html" title="Magic (illusion)">Magic (illusion)</a>, which also needs to be deleted.

<p>(The original article, MAD Magical Arts Domain)</p>
<p>That was my first ever article at wikipedia, I was not aware of rules and regulations. So this time I made very sure that I followed every rule, THe article is informative, and does stick to all regulations, and is a very different article to the origanal one that I made, infact it has nothing to do with MAD, it only gives a usefull refernce to it.</p>
<p>(and the forum itself doesn't satisfy WP:WEB.)</p>
<p>Yes it does!</p>
<p>(Not a how to site.)</p>
<p>its exaclty what it is, learning and sharing how to.</p>
<p>Nothing to learn if your not interested in magic and learning magic, the lnik is not a redirect, not in the slightest, the link goes to the header page, that explains what exaclty MAD is, giving people the option to join or not. I followed Wikipedias own policy on supplying an external link if relevant to the article. I would expect others to add more links, to books, magic clubs and so on.</p>
<p>(This "article" doesn't really tell us anything,) It certanly explains to those who have tryed to learn magic before how and why it was so difacult, and then goes on to give them information on how they could now get into the world of magic a lot more easly.</p>
<p>(The same user has also posted exactly the same text in its own section in <a href="../../../m/a/g/Magic_%28illusion%29.html" title="Magic (illusion)">Magic (illusion)</a>)</p>
<p>Becasue its very relevant, and folows a post on magic ethics. maybe the text could be replaced with a link to learning magic, but in context to the rest of the magic illusion article I thought and think others will find it very relevant.</p>

<li><b>Delete:</b> Fluff, and part of a spam campaign. I was leaning towards a "weak" delete, since if someone <i>really</i> wanted they could make a real article out of it, but I changed my mind to "definite delete" when I uncovered the campaign. This is one of several vehicles for link spam for the MAD commercial site which: 1) requires registration, 2) has prominent Google ads. Neither one is fatal, but they each raise a hurdle (<a href="../../../e/x/t/Wikipedia%7EExternal_Links_1816.html" title="Wikipedia:External Links">Wikipedia:External Links</a> that the user must overcome if they want to justify inclusion of the link, and it is higher since both strikes are against the link.

<p>Total rubbish and a slur on my name</p>
<p>(This is one of several vehicles for link spam for the MAD commercial site)</p>
<p>It is not a commercial site in the slightest, it is a help forum that is free</p>
<p>(which: 1) requires registration, 2))</p>
<p>Yes the forum requires registration, only so that we do not have magic seekers and exposure hunters joining. But the link in the article is a link to a page that describes exactly what MAD is, so you can decide if you wnat to sign up or not</p>
<p>(ha1s prominent Google ads.)</p>
<p>WE dont have any google adverts, we dont have any adverts anywhere, you are obviously jumping to conclusions without researching very well. . .</p>
<p>((User:Matsimons contribs, talk) attempted (multiple times))</p>
<p>The link is part of the article, so why would it not be included?</p>
<p>(Delete all of it)</p>
<p>Before making such a sweeping statment you really should research correctly, to make accusations that are false only makes yourself look ignorant. Helping keep Wikipedia free from fluff and spam is a good thing, but make sure you have your facts correct first.</p>
<p>The whole issue here seems to be about link to a very relevant forum to the context of the article. The article itself is justified and so is an example of a forum, examples of books and magic clubs can be added, but I didnt want to add to many urls, I thought I would give others a chance so as not to be biased.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>False:</b> It definitely does have Google ads right here. I checked now and half an hour ago. Google ads both times: <a href="http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/" class="external free" title="http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/" rel="nofollow">http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/</a>. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 11:18, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<p><br />
Matsimons 11:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I assumed the OP accusing of google adds was talking about adds at google advertising the forum, maybe the OP should have made it more clear, however I am sorry if I missunderstood, If you are talking about the forum itself having adverts this has nothing to do with the forum creators, we use a free forum supplier called proboards, they insert the adverts, not us. In no way is the site a commercial site for those who created it, we get a free servicem the service supplier has to recope that somehow. But there is no monetry gain for any of the creators or users of the forum. And if you did sign upto the forum just to check, you broke the rules of the forum, where we ask people not to sign up unless they want to be magicians. So I would ask you to remove your profile before i deleate it, unless of course you are interested in magic, and if thats the case we would be happuy to have you abourd.</p>
<ul>
<li>These are Google ads: <a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Wp-mad.jpg">Image:Wp-mad.jpg</a>. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 11:41, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
Matsimons 11:44, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>by all means show the add, as i said before its nothing to do with MAD itself. However are you not breaking copyright law by showing an image of the MAD logo that you do not have permision to use? As I hold allrights to that logo, I ask you to remove it from the screen grab. Thank you.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is fair use because it is for a debate which is a news use. It is simply documenting a fact that is in public dispute. Furthermore, when you yourself uploaded the logo to Wikipedia, that gives permission to use it in this kind of educational context. The use of the logo here is to give the <i>bona fide</i> that it really is the page, since apparently one of the users above could look at the page linked and still did not see the ads (note how "ads" is spelled). You spammed Wikipedia, then you deny everything in the debate, and then you grudgingly admit you were wrong and then you attempt to suppress the evidence and control the debate. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 11:56, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Matsimons 12:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC) sigh, again false information, I did not uplaod That image to wikipedia. And yes its fair use, but its still my right to ask you to remove it, even if you dont have to. Also the user you refer to may not have seen the adds, they do not pop up every time. I have denied nothing, infact I think you will see im disputing matters. I did not admit i was wrong, I admited that the issue was not to clear so I misunderstood, but I was happy to apologise. In will not alow false accusations of spamming and such go un answered. I also do not want to argue, I will dispute false claims and ask advice on how to correct them when I get it wrong.</p>
<p>80.5.91.220 13:02, 27 October 2006 (UTC)Excuse me but I think you'll find the spelling of "ads" is correct as "Ads" is short for advertisements of which there are no additional d's. And quite why you chose to bring it up confuses me. You almost seem to be inflammitory and provoking a response which I find wholly unnecessary. As an additional point, I have been refreshing the "MAD" site and up until now have found NO evidence of the screenshot you submitted. If I were to be inflammitory back I could say you doctored the picture to reinforce your point when for the last 30 minutes at least I have refreshed the page and found no advertisements appearing. JBelmont</p>
<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>I did not claim that it was you, JBelmont, who did not spell "ads" incorrectly, so you can relax. I would have thought it was as clear from the context as it is from the text itself that it was Matsimons who did, several times, so it was not a typo. However, since you are interested in spelling, you might like to know that you (JBelmont in this case, to be clear) have spelled "inflammatory" incorrectly twice, so that was not a typo, either.</li>
<li>If you click the link I posted in the line above where you made your reply headed "True" on this issue, you will see the Google ads. I have clicked that link four times half an hour apart each time, and seen the ads, as illustrated, four times out of four. I have not heard of a browser with blockers installed against Google ads, but I suppose they could exist. The ads do not depend on popups (I block popups). Here is the link again: <a href="http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/" class="external free" title="http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/" rel="nofollow">http://magicartsdomain.proboards105.com/index.cgi/</a>. You can see the ads under the login banner that says "Welcome guest". There are two or three that appear at a time in black text on a white background in a box. Just below the box to the left, there is a little tag that says "Ads by Google". To the lower right of the box, it says "Advertise on this site".</li>
<li>To get back to the issue of why the article and the spam links should be deleted, writers here have explained that:
<ul>
<li>The article is not very informative and is basically obvious commonsense that is unnecessary in an encyclopedia.</li>
<li>The site link that is supposedly inseparable and integral to the article is non-notable.</li>
<li>The site fails the "no registration" criteria of the Wikipedia policy on external links.</li>
<li>The site fails the policy against links to sites that depend on advertising, even to support a free service.</li>
<li>The article has been duplicated word for word twice in two other articles.</li>
<li>The article has no sources or references.</li>
<li>The writer argues vehemently that the link is inseparable and integral, which leads to the conclusion that the purpose of the article and all the links that were posted to the articles noted above are just to publicize the site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This has been a long debate (so far), but I have tried to clarify all the issues and answer all the questions in support of the nomination and those urging delete. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 13:31, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>80.5.91.220 13:58, 27 October 2006 (UTC) * I was not interested in spelling I took offence when you quoted "<b>since apparently one of the users above could look at the page linked and still did not see the ads (note how "ads" is spelled).</b> which to me is implying there was some problem in the way I spelt "ads", due to the fact you were quoting someone not being able to see the "ads" which is myself. Additionally I have clicked and refreshed the new link you sent and still to the point of writing this reply do not see any "ads". So what happens? Do we agree to disagree as I only have your word that that screenshot is genuine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh and by the way "publicize" is not spelled with a z. It is an s.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I still see no reason to delete the site when there are plenty of others which seem to get away with more violations than this site does. JBelmont</li>
</ul>
<p>Wikipedia policy is to use British English for articles about British subjects and American English for articles about American subjects. The "-ize" versus "-ise" ending depends on which of those two you use. Since this debate is not in the article space, you should use either one as you feel comfortable and both are acceptable.</p>
<p>Regarding the ads on the site, people reading this debate will click the link (the same link, no change) and form their own conclusions. I begin to suspect that the ads do not appear in the U.K. or France, but do appear in the U.S. I'll be interested to hear some feedback on this. I think that Matsimons may be in France and you (JBelmont) may be in the U.K., based on your "brooks-no-argument" attitude regarding the "ise" ending.</p>
<p>I eagerly invite you to please point out the plenty of other links that you know of which have more violations, and we will be glad to inspect them and delete them if they are not appropriate according to Wikipedia policies. As I stated above, it is possible for a site to have advertising and/or registration, but to clear those hurdles, they have to show extraordinary usefulness. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 14:14, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(* If you click the link I posted in the line above where you made your reply headed "True" on this issue, you will see the Google ads.)</p>
<p>Yes exaclty the link that you supplied, not me.</p>
<p>(I have clicked that link four times half an hour apart each time, and seen the ads)</p>
<p>Again, not a link I supplied, but to prove my previous point, I clicked the link that YOU supplied ten times and not once did I get adverts. you can check the screen grab here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:No_adds.jpg" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:No_adds.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:No_adds.jpg</a>. Also I asked 5 work colleages to do the same, some got adds and some didnt.</p>
<p>(The article is not very informative and is basically obvious commonsense that is unnecessary in an encyclopedia.)</p>
<p>Not all of the information in the article is obvious, how would a new comer to learning magic know that some magic groups would not let you join unless you already had some magic knowledge, or that there are diferent types of forums, Wikipedia maybe the first point of reference, to sugest that its commonsense to know so is in my opinion a arogant statement and derogative towards magic new comers.</p>
<p>(o The site link that is supposedly inseparable and integral to the article is non-notable.)</p>
<p>I never sugested that it was, I was merely supplying a link that was relative to the context of the article to one of the discrbed forums. I didnt want to add more links to books or magic groups becasue I could not confim there credability, and was hopng others would do so at some point.</p>
<p>(o The site fails the "no registration" criteria of the Wikipedia policy on external links.)</p>
<p>I did not supply a link to a site that requires registration, I supplied a link to a information header page, that would then give the reader the opertunity to then decide whether or not to continue and join the forum.</p>
<p>(o The site fails the policy against links to sites that depend on advertising, even to support a free service.)</p>
<p>Again you are talking about a link that you supplied and not I, the information header page has no advertising and is certnaly not a redirect page.</p>
<p>(o The article has been duplicated word for word twice in two other articles.)</p>
<p>I do not dispute this, I didnt realise it was wrong to do so, If only a link to the article in question is permited then that all I would supply, I did however at the time think that the contect of the post was very relevant to the article that I posted in. This is my downfall on not knowing all Wikipedia rules, and I will comply to them when it is sugested froma creditable sourse.</p>
<p>(* This has been a long debate (so far), but I have tried to clarify all the issues and answer all the questions in support of the nomination and those urging delete. Hu 13:31, 27 October 2006 (UTC))</p>
<p>I agree, but to make your issues worthy, you need to adress this issue with the url you are supplying and the url I supplied. Also the fact that I do not think that the inseparable and integral to the article, but that I supplied the link because I thought it was relevant and would be helpfull to any one looking to learn magic as this is what the article is about. -- User:Matsimons</p>

80.5.91.220 14:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC) * Iam aware of the American English and British English seperation, you felt you had to make a point to me regarding an incorrect spelling for no reason I can see other than "teaching me a lesson" of which I find quite childish. Iam in the UK you are correct, I cannot speak for Matsimons as I have no idea where he is, but I do not see why any advertisement would appear only in the U.S and not in the U.K. There are no advertisement blockers on my system at all so if the advertisment is there, I should see it. I can only go on what I see or do not see, and still I do not see the advertisments in question.</p>
<ul>
<li>I find this whole debate is being diluted into petty nit-picking so returning to the point: I disagree on your point of saying it is uninformative, I DO find it informative and others have aswell, I find it arrogant of you to dismiss the whole site because in your personal opinion it not informative.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Finally I may list the sites in the future to you, but at this moment I do not feel it is necessary to the cause in hand which is whether or not the site in question is to be deleted or not. JBelmont</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried to bring it back to the topic at hand, the deletion, when I summarized the arguments for it, above, but that seems to have escaped you. With regard to the ads, the ad servers like google look up the IP address of the destination and when they find that it is located in the UK, they direct ads targeted for that audience according to the settings the advertisers have chosen. There are fewer Google advertisers targeting the UK than the US. Thus you see few or no ads. Matsimons colleagues do see some ads. You can drop the personal attacks where you call me arrogant and childish. I have not applied any adjectives to you and I don't think it is nessary to apply any to me. By not labelling you, it is another way I do my part to keep the debate on track. <a href="../../../h/u/_/User%7EHu_5903.html" title="User:Hu">Hu</a> 15:00, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(Are you in Europe?)</p>
<p>yes I am in europe but not Franc?, the adverts do appear but not all the time. And the same goes for elsewhere in the world, sometimes you get them and sometimes you dont. This discusion has come up many times in proboard forums. But the real big issue is the link that I supplied does not have adverts. You keep refering to a link you are suppliyng. I now understand the rules about what links can and cant be supplied, thats why I supplied a link to the Information page that is hosted by me. I was asked by some of the admin at the forum to create a page that did not have advertising and that gave information about the forum so people could decide to join or not. It was that information that I placed int he first article MAD Magical Arts Domain. The only reason that that article was taken down was for copy right reasons, I failed to clarify that I had created the graphic, and that I had been given permision to use the text. That was my first ever article at Wikipedia and at the time did not realise what I had to citate or how to do it. -- Matsimons 14:51, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>(It's not about the link page, but it is the site that you wish to link to)</p>
<p>This is exaclty the point, it is not a link page as you sugest it is, its a information page. Who said I wish to link to the forum, I was linking to an information site about the forum. You cant make judgments on what other links are at a site supplied,if that was the case at what level of referls what you stop at, as long as the link supplied conforms to Wikipedias rules thats all that matters surely.</p>
<p>(though I suspect based on what others have said that it is not very useful) How would they know? the rules of the forum are to only join if you want to be a dedicated magician. You should make your own conclusions rather than relying on false inforamtion given to you by others. Especialy when making such a dispute as you are. There are over 300 members of that forum who would totaly disagree.</p>
<p>I seem to be repeating myself again and again here. So untill anything new that has not been covered comes up or that adresses my answers to said questions I shall refrain from posting. -- Matsimons 15:26, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Thank you for that observation. I did not look at it like that. My reference to that was it appears to be a series that somebody puts alot of work into. The first nomination mentioned notable and I was rebutting that.

<li><b>keep</b>This is a major competition in major league of a notable sport. It has been definatively scheduled.

<li>It's a filthy slum of an article full of speculation and will be pretty much mandated by WP policy to be blank if kept. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> makes it very clear that events like this one, although nearly guaranteed to happen, still should not get an article until reliable information is available. The date is unconfirmed, the location is unconfirmed, and the participants are unconfirmed. Info was taken from the NSAC, which while they approve events, is no guarantee the event will happen as approved (for instance <a href="../../../u/f/c/UFC_65_d130.html" title="UFC 65">UFC 65</a> was approved to be in Las Vegas before it got moved to Sacramento.) Lets make it clear that deletion does not automatically prevent an article from being re-created. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 17:28, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>.

However, this event is too far off in the future and is a perfect example of the crystal ball.

<li><b>Delete</b> - If every school has a page for every tv or radio station that they had that would be alot of articles that only people at the school would read.

<p>I disagree i think its important to have these articles, as many people use wikipedia as there first reference. isn't the point of wikipedia to try collect everything anyone could ever want to know for everyone to access? or is it only for Americans, as i find many american articles unnotable like the fact it seems every secondary school in american has an article ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:High_schools_in_Colorado" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:High_schools_in_Colorado" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:High_schools_in_Colorado</a>) how are these more notable?

<li><b>reply</b> #1) SIGN YOUR COMMENTS by adding 4 tildes (~~~~)to the end. #2) The existance of another deletable article is NOT a defense of this article. If YOU think another article should be deleted then YOU nominate it. This discussion is about the merits (or lack therof) of THIS article. Familiarize yourself with the Wikipedia policies and guidelines relevent to this discussion, especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. If you think an article is worthy, mount a defense with EVIDENCE as set out by these guidelines. If you can't provide the evidence, you won't sway the consensus to your favor, and more importantly, you won't sway the closing admin to your favor. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 05:19, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't think any of them should be deleted, i'm using them as Precedents particularly to show that if this was page about an american tv station it would not have been nominated for deletion. I apologise for any mistakes i've made in the formatting of this defence, and thank you for the links as it lead me to this, "Licensed radio and TV stations are notable if they broadcast over the air and originate at least a portion of their programming schedule in their own studios." <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">WP:AFDP</a> Student TV and Radio, is based on original content, broadcasts it and has to be licensed to do so. on these grounds LUST and all student TV in the UK fulfills the criteria for notability. unless of course all articles are equal but American one are more equal than others.

<li>Change vote to <b>Neutral</b> Excellent! That is a well found defense. Just one question, the <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFDP_6910.html" title="WP:AFDP">particular precedent</a> you cite specifcally says that: "Lower power radio stations limited to a small neighborhood, such as Part 15 operations in the United States or stations with a VF# callsign in Canada, are not inherently notable". Many student-radio stations are very low power, and only broadcast "on campus". (for example, WVUD at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Delaware_0fa4.html" title="University of Delaware">University of Delaware</a>.) Others have powerful enough broadcast range to be heard over an entire metro area.(for example <a href="../../../w/e/r/WERS_2b1a.html" title="WERS">WERS</a> at <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerson_College_18e0.html" title="Emerson College">Emerson College</a>. The distinction here seems to me to be the broadcast power and area of the station, not association with a university. I am not familiar enough with this station to make any definative statements. Can anyone confirm one way of the other: <i>Can this TV station be seen throughout the entire metro area, or is this simply run on say, the dormitory cable system and cannot be seen off campus. That would make a huge difference.</i> I would be willing to change my vote to keep if we can get definitive confirmation of the broadcast range of the station in question. A link to an external site that proves that this station can be seen off campus would be VERY helpful. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 01:11, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Save</b>: I disagree that the article should be deleted, at least for now. I think a list of organizations he was involved with is a good idea, for historical purposes. The article could stand editing and deeper research; having his alma mater listed, for example, isn't helpful, and doesn't have anything to do with his political/lobbying career or the scandals. But seeing how he pulled this kind of thing off may help folks see patterns like it in the future. This was/is a pretty big shake-up in the political world, and I think documenting it in as many ways as possible is a good thing. For that matter, knowing his tribal clients is also helpful, again for historical purposes. This information should all be saved; and seriously, completely, totally reorganized from the mess that it is. I will say that as long as this information is contained <i>somewhere</i> around here, I'll be happy. It need not be in this particular article. --<a href="../../../d/t/h/User%7EDthatcher_a1f7.html" title="User:Dthatcher">Dthatcher</a> 16:34, 4 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Since Violet died at the age of 11, there is little chance that this article can ever be expanded. Yes, Violet was the older sister of a queen, but she died almost seven years before <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_Elizabeth_the_Queen_Mother_7403.html" title="Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother">Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother</a> was born, so she never even <i>met</i> the queen to whom she was closely related. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 22:15, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Your argument is disingenuous because she died thirty years before her family became connected to the Royals <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrKiernan_4f47.html" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> 06:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Further to that, we are arguing for deletion not on the basis of notability but on the basis of it being a stub article which duplicates material elsewhere <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrKiernan_4f47.html" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> 07:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>First, the fact she died "thirty years before her family became connected to the Royals" is irrelevant. She was still a sister and aunt to queens. Many people are interested in royal relatives, whether <i>you</i> are or are not. Second, there are no valid grounds for deleting an article just because it's a stub. This is a common misconception, but a misconception nonetheless. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:33, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> I am somewhat concerned that the current consensus (Uncle G, Met90 and Chris against DrK and Nlu for delete and Necro for keep) is for redirect or merger. Please note that there are no links to this page, accept from the deletion pages. <s>Consequently, a redirect would be self-defeating, as there are no links to redirect!

<ul>
<li>However, there may be value in linkless redirects, in that users may still type in the name and then get to the redirected article. I had forgotten about that possibility myself, and I'll change my opinion accordingly. (For example, <a href="../../../e/m/p/Emperor_Fei_of_Western_Wei_db74.html" title="Emperor Fei of Western Wei">Emperor Fei of Western Wei</a>, which I had created, has a redirect from <a href="../../../y/u/a/Yuan_Qin_7757.html" title="Yuan Qin">Yuan Qin</a> (his personal name) even though right now no article links to Yuan Qin.) --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 16:45, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, naturally, I agree that there is a value in linkless directs, as you've just explained. But is anyone <i>likely</i> to put in 'Violet Bowes-Lyon'? I think not. <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrKiernan_4f47.html" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> 17:05, 27 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, somebody created an article under that name, and it wasn't misnamed. I don't have a problem if this article gets deleted, but <a href="../../../r/f/d/WP%7ERFD_9e02.html#The_guiding_principles_of_RfD" title="WP:RFD">redirects are cheap</a> so fighting this out doesn't seem necessary. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 17:37, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Simple answer, yes! Why shouldn't they? If I read a mention of a Violet Bowes-Lyon I would likely check it on Wikipedia for exactly the reason that her surname was Bowes-Lyon. It's never a good idea to impose your own perceptions on the Wikipedia habits of others. -- <a href="../../../n/e/c/User%7ENecrothesp_7ebf.html" title="User:Necrothesp">Necrothesp</a> 00:36, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>OK. I'm persuaded that a <b>Redirect</b> is a reasonable course of action. It also means that someone searching for information on her gets the added bonus of the more detailed information on <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Bowes-Lyon%2C_14th_Earl_of_Strathmore_and_Kinghorne_ecdb.html" title="Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne">Strathmore's</a> page. <a href="../../../d/r/k/User%7EDrKiernan_4f47.html" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> 10:28, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Improve - drastically!</b> It is well written but in its current form it will go! I think I proved to myself (not from the article) that it is not a hoax because I found a site that says the sat/tan is a form of "Deistic (or Pantheistic) Satanists" and "The primary two churches which teach Deistic Satanism are the First Church of Satan in Salem, Massachussetts, and the Satanic Reds (who are also, interestingly enough, a Communist group)." [ <a href="http://www.theisticsatanism.com/geifodd/varieties.html" class="external text" title="http://www.theisticsatanism.com/geifodd/varieties.html" rel="nofollow">The Varieties of Religious Satanism By Geifodd ap Pwyll</a> ]. If I wanted to keep this article I would start by removing everything trying to "evangelise the faith" (almost the whole article) and start with the paragraph in link above and fill out a few more details. Once the <b>important</b> parts like who, what, where, when are covered, then think about what other people want to know rather than what believers want to tell others (ideally get someone who is neutral to write it!) If it does just turn out to be two small congregations as the link I saw suggest, then I doubt it will survive as an article on its own - if so try merging it with satanism! --<a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 22:30, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I think some work could be put into this article. And, part removed from the survivor series article. Survivor was a pretty big thing. I dont watch the show but if you asked me what came to my mind when you said, "Tribal Council", survivor would be in the top 3. I think the article could be fixed up and quoted in the survivor article. Ie, a note lik,e, "Main article Tribal Council(Survivor). <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 22:34, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hello one and all, I'm the original article writer. (Note that as of yet the article isn't finished, as I still have to write up the battles for the African front.) In my defense, I would like to say that the Cold War article was just a fun project by me to see if I could write a serious take on BF2142's storyline. If anyone's noticed, I heavily modeled my article after the WWII article to make it as "authentic" as possible.</p>
<p>Some of you bring up the argument that the information listed within my article is non-factual, that it is fiction, that it is just a "plot summary", so it is unnecessary. Why then are whole separate articles allowed for Warcraft's backstory, and many other fictional plots? Please, if there is some way to salvage my article, then I'll try to do so. As for merging with the actual game article, that is a possibility, but the reason I created a separate article was so that the main article wouldn't be over crowded with information. - Windows2142, posted 6.51 AM GMT 31 October 2006</p>

The appropriate place to inform the student body about Mr. Mintz's history would be on a University website or the website of the student group(s) he leads. For now, there's no indication that anyone outside the University would learn much about this fellow, but it sounds like he is destined for greater things and he will have an impact on the world around him in the future. And maybe sometime in the future there will be documentary source material ripe for the creation of a new Wikipedia article on Mr. Mintz and his wonderful future accomplishments. But today is not that day. Best of wishes to Mr. Mintz.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 07:40, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>claim to notability is oblique, but can be inferred to be (1) lots of geeks have heard of this, and (2) somebody once got busted for plagiarizing it in a print publication. But it's thin on a google search omitting trivials (144 hits for an excerpt from the text of the list), and the second test seems irrelevant.

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s> - <b>Weak Keep</b> (Updated by <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrislk02_1edf.html" title="User:Chrislk02">Chris Kreider</a> 17:10, 31 October 2006 (UTC)) - Not something I know of in my circle, but may be legit. At least has some references but they look a little shady. Especially the one citing his list, and having an accessed date like it was accessed from a professional reference site. If so, Cite the site it is from. Also, has a handful of external links that may be spamish.

<li><b>Keep</b> - i'm surprised more nerds here in wiki=land don't remember it; i certainly do (anspach's list that is). i agree that citations are somewhat weak, but considering the subject matter is something that circulated via e-mail in the earlier days of the world wide web, one would not expect differently. there are plenty of stub articles i've seen in wikipedia with much less information that no one is trying to delete (or even take notice of).</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The source is legit, and this isn't just a 'local watering hole' -- it's a venue of public executions in Saudi Arabia. A notorious location of government sponsored beheadings seems notable to me, however the article as it currently stand is a sentence so it needs to be expanded significantly (hence the 'weak'). --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 05:04, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge and redirect</b> to "<a href="../../../d/e/e/Deera_Square_c770.html" title="Deera Square">Deera Square</a>", as it seems to be a notable aspect of that place and well-known even outside Saudi-Arabia. Another reference mentioning "Chop Chop Square": <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,615690,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,615690,00.html" rel="nofollow">[39]</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Guardian_d79f.html" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a>). But there is no reason for two separate stubs on the same square, and even if the chop-chopping may be the most significant aspect of the place, I think the official name is preferable (and less POV).

<li><b>Strong delete</b>: The behavior of 74.12.103.177 in removing the AfD notice from the page and blanking this page makes me take a shoot-on-sight stance without any further investigation into what looks like a COI entry.

<li><b>Delete</b>: could be enough G-hits on an artist, but in this case almost half appear to be listings of Yazi Gallery in Toronto, which mentions him among their roster of artists, and none appear to be reviews in even a local newspaper. Exactly one appears to be one of his students describing him as an "influence", but no indication that she is notable, either. - <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 18:13, 28 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Do not Touch</b>. The article contains references to all the claims made in it. Moreover, the conduct of Due Diligence on a person via Google (though a great tool fot initial research) is insufficient in and by it self. And a blind reliance on such a tool is unacademic and is subject to error. I suggest that the kind learned reviewers listed above view the article again and review the articles sited (which are not available electronically incidentally). The reviewers should consider contacting the appropriate cited sources and ask or the microfilm and review the artiles. <i>If such steps are not taken, and the suggestionn for deletion is based on the mere fact that the sources are only available in hardcopy, and Wikipedia.org removes the article based on those grounds, then Wikipedia.org falls short of its stated claims.</i> <b>Concerned Wikipidia reader.</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.197.230.69 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.197.230.69_f7ea.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.197.230.69">contribs</a>).</small>
