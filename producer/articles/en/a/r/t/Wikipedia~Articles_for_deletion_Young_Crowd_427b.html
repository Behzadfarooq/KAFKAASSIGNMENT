<p>A nice collection of articles about a teenage group, detailing their notable record company, and their platinum-selling single. Only problem is that none of it seems to hold up. All I can actually find on these people is a myspace page. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 17:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Corrections Made</b> I am in the process of trying to remove the KieArra 'Mizz Redz" Pretlow page. I have removed the incorrect information from the remaining two articles and I ask that you forgive me of my actions. I thought that <a href="../../../s/o/_/So_So_Def_Recordings_7fb7.html" title="So So Def Recordings">So So Def Recordings</a> housed Young Crowd but it turns out to be Kilah World Entertainment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was also notified that I was given non-official information pretaining to the "Da Starting 5" single.</p>
<p>Therefore I have made the corrections in order to keep these (2) pages/articles open.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Whether Kilah is deleted or not looks like it won't matter in the slightest. Please review the standards at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. An <u>upcoming</u> release on a label that has no other acts, and whose website is on a free site like cabspace.com, doesn't even remotely come close to those standards. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 18:42, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>After review of the rules, can the mention of the label remain in the articles of Young Crowd and Larry "LaPret" Pretlow II</b></p>
<p>I have read the presented regulations and I again ask to be forgiven. I fully understand that as far as certification goes KILAH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT cannot be proven to be a real label. Please note that it is a independent label located in D.C. they have severala acts who perform locally and also have local airplay of their singles in D.C.</p>
<p>I ask that these 2 articles not be deleted because they would really be of aid to both the careers of [Young Crowd]] and Larry "LaPret" Pretlow II. Both artist are preparing to sign professional recording deals and release professional singles. Just having an article on WIKIPEDIA regarding their carrers thus far would be a tremendous aspect of their Nation-Wide promotion. Thanks! Dontrell McBride - Writer 19:26, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, you don't seem to understand. KILAH is not the issue. There is, at this point, zero chance of any of these articles not being deleted. Wikipedia does not provide free webspace to help unknown performers gain exposure. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>We're not using Wikipedia for Exposure</b></p>
<p>You misundersdtood what I'm saying. Young Crowd is currently touring the USA promoting their mixtape release on local radio. They also are conducting performances and youth speeches. The mixtape will be a nation-wide release just like a Beyonce album. Young Crowd is just signed with an independent label. Each day that passes more and more people become familiar with Young Crowd and their music. It would only be fair to allow the Young Crowd and LaPret articles to be aprt of the Wikipedia these teenagers are doing something that has not been done and its worthy of being one of the millions of articles featured on this website.

<p>Another thing is that this page has been up for almost a month and today when I edit it all of a sudden it has to be deleted.</p>

<li>Go back and read <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> again. Does Young Crowd have at least two releases from a major label (already released, not coming)? Are they the subject of numerous articles in the press? There are thousands of bands who are going to release a CD and <b><u>hope</u></b> that it will be successful. Until they have actually achieved some level of attention, they do not qualify for an article here. (The fact that the article was there for a month before being noticed is irrelevant.) <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan-1967</a> 19:52, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete All</b> The Young Crowd article contains a claim to have an international release of a single, but offers no verification nor a basis for verification (no title for the single). If it has done a tour, the <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> standard is "Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country, reported in notable and verifiable sources." As no sources are used, this test is failed. As far as I can see, all of the tests in <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a> are failed. In fact, as no sources are used in any of the articles, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> is failed. The Young Crowd article is also signed, in violation of <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">WP:OWN</a>. The "Wikipedia should not be allowed" argument above demonstrates a lack of understanding of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> rules. These articles violate multiple rules withing that policy including 1) not a free host, blog, webspace provider or social networking site, 2) not a soapbox, 3) not a publisher of original thought. Given the username of the author, I also have <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">WP:VAIN</a> concerns, but upon seeing his signature I don't currently have any <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> concerns. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
