<li><b>Keep</b> speaking as a programmer, this company is both significant and relevant. found this one on a bay area blog and clicked thru to learn more. there are no other firms that have tackled ecommerce from a web 2.0 perspective, as the article states. this company is perhaps more notable than half the other companies in the website category.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There are an lot of new accounts voicing their opinions here and on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Robert_Pazornik_1dbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Robert Pazornik">related AfD</a>. Can I please remind you that AfD is not a vote, but rather a method of building consensus. Whilst the opinions of new users are very welcome, the admin who closes this AfD is not obliged to treat them all with the same weight. Personally I think the article Licketyship is more notable than the article on Robert Pazornik, especially as all relevant information from that article can be included in this one. So that'd be a <b>weak keep</b>, but it could still do with being verified/cleaned up. --<a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 16:12, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I should probably first qualify that while my account is new, I am not a new user, I have been contributing religiously by IP only for the past 3 years. I stumbled to the LicketyShip article while reading about other Web 2.0 companies, and I must say I'm mostly (though not entirely) befuddled as to why its up for deletion as NN. I have a feeling that most advocating delete don't really know much about web 2.0 and why it's important. The editor who made the comment about <a href="../../../g/r/o/Group_4_Securicor_09bd.html" title="Group 4 Securicor">Group 4 Securicor</a> and <a href="../../../d/h/l/DHL_53c6.html" title="DHL">DHL</a> is a perfect exemplar; those companies are about as similar to what Licketyship is doing as <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodak.html" title="Kodak">Kodak</a> is to <a href="../../../f/l/i/Flickr.html" title="Flickr">Flickr</a>. There is a substantial public interest in this company not only becuase it is part of a larger, more significant movement, but also becuase its doing something no other company has done (or tried to do) before - and it's entirely verifiable. If you do a bit more than a quick google, this company has been covered by Fortune, CNN, and NYT - and I found those in about 2 minutes worth of research. That said, this is my first AfD vote, and hopefully my last.--Bigbang21 22:37, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm admittedly new to editing. I read wikipedia a lot, but havent edited any pages. I searched for licketyship after reading the <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/nine-startups-at-e27-summit/" class="external text" title="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/01/28/nine-startups-at-e27-summit/" rel="nofollow">techcrunch blog</a>. I guess they're not a huge company, but they're apparently notable enough to be recognized by stanford's tech community. I'm not really sure what the standard is for deleting an entry (lack of notability?), but when I google them, I come up with all sorts of hits and articles. Does that not make them notable? Or is it something about what the company does that would make them notable? If its the former, I guess you could be objective by measuring how many pieces in the popular press mention them (which seems to be quite a few). If its the latter, then I guess its pretty subjective, and if you don't know much about the space the company is in, you might not be qualified to voice an opinion -- that's just my 2 cents. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.198.133.103 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__71.198.133.103_b869.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 71.198.133.103">contribs</a>) 06:33, 2 February 2006 (UTC)</small></li>
