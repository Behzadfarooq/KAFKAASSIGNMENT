<li><b>Comment</b>: Per badlydrawnjeff's comments below, I'd like to make clear that I am asserting all of the articles below also fail notability on their own terms, above and beyond the walled garden/spamvertisement problem. (I will provide details for any individual article upon request.) This is the entire problem of why walled gardens are bad for Wikipedia: It allows people to mistakenly fall into circular reasoning traps when it comes to AfDs (e.g. "Keep Candice E. Jackson, she's notable!" "For what?" "For writing <i>Their Lives</i>!" "But why is <i>Their Lives</i> notable?" Because it was written by Candice E. Jackson, and she's got an article!"). (Please note I'm not accusing badlydrawnjeff of circular reasoning; I consider his vote 100% legit. It was just his comments that led me to think I didn't make a clear enough nominating statement.) --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 16:17, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>That's fine, and I want to assert that I didn't think your comments were directed at me before I read your last note. I do think many (most?) of these meet our standards, but <i>some</i> do not. Just like I wouldn't want to see the obvious ones (<i>These Lives</i>, <i>Help! Mom!</i>) deleted because some of the minor ones might not meet it, the minor ones shouldn't just be kept because of the high notability of two of them. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:30, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep all</b> for now. The publisher is certainly notable, due to the books on this list - specifically "Help, Mom!" and "The Paypal Wars."

<li>To expand a bit, "Help, Mom!," "The Paypal Wars" and "These Lives" have all recieved noteworthy independent media coverage. Their authors, therefore, would also be worthy.

<li>The Stanford Review is the second most-often published student publication from the Stanford Undergraduate Student Body. There are Wikipedia pages for the Dartmouth Review, the Cal Patriot, The Harvard Salient, and other such publications that are produced by undergraduates around the country just like The Review. None of them should be marked for deletion, and neither should the Review. And as for me being an SPA, I'm sorry but I am a new member of the group and as a college student don't currently have time to edit a lot of articles. I plan to do so in the future.

<li><b>Keep all</b>. The publisher is notable both for its books and for the fact it is the publisher of <a href="../../../w/o/r/WorldNetDaily_c1c3.html" title="WorldNetDaily">WND Books</a>; it is therefore a significant company in an important part of the publishing industry. The books themselves are notable titles about important social and political issues, and they have all been highly visible in the media and the marketplace. The indvidual Wiki articles are extensively referenced using multiple independent media sources -- including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, NewsMax, US News &amp; World Report, Forbes, Washington Post, etc. If highly visible books about controversial topics do not belong on Wikipedia, it raises the disconcerting question as to whether we need to start deleting Wiki entries for books like <a href="../../../k/i/n/King_%26_King_bdc4.html" title="King &amp; King">King &amp; King</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Rainbow_Fish_ddca.html" title="Rainbow Fish">Rainbow Fish</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/w/Bush%27s_Brain%7E_How_Karl_Rove_Made_George_W._Bush_Presidential_2844.html" title="Bush's Brain: How Karl Rove Made George W.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) One look at my user page should be enough evidence that political motivations had nothing to do with my nominations. I nominated them because they're a <a href="../../../w/a/l/WP%7EWALL_5398.html" title="WP:WALL">Walled garden</a> of <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">vanispamcruft</a>. 2) At least half of the "extensive references" in these articles were added by - surprise! - <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkey2020_76fa.html" title="User:Turkey2020">Turkey2020</a> in the last 48 hours, after my nomination <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Turkey2020" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Turkey2020" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, and most of the rest, which were unpersuasive, were added by him earlier because, well: 3) Turkey2020 is an <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a>. Except for his very first edit - a keep vote on a long-settled AfD - he has never made a single edit to Wikipedia that isn't to one of the articles that are the subject of this AfD. 4) His "deleting X means we must also delete Y" argument is, of course, fallacious and is listed as a classic "argument to avoid" at <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT/"What about article X?"</a>. 5) I will <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">AGF</a> and simply note that his comment about WND Books is misleading; the publisher has signed some sort of deal to take over that imprint in 2007, but as for now it's part of another company.

<li><b>Comment</b>: 1) Aaron seems to imply that entries he nominates for deletion shouldn't have references or additional information added in an attempt to improve them. 2) When it is pointed out that the articles he wants to delete have long lists of sources (including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, NewsMax, US News &amp; World Report, Forbes, Washington Post, etc. etc.) which contradict his non-notable claim, Aaron does not defend his original hypothesis but instead dismissively uses "extensive references" in quotes as if that means the references can therefore be ignored. 3) Aaron calls into question the credibility of who makes edits but not the edits themselves. 4) Aaron ignores valid attempts at benchmarking other articles. 5) Aaron claims my point about WND Books is "misleading" for some reason because the books do not hit store shelves for a couple of months; such reasoning is convoluted, and the fact that the publisher won the contract <i>ipso facto</i> further contradicts Aaron's claim of non-notability. Conclusion: None of the points Aaron makes demonstrate the claim on non-notability; this claim is contradicted by numerous verifiable references to independent media sources. --<a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurkey2020_76fa.html" title="User:Turkey2020">Turkey2020</a> 00:02, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Other than one point, I will let Turkey2020's actions, edit record and statements speak for themselves: The generally accepted standard for good faith editing of articles in AfD is to simply make the edits and then come to the AfD and post a note to the effect of, "I've made an attempt to improve this article/these articles, and I'd appreciate it if you'd take a look at them now and see if they're any better before making a vote. Thanks." (Or, alternatively, to do the reverse: Post that you intend to edit and then carry out those edits and come back to let the AfD participants know that you're done.) Instead, T2020 made the edits quietly and then came in here to post a "keep all" vote using his comments to imply that all the articles were <i>already</i> in the state they're in now (not that his changes have done anything to address the concerns I raised in the nomination; IMHO some of them have been made worse), and that my nom was thus making fraudulent claims. Are those the actions of a good faith editor? You make the call. --<a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 00:40, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also I am agnostic on the question of the Stanford Review, which is after all a legit publication. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.51.9.65 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.51.9.65_8b98.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.51.9.65">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> but at some conditions like more developpement to the entry and adding the neutrality of this article is disputed and I'm agree with Turkey2020 on one point, if we have an entry about <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bush%27s_Brain_9b3d.html" title="Bush's Brain">Bush's Brain</a>, why not for <a href="../../../h/e/l/Help%21_Mom%21_There_are_Liberals_Under_my_Bed_1aba.html" title="Help! Mom! There are Liberals Under my Bed">Help! Mom! There are Liberals Under my Bed</a>? And to my eyes, this book critic more the current "Social liberals" then the "classic liberals" or "economic liberals" or libertarians. --Sd-100 October 5 2006, 19:25 Eastern time zone</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> as regards World Ahead Publishing, I suggest that <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> should provide a pretty good basis for a decision. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenshed_5a67.html" title="User:Greenshed">Greenshed</a> 21:06, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> all except Paypal Wars (and by extension Eric Jackson) per 68.51.9.65, as EJ/PP Wars appears to satisfy <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Although contemplated keep on Thank you President Bush due to its lineup of contributors, its appears to be purely destined for partisan causes and almost certainly Vanity for Dubya. Its very low Amazon rank (in the 494 thousandsths) is telling me this is obviously a red card. The political parties are skilled at setting up front organisations to channel campaign finance, and it appears it would come as no surprise that they are all helping each other here to get their causes noticed. For Stanford Review, I vote <b>mergeto <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a></b> unless/until its notability independent of the University can be proven. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:56, 7 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
