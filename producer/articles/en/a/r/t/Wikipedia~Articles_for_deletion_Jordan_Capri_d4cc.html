<p>How is this encyclopedia-worthy? There's plenty of porn directories on the net, Wikipedia doesn't need to be one. Also, listing her real name, residence, employer, and link to her blog seems like a great way to get this girl fired, harassed by stalkers or anti-porn zealots, etc. Her blog says she is unhappy with the extent of exposure she got. So she had a youthful lapse in judgement, one that she'll have following her for years. Wikipedia doesn't need to play a role in that. There's nothing of scholarly value in this page, and it seems unethical in the extreme to list some of this information in this context. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Murple" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Murple" rel="nofollow">-Murple</a></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but perhaps remove some of the personal information. She is one of the most widely recognized names in Internet pornography (she claims to have been "the second most popular softcore ameture gal on the internet").

<dd><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm pretty critical of notability, but Jordan Capri was at one time, and may still be for all I know, one of the most popular softcore models on the internet. Any judgement of her notoriety aside, that still is a pretty strong case for notability. As for is this encyclopedia worthy, I'd say yes in the context of Wikipedia. Look around... there are articles on <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jenna_Jameson_fd39.html" title="Jenna Jameson">Jenna Jameson</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a>, and <a href="../../../g/g/_/GG_Allin_ce18.html" title="GG Allin">GG Allin</a>. This isn't the <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Britannica</a>. As for the content of the article, Ms. <s>real name</s> has stated all these things in her blog. It's not like she is trying to hide the information or her identity. If this article posted her home address, phone number, or some other personal information that she herself had not posted on her public blog, I'd agree with you, but in light of the facts, there is no reason to delete this other than a distaste for the subject matter, which in my opinion is not merit enough for deletion.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 02:13, 21 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I am <s>real name</s> Jordan Capri. I have been having issues recently with "fans" coming into my work. Just this past Monday someone came in asking for my autograph &amp; said he found me on THIS site. First of all, on my MySpace page, I never gave my last name away nor the engraving shop's name, because I did not want people to find out my real name. This is a serious issue; I could have potential salkers, rapists, ect. now!! What if some crazed fan comes in, waits for me to leave late at night, then follows me home!? Since I found this thing I've been scared to death! Please delete it for the sake of my safety not to mention potentionally being fired from my jobs from the flood of phone calls/visits I've been receiving there.

<dd>The problem many will not. I did a random sampling from the porn stars category and plenty have the real names. The thing is the Internet is a stalker/rapists friend; to be a public figure in this information age is to fight a losing battle for privacy. I did a basic search on Google for "Jordan Capri" and her real name and came up empty for the first fifty pages, which impressed me.

<dd><s>Is it possible to scrub out her real name and personal info from the change history and from this AfD? If it is feasible then this might not be a bad idea. I'm not a big fan of censorship, but I can also see the point of view where she would not want her personal info splashed all over wikipedia. Of course with a page history the damage has already been done unless someone can scrub it out... The article itself should be kept as it has value in the context of other articles pertaining to the same subject matter, but in the interest of simple decency it might be a good idea to remove all reference to her real name, employment and the link to her blog from the history. Of course the article would almost have to be locked to prevent someone else from coming here and posting the info back on, but since she is apparently out of the industry, what more is there to say?</s> nevermind... just looked at the article and it is possible.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 14:15, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I vote strongly for deleting this article and similar ones... but if it must be kept, how's this for a compromise. Delete the article so the history disappears and the girl doesn't have to live in fear of some Wikipedia stalker tracking her down, and create a new one that only has the "relevant" information and not her personal information. It seems to me that if anything bad happened to this girl as a result of her info being listed here, Wikipedia would be potentially legally liable. As far as the excuse "well its in her blog"... her blog isn't being advertised with her Jordan Capri name, so it's not making the link between her identities that this Wikipedia entry did.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per previous VfD, with personal info removed per Vizjim. Her real name does not need to be part of this article, and was not related to her modeling notability.
