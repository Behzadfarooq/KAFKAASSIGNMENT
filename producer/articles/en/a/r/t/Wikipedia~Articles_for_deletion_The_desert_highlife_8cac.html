<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><b>Don't Delete</b>, ok first off. StarryEyes.. his acne has nothing to do with the deletion of this article. Gazpacho, they are in the 10th grade and are already in the news paper and are popular all throughout Northern Virginia, such as of course King George, Fredericksburg, Westmoreland, Caroline, Spotsovania, and many other counties surrounding Fredericksburg. They have played at many different places such as The Big One V (won Player's Choice), The Loft, and Pickers Supply in downtown Fredericksburg. Holderca1, its pretty notable especially since 2 or 3 of those google hits are popular area Newspapers. The minister of war, he could creme you at bass anyday and how does that have to deal with deletion?? Not quite sure what nn means? not notable??. Come visit Fredericksburg and King George and ask any middle/highschool kid and most any young (20 - mid 30's) adults and they could name The Desert Highlife for you most likely. I didnt get to put much time into the article yet, considering the first attempt i made was cut off and placed with this stupid deletion thing. They also have a demo coming out in a few weeks/months. They have played with bands such as 816 and St. Diablo (who have few albums out already and played with The Desert Highlife). Most of these Delete posts are rubish (especially StarryEyes's post)<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucid._4aa0.html" title="User:Lucid.">Lucid</a> 19:50, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font>

<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><b>Comment</b>. Review the section of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> on what makes a band notable. This band meets none of those requirments(If I am wrong on this, mention which one of the seven they have accomplished). Also, not sure what you searched for under Google. But none of the hits on my search were newspapers. --<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolderca1_0bcb.html" title="User:Holderca1">Holderca1</a> 20:37, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font></li>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><b>Comment Answered</b>. Try searching google for "the desert highlife free lance star" its about the 2nd one down. from there you can find a link to the freelancestar.com site, or if you wish, you can look through the other pages of results. Possibly number 6. Thats the mood of Fredericksburg and surrounding cities. Its pretty much an opinon thing but since you dont live their you cant possibly have an opinion. also it says on the page "Please note that the failure to meet any of these criteria does not mean an article must be deleted; conversely, the meeting of any of these criteria does not mean that an article must be kept. These are merely rules of thumb which some editors choose to keep in mind when deciding whether or not to keep an article that is on articles for deletion.". So even if they dont classify they still dont need to be deleted. they are rising band with a good future. even a demo soon. why not give them a page?</font>
<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><b>Answer to comment answered</b>: Because millions of bands claim to be rising bands with good futures and end up nowhere. I wish them all the best but until they make an actual record on an actual label they are not notable. I do apologize for the "Clearasil" remark, it wasn't meant as a personal attack, it was just good-natured jest. Also, Lucid, in the future, please note that new votes in AFD go at the bottom, not at the top. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarryEyes_74d0.html" title="User:StarryEyes">StarryEyes</a> 21:03, 24 October 2005 (UTC)</font></li>

<li><font color="#7FFFD4">Yeah, but then it pulls up webpages from the Sahara desert to Miller Highlife.

<ul>
<li><font color="#7FFFD4">Whats wrong with a high school student? it was published by a newspaper. Obviously it was edited and reviewed by the Free Lance Star to see if it was suitable or just plain bogus. Plus the student is from Brooke Point High School, a high school that none of the band members have ever visited or seen. On the 816 website it even says The Desert Highlife, player's choice meaning that out of all the bands, they were voted for the award.<a href="../../../l/u/c/User%7ELucid._4aa0.html" title="User:Lucid.">Lucid</a> 19:57, 25 October 2005 (UTC)</font></li>

<li><font color="#7FFFD4"><b>Delete</b>, but gently. I admire their enthusiasm, and the fact that one of them was in the "Ultra Super Zombie Lords", which is a great name. Shame their website doesn't have any music on it. I have played the bass guitar, and I believe it is easily possible to be a 15-year-old veteran of the instrument. It only has four strings, after all. The article and the website remind me of Bryan Adams' "Summer of 69". the band will split up, they will get jobs, and eventually their instruments will end up in the attic or on eBay.
