<li><b>Delete</b> It's really a shame to delete this; we really need to establish a WikiMemorial or WikiObituaries. We should warn the author so he/she doesn't lose the text if we do delete this. I don't like doing this, but it's just not encyclopedic.<a href="../../../z/a/n/User%7EZantastik_9813.html" title="User:Zantastik">Zantastik</a> 07:21, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - we have terrible double standards here. Why do we have an article on <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Angleton_b9df.html" title="Doris Angleton">Doris Angleton</a>, a murdered socialite? is a socialite encyclopedic, but a telecommunications professional not? Why do we have an article on <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bergsten_6e2e.html" title="Jessica Bergsten">Jessica Bergsten</a> and <a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassie_Bernall_7534.html" title="Cassie Bernall">Cassie Bernall</a> instead of only an article on their murderers? Why is <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlie_Brucia_f6a8.html" title="Carlie Brucia">Carlie Brucia</a>'s murder encyclopedic, but McKeown's death not? Why is <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Donald_7d8b.html" title="Kris Donald">Kris Donald</a>'s murder anymore note-worthy than McKeown's death? Are the following deaths significant enough to deem a devoted article? <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristen_French_305f.html" title="Kristen French">Kristen French</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberly_Anne_Guglielmo_5c9f.html" title="Kimberly Anne Guglielmo">Kimberly Anne Guglielmo</a>, <a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Homolka_bad6.html" title="Tammy Homolka">Tammy Homolka</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Howe_%28murder_victim%29_365f.html" title="Brian Howe (murder victim)">Brian Howe (murder victim)</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Jessop_49e3.html" title="Christine Jessop">Christine Jessop</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Jones_1668.html" title="Holly Jones">Holly Jones</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Mahaffy_e557.html" title="Leslie Mahaffy">Leslie Mahaffy</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/i/Gail_Miller_7844.html" title="Gail Miller">Gail Miller</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Osborne_69e5.html" title="Betty Osborne">Betty Osborne</a>, <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alison_Parrott_5f60.html" title="Alison Parrott">Alison Parrott</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reena_Virk_852d.html" title="Reena Virk">Reena Virk</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/l/Lili_Wang_7694.html" title="Lili Wang">Lili Wang</a> and <a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecilia_Zhang_62b8.html" title="Cecilia Zhang">Cecilia Zhang</a>.

<li>The quick answer would be that we have those articles because they haven't been nominated for VfD. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 10:16, 4 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've gone through and had a quick read of all the articles you link to. I'll put a brief summary of my thoughts on each one below. Before I do that, I should say that I think that beign murdered is <i>slilghtly</i> more notable than being killed in a train crash, but not sufficent to merit inclusion in WP on its own, however if the murder is notable this can make the victim notable (for being notably murdered). Whether this is a view shared by others I have no idea. If others want to use my comments in any future VfDs on these articles you may do.
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Angleton_b9df.html" title="Doris Angleton">Doris Angleton</a> (created <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_28.html" title="August 28">28 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, marked for cleanup since <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_8.html" title="December 8">8 December</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>): Doesn't seem notable to me, although if it is cleaned up notability may be established. 90% of the edits have been by <a href="../../../w/h/i/User%7EWhisperToMe_201b.html" title="User:WhisperToMe">User:WhisperToMe</a>, who created the article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/r/Carlie_Brucia_f6a8.html" title="Carlie Brucia">Carlie Brucia</a> (created <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_4.html" title="February 4">4 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>). This apparently generated a lot of US-nationwide media attention at the time, which would establish enough notability for me. The <a href="../../../c/a/r/Talk%7ECarlie_Brucia_246b.html" title="Talk:Carlie Brucia">talk</a> page shows it was subjected to a VfD from <a href="../../../f/e/b/February_8.html" title="February 8">8 February</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>, the consensus of which was to keep that article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bergsten_6e2e.html" title="Jessica Bergsten">Jessica Bergsten</a> was murdered by "famous skateboarder <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Rogowski_2d96.html" title="Mark Rogowski">Mark Rogowski</a>". Because of his fame (his article firmly establishes that) and the fact she was prominently featured in a DVD about his rise and fall (see her article) I feel she merits an article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/a/s/Cassie_Bernall_7534.html" title="Cassie Bernall">Cassie Bernall</a> was a <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_massacre_3e4b.html" title="Columbine High School massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a> victim. Of the 15 victims of that tragedy, 6 have articles. Of those 6, 4 are subject to current VfDs (all started by User:UncleG on <a href="../../../1/s/t/1st_February_2030.html" title="1st February">1st February</a>, the current consensus seems to be to make them redircts to the massacre article. The only other one who is not subject to a VfD is <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Scott_89ed.html" title="Rachel Scott">Rachel Scott</a>, this seems to be because her parents have written very extensively about her and the massacre. Were Cassie's article to be subject to a VfD I wouldn't vote.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kris_Donald_7d8b.html" title="Kris Donald">Kris Donald</a> (a white person murdered by "British Asians of Pakistani Muslim origin"): reading the article this seems to have been quite an issue, with the case being cited by far right wing groups and contrasted to the <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Lawrence_8350.html" title="Stephen Lawrence">Stephen Lawrence</a> murder. I'd vote to keep this article.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristen_French_305f.html" title="Kristen French">Kristen French</a>: Doesn't strike me as notable at all. I will be marking this for VfD when I have finished commenting here.</li>
<li><a href="../../../k/i/m/Kimberly_Anne_Guglielmo_5c9f.html" title="Kimberly Anne Guglielmo">Kimberly Anne Guglielmo</a>: "The murder of Kimberly Anne Guglielmo which at first received sensational print and elecronic media coverage in <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_3da4.html" title="New York">New York</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/o/Florida.html" title="Florida">Florida</a>, was eventually dropped as attention of the public was diverted to the trial of <a href="../../../o/2E/_/O._J._Simpson_aee1.html" title="O. J. Simpson">O. J. Simpson</a> and the arrest of <a href="../../../t/i/m/Timothy_McVeigh_0621.html" title="Timothy McVeigh">Timothy McVeigh</a>". Reading this extensive article, it seems notable enough to me.</li>
<li><a href="../../../t/a/m/Tammy_Homolka_bad6.html" title="Tammy Homolka">Tammy Homolka</a>: Murdered by her sister, serial killer <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karla_Homolka_58d9.html" title="Karla Homolka">Karla Homolka</a>. Whether she is notable or not is a pretty difficult decision. There is not much more in this article than what is said about her in her sister's article. I'm not nominating this for VfD myself, but if someone else did I'd probably vote <i>weak delete</i>.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Howe_%28murder_victim%29_365f.html" title="Brian Howe (murder victim)">Brian Howe (murder victim)</a> was killed by the extremely notorious <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mary_Bell_9c38.html" title="Mary Bell">Mary Bell</a>. The article says absolutely nothing however (when you remove the cleanup and stub notices your left with his date of death and date of burrial. I will also be nominating this for deletion.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/h/r/Christine_Jessop_49e3.html" title="Christine Jessop">Christine Jessop</a> This doesn't establish notability at all - I'll mark it for VfD.</li>
<li><a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Jones_1668.html" title="Holly Jones">Holly Jones</a>. This is more difficult to decide on, if the murder happened in Britain it would almost certainly have caused a lot of media attention, especially as the tabloids would haev a field day with the comments about <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_pornography.html" title="Child pornography">Child pornography</a>. Can anyone from the <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> area (or <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canada.html" title="Canada">Canada</a> in general) say whether this happened or not? I wont mark this for VfD, but I have put a note on the talk page.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/e/s/Leslie_Mahaffy_e557.html" title="Leslie Mahaffy">Leslie Mahaffy</a>. Again this doesn't seem notable to me, another VfD I think.</li>
<li><a href="../../../g/a/i/Gail_Miller_7844.html" title="Gail Miller">Gail Miller</a>. Notable enough (but only just) imho.</li>
<li><a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Osborne_69e5.html" title="Betty Osborne">Betty Osborne</a>. This seems to be locally important, whehter this is enough I will let others decide.</li>
<li><a href="../../../r/e/e/Reena_Virk_852d.html" title="Reena Virk">Reena Virk</a>. Notable enough for me.</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/i/l/Lili_Wang_7694.html" title="Lili Wang">Lili Wang</a>. Just notable enough imho, but only just.</li>
<li><a href="../../../c/e/c/Cecilia_Zhang_62b8.html" title="Cecilia Zhang">Cecilia Zhang</a> her dissapearance made "Canadian and international headlines.". This statement in itself make the article worth keeping imho.</li>
