<p><b>Delete</b>, not notable enough. The cited sources used to back up all claims consist largely out of tiny newspaper snippets that are blown up out of proportion. He was never on TV, he only worked on projects that never aired. The notability of that title "International Magician of the Year" is heavily questioned: The award organisaton seems to not even have a website, and a search for the title leads to only 123 hits (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22International+Magician+of+the+Year%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22International+Magician+of+the+Year%22&amp;hl=de&amp;lr=&amp;start=130&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>). So when one removes all that promotional hoopla, his notability has to be rated on this bottom line: Aladin performs rarely, is portrayed in 1 book, and works for the City of London. I strongly believe that those elements don't suffice that an individual be included in the wikipedia. Additionaly, the article sounds very much like blunt euphoric advertising, written by the person himself to jumpstart his career and business by taking advantage of the popularity of the wikipedia project. <b>To any admin deciding the vote</b>: I'd like to order a full sockpuppet and meatpuppet check on all people that have voted here, with an article of such a bad quality, all those "keep" votes cannot possible be the thruthful opinion of the well-educated general wikipedia public.

<li>It is not at all normal to do an IP check over an AfD unless there is substantial evidence of sockpuppetry -- more than just votes that favor what some think is a poor article. many of the keep voters have long contribution histories, have made hundreds or thosands of edits, on many different subjects. I don't see any plausibel evidence of sockpuppetry or meatpuppetry here, overall. Of couse legit editoes can have unwise opnions for a time, and IMO User:Peter S's substantive points should be substantively answered, but arging about socks is not the way to prevail in this debate, I think. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 05:17, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> (considering all those "keep" votes): Whoa whoa whoa people.... I think you need to slow down and take a look at this before you vote... The article as written makes it seem like he is notable, but it's written like a brochure for self-promotional purposes. For example, the extensive quote cited to Inside Magic is deceptive, as that quote was printed in Inside Magic, but it was quoting a student newspaper ("The Oxford Student has an incredibly positive piece about a young magician") -- the most important bit from that piece is that the editor of Inside Magic calls aladin <b>"a magician I have never heard about."</b> Furhtermore, he questions the student newspaper's claim that he left some society because it wouldn;t admit women as he knows a number of women in the society. This looks like a majorly deceptive bit of advertising by someone trying to give himself credential he doesn;t have. DON'T JUST VOTE KEEP claiming that he's notable without EVIDENCE that he is notable. He fails the Google test, and quite badly. The writer of this article created deceptive references, and sockpuppets have already been suggested. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 22:04, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well said, DreamGuy, thanks. Other misleading credentials include the link "NBC Today Show featuring aladin's Book of Cool", but "aladin" was never mentioned on the Today Show, just this book with 25+ different people in it.

<li>Englishrose, the organisation behind "International Magician of The year" doesn't even have a website, how notable can this award be? There are thousands of such smallish awards with grandiose names. Bottom line is, Aladin performs rarely, is portrayed in 1 book, and works for the London gov, so I really really can't see how he's notable. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 22:59, 2 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I echo the comments above. <b>Very noteworthy</b> and <b>VERY</b> well substantiated. In fact the article is possibly one of the most heavily annotated in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_magicians.html" title="List of magicians">List of magicians</a> and so interesting that I have been itching to add to it as it needs to include his 'other lives' in greater detail - all of the latter easy to find through search engines and other websites. Might well be a candidate for starred article? And I must agree with EnglishRose - Peter S seems to be pursuing aladin for a reason which one cannot fathom.

<li>A little google reveals <a href="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/SeriesSchedule.asp?Seriesid=385" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ngcasia.com/watch/SeriesSchedule.asp?Seriesid=385" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, a National Geographic website that refers to aladin as a magician and management consultant. They may be taking him at face value. He certainly seems to be devoted to self-puffery. All the same, I should think that that any major falsification would have ruled out that particular TV show. NG has been caught in bad fact-checking in the past (the Chinese fossil that turned out to be faked) but they come clean about it and they aren't generally known for being a dodgy source. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 23:28, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Zora, that's a program about refugees, he was portrayed as a refugee. The article claims "He performs from bombay to las vegas and has appeared on National Geographic", which is clearly a misleading statement. As I said before, once you cut through all the promo language, you end up with a boring person that doesn't warrant an entry in the wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeter_S._9efb.html" title="User:Peter S.">Peter S.</a> 23:35, 2 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>This article has distinct verifiability problems, not least because most, possibly <i>all</i>, of Aladin's self-publicity seems to be either exaggeration or outright fiction. Last year we had Alkhemi (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Alkhemi_214b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alkhemi">AfD discussion</a>), which was as far as could be determined a fictional company created by this person, published on his web site, and mentioned wherever his autobiography is quoted, and for which no independent evidence of existence could be found. (It's possible that it is a one-man consultancy company that exists solely on paper, for tax purposes.) But that is far from the only apparent work of fiction in this person's publicity, it transpires.
<p>Mentioned above is the fact that <i>Inside Magic</i> is using <i>The Oxford Student</i> as its source for an article on "a magician I have never heard about". However, it seems that <i>the only source for that article is Aladin himself</i>. On Aladin's web site we have a quote from the article, describing it as a "3-page feature", published on <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>-<a href="../../../f/e/b/February_19.html" title="February 19">02-19</a> by Tamara Cohen. However, going to <a href="http://oxfordstudent.com./ht2004wk5/features" class="external text" title="http://oxfordstudent.com./ht2004wk5/features" rel="nofollow">the archives for that issue of The Oxford Student</a> (Volume 37 issue 6) I find <i>no such article</i>.</p>
<p>True, Aladin was a "subject of a documentary on <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_abe5.html" title="National Geographic">National Geographic</a>". But that was as a refugee, not as a magician. True, there is a <i>Book of Cool</i> (It's actually a set of DVDs.). But it isn't by Aladin. True, Aladin was a "government adviser". He was the vice-chairman of the Mayor of London's Cultural Strategy Group. And the article in the Times is inaccessible without a subscription fee, but given that it begins "Alaudin Ahmed used to use his sleight of hand to broker million-dollar deals." and is an interview with this person I am highly skeptical of its accuracy.</p>
<p>The key to notability here is being the subject of multiple non-trivial published works from independent sources (e.g. magazine feature articles, books, and so forth). But upon investigation the whole thing turns out to be either built on sand or unverifiable. The <i>Inside Magic</i> article cites as its source an article in <i>The Oxford Student</i> that doesn't exist. I am unable to verify the purported 1999 coverage in <i>The Hindustan Times</i>, because its archive doesn't go back that far. The only person who appears to have even heard of the "Golden Turban Award from the Magic Academy of Bangalore" (or, indeed, the Magic Academy of Bangalore itself) is Aladin himself. The <i>Daily Star</i> archives don't go back to 1999, either.</p>
<p>Strip away everything about this person that isn't verifiable, and one is left with someone who <i>only</i> satisfies the WP:BIO criteria because of the National Geographic documentary. <b>Weak Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 05:49, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> This Article is Misleading and Inaccurate. In order to judge the accuracy of this article, one would need expertise in the subject, right? Well, I may not be able to judge the accuracy of the scientific articles on wikipedia, but I have performed Sleight of Hand for over 30 years and have never heard of this individual. Additionally, the original article listed Sleight of Hand Artists that I not only *know*, but several of them have given me endorsements for promotional material. I've even gone to the trouble of contacting some of the most knowledgable Sleight of Hand people in the world and none of THEM have heard of this fellow. This leads me to believe the article was posted for purely promotional reasons. Keeping the article would lead people to believe that this indiviudal is one of the top Sleight of Hand Artists/Magicians in the world and this is simply not the case. Darwin Ortiz, Jon Racherbaumer, John Bannon, Paul Curry, Ed Marlo, Dai Vernon, John Scarne, Jean Hugard, Fred Braue, Larry Jennings, and about 100 others are the ones you want articles on, not this fellow.

<li><b>Comment</b> I have managed to track down two of the articles.
<dl>
<dd>The Asian Age of 9 January 1999: aladin has the top right quarter of the 'People' page on page 21 in a four column article entitled 'Man with the magic lamp' which also has a photograph of him across two and a half of the columns; written by Abhik Sen:</dd>
<dd><i>To mobilise support for the homeless, to walk some of London's roughest neighbourhoods in the middle of the night and charm street gangs off their crimes, to help the UK government as a Cabinet-level adviser on youth and community projects, to coordinate and synthesise the work of South Asian musicians and artistes in Britain, and to do all of it at the same time, one would have to be a magician. That's precisely what aladin is, among, it has to be added, many other things.</i></dd>
<dd>Indiaweekly of Friday September 10 - Thursday September 16 1999: aladin has practically the whole of page 25 in the 'Entertainment' section in an article entitled 'Master of Magic'; 3 of 4 columns to be exact, including a photograph stretching the width of the article, which is written by George Simpson. aladin was interviewed at the Institute for Contemporary Arts where he was appearing:</dd>
<dd><i>aladin, amongst many other things, is a magician, live artist and producer/director. Born in Washington DC to Indian and Bangladeshi parents, aladin (his real name) was brought up everywhere, speaks English, French and Bengali, has worked with street gangs and been an academic, journal editor and government advisor. And this is just a small sample of the man’s achievements.</i></dd>
<dd>Both articles cast him as a Renaissance Man and so have some fascinating background which I am going to include in the Wiki page. The quotations on aladin’s own website match up to the sources incidentally <a href="../../../a/u/t/User%7EAutumnleaf_9e32.html" title="User:Autumnleaf">Autumnleaf</a> 01:03, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Peter, I understand that you're suspicious. Since I too believe that aladin has been editing his page with sockpuppets, I can understand that you'd look askance at any editor you didn't know. Well, Autumnleaf has been editing Indian cinema articles for a while now and she seems quite level-headed. I don't agree with her on this issue -- I think she has too much faith in journalists! -- but I don't think she'd lie. I'm not the best judge of people in the world, but I've certainly had no reason to distrust Autumnleaf. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 21:00, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Let's say he had 2 Dozen Articles about him in magazines and newspapers. That's enough to make him worthy of an article in a reference source? If so, there are at least 10,000 more amateur magicians waiting to use wikipedia as their personal promotional tool. Anyone with a modicum of talent and enough money to hire a press agent could easily get more press than that. Has he published any work in any of the trade journals? What are his contributions to the art? Has he lectured for the International Brotherhood of Magicians? How about the Society of American Magicians? How about for The Magic Circle? Has he even played the Magic Castle? WHAT?!? Tell me something he's done besides generate a few articles!!! And then tell me why those achievements make him high enough on the ladder to earn his own article in what is supposed to be a serious and accurate reference source.

Go search your 1400 newpapers and find out how much press Karl Fulves has, yet he is a prolific author on card magic. How about Charlie Miller?

<li>I understand your position now. Expertise in a subject is defined by how much you've participated in Wikipedia and how well you can use google. Brilliant. Now THAT'S how you build a reliable reference source. By the way, Karl Fulves has written more than a dozen books on magic and produced three of the most influential periodicals in magic-- The Pallbearers Review, Epilogue and The Chronicles. But you didn't find that from searching newspapers online, did you? Probably because the only people that care about that would be people who are knowledable about the subject at hand. See my point?

<li>We are not <i>building a reliable reference source</i> with your input since you have made no material contribution to the project besides this AfD.

<li>It's not useful for anyone doing serious research on historical/professional magicians to come across articles about amateur magicians because they have been linkfarmed into valid magic articles. That "aladin" would appear on a list among the likes of Houdini, Copperfield or even David Blane is utterly ridiculous.

<li><b>Comment</b> -- on all of the above.
<dl>
<dd>I've managed a look at the Times article (being coy, lest the copyright police swoop) and it does state as fact a number of the items that we can't substantiate with google. But I *still don't believe it*. Sorry. The only thing that the writer of that article knew for certain was that aladin was a youth-worker. All the rest of it seems to be repeating claims that aladin made to the writer. But if he had put on a magic show in India that had a cast of 800 magicians and was watched by a billion people (one sixth of the population of the planet, right?), surely there would be some record of it in google? Is there <i>any</i> TV show on record with a demonstrated viewership of one billion? Is there <i>any</i> Magic Academy of Bangalore?</dd>
<dd>Googling furiously, I found the following curious note in ExpressIndia:
<dl>
<dd>Muthukad, who is popularly known as India’s Houdini, also runs the Gopinath Muthukad Magic Academy in Thiruvananthapuram, the first of its kind in Asia. "Magic with a mission" is the slogan of his institution. <a href="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=104609" class="external autonumber" title="http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=104609" rel="nofollow">[5]</a></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>If the Magic Academy of Bangalore is so famous that a billion people watched the show it sponsored, how is it that ExpressIndia doesn't know that there is another magic academy in India?</dd>
<dd>Plus, I can't replicate much of anything in the article on aladin's supposed father, <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a>. Certainly nothing that proves that he <i>is</i> aladin's father, or that various details given in the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a> article are true. There are details that could have only been supplied by a fabulist -- or possibly a family member who edits from sockpuppet accounts, and may be prone to exaggeration.</dd>
<dd>I was originally trusting, but the more research I do, the more alarm bells go off. I know that it's upsetting for people to admit that they've been conned, but aladin seems like a con. A con who edits vanity articles from sockpuppet accounts. Possibly a notable con, but con nonetheless. I don't think it makes any sense to trust a conman just because he's South Asian, or argue that it's prejudice to distrust him. We're all human, and human includes grandiosity. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 06:27, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Have you spoken to the reporter who wrote the story? Have you contacted the Times?

<li>JJay, the only thing in that article that the reporter said that she personally witnessed was aladin interacting with some youths in a slum. I believe that she witnessed that. It's possible, and I have no reason to think that she would lie about what she had SEEN. (Of course, journos have done that -- does the name Jayson Blair ring a bell? -- but I see no motive here.) However, given that she reports as fact extremely dubious material that she can only have gotten from her interviewee, I think she's too darn trusting. Gullible. Journos can be. A friend of mine who was a magazine reporter wrote a long crusading article about a man who had a land claim against the state of Hawai'i, a claim based on supposed Hawaiian historical facts. I trusted the friend until I spent hours in the archives trying to chase down the "facts". I found that my friend had believed the claimant without checking anything, and that the claimant had been b!llsh!tting him. JJay, your faith in journos is misplaced. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 20:04, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thanks Zora, for your search into the matter. I just want to comment on the <a href="../../../a/b/u/Abul_Fateh_554d.html" title="Abul Fateh">Abul Fateh</a> article, that his role in <a href="../../../b/a/n/Bangladesh_Liberation_War_b476.html" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">Bangladesh Liberation War</a> is <a href="http://www.newagebd.com/2005/feb/18/feb18/xtra_also3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newagebd.com/2005/feb/18/feb18/xtra_also3.html" rel="nofollow">verifiable</a> and he <a href="http://www.mofa.gov.bd/foreign_secretary.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.mofa.gov.bd/foreign_secretary.htm" rel="nofollow">was</a> the first foreign secretary of Bangladesh. Other than that, I can't find references for anything else. It may be possible that someone who personally know him added the details, including his relation with <a href="../../../a/l/a/Aladin.html" title="Aladin">aladin</a>. Thanks. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 06:44, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Verifiable enough and notable enough for me. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 14:30, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Dubious references.

<li><b>Comment</b> In the last few months, the credibility of Wikipedia has been questioned and I had no basis on which to form an opinion either way, since I really don't have any specific academic credentials. However, if this article is kept then I will sadly conclude that Wikipedia is not a reliable reference source. I could make that conclusion based on the fact that *I DO* have the expertise to judge whether or not someone is a "notable magician"-- and people who *DO NOT* have those qualifications are making editorial decisions based on magazine articles rather than extensive knowledge of the subject at hand. Wikipedia may be accurate in the Scientific realm, but if this aricle is kept, I will have no doubt that it's usless in every other sense. --Steven Youell<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.7.141.95 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.7.141.95.html" title="User talk:68.7.141.95">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.7.141.95_a6c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.7.141.95">contribs</a>) 20:19, 4 January 2006 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>delete</b> when mirror and smoke was cleared, there is nothing verifiable left. It was a mistake to start a vote and then to remove garbage. The magicial already did his rabbit-from-hat thing. <a href="../../../m/u/k/User%7EMukadderat_f623.html" title="User:Mukadderat">Mukadderat</a> 00:08, 5 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Verifiable and notable. I haven't been able to contribute much to the Wikipedia project these days. However tomorrow morning I will take a cue from what has been left on my Talk Pages and drop in with some verifiable and verified material for discussion.
