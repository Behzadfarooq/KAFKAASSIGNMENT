<ul>
<li>Actually, if you read the St. Louis Dispatch review of <i>Passing,</i>--linked at Jane Dark--there is not only a book with a chapter about Dark/Clover pen name phenomenon, but the review calls it the most interesting chapter. But I think I'm still in favor of the merge (frankly, I don't understand the difference--does merge mean Jane Dark article will be there with a redirect to Clover, or will all the Jane Dark content be in the Joshua clover article?--like I said, I don't "get" AfD, sorry if that is stupid question, and for coming back to add my comments if they don't make sense.) Clover noted in <i>Passing</i> that when he was "outed" as Jane Dark, he lost the sense of her as a separate/independent voice...but still used the pen name. So, there is a way in which "Jane" was a separate voice/different writer from Joshua-the-poet, and that <i>has</i> been noted in a book. But I wouldn't say that is really the case now--the voices are merged at the current Sugarhigh! at least, so it makes sense that the articles could be merged. Unless the idea of Jane-as-separate- voice is deemed to have historical value. Because there are so many Village Voice articles by Joshua (more than 200) and only a slim minority of those are noted at his article--on "serious" subjects--and there are also a sizable chunk of VV articles by Jane--on "pop" subjects-- that could make the Clover article messy if merge means all the articles are in one place. Or at least overflowing with links to the VV.&#160;:-)-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 07:52, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe to add clarity: Jane's published articles are only about popular culture (whereas Clover's are both pop and serious). And for a few years, no one knew that Clover was Dark. That would be the argument for Jane as separate? Now, it is not a secret that Dark is a pen name of Clover--there has been a book about it, and the Academy of American Poets notes that Dark is a pen name of Clover. Sugarhigh! was a column written by Jane Dark for the Village Voice, but is now the name of Clover's blog (which he writes un-secretly as Jane Dark, and about subjects both pop and serious.) That would be the argument against separation?-<a href="../../../c/i/n/User%7ECindery_01fc.html" title="User:Cindery">Cindery</a> 08:40, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It could be... I'm just not sure if there is enough content published to build an article longer then a stub about "Jane Dark." I think at this point it's fairly clear that the article won't be deleted, so we are just deciding where to put the content... ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 15:06, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge and redirect.</b> There are evidently only a few paragraphs' worth of information to be written about Jane Dark in the forseeable future. There is no reason not to merge them. Any details of the relationship between the two personas can be explained in the Clover article, and are more easily explained together in the same article than by asking readers to fllip back and forth. We don't have separate articles on <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walter_Carlos_2bab.html" title="Walter Carlos">Walter Carlos</a> and <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Carlos_7363.html" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>, on <a href="../../../c/u/r/Currer_Bell_a2e9.html" title="Currer Bell">Currer Bell</a> and <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charlotte_Bronte_2ca9.html" title="Charlotte Bronte">Charlotte Bronte</a>, on <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_French_05bf.html" title="Paul French">Paul French</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Asimov_1d17.html" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, etc. Under the naming convention articles go under the most common name; if "Jane Dark" were far more famous than "Joshua Clover" then the merge would go the other way. The case of <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Bachman_2ecc.html" title="Richard Bachman">Richard Bachman</a> is the exception, not the rule; I'm not sure it's justified, but if it is it would be on the basis of Bachman being so well known and the Stephen King article being so long, neither of which apply here. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 11:16, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think in the case of <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_King_bf4f.html" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a> it's a matter of article size. Splitting articles due to size is quite a common thing to do. I don't know why it was decided to split it like that, but there you go. ---<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User%7EJ.smith_e018.html" title="User:J.smith">J.S</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/2E/s/User_talk%7EJ.smith_6ef6.html" title="User talk:J.smith">T</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_J.smith_698b.html" title="Special:Contributions/J.smith">C</a>/<a href="../../../w/r/e/WP%7EWRE_9138.html" title="WP:WRE">WRE</a>)</small> 15:08, 22 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It also provides a compelling example of why this kind of split is a bad idea in the long run. The two articles differ on as fundamental a detail as why the pseudonym was used at all. According to the King article, it was to produce more books without appearing to flood the market under a single name. According the the Bachman article, it was primarily an effort to duplicate his success and ensure that his readership was not simply a fluke. In my mind, the King article (at 38k) is not so bloated that a merge of the salient points from Bachman would hurt; some of the accessory details that are book-specific should probably be merged to those articles instead. Regardless, while that'll need to be discussed on the respective talk pages, I think it makes the point clearly for the discussion at hand. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 15:19, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> and redirect because once the silly list of links to a dozen individual columns is tripped out we have one short paragraph, clearly well short of the amount of data which would justify a fork even if the main article were as large as Stephen King's (which it ain't). Notable pen names are ones which have their own history, like <a href="../../../k/i/l/Kilgore_Trout_63ed.html" title="Kilgore Trout">Kilgore Trout</a>. <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Sand_918d.html" title="George Sand">George Sand</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Eliot_fae2.html" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a> have the main article at the pen name, by the way, we make up our minds according to the situation. I am bemused as to why Jeff is so keen on having a separate, very short article for this one, a merge will lose no useful information and will be <i>more</i> informative. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 15:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: I am going to try an informal test. Before looking them up, I am going to a number of pen names and other pseudonyms, and see how many of them have combined articles for the real name and pseudonym and how many have separate articles.

<dd>So, one doesn't count, as there was not an entry for E.

<li><b>Delete both</b> as not notable enough. Is every poet with a couple books and a few bush-league culture articles currently in wikipedia? Should they be? I mean, where's the Nicole Cooley entry, or hatever? I know there's a purported will to encyclopedize everything — but if that were really the case, there would be no WP code about notability in the first place. And it would sure be the easiest solution to this kerfuffle. How about this: delete both, and if there's a big hue and cry, and someone wants to take on the responsibility of remaking them, perhaps that will be suggestive. But if they're deleted and that turns out to be okay, won't we all have one less thing to worry about? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Janedark (<a href="../../../j/a/n/User_talk%7EJanedark_4e74.html" title="User talk:Janedark">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Janedark_ad55.html" title="Special:Contributions/Janedark">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Based on the current content in the <a href="../../../j/o/s/Joshua_Clover_1607.html" title="Joshua Clover">Joshua Clover</a> article, he seems to meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I think if it were a new article and it were nominated for deletion, there would be some discussion but ultimately the consensus would be to keep. In its present state, I think a nomination would probably garner some "speedy keeps" and some expressions of pique at the nominator. But at any rate, I'm about to perform a test. This is just one of my <i>personal</i> criteria for notability. I don't know yet how it will turn out. I personally regard someone as a "real" author if they have a book with an Amazon sales rank of 200,000 or better. I picked 200,000 for fairly arbitrary reasons, but basically it correlates very well with my own opinions on authors whose notability I can judge myself. I'm about to see how Clover's books do. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:16, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>His book on <i>The Matrix</i> for the British Film Institute, <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1844570452</a>, has Amazon sales rank #487,980; his book of poetry, <i>The Totality for Kids,</i> <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 0520246004</a> #339,900. Well, I don't know quite how to apply my criterion when there are <i>two</i> books with <i>similar</i> low rank... the nerd in me is tempted to add 1/487980 and 1/339,000 and get 1/200348... I was hoping I could instantly say he's notable on the basis of authorship, but, by my criterion, not quite. These are "real" books, though; I own one of the books in the BFI series (not his). And a claim for notability would be supported by more book-authorship alone. I still think a nomination for deletion would fail, but there might be some serious discussion... <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 12:27, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'd disagree with "regular" as well, looking at the VV website I only found one Joshua Clover article last year, and the latest from Jane Dark there was 2003. He/she has written for them, but obviously not a staff columnist or regular contributor. If anyone favors deleting both articles, the way to go about it is probably to start an AfD on Joshua Clover once this one is done (merged). --<a href="../../../m/i/l/User%7EMilo_H_Minderbinder_261f.html" title="User:Milo H Minderbinder">Milo H Minderbinder</a> 13:38, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Jandek's actually a good case of when a pseudonym perhaps should be the article title. Although there's somewhat reasonable agreement that Jandek is Smith, there have obviously been other contributors to some Jandek pieces, and the entire career has been a marked attempt to avoid identification or recognition under the artist's real name, with no official confirmation of his identity ever provided. Those attributes distinguish Jandek from this case, where there is no question as to the author's identity (and confirmation by the author himself), and where notability and public recognition have been established under the real name as well. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:11, 30 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
