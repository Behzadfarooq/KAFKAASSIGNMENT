<li><b>Keep</b>That you think it was created for Pan Turkism is your opinion, i dont think the article implies that all. It is a noteworthy list of states with a Turkic heritage and it does have academic footing, for example see Hugh Pope, 2005. Sons of the Conquerors: The Rise of the Turkic World or Carter Vaughn Findley, 2004. The Turks in World History. --<a href="../../../a/2E/g/User%7EA.Garnet_b4c6.html" title="User:A.Garnet">A.Garnet</a> 16:16, 17 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> bad faith nomination following many edit-wars in Turkic-Persian articles. There is nothing in there for "pan-Turkist" propaganda, the comparison with "Aryan states and empires" is childish, in bad-faith and not academic. <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_languages.html" title="Turkic languages">Turkic languages</a> articles exist. This is not a template either. There is nothing wrong with such a list, there are many states that have been considered "Turkic" for many major academic works. I woud like to remind that, even though many editors tried to argue until the sky turned green how the usage of the word "Aryan" in the English language has definitely shifted from the anthropological definition, this has not gotten through to some people. "Turkic" has never suffered such a degeneration. The comparision is baseless: there is no such article Aryan peoples, nor are there serious academic sources that advocate such categorization. However, there are articles such as <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iranian_peoples.html" title="Iranian peoples">Iranian peoples</a> and <a href="../../../t/u/r/Turkic_peoples.html" title="Turkic peoples">Turkic peoples</a> The case here is similar to "Hellenic empires" or "Hellenic states". There is a similar article at <a href="../../../h/e/l/Hellenistic_civilization.html" title="Hellenistic civilization">Hellenistic civilization</a>. Many of those states listed have been categorized as "Turkic" by major academic sources over the centuries. Extremely bad-faith nomination and unencyclopedic behavior. The actual countries listed have also been listed as "Turkic" by major academic and news organizations. If editors would take a close look at the article, they will see that arguments center on 5-6 states of 14th century Central Asia that have been listed, with arguments such as "Turkic-speaking, but not of origin" or "Turkic origin, but not of culture". That is not the basis for the article's deletion.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 16:24, 17 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>again, the motivation of the creators of this article is obvious. It is also POV. I don't have time to answer all of your long replies. (from that TfD, I have memorized your responses) (I will let the admins or users decide, by readying that article). and my last reply to you: do we have Semitic States, <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arabic_States_9ec7.html" title="Arabic States">Arabic States</a> or Iranian States or .... articles? and most of the sources provided are not academic. And it is also interesting that you have put e.g. <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khazars.html" title="Khazars">Khazars</a> <a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a> <a href="../../../k/a/r/Kara-Khanid_Khanate_6f39.html" title="Kara-Khanid Khanate">Kara-Khanid Khanate</a> <a href="../../../l/a/t/Later_Tang_Dynasty_408d.html" title="Later Tang Dynasty">Later Tang Dynasty</a> <a href="../../../l/a/t/Later_Jin_Dynasty_079f.html" title="Later Jin Dynasty">Later Jin Dynasty</a> <a href="../../../l/a/t/Later_Han_Dynasty_4a75.html" title="Later Han Dynasty">Later Han Dynasty</a> in <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a> <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavid_Empire_1e98.html" title="Ghaznavid Empire">Ghaznavid Empire</a> <a href="../../../s/i/b/Siberia_Khanate_b3bc.html" title="Siberia Khanate">Siberia Khanate</a> and etc. by looking at those articles, every body who hasn't a solid idea before; will decide who has a "bad faith"</dd>

<dd>Tajik, you have been blocked countless times for edit warring and incivility on a wide range of Turkic-Persian articles, so please spare others the accusations of disruption. <i>Many</i> of those states have been called Turkic for centuries by major academic sources. There is nothing wrong with creating an article for states that have been founded by slavic peoples either. If it hasn't been done, that's not our concern. Please stop accusing others of racism. Criteria for AfDs is not the same as TfDs, and I would like to remind you that template Turkic speaking easily survived a TfD, and a template Semitic speaking also exists. This article is a simple grouping of states that have been founded by Turkic peoples over the ages. Your concerns center on 5-6 states in the list, and that with arguments such as "turkic origin, but not turkic speaking" or "turkic-speaking, but not of turkic-origin". Please take these disputes to the article's talk page. Maybe you should have gone to that Royal Academy of Arts exhibition I mentioned earlier&#160;:) I easily addressed another non-academic allegation that Pejman made about the three dynasties, so this shows what a bad faith nomination this is.<a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 01:38, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

These are your words: <b>there are no articles called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Germanic_states_c659.html" title="List of Germanic states">List of Germanic states</a> (containing <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germany.html" title="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a>, etc) or a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Slavic_states_d48e.html" title="List of Slavic states">List of Slavic states</a> (containing <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="../../../b/u/l/Bulgaria.html" title="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, etc) either ...</b> So may I ask what the hell are <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_Europe_030b.html" title="Slavic Europe">Slavic Europe</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Europe_085c.html" title="Germanic Europe">Germanic Europe</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/t/Latin_Europe_b571.html" title="Latin Europe">Latin Europe</a> articles doing there?

<dd><a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Europe_085c.html" title="Germanic Europe">Germanic Europe</a> regroups Germany and the UK, so your argument that "there are no lists or maps that regroup Germany/UK monsieur!!!" simply, and utterly, falls flat out I am afraid. I would be keeping it down if it weren't for the fact that certain users have been constantly edit warring on Turco-Persian articles for ages. This bad faith nomination is really the last straw. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 05:13, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comments</b>: <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanic_Europe_085c.html" title="Germanic Europe">Germanic Europe</a> and <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_Europe_030b.html" title="Slavic Europe">Slavic Europe</a> are only <b>LISTS</b> of <b>PRESENT</b> Slavic-speaking states <b>ONLY in EUROPE</b>. This article, however, is another attempt of Turkish nationalists to infiltrate Wikipedia with their POV. The article would be totally correct if it were only limitted to the present Turkic states, with a small notification that these nations also include large numbers of NOn-Turkic minorities (Russians, Kurds, etc). But this article is POV because it tries to establish the biased claim that these nations are "Turkic by nature". It also contains a totally POV section about history - of course the way Pan-Turkists want history to look like. All kinds of historical kingdoms and states - some of them still a big myth (<a href="../../../h/u/n/Huns.html" title="Huns">Huns</a>), some of them not really Turkic (<a href="../../../k/h/w/Khwarezm_Shahs_378e.html" title="Khwarezm Shahs">Khwarezm Shahs</a>, <a href="../../../g/h/a/Ghaznavids.html" title="Ghaznavids">Ghaznavids</a>) - are claimed as <i>Turkic states</i>, and the confusing intro does not justify ANYTHING. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">TÄjik</a> 20:54, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again, FALSE... First of all, it is normal that there only the slavic states in Europe, since there have never been slavic states in Africa. If there were, I am sure the title of the article would have been modified to take that into account. This article also lists only the Turkic states in Eurasia, since there haven't been any Turkic states in South America. Secundo, this article lists current Turkic states, and those that have been defunct in 20th century to begin with, and then gives another list of states since the Gokturks. <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavic_Europe_030b.html" title="Slavic Europe">Slavic Europe</a> does a similar thing, there are also the mentions of "Mongol invasion", "Ottoman invasion", "Holy Roman Empire", "Austria-Hungarian Empire", "Imperial Russia" in the article. Stop using the <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chewbacca_defense.html" title="Chewbacca defense">chewbacca defense</a> and please stop trying to confuse other editors in to believing non-truths. The article's format is very similar to other similar articles. If you think that the article's history section could be better formatted, please raise those objections in its talk page. Personally, I would also prefer it to be extended so that it is not a simple list, but there are no editors that work on this article 24h a day, so give them a break. Of the whole list, your only objections center on 5-6 entities, and that only on grounds of "Turkic-speaking, but not of origin", or "Turkic-origin, but not of culture". They can all be addressed using the talk page. Some editors, including you, have been working to extend the history section so that it is more informative. So what is the problem? <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBaristarim_c144.html" title="User:Baristarim">Baristarim</a> 21:27, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: You are wrong! OF COURSE there are "Slavic states" outside of Europe: <a href="../../../k/a/z/Kazakhstan.html" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>'s population is 1/3 slavic, most of <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russia.html" title="Russia">Russia</a> is in Asia, and even <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alaska.html" title="Alaska">Alaska</a> used to be Russian territory. There are countless Germanic states outside of Europe, including the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">USA</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Africa_1287.html" title="South Africa">South Africa</a>, and <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>. However, there no such a list containing all of these nations and propagating some sick Pan-Germanic or Pan-Slavic propaganda. None of these articles contains a list of <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudo-history.html" title="Pseudo-history">pseudo-historical</a> claims. THAT's the difference. <a href="../../../t/a/j/User%7ETajik_56da.html" title="User:Tajik">TÄjik</a> 22:09, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Again wrong.. The chewbacca defense at work again. <b>Russia is already listed</b>. Did you take a look at the article? The fact that Russia is transcontinental is not our business. As for Kazakhstan, its inclusion concerns the editors of that page, that's a content dispute more appropriate to its talk page. I would like to remind you that there are only "seven" nation-states that are listed there? There is no sick pan-turkic propaganda, otherwise Russia, Germany, Bulgaria, Greece, Iraq, Iran etc would have been included as well. There is no such list in this article, please stop spreading non-truths around. You first claimed that there was no such list, it was proven to be wrong. Than you said it was only for modern states, that was also proven to be wrong, since there are mentions of states of 13th century.

<li><b>Keep</b> Very useful page. There are similar pages in Wikipedia, so why deleting the Turkic-related ones. The accusation of pan-?-ism is turned out be a main slogan of the ones who try to dispute every Turkic-related entry in Wikipedia. I'm wondering whether these attempts are the part of anti-Turkic propaganda. If it is, this would be a good arbitration case.
