<li><b>Don't Delete</b> It's not a neologism. I know it looks kind of extraneous at the moment but I'll add to it.

<li><b>Delete</b> This phrase might merit a mention in <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex-selective_abortion.html" title="Sex-selective abortion">Sex-selective abortion</a> but the existence of the latter article makes this one redundant as an article in it's own right, in my view. <a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJules1975_f2fe.html" title="User:Jules1975">Jules1975</a> 11:29, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> Looking through the footnotes, there is only evidence for this terms existence (outside of wikipedia) from the <a href="http://www.euroblind.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.euroblind.org/" rel="nofollow">European Blind Union</a>. However, I did not read through the University of Washington paper extensively. If the term is used exactly, I would say that it barely passes "multiple secondary sources" (with a grand total of 2). However, from a brief skim of that article the phrase is not used, and I'm assuming a delete for failure of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>-<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 17:47, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Changed to <b>Keep</b> It does seem there is more encyclopedic substance to the article now, which can be built on, and it is no longer merely a definition. There are only three sources at the moment although I googled it and more sources can definitely be added. Also I do not see how it could be merged any longer as the article it would most likely to be merged into ie. (sex-selective abortions) would not contain information on disability related abortions which this article does. It might however be possible to merge sex-selective abortions into this article since that is a subtopic here. --<a href="../../../r/d/j/User%7ERdjohnson_e4c2.html" title="User:Rdjohnson">Rdjohnson</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>Despite my original feelings I'll have to vote to keep it for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>It is fleshing out with more encyclopedic content than I originally thought it would, and isn't just a dictionary definition anymore.</li>
<li>It isn't used much but it apparently does have legitimate usage among scholarly papers.</li>
<li>I don't think it can be merged anymore since it is a distinct topic of its own, even though it is definitely relatable to other topics.--<a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegaMind_6bd5.html" title="User:MegaMind"><font color="teal">MegaMind</font></a></li>

<dd>The first ref just uses the words as a descriptor not a defined term <i>per se</i> so is not a reference for the term as such, just a discussion which would be a more proper ref off abortion or disability or something else. It has clearly been put in to justify having this article. The whole topic can and should be discussed under the other topics already listed such as aobrtion on the basis of sex or disability. I'll have a look at the other refs now... cheers, <a href="../../../c/a/s/User%7ECasliber_bea8.html" title="User:Casliber">Casliber</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/s/User_talk%7ECasliber_3ddb.html" title="User talk:Casliber">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Casliber_4aa0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Casliber">contribs</a> 21:59, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Topic is notable even if the title is a neologism. Consider moving the article to <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_abortion.html" title="Selective abortion">selective abortion</a> per <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">User:Scientizzle</a>. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 07:50, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and move to somewhere people can actually find it. --<a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDookama_7ef0.html" title="User:Dookama">Dookama</a> 12:39, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it should probably be linked to the see also sections of related topics.--<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpoisp_485b.html" title="User:Spoisp">Spoisp</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Since this article encompasses sex-selective abortion we could just merge it under this article under a specific sex-selective abortion sub-heading instead of creating a whole new article for it. That way we could also expand the article in ways that might not necessarily involve selective abortion per se but perhaps involve prenatal discrimination in other areas like opposition for healthcare rights for pregnant mothers and their offspring or economic discrimination against pregnant mothers with fetuses. I don't know if that's relevant but I just thought I'd toss it up there as a possibility.--<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpoisp_485b.html" title="User:Spoisp">Spoisp</a></li>
<li>Another possibility: prenatal discrimination and selective abortion might also work as a merge page if we do decide to merge it. --<a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpoisp_485b.html" title="User:Spoisp">Spoisp</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Possibly I don't know if selective abortion should necessarily be in the title then though if that kind of material is added. On the other hand I think you definitely have a point about creating a sex-selective abortion subheading although I think a selective abortion subheading would be good as a title or part of a title for the first part of the article. I also thought it might be a good idea to include material regarding attacks on pregnant women motivated by reasons for attempting to end the pregnancy based on the spouses or grandparents economic or social motivations not to permit a delivery. I do definitely think that including the information in the sex-selective abortion article in this article would be a good idea whether or not we decide to merge it. --<a href="../../../j/f/r/User%7EJfraatz_d331.html" title="User:Jfraatz">jfraatz</a></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The article brings together two kinds of selective abortion, sex and anti-disability selectivity. Both are notable, but they need to be linked to articles on the individual subjects (using the 'main' template, or some other). <a href="../../../s/e/l/Selective_abortion.html" title="Selective abortion">Selective abortion</a> might be a better title. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPeterkingiron_03d3.html" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> 00:23, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
