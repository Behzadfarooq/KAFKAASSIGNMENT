<p>Not notable, should we also have Latvian Blogosphere? <a href="../../../s/k/r/User%7ESkrewler_3446.html" title="User:Skrewler">Skrewler</a> 01:39, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, we are supposed to be providing users with the sum of human knowledge, why shouldn't we have Latvian blogosphere if there is enough content? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:03, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is NOT supposed to be providing users with the sum of human knowledge. There is a great deal of information that does not have a place in this encyclopedia. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 04:04, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If information is part of the sum of human knowledge, it obviously belongs here or in some other wikimedia project. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 05:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it does not "obviously" belong anywhere. Tell me, to which Wikimedia project should I add the complete cast and crew of the school play I was in when I was in 4th Grade? Or the full list of official guests received by President Clinton during the month of February 1996? Or the complete texts of the dozens of love letters that my great-grandfather wrote to my great-grandmother a century ago? All of this stuff is verifiable human knowledge. But in terms of notability, none of it rises beyond being subtrivial. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 22:52, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wow. Please add that latter two to wikisource as valuable historic records. We can probably live without the first one. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:36, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>What's wrong with the first one, it's factual human knowledge isn't it? The fact is, we can agree that it belongs nowhere on Wikimedia. As for the correspondence between my <i>zayda</i> and <i>bubbe</i>, I should point out that they were nobody famous at all. Mash notes between a seamstress and a tobacco shop owner hardly constitute "historical documents." <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 04:45, 16 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't object to the inclusion of the cast list, but I think it's unlikely to be of use to anyone. I strongly disagree about the value of the "mash notes", why would you take that resource away from future researchers into 20th century culture and language? <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:20, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I would don't see any evidence that the Belgian blogosphere lacks notability. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 02:44, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Request for clarification</b>. I could understand a Flemish blogosphere. How would French-speaking Belgians inhabit a distinct part of cyberspace from Parisians or Quebecois? <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 02:58, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nominator. I would support merging any useful info on French or Dutch blogs to pages on Francophone blogosphere or Dutch-language blogosphere (or something like that) if someone felt they were worthwhile enough to create. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Levine_ad03.html" title="User:Andrew Levine">Andrew Levine</a> 04:04, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b> One article on blogs is enough. <a href="../../../6/5/2E/User%7E65.34.232.136.html" title="User:65.34.232.136">65.34.232.136</a> 05:32, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> discussing the blogosphere of all the countries in the world would create a horrendously long article. And if we have <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canadian_blogosphere.html" title="Canadian blogosphere">Canadian blogosphere</a>, I don't see the use in splitting the Belgian one. There's both French and English speaking Canadians and that one isn't split either. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 09:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>The only problem with that logic is you assume articles for "each country blogosphere" are needed. They aren't. Bloggers are bloggers. It's same scum no matter what country you are from. --Timecop 02:14, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> we don't need individual national blogosphere articles. <a href="../../../d/o/t/User%7EDottoreso_44ff.html" title="User:Dottoreso">Dottore So</a> 10:54, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>: There is no such thing as a Belgian Blogosphere, or an American one, or a Canadian one. The Internet is global. Contributors to the Moravian blog might be Japanese. Extending national borders or, worse, ethnic identifications, into the Internet and then claiming that there is some extension of this into a content designation, is silly, counter-productive, and the fruit of boredom or malevolence. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:49, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> - there is such a thing as a Belgian blogosphere. How many Americans are interested in Belgian matters, or speak Flemish? It's naive to claim that just because there's international interest, that there are no national blocs on the internet. --<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacRusgail_89f3.html" title="User:MacRusgail">MacRusgail</a> 13:43, 15 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Non-Belgians can write Flemish, and many can write French. The point is that there is no "there" in the Internet except for the URL. In this case, it's not an article about a URL, nor is it an article that describes a distinction of difference. This is an article not about a specific place, nor specific site, nor a collection of sites that have anything in common than that they are <i>assumed to be</i> from the nation-state of Belgium. The article makes no effort at establishing what that means. Once we get away from actual space and into virtual space, how is the Belgian designation greater than some micronation's? <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:35, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> because the article has nothing to say other than "there are bloggers in Belgium too". It makes no claims of particular notability for any Belgian bloggers, and completely fails to identify any points that distinguish blogging in Belgium from blogging anywhere else in the world. Remove the words "Belgian" and "Flemish", and it would be impossible to distinguish this from a generic article on blogs. What next - an article on Belgian rabbits ("The common rabbit lives all over the world, including in Belgium. It is a small mammal...")? — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 16:59, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is silliness. As rightly pointed out above, blogs are global, like everything on the internet.
