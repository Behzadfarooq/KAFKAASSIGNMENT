<dd>If "unencyclopedic" is a description of the tone, it can be fixed. If it describes the topic, I disagree. I can understand it, and so could any reader, so I don't think it verges on nonsense. "Junk" is hardly an attempt at persuasion. "Lack of notability" seems like a funny criterion to apply to this hopefully unique event. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 02:41, 14 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> though I'm sure bestiality videos are of interest to some folks, individual files are not an encyclopedic topic. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 02:38, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Edit and keep</b> Maybe it belongs among "web phenomena" or something similar. It's not exactly "encyclopedia-worthy", but it should be here to explain what it is to people so that they don't need to see the video. It's being called "the next goatse", so it's likely that it will be showing up in forums for years to come, there may as well be some background information on it somewhere legitimate so that people who are curious don't need to actually search for it on google and read every forum post filled with people saying "that's gross". The article doesn't have a lot of information in it, because it's fairly self-explanitory. It's a gross video of a sexual act resulting in death that is being posted around the internet as "shock humor". Not sure how to correctly sign my name here, I apologize. As for why it is different than the other floating porn videos, this one resulted in a death, which is at least newsworthy - original poster - 02:43:48 14 October 2005<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 65.96.233.102 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_65.96.233.102_3764.html" title="Special:Contributions/65.96.233.102">contribs</a>) 02:52, 14 October 2005 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a very persuasive case to keep the article. If it is a phenomena, and it is talked about, then it IS noteworthy, and it SHOULD be referenced. However, I question the merit of "self-explanitory." The article should explain a secondary consensus and/or debate on the phenomena and provide references. Clearly, however, it is not original research, so I think this has potential to be saved. --<a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMalecasta_ddbb.html" title="User:Malecasta">Malecasta</a> 04:10, 14 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge/Revise</b> The entry refuses to define itself. Perhaps a reporting on the sources listed and a merge with other material. There should be some definition of "Mr Hands," and some reporting on the secondary scholarship of issue. If no scholarship, then some attempt should be made to distinguish it from original research.
