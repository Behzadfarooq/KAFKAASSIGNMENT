<p>This is an article on an elementary school (the editors'?} in Canada, with no reason given why this subject is noteworthy (other than to the children who go to the school and their parents). There are more elementary schools throughout the world than there are articles in Wikipedia. Unless a grade school is really noteworthy (ie. <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine High School</a>), it should not be the subject of a Wiki article. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 14:24, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I question the editorial wisdom of any project that opens up Wikipedia to articles on every grade school within any country. What about the New South Wales school system in Australia? Should we have a Wiki article on every grade school there? Or how about every grade school in China - a country that is increasingly objecting to Western cultural imperialism. I personally would like to create articles on P.S. 115 and P.S. 172 in Queens, New York. I fail to see the logic of creating Wiki articles for every grade school in any one nation. There are probably more than 100 million grade schools throughout the world. If "creating complete entries for all Canadian schools" is an "encylopedic goal in itself," why not create a separate Wiki encyclopedia on "Education in Canada" and head off the problem of nationalistic educators competing for the most Wiki articles? If I'm missing an important reason for creating a separate Wikipedia article on every school in Canada, please let me know.<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 17:39, 18 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>* <i>What about the New South Wales school system in Australia?</i>, <i>I personally would like to create articles on P.S. 115 and P.S. 172 in Queens, New York.</i> - I would support any other project from Australia or New York that wanted to do the same thing.</dd>
<dd>* <i>I fail to see the logic of creating Wiki articles for every grade school in any one nation.</i> It continues to stun me what harm these types of AfDs are trying to protect Wikipedia from. I could also list reams of other types of articles that I have no interest but I would stop short of saying they shouldn't be allowed (Ball Parks, Xbox Games, Anime characters come to mind). I don't object to them and I would expect the same consideration.</dd>
<dd>* <i>why not create a separate Wiki encyclopedia on "Education in Canada" and head off the problem of nationalistic educators competing for the most Wiki articles?</i> If necessary I would put up my own wiki but I thought the reason wikipedia was here was to collect information not fragment it. Again the great concern seems to be <i>what if everyone did this</i> - that would be awesome, that would be wonderful. Wikipedia could engage educators and students all over the world that would create a generation of wiki contributors. That is why I do it and I contribute $$ to the wikimedia foundation instead running my own server. If someone is so worried about a few MB of disk space send me the bill would happily pay it. --Wakemp 18:15, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Excuse me, but ball parks, Xbox Games, Anime characters and such are of interest to many people around the world. What I'm asking is who is interested about this elementary school - other than its students, their parents and teachers, and some of the people involved in the school system in Vancouver, Canada? If your goal is to put everything in the world inside of Wikipedia, no matter how unimportant, we already have something a bit like that. It's called the Internet. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 04:13, 19 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>And I said that was fine, if you want your silly little games in Wikipedia. I don't AfD those, and I was asking for the same consideration. But when you compare a school (real physical structure that thousands of students go through and that serves a community) to a fictional animated character - I don't feel there is any need for me to have to continually justify the existence of a school in Wikipedia. You can continue to assurt that notability is your standard, it juts isn't mine. --Wakemp 15:25, 21 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sorry, but this argument does not seem to make sense. An article can be well-written and verifiable and yet be about something utterly unnoteworthy. The most well-written and verifiable description of the puddle of rainwater on the street where I live (it's pouring out) would neither be noteworthy or Wikiworthy. As for being part of a series, stringing unnoteworthy articles together into a series will only provide you an unnoteworthy series.

This article already demonstrates thoroughness and verifiability, which makes the promise of expanding the articles for this and other Canadian schools, to make them yet more productive and useful, all the more eminently justifiable. It's about time that a group gave the serious attention, organization and planning to schools that usually only gets applied to Pokémon cards or imaginary Star Wars planets. If there really are "more than 100 million grade schools throughout the world" we've got our work cut out for ourselves, and we're going to need efforts sturctured like <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> to get all the required articles created.

<li><b>Comment</b> And why is this a "worthwhile article?" How is this a "significant topic?" I keep asking this, but all I am getting are affirmations that the article really is noteworthy. I'm not asking for affirmations. I am asking what possible reason is this article noteworthy. And no, I'm not buying the argument that without an article on this school the collection of every known school in Canada would be incomplete. That's not a credible reason.<a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 03:07, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Per Askolnic and other comments. I see no reason to keep it, nothing that is at all notable. The only relevant detail otherwise is the claim that as a former K12 school is should somehow be magically kept which is less than persuasive. If anything <a href="../../../e/i/c/WP%7EEiC_8a85.html" title="WP:EiC">WP:EiC</a> is a good demonstration of the absurdity of attempting to keep all these schools. They are non-notable and nearly identical. And also note that being a part of a Wikiproject is in no way a keep argument. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:39, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Joshua, this mind boggling debate reminds me of Lewis Carroll's story about cartographers who created the most wonderful map ever. It was a gargantuan map of England drawn to the scale of 1 inch = 1 inch. It was truly a work of wonder. The only problem was that people wouldn't let them unfold it - farmers said it would destroy their crops, and others had equally trivial complaints. One of the cartographers finally suggested that they could use the actual land itself, since it was a reasonable facimile of the map. <a href="../../../a/s/k/User%7EAskolnick_cd84.html" title="User:Askolnick">Askolnick</a> 03:07, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> What we have here is a lot of people who claim the article is "notable," "noteworthy," "worthwhile," on a "significant topic," who are utterly unable to articulate why the article is notable, noteworthy, worthwile, or on a significant topic, other than to tell us that it is "notable," "noteworthy," "worthwhile," and on a "significant topic." I really can't believe this is the kind of debate that can go on in Wikipedia.

That includes the few that have not yet produced a nobel prize winner, soap opera star or serial killer.

How would you not find your trivia by reading a general article on Canada's School System (where this might be merged, per DMacks above)? How would you even find this trivia, being that it won't ever be linked through anything substantial, owing to the fact that it's <b>not notable</b> in and of itself? I'm just curious on how you think this will benefit <i>anybody</i>, including those interested in trivia (I agree, this is a great attribute of encyclopedias in general), since (being not notable) it won't be linked to except by projects and large lists (pages that trivia seekers don't generally seek out). --<a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorkk_d740.html" title="User:Storkk">Storkk</a> 21:17, 22 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - joy, oh joy, another school AfD that will end as 'no concensus'. For the record the only notable feature, its ranking position, is admitted to being unreliable and there is nothing encyclopaedic that cannot be better placed in a school district article. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 02:23, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: its unreliability is <i>questioned</i> -- the stats from the Fraser Institute is still widely recognized. The questioning of the stats' reliability is inserted to prevent a POV stance. -→<a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBuchanan-Hermit_699c.html" title="User:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="blue">Buchanan-Hermit</font></a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="darkgreen">™</font></a>/<a href="../../../b/u/c/User_talk%7EBuchanan-Hermit_6a2c.html" title="User talk:Buchanan-Hermit"><font color="red" size="1">?!</font></a> 06:27, 23 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep'</b> please it is notable to the local area and part of a wiki project series too no need to erase it <a href="../../../y/u/c/User%7EYuckfoo_5ab6.html" title="User:Yuckfoo">Yuckfoo</a> 04:21, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Notable to a local area is not the same as notable and I have seen actually no source or claim that it was at all notable for the area. Part of a wikiseries is not a reason to keep something either. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 04:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
