<li><b>Comment</b> The Washington Post coverage is <b>a local city news article</b>. See this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092100924.html" class="external text" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/21/AR2006092100924.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> for the "Metro" category market in the top left corner. That's why the story is filed under the "Metro" section and not the "National" or "Politics" section. Remember, the Washington Post is not just a national newspaper, it is also a local and regional newspaper. There is no coverage of this event in the New York Times at time of writing<a href="http://news.google.com/news?as_q=&amp;svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=declaration+of+peace&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nsrc=new+york+times&amp;as_nloc=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=24&amp;as_minm=8&amp;as_maxd=23&amp;as_maxm=9" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.google.com/news?as_q=&amp;svnum=10&amp;as_scoring=r&amp;hl=en&amp;ned=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;as_epq=declaration+of+peace&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_nsrc=new+york+times&amp;as_nloc=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_drrb=q&amp;as_qdr=&amp;as_mind=24&amp;as_minm=8&amp;as_maxd=23&amp;as_maxm=9" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>.As for <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Press_International_25ef.html" title="United Press International">United Press International</a>, this is a <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newswire.html" title="Newswire">newswire</a> service, and like its rivals, Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France Presse and so on, it carries many minor stories as it primarily services news outlets (its main customers) with as a great a choice of news as possible, and is not primarily driven by editorial selection of stories.

<li><b>Comment</b> You got to use quotation marks and targetted terms when searching google or google news or google whatever.

<li><b>Reply</b> fair enough. with quotaion marks, it still gets well over 60 newspaper articles, including the washington post and several major city dailys, and is carried on the upi wire service. (it also gets +400 unique non-news hits). that meets my standards. i frankly don't see what's bad about providing information on what's clearly a reasonably large event, as indicated by the geographical breadth of the coverage). isn't that what we're supposed to do: provide neutral information about things people care about? people seem to care about this, as evidenced by widespread coverage. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDerex_23d4.html" title="User talk:Derex">Derex</a> 08:07, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>DirecTV list and Dish Network lists are NOT the same, as someone incorrectly noted. Thus, if a list of DirecTV channels is good, then a Dish Network list is also fine. If one is deleted, both should be. The problem is the can of worms being opened up if they are kept, because one could then argue that a listing of any cable systems line-up would also be relevant. I'd delete both listings, but I would replace with a thorough listing of cable channels available on a nationwide basis in the U.S. That list could easily include the Dish Network and/or DirecTV channels (if applicable). Indeed, a channel's inclusion on one of these systems (or Comcast) would serve as excellent criteria for inclusion on this comprehensive channel listing. <a href="../../../g/o/e/User%7EGoeverywhere_685f.html" title="User:Goeverywhere">Goeverywhere</a> 02:53, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with the both or none argument. I also don't have a problem with combining both into one complete grid, that can also include cable systems.

<li><b>Merge</b> I wrote this article. I felt that since DirecTV, Sirius Radio, and XM all had channel guides, so should Dish Network. Someone copied the entire article verbatem and revamped the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dish_Network_channels_1bfc.html" title="List of Dish Network channels">List of Dish Network channels</a>. The list originally just listed the stations in two or three columns with no channel numbers, which in my mind is the reason to have a list. Since the AfD I have updated the Grid, bringing the channel names up to date and have even re-copied my work over to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Dish_Network_channels_1bfc.html" title="List of Dish Network channels">List of Dish Network channels</a>. I am planning to add more information. I've already put in about 12 hours into this project and I'm still learning the finer parts of the Wikipedia coding. I feel that if someone wants to put their cable listings up as well, they should be able to. Wikipedia isn't a TV guide, but it is a reference tool. If someone is thinking about getting cable or satellite TV, Wikipedia should be the ultimate source of information about all your options. <a href="../../../m/b/c/User%7EMbcossette_af29.html" title="User:Mbcossette">Mbcossette</a> 21:56, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>P.S. Just a few questions</b>: it seems unlikely that this will be kept at this point, but just in case it is, I would like some comments from those wishing to keep it. I have not found any policy page explaining which <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_racism.html" title="Scientific racism">racial classification system</a> is to be considered normative to use on Wikipedia, and I have some other issues as well.
<ul>
<li>For instance, I always find myself stuck when trying to determine whether a person belongs to the <a href="../../../n/o/r/Nordic_race.html" title="Nordic race">Nordic race</a> or the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpine_race.html" title="Alpine race">Alpine race</a>, and I also frequently confuse people of the <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpine_race.html" title="Alpine race">Alpine race</a> with those of the <a href="../../../m/e/d/Mediterranean_race.html" title="Mediterranean race">Mediterranean race</a> - could we please have some clear instructions? (I assume any couple with an Alpine partner and a Nordic one has to be included in this list.)</li>
<li>Without good pictures, determining whether a persone is <a href="../../../d/o/l/Dolichocephalic.html" title="Dolichocephalic">dolichocephalic</a> or <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brachycephalic.html" title="Brachycephalic">brachycephalic</a> can be pretty difficult. Perhaps we could make sure we have a clear set of <a href="../../../c/r/a/Craniometry.html" title="Craniometry">skull measurements</a> in an infobox in each biography?</li>
<li>And how are we going to do with people of African descent — I think "<a href="../../../n/e/g/Negroes.html" title="Negroes">negroes</a>" is the proper terminology, am I right? — are we going to use the <a href="../../../o/n/e/One-drop_rule.html" title="One-drop rule">one-drop rule</a>? It does after all have a <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Crow_laws_6b62.html" title="Jim Crow laws">long tradition</a> of established use. For instance, it has been reported in the Swedish press that new prime minister-elect <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fredrik_Reinfeldt_49fe.html" title="Fredrik Reinfeldt">Fredrik Reinfeldt</a> has a great great grandfather who was a "mulatto from New York".<a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2390&amp;a=573767&amp;previousRenderType=2" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=2390&amp;a=573767&amp;previousRenderType=2" rel="nofollow">[6]</a> Does that make him a negro? Does it make his relationship with his wife <a href="../../../f/i/l/Filippa_Reinfeldt_ec55.html" title="Filippa Reinfeldt">Filippa</a> an interracial one? Or do we first have to trace all <i>her</i> ancestors five generations back, to make sure she doesn't also have a similar amount of "negro" ancestry?</li>
</ul>

<dd>My favorite part is "in fiction." Jane Austin never explicitly <i>says</i> that Elizabeth Bennet is white, you know. I have a feeling that was an interracial couple. Also, I don't recall Daniel Defoe saying that Robinson Crusoe was white. (The one drop rule should definitely apply, and then there will be no interracial couples, as everyone has a drop of everything.) <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:44, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> It shouldn't be deleted for the original reason stated but as others have said the list could go forever. While there may be arguments as to how each race should be classified or how one can determine to which race they belong the term is not a mythical concept. This article needs to be tidied up. The race of both partners, full names, links to partners who are on wikipedia (Iman-model), etc. would be useful. It could be helpful when people are doing research on race relations and as a link to a more detailed article on interracial marriage and relationships.TMacII 12:08, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was <b>delete.</b> Ultimately, the subject of this article lacks notability that is demonstrable throuh reliable sources. The state of the article, and the amount of cleanup warranted, were not raised as reasons for its proposed deletion, and are not compelling reasons to prevent deletion. With that said, arguments that solicitation for votes in web comic polls is proof of the comic's lack of notability are also not convincing, as comics such as <a href="../../../i/n/v/Inverloch.html" title="Inverloch">Inverloch</a> boost their rankings by asking for votes (which is one of the reasons Inverloch is #1 at topwebcomics.com).

<li><b>Keep</b> (and continue to improve, of course). It has potential, and also, non-induvidualy-notable KeenSpot comics seem to be afforded an article because they're with KeenSpot.

Exterminatus Now is no more notable than this comic (arguably less if you go by its only source, thewebcomiclist.com). At the very least it should meet the same fate as this one, whatever that is.

Searching for "anime arcadia" on Google largely brings up irrelevent links, and if you add the webcomic writer in the search string, it brings up around <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22anime+arcadia%22+metrokard" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=%22anime+arcadia%22+metrokard" rel="nofollow">40 links</a> + <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22anime+arcadia%22+yaloumis" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22anime+arcadia%22+yaloumis" rel="nofollow">40 links</a> maximum. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 00:27, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's quite a few absolutely nn-webcomics which I haven't yet nominated because they're still orphaned links and will never get any spamming attention. The guy who wrote this article though, had the cheek to link it from the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomics.html" title="Webcomics">webcomics</a> article though. It's hosted on Tripod, which makes it even worse than the free webcomic hosts Comic Genesis. There's absolutely zero chance of this surviving AFD, although it does have a link to the author's myspace.

I know that I am disregaring several "delete" suggestions below, so let me explain why. First, let me point out that deleting an article <i>containing</i> <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> is not the proper remedy; the proper remedy in this case is <i>editing</i>. One editor assesses this article as <i>inherently OR</i>, which is grounds for deletion, but I don't think that has been established. For example, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=3K2&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22hispanic+vote%22+%22united+states%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=3K2&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22hispanic+vote%22+%22united+states%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this Gsearch</a> comes back with more than 100,000 hits, and looking through the first ten, one sees the domains include the Annenberg Public Policy Center, USNews, <a href="../../../u/p/e/UPenn_1ac5.html" title="UPenn">UPenn</a>, etc. This is clearly a subject of informed and scholarly debate, and although the current incarnation of the article could use with a lot more sourcing, there is no question these sources exist. Finally, in terms of analogy and precedent, not that there are at least <i>five</i> analogous articles about the Black constituency in the U.S., namely: <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garveyism.html" title="Garveyism">Garveyism</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_nationalism.html" title="Black nationalism">Black nationalism</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_populism.html" title="Black populism">Black populism</a>, <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_leftism_dd38.html" title="African American leftism">African American leftism</a>, and <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_conservatism.html" title="Black conservatism">Black conservatism</a>. Surely an even larger group has enough effect on politics to generate one article? --- <a href="../../../d/e/v/User%7EDeville_64d2.html" title="User:Deville">Deville</a> (<a href="../../../d/e/v/User_talk%7EDeville_300c.html" title="User talk:Deville">Talk</a>) 16:57, 30 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also, wouldn't it be great if someone informed you about articles up for deletion like what's done for images that are put up for deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Regardless of a site's popularity, portals are not encyclopdia-worthy IMHO. If the portal contributes to something significant in past or current history, or is a significant part of current popular culture, then it would be worthy of a page.

The article says he has composed 600 works - a reference to a review of one of them by a reviewer in a national journal independently opining that it is a notable composition would convince me. I notice that one of the hundreds of works the article says he has premiered is by Peter Maxwell Davies, although the piece was not written for him; however, although this appears to be his most notable first performance, it does not of itself convince me, either; I was somewhat surprised that it is not mentioned in the article. His activities as journal editor, music reviewer, and collaborator with authors would be good article content if he were otherwise notable. Notable teachers (and Bernard Rands and Gillian Weir <i>certainly</i> are notable) do not confer notability on the pupil.

<p><b>Comment</b> I've looked around for some links on Google to see if I could find some references made to the school, but came up empty handed. The school seems very nice, nice website, which is why I've tried to find something, but all I can see is that the school is of course notable to its pupils and their families (more than notable), there's nothing out there justifying an article on WP. I'm wondering if Will Richardson from Webbloged was referring to a seperate wiki or mentioned the WP without discussing the requirements of notability etc? I would advise the staff of the school who are involved in this to seek information on setting up their own wiki, and hope this hasn't put them off Wikipedia (it can be great practice for your students to edit articles on all the subjects here). The Village Pump on the main page is also somewhere to turn to for help if needed. If someone else more experienced could have a quick look to see if they can find some notability citations I'd be greatful. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 04:17, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I disagree. There was media coverage a few months ago, and that's it. It stopped. If we covered everything that got a smattering of newspaper articles, we'd have thousands of articles on moose who wandered into parks and criminals who forget to take the money when holding up convience stores.--<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sean_Black_def1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 05:52, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sean, alot of things gain coverage and then quickly fade away from the public eye. Just because people's attention spans suddenly put that event or person on the backburner does not mean that we just toss aside the subject as well because that's what the fashion tells us to do so. Honestly, some people or things are highly talked about and then almost fade away before our own eyes. You would have a hardtime deleting articles about anything that was part of non-stop talk and now suddenly noone cares about it. That would be utterly ridiculous. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 14:01, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think there is confusion between notability as a prolific Wikipedia editor, and notable as someone who has received a lot of public attention. Of course, no one is notable for being a Wikipedia editor - in that case, we should all have our own article.

<p>Vanity article that does not conform to any Wiki standards. Article is supposedly about a book publishing company, but is only briefly mentioned in the opening. The rest of the article reads like a resume for the company's founder. No edits other than creation by presumably the company's founder, and that is the only edit in their history.

<p>Someone put this up as a speedy. It's not a speedy candidate, but it's still probably worth deleting. Fred Ettish is a name known to fans of <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship_e281.html" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">Ultimate Fighting Championship</a>. In one of the early matches in the early days of UFC, the UFC was known to take a lot of amateurs. One of them was Fred Ettish, a karate instructor who displayed more bravado than martial arts prowess, and lost his one and only fight in a particularly lame way. Shortly thereafter, a mockery site sprang up, which is still in existence. Does this make Fred Ettish notable enough for a bio? Dunno. I leave it up to you guys. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtreme_Unction_1dfd.html" title="User:Extreme Unction"><font face="arial, helvetica" color="#FF0000"><b><i>Ξxtreme</i></b></font> <font color="#006688" face="arial, helvetica">Unction</font></a>|<font face="arial, helvetica" size="0"><sub><a href="../../../e/x/t/User_talk%7EExtreme_Unction_3e82.html" title="User talk:Extreme Unction">yakkity yak</a></sub></font> 04:05, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> as the user who lodged the speedy template. If the admin didn't happen to have specific knowledge of who this guy was, we wouldn't even be having this discussion because the article was in terrible shape.

<p>He is very noteable, because he took the fight in 10 minutes, he is maybe not noteable to the people who dont follow Mixed Martial Arts but he is to those who do.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Again, we are talking about a late night show on a fairly minor cable network. This portion of the show is not even very notable within the context of the show. It has potential to be a gigantic page and it is just unnotable cruft in the context of WP. As I had suggested to Chad and Trainer (who really should butt out of the discussion some), why not just create your own webpage and include the table and work on it from there. This just isn't important and should be removed soon. Fancruft at its very worst to a low-rated late night cable show. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 00:53, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> AFD equitette states "Please disclose whether you are an article's primary author or if you otherwise have a vested interest in the article." By this, I believe that Chad and Trainer should state this, as they both have stronger than usual interests in the show and one of them created the article, and the respective talk pages should say even more. That should be mentioned to make a clear decision. <a href="../../../g/i/a/User%7EGiant_onehead_ca40.html" title="User:Giant onehead">Giant onehead</a> 01:10, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I think this list was started in the Playmania article when there was a sense that it might be a limited term publicity stunt. That clearly is not the case given the expansion to six nights a week and the presence of at least one competing show on another network. We don't keep track of a list of Letterman top 10 List themes here, so we shouldn't keep track of a list of Playmania email themes. It's an excellent idea for a part of a fan page, but that's not what Wikipedia is. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 16:20, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b><strike>Delete</strike></b> the article fails to note that Nimoy didn't write the book. He was credited as a "creator" and used to market the book, just like everything else they published. It's worth a mention on Nimoy's page, but the book in and of itself isn't all that significant. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchsmart_f83d.html" title="User:Watchsmart">Watchsmart</a> 12:30, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>clarifying: The publisher, Teknocomix paid celebrities a lot of money to "create" some "concepts" for comic books. They then passed the the book onto someone to write. They had "Issac Asimov's Ibots" and "Neil Gaiman's Mr. Hero," and even "Gene Roddenbury's Lost Universe," (though G.R. had died some years earlier). Nimoy's involvement with the book was quite limited. The book was sort of alright, though. <a href="../../../w/a/t/User%7EWatchsmart_f83d.html" title="User:Watchsmart">Watchsmart</a> 02:40, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds like details that would be worth adding to the <a href="../../../t/e/k/Tekno_Comix_c09c.html" title="Tekno Comix">Tekno Comix</a> article, and this one. I was tempted to do so, but lacked sources. If you've got some, it'd be appreciated.

<dd>I added the second speedy tag after coming across the article in the newpages list. In retrospect, I should have checked the page history to see if it had been so tagged before, but I didn't. The prod was <i>not</i> (at least at the time I moved this to AfD) removed twice. I added it based on the fact that the speedy had been removed (twice, in the event) without any assertion of notability in fact added, so the original author or anyone had the full five days. When it was removed, I brought it here. What I meant by the phrase "to slap a Speedy on it" wasn't "to add a CSD tag to the article again", but rather "to speedily delete this article despite its appearance at AfD", something which frequently occurs for things which have only turned up here because of process. To say that I'm not "playing by the rules" is, to me, either an assumption of bad faith or something sailing remarkably close to that area. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 11:12, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This page is just being used as a reason for members of that forum to promote themselves and to bash other members. Check the history to confirm this. This page is hardly noteworthy. It is an internet forum. Yes, there are forums on Wikipedia that do have pages, but that is because they are actually important forums in rwlation to the show they represent. Wrestlingnewsworld is merely one of a hundred wrestling forums that are equally as big. If Wrestling News World gets a page, why not the rest of the wrestling forums? And, watch out for sock puppets. Some Wrestling News World members are sure to create accounts so that they can try to save their page. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion0422</a> 06:19, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment/Weak Keep</b> - <b>Thoughts from creator of page</b></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This page was not created for members of the forum to promote themselves and to bash other members. I created and maintained this page (for the better part of a month) in order for it to be informative more than anything. I believe it is relevant as at least one example of another article on Wikipedia, that of the Internet Wrestling Community. WNW has also been quoted to be one of the better stops on the internet for "real" news about the American professional wrestling industry. Having said that, this page HAS degenerated into an extension of rather juvenile feuds (on both sides, by the looks of it, due to the deletion of this article being brought up at this time) that are unnecessary in the forum itself, and totally out of place on Wiki. I do acknowledge that this is so, as the proof is in the history link for the article. I advocate one of two solutions: restricting editing access to the page or deleting it outright. Whichever decision is made would suffice, though I would personally like to see the page remain on Wiki. Let me stress that I am not a staff member of the forums in question and did not create this page for promotion of the site, forum, or any one individual. My original article included a plea to forum regulars not to add themselves to the page in order for it to remain neutral and solely informative to those who wish to know a little more about the "internet wrestling community" and the culture of internet forums and discussion boards in general. Once again, do as you will. If this page is deleted, I will not try to recreate it. --UserNumber586 07:17, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I used to listen to Today with Steve Willis when we lived in Ireland, reception was not great as we lived outside Dublin, but he was very popular. Reading the bit about the gaps in the programme makes sense. I did remember those. He did often read emails out from people in Spain, Gibraltar and the UK. That programme I can say with certainly was a syndicated programme. ClaireLMillington 13:42, 24 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I find it even more amazing that they listened to a Northern Irish radio station in Ireland, especially as its transmission site is relatively well shielded and its only cross-NI coverage is on DAB - which very few Irish people have receivers for. I also find it amazing that every listener who "heard him" a few years ago happens to stumble across to this to vote, and that they're all avid AM radio listeners as well as FM and DAB - must be hard keeping up with three modes of transmission to follow eh? --<a href="../../../k/i/a/User%7EKiand_8457.html" title="User:Kiand">Kiand</a> 18:56, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>As a radio broadcaster myself, (as explained in earlier comments) It is quite possible to listen to any radio. My last radio station was Galway Bay FM and we used to listen to Red FM (Corcaigh) online. I think the comments of 80.189.171.58 are quite plausable. She did not say that she listened off air or online. Also Ireland is a general term, again non specific, (ROI/NI. She says she lives in Berks. UK, After checking the IP, I do indeed see a London connection, and Newstalk 1152 I would have thought would be receivable in that area. I really cannot believe we are all debating how well known he is. What do you all want? Me to put a photo of him on the Galway Now website? SineadNiNeachtain 19:24, 27 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I would also like to see this. "Hard evidence" doesn't cover websites you or any of the other supposed people who've voted on this thread own/run/work for, for a start. So far, the only "hard evidence" we have is that he does two hours a week on a student-run AM radio station, which means he fails entirely on notability requirements.

<dd>OK, that proves what new information? That he works on a AM student radio station.... which we already knew as the sole provable piece of information about him.

<dd>What I particularly liked about the notice Willis put on his website (now interestingly removed) was that he talked about Wikipedia as if he'd just heard about it ("some site called Wikipedia"). When, in fact, he'd set up a user account, <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevewillis_dcd6.html" title="User:Stevewillis">User:Stevewillis</a>, several months ago to spam the same sort of vain nonsense.

<dd><b>Comment</b> No-one is denying that he exists. The debate is whether he is notable enough to appear in the Wikipedia. Given that he is just one of many presenters working in a local radio station, his notability is very much up for grabs. That he's (ineptly) been using sock-puppets to vainly promote himself in Wikipedia is, to a degree, a secondary issue (though it hardly helps his case). Anyway, I don't know why I'm saying this to what's probably another of his sock-puppets. --<a href="../../../p/l/u/User%7EPlumbago_5505.html" title="User:Plumbago">Plumbago</a> 14:38, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>very sorry if the entry appears as self-promotion, and i'm hoping you'll have some guidance to make it appear less so. i was sent email that there was an inactive link for us in the 'flux television' entry, and thought it was my responsibility to correct it. i also took the opportunity to set up supporting links w/ other wiki articles. re: satisfying the criteria for companies and corporations, i'd refer you to <a href="http://www.fmra.com/fmra_pr.html" class="external text" title="http://www.fmra.com/fmra_pr.html" rel="nofollow">this link</a>, an international list of publications not authored by twenty2product that feature the work of the company. if you still feel the article is best deleted, i'll make no more of the matter. best wishes, Twenty2 14:36, 24 September 2006 (UTC)terry</dd>

<p>Article for web comic that makes no assertions of notability, and fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: However, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a> has been written about in various magazines, which would qualify it for a WP article, whereas your webcomic has received no independent press, making it ineligible for a WP article. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 17:54, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Does an internet gaming site, such as the Planet sites, count as independent press? There are many mods for Half-Life 2 that have wiki articles here that have not been written about in magazines. So what constitutes independent press? I could make my own Elder Scrolls site and make a news item and review of the comic. Would that be independent press? Even though I have not had any 'press' talk about it, I have tons of support on the multiple forums I frequent. Where do you draw the line? If you are that concerned about it, I will submit the site to PlanetElderScrolls and pray they make a news item of it. Seriously though, it has been out for 2 weeks. Of COURSE it won't have independent press. I say just give it time, my friend. bchick222 13:14, 24 September 2006</li>

<p>Ok. I'll agree that it hasn't recieved any news attention in any sort of form besides people recommending people to the comic. If that meets your view of an unnecessary article for wikipedia then by all means let's delete it. However, do NOT call it 'self-promotional spam' as it is NOT that. I even looked under the wiki pages about what constitutes spam and this is NOT it. You drew the wrong conclusion on that one. Like I said before, my forum members and readers wanted to make this wiki so that info about the comic, the protagonist, and the story in general could be laid out for others. That said, I agree that the comic hasn't had any media recognition and I would not oppose a removal if that small detail breaks some sort of rules here. I truly think you are over-reacting though. bchick222 21:14, 24 September 2006</p>

<ul>
<li>Lets look at <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a>. It's a web comic with a good amount of viewers. Exactly when did it qualify to attain a Wiki? Did it need to be shown in a magazine? Did it need 1000 users? The point where a comic meets the conditions is gray. <a href="../../../d/e/e/User%7EDeepfatfryed_3203.html" title="User:Deepfatfryed">Deepfatfryed</a> 22:12, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's really not much of a grey area. As per long-standing official policy, Wikipedia articles must be based on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> information from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> with reputations for fact-checking and accuracy. So, yes, the fact that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Concerned.html" title="Concerned">Concerned</a> has been covered by at least three magazines and Septim's Pride "hasn't had any media recognition" means that we'll keep the former but not the latter. Our goal is to create a reliable encyclopedia on topics of historical importance. You may be more interested in Comixpedia which allows original research on webcomics, and doesn't require third-party reliable sources for its articles. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 22:58, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>ANNOUNCEMENT</b>: It should be noted that AlQoraton was NOT the creator of this article, as has been suggested below, rather towards Jamino (me) should be directed any discrepancies in regards to posting regulations. It has been put forward that AlQoraton asked members to post their views on this debate via the TeamLorio.net web-forums. However, as he didn't write this article, it should be understood that rules and regulations regarding the posting of Articles on Wikipedia are unclear to him as, obviously, he has previously had no reason to have read them. However, as I seriously doubt the members of the TeamLorio.net forums will be deterred from defending this article merely by the notice posted above, I must also stress as the sModerator of the Forums in question that NOBODY from TeamLorio.net simply makes an account to tip the scales of this debate.

<dd>it's not, but Wikipedia has over a million articles there are ALWAYS articles here that should not be. The fact that those are here and maybe should not be, just means that nobody has gone around to AFDing them. However now you have raised their profile to the community, I'm sure that if they are not notable they will be AFD'd shortly (which is generally the result of someone saying "hey what about article X!").

I'm trying to understand why the examples I gave have been here for over a year or even longer (without anyone noticing they, apparently, don't meet Wikipedia policy) and this page gets flagged withing two months.

<li><b>Keep</b> Vanity? Where? Is the Salad Fingers Wiki also up for deletion due to vanity? How about the World of Warcraft Wiki? The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Wiki? Any Wiki describing another product of entertainment? No. This Wiki simply disects another product of entertainment, one known as Team Lorio. At NO point during the Wiki does it claim that Team Lorio is the best, or better than anyone else, nor does it even claim to be GOOD beyond what results have provided proven facts to subtantiate. Also, if you're going to post in this debate then at LEAST provide a comment that supports what you're saying, rather than just insulting something that need not be insulted. Wiki-Management, I challenge you to find any form of vanity in this article. If it exists, which it does not, I will remove it. I wrote this article, and great care was taken to ensure all guidelines were met. Therefore is there ARE any breaches then this article should be flagged for ALTERATION, not deletion. That is absurd.

<dd>First of all: the Attention sign is what we post whenever it appears that someone outside of Wikipedia is attempting to sway the vote. In that case, we remind them that what counts is the strength of your arguments, not the number of bodies you can muster. Wikipedia, after all, is not a democracy. Second, you're getting too worked up over this; please review <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">what we have to say about civility on Wikipedia</a> before you post next. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 04:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I know what the sign is ment for, I can read. But in that case: why does the sign specifically say <i>If you came here because you were told so at the <b>teamlorio.net forums</b></i>? This is just an insult to teamlorio.net's integrity. They are not telling anybody to come here, so to keep this discussion as fair/clean as possible I would strongly suggest to remove that particular reference. And second, I already reminded Charlesknight to stop posting a new policy every time to make your story plausible. I've read WP:CIVL...so allow me quote myself: <i>Thank you for making my point</i>. --<a href="../../../a/l/q/User%7EAlQoraton_9365.html" title="User:AlQoraton">AlQoraton</a> 11:13, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, the <i>song</i> has not been released. The <i>album</i> has been released, and the song is to be found therein. There's no indication that it will be released as a single as yet, although there's also no indication that it won't be. The argument that other albums have articles on every song (which I assume is what you're saying) isn't particularly relevant - partly because the fact that other articles of a certain type exist doesn't mean that any specific article of that type needs to exist and also because the albums which have longer articles (bear in mind this is a stub at best) on each one of their songs do so because they're highly significant albums like <a href="../../../d/a/r/Dark_Side_Of_The_Moon_839b.html" title="Dark Side Of The Moon">Dark Side Of The Moon</a>. Al's latest may well become similarly significant, but give it about 30 years or so before it is. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 22:52, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

</ul>
<ol>
<li>Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable).</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Well, I've had nothing to do with this page so I don't know the intentions of the creator or editors, but regarding self-promotion/linkspamming, I'd say that while the section on other wiki-articles that link to her could certainly be removed, the bibliography of an author is normal and expected, as are external links for those wanting more information. That just tells me the article needs a cleanup, not deletion. And I would add...all of those sections provide evidence of notability, which was the criteria you nominated this article for.

<dd>I agree. I removed one of the more ridiculous sections, but the article still needs to be cleaned up more. I would argue that the article needs to focus on her contributions to the comic book field, for which she is notable, rather than on her small-press hippie voodoo books, for which she is not. But still, it shouldn't be deleted.</dd>
<dd>It should also be noted that yronwode herself is active on Wikipedia and has edited this article extensively.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Yes, I realize that. I had several sources coming into this debate: one of them was the Google Scholar search that you did (except that I capitilized the term). I also had the result of a dictionary search and an inconclusive Google Books search. I chose to use the plain old google search because it does, in fact, illustrate my point. I wouldn't want to use the same source twice; I wanted to provide another one. I can provide the rest if you like, but it appears to be unnecessary. If you would look at my google search results, you'd see that my source confirmed the notability of this subject just as well as yours did. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 19:19, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>At first glance this entry might appear to be spam but the term duct tape marketing has begun to represent a style of marketing for the small busines - yes, it also happens to be the title of a book, one that I authored, but the title was chosen to represent a metaphorical term that has gained a great deal of traction with small businesses. I have added some references to the term from major publications that don't reference the book title at all. Tracking from all of the major search engines shows the terms duct tape marketing receives several hundred searches daily - having nothing to do with a book. This term is very similar in nature to the term <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerilla_marketing.html" title="Guerilla marketing">guerilla marketing</a> User:Jantsch <a href="../../../s/e/p/Sept_24.html" title="Sept 24">Sept 24</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a></p>

<p>I didn't mean "just happens" to imply "accidentally happens." The title of the book was chosen to capture a term, duct tape marketing, that is becoming well-known as a form of small business marketing. Again, I point to the term <a href="../../../g/u/e/Guerilla_marketing.html" title="Guerilla marketing">guerilla marketing</a>, a Wikipedia page, and the the first few words of this entry - Guerrilla marketing, as described by Jay Conrad Levinson in his popular 1982 book Guerrilla Marketing, is an unconventional way of performing promotional activities on a very low budget.User:Jantsch</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">guidelines on forking</a> say that 'since what qualifies as a "POV fork" is itself based on a POV judgement, do not refer to forks as "POV" — except in extreme cases of repeated vandalism.' If some account of the record of vandalism behind the creation of this article could be provided it would be helpful in assessing the AfD. I suspect that the real question here is whether this is a notable item not sufficiently dealt with elsewhere. If it were renamed "Pull it" it could be compared with an article like <a href="../../../l/e/t/Let%27s_roll.html" title="Let's roll">Let's roll</a> to assess its notability.--<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThomas_Basboll_a8ed.html" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas Basboll</a> 19:34, 24 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would have no problem renaming the article to "Pull It" or something like that. The reason I think keeping the content is important is because the debate concerning whether pull meant "pull out the firefighters" or "pull down the building" is captured in this article. I'm pretty sure if we lose this information then the debate will once more rear its ugly head as it did in the main article a few weeks ago. Nay-sayers on Yay-sayers will retread old ground. I think having it as a reference and perhaps the battleground for additional debate is pretty important. And separating it from the main article will prevent too much minutiae being discussed in what should be a general overview. --Demosfoni 20:08, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The article did not prove it. It only claimed to be. You did not include a single source in the original version. Furthermore, it was (and still is) somewhat poorly written. You act as if everyone else should somehow validate your article. That is your job. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">Talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">contribs</a>) 21:50, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>How am I? 'Stub' clearly implies the article is a work in progress and some amount of general knowledge on the subject should be expected from users. Wikipedia simply gathers knowledge, it doesn't provide it. You just seem to be in a foul mood because you went with the crowd calling for this being deleted and had to retract your initial vote when it was proven the call for deletion was on flimsy grounds. The merchandise and such I already mentioned is mentioned with the article itself. Don't blame me because the creator of this whole debate jumped the gun. If they believed this item was about a fan work, the smart thing to do would have been to ask on the article's discussion page. If it was the case, THEN a vote for deletion should have followed--HellCat86 22:16, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Don't presume to know my mood. It's annoying. I'm telling you why people tried to delete your article. I retracted my vote as a courtesy because you took the effort to prove your subject notable. I would not have done so otherwise. You do not link to any sources in the article which validate your claims, and you seem to be unaware of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I suggest you read up. If you continue to make articles as you did this one, expecting others to prove notability for you, then expect more AfDs.

<dd>Confronted with my own mistakes?...why does there have to be a group of people around here who think they can just throw around links to the site's policies then just look down their nose at the rest of us? I've already explained the state of the article. Terribly sorry it doesn't personally please you. I've started a number of other articles on Wikipedia, many of which I've been able to build up myself along with the help of others and have encountered nothing like the attitudes I'm seeing here. Avsf35 jumped the gun. I contributed what I could to the article and took the neccessary steps to highlight it so others who might know more could further improve it. That's the whole point of Wikipedia. I started this article but that doesn't mean I alone am responsible for maintaining it. Don't imply I'm some ignorant slacker when I have a body of contributions that prove otherwise.--HellCat86 23:21, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Forget it. I honestly don't care. I'm tired of responding when you refuse to listen. You know why this was AfD'd. No one jumped the gun. You created an article that did nothing to assert its importance and it got AfD'd. That was your mistake and no one else's. You are responsible for proving the notability of a subject when you start the article, which you failed to do.

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Regardless of HellCat86's comments, I'm afraid this <i>does</i> seem to be fan-work, and either way it <i>is</i> non-notable.<br />
It's very common for popular franchises to have fan manga drawn about them. And it's very common for that manga to be published and to show up on Amazon.co.jp. That doesn't make it notable or mean it needs an article. It is simply one common form of fanfiction, which in Japan is given more recognition by the media companies than it is in America.<br />
At best, this might merit a mention in whichever article discusses the fan club as a whole. It certainly does not merit an article of its own.<br />
Remember: just because something exists doesn't mean it needs a dedicated article all of its own. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 14:35, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, this manga is produced by Bandai, the company that hold the copyright to Gundam, NOT by fans. Ergo, it is an official Gundam product. The fact that Bandai has chosen its fanclub as a channel of distribution is irrelevant. - <a href="../../../c/n/i/User%7ECNichols_7db0.html" title="User:CNichols">CNichols</a> 14:54, 25 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Adding to that, the comics are also distributed in Newtype magazine. Bandai hold any number of official relations with various Japanese magazines; the official SD Musha Gundam mangas, from which they make a long running line of model kits from, are published in Comic BomBom. Both Dengeki Hobby Magazine and Hobby Japan have hosted official content for the various Gundam series, including in recent examples Advance of Zeta and Gundam SEED Astray. Anyone backing the deletion of this article doesn't have their facts straight. I don't see how something produced by the official license owners for a fanclub they started and maintain is somehow fan work. This is just as official as the exclusive webcomic stories StarWars.com publish on their members-only Hyperspace service.--HellCat86 15:17, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, the original text read <i>Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Club Yonkoma is a spin-off Yonkoma from the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED anime. It is a series of parody comics, usually four panels long. The comics are a joint venture between Bandai/Sunrise's official Gundam SEED fan club and Newtype Japan magazine.</i> I personally felt that pointed out the nature of the series and made it clear that they were official. Any suggestions for improvements, since that doesn't seem to have worked?--HellCat86 23:36, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, take a look at the Infobox I just added. If you would be so kind as to further flush out the details listed in the infobox, (I would myself, but I cannot read Japanese,) then that would go a long way towards establishing why this article should be kept --<a href="../../../r/o/n/User%7ERoninbk_cea5.html" title="User:Roninbk">Roninbk</a> <sub><a href="../../../r/o/n/User_talk%7ERoninbk_7cd0.html" title="User talk:Roninbk">t</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Roninbk_59dc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Roninbk">c</a> <span class="plainlinks"><a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Roninbk" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~essjay/edit_count/Count.php?username=Roninbk" rel="nofollow">#</a></span></sub> 00:02, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Show the evidence for your utterly false and intentionally misleading assertions. The Digital Deli Online will always be at something of a disadvantage because it promotes 'Golden Age Radio', as opposed to 'OTR', and because of it's stated pledge to avoid all link spam on it's site. The hits we get are from honest crawls, not link spam. But your specious argument is typical of what I've seen on Wikipedia to date. The very proscriptions they say they wish to enforce against link spam, are what the editors use to decide a page's ranking from Alexa. The Digital Deli Online has never, nor will ever, promote the name 'The Digital Deli Online'. The Golden Age of Radio is the name that it promotes--and always will. Your claims are completely unsubstantiated and unsupported. (As would be expected if the editor is relying upon finding the name 'The Digital Deli Online' to substantiate a presence on Alexa--which is without question the most heavily skewed search engine on the internet.) This is primarily because they'll rank you higher if you pay for it, and they're tied to the DMOZ's limited category structure for their rankings. A fairer comparison would be from Google, which is unquestionably far larger and more reliable than Alexa, uses a far more equitable ranking system, and ranks for <b>content</b>, not <b>link spam hits</b>. Their technology is specifically engineered to catch, isolate and adjust for link spam. Let's have full disclosure here, Guy.</dd>

If you're going to skew results to suit your argument, please make at least a pretense of acting in good faith. The way Alexa participants get their hits is by offering the Alexa toolbar to their users or subscribers to gain more page hits. Do <a href="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=digitaldeliftp.com&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://images.google.com/images?svnum=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=digitaldeliftp.com&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">another Google search on the site's actual URL in the Google Images Tab.</a> And while you're at it, <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=42157" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=42157" rel="nofollow">do a <b>fair</b> Alexa search, like this one.</a> I opted out of Alexa when I realized how co-opted it was. But as you'll see, even though Alexa has intentionally misrepresented the time to connect to the site for over 3 years now, they still have to use Google for their crawls, and they're forced to list The Digital Deli Online, as <b>consistently within the top five 'Old Time Radio' sites on the internet</b> (even though I've specifically requested that Alexa and the DMOZ remove The Digital Deli Online from from the Old Time Radio category), and despite every effort on their part to hide the site. They've falsely claimed an 8 second connect time to The Digital Deli Online for over three years now. <a href="http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/home.html" class="external text" title="http://www.digitaldeliftp.com/home.html" rel="nofollow">Pull out a stop watch and time it yourself.</a> But since I don't pay them to stop lying about the site's performance, they continue to misrepresent it. <b>Tell us, Guy.

<dd>I gather from others of your observations that you're 'Mr. Alexa Expert', here on Wikipedia. Help us please understand, given your apparent Alexa expertise why you selectively excluded the most glaring fact regarding The Digital Deli Online's significance on Alexa. Given the preponderance of actual facts cited above, and your apparent extensive Alexa expertise, you'll forgive a casual reader's suspicion of why you'd intentionally fail to disclose Alexa placing The Digital Deli Online as <b>the 4th most popular Old Time Radio site on the internet</b>. If it's your contention that Google, the single largest, most respected, and most referenced web presence in the history of technology is a somehow inferior to Alexa then go ahead and try to persuade anyone to believe that. Just as an example of it's own absurdity, Alexa regularly ranks Google between 3 and 5 some days. A teensy bit self-serving? Huh? I agree it's a darn shame that Alexa is so utterly co-opted and skewed but their management put them on the path they've chosen, not me. Do a little soul-searching, then come back when you're prepared to comment in good faith and with numbers you can substantiate, instead of a lot of hearsay or Alexa nonsense. If you wish to denigrate or diminish the significance or importance of an article or site, respect this forum enough to do your homework first next time. Dnyhagen 05:33, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dnyhagen, please see <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">this guideline</a> for some reasons why you should not create articles on your own endeavours. It doesn't matter if you are one of the bigger fish in a very <i>very</i> small pond, the Alexa rank for your site remains at somewhere over the 1.8 <b>million</b> mark (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=digitaldeliftp.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=digitaldeliftp.com" rel="nofollow">[44]</a>). I would suggest to you that you may not be the best person to assess the significance of your own website. As to golden age vs. OTR, I have no idea what you are talking abut and care even less. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is the applicable notability guideline, and we also <i>strongly</i> discourage essentially autobiographical content. The article itself is largely unverifiable from non-trivial neutral coverage reliable secondary sources anyway. Your position in the search rankings speaks to your skills in promoting your site, not to the signifciance of the site. The significance fo the site is measured by references to it elsewhere. The inbound link count <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sexp-rd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdigitaldeliftp.com+-site%3Adigitaldeliftp.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.yahoo.com/search?ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=sexp-rd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fdigitaldeliftp.com+-site%3Adigitaldeliftp.com" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> also fails to support assertions of significance. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> 10:24, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>This has been asked and answered elsewhere, but it bears re-addressing. The SINGLE guideline objected to originally was proprietary authorship. As the article was in the process of rehabiliation, suggestions for citations were both submitted, vetted, and approved. The recommended guideline is that an article subject SHOULD not be submitted by it's owner or benefactor. But the article is less about the Digital Deli Online than it is, about Golden Age Radio preservation. Your self proclaimed ignorance of the subject matter speaks for itself, and if 23 million Golden Age Radio sites is a small pond, then you have your opinion and 23 million others have their own. And if 23 million is smaller in significance than 1.8 million I really need to check my math. Somehow that simply doesn't compute. But, hey, if Alexa says their 1.8 million are more significant than Google's 23 million, I guess we'd have to believe that. No? If you feel your opinion is more valuable than the 23 million others, so be it. There's no argument to that logic. That you didn't trouble yourself to verify Alexa's skewing of my daily results also speaks for itself. I stated and cited my specific objections to Alexa's methods. And I'd suggest to you, that since you not only admit, but seem proud of your abject ignorance of the subject matter, you're even less appropriate to assess it's worth. I couldn't give one whit if I ever get a single hit from Wikipedia. It's Golden Age Radio Preservation that the article focuses on. And would have continued to focus on if continued to be developed. Explain the insinuation that I've employed some sort of extraordinary skills that promote the site, rather than letting the site's articles and materials speak for itself, as you apparently didn't take note of, either. Apparently your difficulty is with The Digital Deli Online as the title of the article, as compared to perhaps, Golden Age Radio Preservation Issues, or something of that nature. I take no offense or exception either way. But your snide fish and pond analogy is simply insulting--not to the site, but to Golden Age Radio Preservation and it's measly 23 million internet proponents world wide. So let's recap here: Higher number of Alexa ranking=better article candidate. That's a new one on me. I must have missed that amongst all the other guidelines on Wikipedia. Too late to respond further. I can see where this is heading in any case. Oh, and thanks for all the constructive comments. Very helpful. Dnyhagen 13:05, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>23 million Golden Age Radio Sites? You mean the 18 million hits Google returns for a search on Golden Age Radio?<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=golden+age+radio&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;q=golden+age+radio&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> But that's <i>not</i> how you should use Google. The results include all websites that contain all three words, in no particular order or relation to each other. So you get sites about a radio appearance of The Golden Age (a band), of the Danish State Radio Orchestra playing the Golden Age of Light Music. What you are looking for is either a search for "Golden Age Radio"<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22golden+age+radio%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22golden+age+radio%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> (11000 Google Hits), or "Golden Age of Radio"<a href="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22golden+age+of+radio%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.be/search?hl=nl&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;q=%22golden+age+of+radio%22&amp;btnG=Zoeken&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, 147,000 Google Hits. Now remember that these include (many) duplicate hits (hits to the same website or forum), so the actual number of sites that mention the term (favourably, unfavourably, in passing) is still much less. And consider this: no matter if there are thousands or millions of sites about the Golden Age of Radio, only 44 at the most link to your site. And as stated bemow: you are free to write an article on Golden Age Radio Preservation, but that is <i>not</i> what we are discussing here. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:04, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If you continue to use Alexa as your yardstick, you'll continue to commit intellectual fraud yourselves. This isn't a matter of a level playing ground or not. It's simple intellectual fraud.

The references you give in the article are overstated ("Golden Age Radio's international appeal is underscored by Queensland University of Technology's use of The Digital Deli Online as a reference for Golden Age of Radio Advertising," means that they use it once as a reference for a Coca Cola advert: they don't cite Digital Deli as "this is a good reference site" or so, and "and the Norwegian Historical Radio Society (NHRS) has long cited The Deli ,[13] as a source for Historic Radio Clubs" means that your site is included in a long list of links. "Family First has also consistently recommended The Digital Deli Online as a valuable educational source for Golden Age Radio enthusiasts": consistently recommended meaning that DigitalDeli is one of the thousands of sites they have reviewed favourably, and that that review is still online). Digital Deli Online is not notable enough and fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and so I endore the nomination. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:11, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, yes. Certainly something you'd do well to adhere to. All of us for that matter. Your opinions regarding the weight--or absence thereof--to two of the article's 17 citations thus far are noted. Please cite the actual count of the 'thousands' of Family First Articles on Golden Age Radio that you refer to, unsupported by fact. Your endorsement of deletion is noted, though; for the most part unsupported as to the <b>content</b> of the article. I will repeat, yet again: searches for only 'The Digital Deli Online' are clearly slanted and biased, by design. The site is not notable--nor sets out to be notable--for it's link backs to the name, 'The Digital Deli Online', or for that matter, popularity outside of the Golden Age Radio community. It's notable <b>only</b> to the Golden Age Radio Enthusiast or Preservation Community, as are any number of the tens of thousands of other niche articles on Wikipedia--or frankly any encyclopedia of any kind. Every article has and will have it's own proponents. Clearly those seeking a specific article on Wikipedia won't give a whit about an article backed by 1.8 million other proponents--or the converse. It's the subject matter of the article they'll search for more information. It's that simple. Golden Age Radio Preservation is addressed no where else on Wikipedia. It is addressed quite comprehensively on The Digital Deli Online and the other 14 citations the article has assembled thus far; as apparently those measly 23 million other Golden Age Radio proponents--on the internet at least--seem to feel, anyway. The Golden Age of Radio, and it's legacy are of great value and importance to that tiny--apparently insignificant to two of you thus far anyway--niche of 23 million proponents who would beg to differ with both of you. Perhaps Wikipedia has outgrown the need to cater to 23 million proponents of The Golden Age Radio. Pretty successful to be sure, to simply snub an interest group of that size. But those 23 million can certainly continue to look elsewhere. If Wikipedia refuses to permit such an article, they'll find what they're seeking about Golden Age Radio preservation elsewhere, anyway. That's the long and short of it. I've made my case, and begun the article with just such material. If the aim here is simply to naysay, snipe, or detract rather than be constructive, it's less a reflection on Golden Age Radio Preservation than on Wikipedia. Far be it from me to either promote or detract from Alexa's inestimable value in assessing an article's worth on Wikipedia. That remains for consensus to decide. Suggestion for future Wikipedia Guidelines: If Alexa's imprimatur in promoting--or detracting--from an article's worth is so key, why not add it as a guideline and be done with it? I'll take my chances with the 23 million Golden Age Radio proponents any day. But I do thank you for your highly constructive comments. Dnyhagen 13:05, 25 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you feel that I have not been civil to you, please point out where, as I don't see where I have done so. Otherwise, please don't retaliate a friendly reminder by accusing me of doing the same. If you want examples of where you have been uncivil and not assuming good faith on this page, I can start with your first line, "intentionally misleading assertions". Having said that: you yourself say that the site is not notable outside its community, but apparently the community of Golden Age of Radio has very few websites, as there are very few links to your website from inside the community either. This AfD is <i>not</i> about <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Age_of_Radio_deef.html" title="Golden Age of Radio">Golden Age of Radio</a>, which is not up for deletion. Saying that "Wikipedia has outgrown the need to cater to 23 million proponents of the Golden Age Radio" is not supported by the facts, and I sincerely doubt those 23 million peope would all see an article on Digital Deli Online as necessary here. Golden Age Radio Preservation is adressed in the main Old-time radio article, and for all I care a separate, neutral article concerning the Preservation can be made. This, however, is an article about one website, not about that Preservation. If that was your intention, then the article is named completely wrong, and has too limited contents (it shouldn't be about your website). Finally, an answer to a few more specific remarks you make: Of your seventeen sources, I can't retrieve the third one, none of the first ten otherwise even <i>mentions</i> Digital Deli, just like the 16th and 17th; the 11th and 13th have the site in a list of links, the 12th uses your site as a aource for a quote about the Coca Cola formula, so all we are left with are the 14th and 15th reference. Two references, which both come out of the 40 or so Google found. As for the actual count of the 'thousands' of articles on Family First: obviously they are not about Golden Age Radio, they are about all kinds of stuff, they are to be more precise about websites <i>suggested by readers of the website</i>. I did not say or imply that they reviewed thousands of websites on Golden Age Radio, my actual quote was "consistently recommended meaning that DigitalDeli is one of the thousands of sites they have reviewed favourably," and if I counted correctly, there are 3583 sites reviewed. This is all highly irrelevant to the main issue though, that your website is not notable enough for inclusion here, but I thought it would be better if your other remarks were answered as well. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:40, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In a sense I had expected this article to be here sooner and when I first saw it felt that it did deserve deletion review however other editors were involved in it. I have reflected for a while on this before voting as I have been involved on the edges of some related discussion. However, with reflection, I feel that this is the correct vote. I do not see the article as being truly notable and I believe there is at least an element of vanity here. The author has been &amp; is extremely protective of his article and his position - in a sense I understand this but it is my belief that this is not appropriate for Wikipedia --<a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelR_5647.html" title="User:NigelR">Nigel</a> <b><sup><small>(<a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENigelR_05f7.html" title="User talk:NigelR">Talk</a>)</small></sup></b> 17:34, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Oh please, NigelR. Expected, but not instigated? Let me help this along. <b>Delete it. Please.</b> Contrary to your assertion, Fram, there is almost nothing of value in the existing 'Old Time Radio' Article as regards the preservation of Golden Age Radio. Nor, given the underlying forces and parties at work on it, will there likely ever be, since people that feel as I do about it, tend to resent the imprimatur of 'Old Time Radio' or even worse, 'OTR', onto Golden Age Radio Preservation issues. Heck, I can't even get my own site removed from the Old Time Radio category on Alexa, despite three years of repeated attempts. Sadly, those two factions appear to be at cross purposes with each other--the one faction wanting to continue to profit from it, and the other wishing to promote an urgent message to preserve even more of it. Even worse, it's an unwitting antibiosis; the preservation faction passionately racing against time, to churn out even more preserved recordings, and the commercial OTR faction even more passionately downsampling all of them so as to pack more of them onto a CD for sale for 3 bucks a pop. Indeed, the early decision to lump Golden Age Radio into 'OTR' was apparently made by the same commercial factions of 'OTR' sites with an eye to future exploitation of the articles and the tentacles of Program articles stemming from it--a literal orgy of self-promotion, commercial podcasting, and link backs. A real treasure trove indeed. And apparently little of it, policed or enforced till a naeive newcomer upset the apple cart. That's regrettable, but not entirely surprising in the least. I'll get an article on Golden Age Radio Preservation into Wikipedia in time, one way or the other. I certainly don't need to do it on the back of The Digital Deli Online, and god knows I'll never subject the site again to such naked abuse, insinuations, and unsupported attacks. The 'vanity' aspects of the article were admittedly regrettable, but the initial insistence of the editors to first comment on it, was directed principally toward supporting the <b>website's</b> notability, <b>not</b> the notability of the Golden Age Radio Preservation effort that serves as its <b>only</b> <i>raison de etre</i>. Nor was it indicated anywhere, by anyone prior to that, that the measure of a site's notability stems, as a prerequisite, from it's Alexa ranking. If that's truly the case, from what I've seen thus far on Wikipedia, there are hundreds of similar internet site-related articles that will certainly never rise to that measurement, as well as conversely, hundreds of potentially valuable internet site articles, encyclopedic in nature, that will never grace the pages of Wikipedia. More's the pity. Frankly, I find that an absurdly narrow prerequisite for notability, if not a disservice to the ultimate goals of Wikipedia in it's effort to become the world's most accessible online encylcopedia. To my perhaps naieve way of thinking, notability stems from an entity's uniqueness of content, promotion of a noble effort, encyclopedic information value to a noteworthy niche or broader interests, or perhaps even to purpose alone. In retrospect I regret misintrepreting the means by which editors were seeking notability from the website, versus the message. I honestly do, but the positive comments I was receiving along the way from other Wikipedia editors left me with the mistaken impression that I was pointing the article in the right direction. I'm nothing if not passionate about this effort, and I fear that passion served more to detract from the message, than contribute to it. All in all, a regrettable, misdirected first outcome. <b>Do what y'all need to with the article.</b> The process of learning the ropes, coding, citing, structure, guidelines, and politics of Wikipedia can only serve to help my next such effort. Lots of lessons learned--some outrageously negative, some very positive. Lest Guy conclude from this any self-serving perception of further justification for his unwarranted insinuations that I either undertook an arbitrary wholesale deletion of spam links, or, since he apparently wants it both ways, that I failed to delete as many as his proudly self-avowed ignorance of the subject led him to believe I should have deleted, I'll reiterate yet again, and for the final time; every single spam link I did--or didn't--remove was based on an informed rationale, from long-standing experience and knowledge of the subject matter. No more, certainly no less, and unequivocally without prejudice, pro or con. Never at anytime did I permit my own passions sway my own deliberation processes. Not once. That dog doesn't hunt. Put it out of its misery. Though I doubt this will cease Guy's continued insinuations, I for one am finished rising to the bait. Period. Dnyhagen 23:15, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Due to lonelygirl15, she has become a big star. She's done numerous interviews now and has even been on Jay Leno. There's a strange argument that lonelygirl15 was the only notable thing she's done so far and therefore shouldn't have a page. That makes no sense. Just because an actor gains notoriety for their leading role in any single movie or TV show means they shouldn't have an article about them? Under this argument, all Big Brother (every country version) and Survivor contestants pages would be deleted. Jessica Lee Rose is arguably more well known then most of those reality show contestants with articles. That people want to delete a page about this extremely notable actress is just nonsense.

<li>By "that link" I was answering TonyLeigh directly. Their link lacks double quotes. As for your own numbers, that total includes repeats. Unique Google hits are an important factor for editors who care about the <a href="../../../g/o/o/WP%7EGOOGLE_1973.html" title="WP:GOOGLE">Google test</a>.

<ul>
<li>Nobody is saying a certain article is not published in more than one place. Like with alot of google news articles, the google repeats are usually articles published in different newspapers or other news services, but from the same source. For instance, if AP writes a story, frequently many newspapers will publish the same story because the editor feels it's newsworthy for their local market and/or reader base. A newspaper editor in Seattle might choose to publish an LA Times article (provided they have a contract with said paper), then that would appear as 2 articles. That over 400 times editors choose to publish an article on Jessica Lee Rose, whether it was their own original material or not, shows she has a huge amount of media attention that can't be denied.<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 23:11, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Lonelygirl15 is the name of the ficitional character/series of videos she has been in. These videos are notable enough for mention so the star of them should also be.

What about <a href="../../../h/o/w/Howard_Brown_3feb.html" title="Howard Brown">Howard Brown</a> who is only notable for bank commericals in the UK (very popular ones though) who has his own article? This page should not be deleted. TonyLeigh 22:02, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - This is going to be an article that grows, just like the orginal lonelygirl15 article. It will allow for some of the info to be stashed elsewhere. basically, it will keep the lg15 artcile about that, and the info about the actress seperate. The orginal arguments about lonelygirl15 in the AfD's and the undelete there are all going to be made again. I think the same outcome is going to occur. Dave 22:04, 20 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - She's notable enough by now, and her biographical info does not belong on the Lonelygirl article.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't edit on this website, but frequently reference it, like I did when seeking information on this actor and that is my perspective so value my opinion accordingly. Deleting or merging the biography on this person doesn't seem consistent with the rest of this website.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I may not agree with the videos and it's intended secrecy, but if we decide to merge this article with LonelyGirl15, we might as well merge all of the other articles regarding actors and actresses who are only known for one role.

She's mentioned in dozens of newspapers, appearead on The Tonight Show, and has had a minor career as a make-up artist as well. There are thousands of actors on Wikipedia who have less prominence than JLR who simply aren't flagged for deletion for the ironic reason that nobody is paying as much attention to them as they are to her, along with a sense that just because her claim to fame hasn't been developed by a major Hollywood studio it's somehow less credible than someone who appeared in three episodes of <i>The O.C.</i> - <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDharmabum420_04df.html" title="User:Dharmabum420">dharmabum</a> 07:28, 24 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Carl Douglas is <b>ONLY</b> known widely for <a href="../../../k/u/n/Kung_Fu_Fighting_a476.html" title="Kung Fu Fighting">Kung Fu Fighting</a>. That's it. His one claim to notability and fame in the entertainment world at large. He has done <b>nothing else</b> anywhere close the that level. So the point is if Jessica Lee Rose's page should redirect to Lonelygirl15, because that's is "the only notable thing she has done" (which is the argument for deleting her page in the first place) then Carl Douglas should redirect to the one song that has given him any notability. There is no difference in the matter. The song may have been around 30 years, so what? The man has had nothing else come close in three decades. So for you to suggest just because his one big success was many, many years ago somehow makes him more worthy of a page than Jessica Lee Rose because her one notable credit (so far) happened this year is what is what is silly. She's also got much more chance of doing something else more notable than <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Douglas_f7b0.html" title="Carl Douglas">Carl Douglas</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Beck_51f5.html" title="Robin Beck">Robin Beck</a> et all because it's a fact those people have failed again and again to have another success over many years of failed attempts to recapture their one moment in the limelight, what the future holds for Jessica Rose is still yet unknown. <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.71.html" title="User:64.12.116.71">64.12.116.71</a> 00:15, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I never said Wikipedia is a Crystal Ball, I said quite the opposite. However, you CAN compare someone who has starred in an online Internet show that has been seen by millions to a person who has had one major hit single. They both have had the limelight for one thing and one claim to fame. There is no difference between Carl Douglas and Jessica Rose other than one is a one shot singer and the other a one shot actress, therefore she is just as worthy of a page as he. If the wiki guidelines somehow view that as different then that is crazy. If the guidelines were than black and white surely this VFD wouldn't even be here, the page simply wouldn't have existed (or at least just simply and quickly been deleted) <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.71.html" title="User:64.12.116.71">64.12.116.71</a> 11:04, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Your example of Carl Doulgas is flawed. Douglas's <i>major</i> claim to fame is "Kung Fu Fighting," but it is not his only one. His song "Dance the Kung Fu" was a top ten hit on Billboard's R&amp;B chart. That too is pretty notable; hence, I won't be nominating Douglas for deletion. Robin Beck had a very prolific career as a background vocalist on popular hits before her success with "The First Time," which gives her notability outside of her song. If Jessica Rose ever does something comparable, this article can be recreated... but she hasn't yet. GassyGuy 15:29, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Unless the more recent installments (which I haven't read) feature Southaven prominently, I'm pretty sure the novels only pass through Southaven a couple of times in the entire series; there really isn't a lot to say about it, besides that the party passes through it a couple of times. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 19:31, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>No need to delete it because, this article will provide information that Pakistan has indeed indulged in Propoganda and the will keep the reality. This is a very valuable article, since this is by Pakistani's admitting that what has been written in certain books and websites are indeed propoganda and not the truth.

<li>Proposed partial solution to POV issues - if we can rename this to something that doesn't use the weasel and peacock terms "considered" and "greatest", we would be in better shape, and at least the title would be appropriate for an encyclopedia. - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriona_934d.html" title="User:Triona">Stephanie Daugherty (Triona)</a> - <a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETriona_5b3e.html" title="User talk:Triona">Talk</a> - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Triona&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">Comment</a> - 10:00, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The title could perhaps be changed, but the content appears a sensible collection of various metrics for ranking films. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 10:32, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Although I think (as I recently mentioned on the article's talk page) that box office information should be removed and/or given its own page (Movies with the Highest Box Office Receipts or something like that). I disagree that "considered" and "greatest" are weasel words in the context of a consensus of movie critics or major award-giving organizations. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappylobster_391d.html" title="User:Happylobster">Happylobster</a> 14:30, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Looks like these issues have been discussed in great length on the talk and AfD pages of the other "XXX considered the greatest/Worst ever" articles. All these lists are heavily edited and patrolled and are gradually becoming fairly good articles. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 22:41, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Looks extensively referenced and sourced to me, so does not violate NPOV or WP:CITE in my opinion. I don't see anything wrong with the title, either though if someone thinks they can come up with a better one, knock yourself out. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 23:58, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The title isn't POV, it refers to lists that have already been made. This article isn't saying what we, the Wikipedians, think are the best movies ever, it's listing movies that critics and other people outside of Wikipedia have considered among the best ever. I hardly see how this is a point of contention. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartacusprime_ef4b.html" title="User:Spartacusprime">Spartacusprime</a> 18:32, 26 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As long as historical surveys and references are properly cited, I see no reason to delete the article. We may want to change the title of the article to something that <i>sounds</i> less POV-ish, though. — <a href="../../../l/o/a/User%7ELoadmaster_9161.html" title="User:Loadmaster">Loadmaster</a> 19:19, 27 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This article has been an exhaustive effort -- and, I think, successful -- to give an NPOV approach to an inherently POV subject, by approaching it from every possible angle. If I remember right, there was a previous attempt to delete this article, and that attempt was also unsuccessful. --<a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> 17:32, 28 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sometimes Wikipedia is so TIGHT. Personally, I could list 1000 "greatest" movies, but please consider this list is not for "the guided," but rather for those needed guidance. So many PEOPLE, new to English, new to movies, young people, curious people, and others COULD be greatly helped by it. Please no self-centered replies about the rules...lolart 00:10, 29 September 2006 (UTC)AAAAA</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> <del><b>or Merge</b></del> I am a Rutgers alumni and life-long NJ resident. I've met more than a few people from NJ and beyond who when told I went to Rutgers would promptly ask about the "Grease Trucks". I have rarely met anyone from New Jersey who hasn't at least heard of them, and many have been there at least once. The Grease trucks are noted in various sources, most famously in Maxim, and are a well-known part of the Rutgers University social environment. At the very least they deserve mention on the Rutgers University wiki page, though it is probably too complex to detail in a small space. Needs its own entry. --Daveyboy37 17:19, 25 September 2006 (UTC) <i>changed to KEEP and clarified position</i></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I am against a merge since the Grease Trucks have grown beyond just Rutgers culture. Students have traveled from others colleges, including community colleges to have a sandwich I am a primary witness to such events. As a free encyclopedia that require a community to expand, democratic methods can be taken even if an article has been deleted (which I did not know since I created this article from a redirect, an improper one might I add, since Food trucks are not called Grease trucks. The name is unique to these Rutgers trucks). I question the fairness of the previous delete because so few responses were taken. The failure to pass may have been due to poor quality, which I believe I avoided in this article, as well as a lack of research in notability (possibly because of lack of citations). This rewritten version comes complete with citations. A simple search of Grease trucks in Google brings copious amounts of results (notable results might I add). <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValoem_e826.html" title="User:Valoem"><font color="DarkSlateGray"><b>Valoem</b></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../v/a/l/User_talk%7EValoem_0a70.html" title="User talk:Valoem"><b><font color="black">talk</font></b></a></sup> 19:15, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The grease trucks are a well known regional institution of sorts. I would estimate that the majority of people who went to college in the Greater NJ area since 1990 or so have heard of the grease trucks. They are a ubiquitous aspect of Rutgers college life, a large national univrsity and as such, it is my opinion that the entry is valid and should be retained. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.151.113.139 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.151.113.139_aefc.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.151.113.139">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP</b>. Merging with <a href="../../../r/u/t/Rutgers_University_ce58.html" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a> is not a solution since it isn't solely a matter of "student life"...it's grown beyond its connection with Rutgers (as per Valoem). Though a reference on the Rutgers page is warranted, it's already there in the template and I think under the section titled "points of interest" (if not, i'll correct that). Deletion is not the solution, since this is notable and its notability is cited.

This article is not about a single truck on a single corner, it's about a <i>specific group</i> of trucks that cluster together.

<li>"STRONG KEEP"* -- I lived in central jersey for 18 years and though I never attended Rutgers University, I visited the grease trucks on more than one occasion. The flow of young people crowding the area late at night is a social event in itself. Good memories, affordable yummy greasy food, more fun than going to the local diners. The grease trucks are a part of New Brunswick's youth culture. I was looking for information about them to show my west-coast friend and this article conveniently showed up in search results. It was helpful... Please don't delete it...68.171.137.121 07:28, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>About each algorithm there is a unique truth as to whether it generates the n-th digit of a computable real number when given n. So it is possible to form an ordered list of computable real numbers. When such a list is given, Cantor's diagonal procedure gives the n-th digit of a number not from the list in finite time, so the reals generated in this way are computable.

<li><b>Delete</b> This seems to hang on whether Ó Ruanaidh's work is significant and well-known which is, as <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROF_f2d1.html" title="WP:PROF">WP:PROF</a> says, hard for those not in an academic's own field to judge. The article itself leaves a lot to be desired though. The introduction doesn't state the person's notability. If this article survives, I'd suggest starting it with something like 'Dr. Joseph Ó Ruanaidh is an Irish research scientist specialising in digital signal processing techniques.', or some other statement which immediately establishes the grounds for the notability. The link to Google is pointless. The link to Siemens doesn't even mention the subject. And finally, I think the author should have waited for someone else to start this article - <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrosbiesmith_4feb.html" title="User:Crosbiesmith">Crosbiesmith</a> 19:43, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree with the last entry that the article is too terse and needs to be rewritten. However, on closer inspection it is obvious that the subject is proficient in two different fields at the same time - namely Bayesian Signal Processing and Digital Watermarking. Of the two fields, he is very notable in the field of <a href="../../../d/i/g/Digital_watermarking.html" title="Digital watermarking">Digital Watermarking</a> although I am concerned that he has not published in quite a long time. digital_watermarker 20:14, 29 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Evidence must be available that the work of the researcher is highly cited, that he may have written a book read by more than 5000 people (I remember that one), be an invited speaker at conferences etc. etc. I have done all this in spades. It was hard work getting to that level (especially when one had to start at the bottom).

<b>Clarification</b>: I'm sorry to step back in, but I guess I should have been more clear. My points are this:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li><b>organization itself is a prop</b>: If you do more than a <i>quick google</i> you'd see that the organization in question is only "published" as a less-than-quarterly newsletter. The newsletters only contain opinion pieces, analysis of non-peer-reviewed studies (although the studies themselves aren't published) and pro-viewpoint news blurbs. They do no original research, and do nothing but blare press releases about themselves. It's all flash.</li>
<li><b>original research</b>: I can't find anything about this organization that isn't original research... it's all circular. Everything you get on google ends up sourcing back to their own press releases! No one else is writing that they actually do anything.</li>
<li><b>significance</b>: There are only 6 hits on google. <i>All six source back to the same press releases!</i> Six hits is not a significant organization.</li>
<li><b>repitition</b>: As someone mentioned, avoid similarities with their own self-published history. How come all these google results read exactly the same? <i>it's all from the same source!</i></li>

<p>This article has been recreated 3 times after previous deletion, the Newgrounds forums do not deserve their own article, you should simply write a detailed paragraph about it in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> article.

<p><b>Remain undeleted</b> I belive they are in need in there own article but theve actully been recreated 3 times!? Sorry if it's already made but I do belive they are large enouph I mean look at <a href="../../../4/c/h/4chan.html" title="4chan">4chan</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_awful_forums.html" title="Something awful forums">SA Forums</a> Or Nintendo NSider Forums You don't see them deleted. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigBlueMeanie_3a01.html" title="User:BigBlueMeanie">BigBlueMeanie</a> 23:53, 24 September 2006 (UTC)BigBlueMeanie</p>
<p>Yes, thats true but those other forums are much larger then the Newgrounds one. I think that the forums should be a large section of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">Newgrounds</a> article but not an entire page. And they were recreated by the same person all three times, so it wasnt three different people wanting it on. And because it got deleted three times it just shows how worthless it is. Jarvisganon.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> The SA forums have their own article because they are largely <i>why</i> the website is so popular- the majority of the site's features come from the forums. Also, if this article has been deleted three times it should be deleted as a re-post and protected. --<a href="../../../w/a/f/User%7EWafulz_fbcf.html" title="User:Wafulz">Wafulz</a> 00:10, 25 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
