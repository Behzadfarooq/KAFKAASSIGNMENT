<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. My count of valid votes is 38 to delete (including 5 delete of merge, 4 delete and merge and 1 delete or transwiki to Wikiquote), 18 keep (inlcuding 1 merge or keep), and 18 merge (including the 'merge ands' and 'merge ors'). As the "merge and/or delete" votes can be taken as saying there shouldn't be a seperate article about this, and the transwiki vote saying that this doesn't belong on Wikipedia, then this is a consensus to delete. Many of the reasons given to delete focused on this article, whereas most of the reasons to keep were along the lines of "an unrelated incident has an article so this should have" - which doesn't explain why this article is notable enough. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 15:10, 3 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. Apparently added due to the fact that consensus was that this interview was just a blip in the actor's bio; Striver created this fork to present the interview in its entirety. Individual interviews aren't notable of mention. This is not about the content; which is already on wiki. It's about how significant an actor's opinion is in the grand scheme of things. What's covered in this article?</p>
<ul>
<li>Charlie Sheen is a member of the 9/11 truth movment, as stated in an interview with Alex Jones
<ul>
<li>fine, belongs on his page and 9-11 truth movment page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Content of interview and arguments regarding 9-11.
<ul>
<li>definitely non-notable. The same arguments have been put forth in 9-11 conspiracy article. No reason to reproduce them just because an actor repeats them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Media reaction
<ul>
<li>non-notable. We don't see <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_Wilbanks_a13c.html" title="Jennifer Wilbanks">Jennifer Wilbanks</a> categorizing every media response to the incident, and a handful of media references is far from a media frenzy.</li>

<p>Gee, looking at the "rules" listed on the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Articles_for_deletion</a> page and I fail to see the "Only count people with over 10 edits" rule. For the record I've made edits before (regarding the Oberon programming language) but I didn't bother with an account at that time. Anyway, did it ever occur to you that people with an interest in the subject simply ran accross the Charlie Sheen article via Google or Wikipedia search, saw that it had been listed for "deletion" then decided to say something about that? I hope the "powers that be" stick to the rules as stated, and not with the ones some people seem intent on making up as they go along. Nakedtruth 19:40, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is intended not as a vote but as a summary of the body position(AfD isn't a vote to begin with, anyway). I'm not saying Delete/Keep because vote &lt;&gt; some percentage; just giving a summary of a very long vote/discussion page. I'm confounded somewhat that it's official policy that this is not a voting process, but still on the admin pages there was talk over stats of the vote tally for closing admins. Moreover, I've seen it used in practice by closing admins to exclude posters with low edit counts; particularly when there is indication of meat/sockpuppetry. Considering we got an influx of anons from the 911 eyewitness AfD just a few days ago, it's not unreasonable that there are still some socks around. The 75% you cite is one editor's opinion on that talk page; it's left up to editor's discretion and tends to be a wee bit lower in practice. --<a href="../../../m/m/x/User%7EMmx1_39e2.html" title="User:Mmx1">Mmx1</a> 15:45, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> Sure, there have been other figures to come out and questioned 9/11, including a former member of Bush's own cabinent, but few interviews have garnered as much interest in as short a period of time. There is too much information on that one page to realistically merge it into Charlie Sheen's page, besides, as someone else pointed out, it's an interview between Sheen AND Jones. Does the "merge" group think it should be "merged" into both pages? Also one has to wonder why we're even having this debate. Is wikipedia running out of hard disk space?

<li>While citability is a necessary criteria for inclusion, it's not a sufficient one. It's making a mountain out of a molehill. Yes, he said he's a member of the 9-11 truth movement. That's about as notable as this event gets. You don't need an article discussing the very salient points he's making, especially when there are more intelligent people making those points. Man, don't you realize fame is usually inversely proportional to intelligence and that he's just parroting what he's heard. You might as well go right to the source and quote Alex Jones. Ya'll are aware that the political opinion of actors isn't very notable to begin with, right? First civil engineer to doubt 9-11 theories - notable. First actor - who cares?

<li><b>Merge</b> This article is a recent event about a set of theories that claim possible 'conspiracy' which in and of itself is not illegitimate for that. Conspiracy is by definition when a group gets together to commit an act. Like Lincoln's assassination and JFK's which more and more evidence indicates was a conspiracy by others. Alex Jone's does not just come up with quack conspiracy's but has massive documentation behind them. I do not agree with all his assertions but he is well sourced. Charlie Sheen is well known and this article fits wikipedia. He is not the only one who questions the official version of 9-11. Indeed it is not wrong to question, it is wrong to blindly follow anything the government says...Freemen are not Yes men, and Democracy encourages legitimate questions. Some in Academia are beginning to question 9-11 on the evidence alone. --<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENorthmeister_77ef.html" title="User:Northmeister">Northmeister</a> 06:22, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most biographies refer to any number of notable events; it's not appropriate to create discrete articles on everything mentioned in every article. Otherwise, I look forward to pages for each of Eisenhower's heart attacks, the Grateful Dead's concerts, Muhammed Ali's bouts, and George W.

<dd>To be fair, as Striver isn't American, he doesn't have the familiarity with American systems and the AJ bullshit doesn't ring on his bullshit detection as it does ours. However, a few points for you:
<ul>
<li>Congressional hearing implies Congress as a body heard the issue. In reality, one congresswomen held a hearing.</li>
<li>Showbiz tonight....well, you may not realize it wasn't on CNN, but just from title of the show? This isn't a hard-hitting investigative news show like Chris Matthews or 60 Minutes. They typically cover who's sleeping with who and who's snorting coke this week. Do we have an article on the Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston breakup? (actually never mind, we probably do&#160;:-( ). How about the nth time Gary Busey checks into the Betty Ford clinic? (a drug rehab clinic)</li>
<li>Similarly for Robert Bowman and Morgan Reynolds's claims.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Striver, you might want to consider how credible these people are if they're exaggerating and misrepresenting the significance of things like these. People have been fired for less significant misrepresentations than Bowman and Reynolds are guilty of.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - It is by any measure more notable than the abundance of other articles in Wikipedia pertaining to more or less globally obscure subjects.

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Clean Up and Merge</b> This compilation of quasi-quotes and talk-media response to the interview is a mess and not notable for purposes of being a separate article. If there were substantial clean-up efforts, parts could be merged either into the 9/11 Truth Movement or into the Charlie Sheen article. As it is, it looks like an archive of a pseudo-transcript. As a celebrity news current event article it has some validity, though not in its current form. My only question is this: How long do "current event" articles maintain that status? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAnde_B._3091.html" title="User:Ande B.">Ande B.</a> 09:06, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Isisnosiris, Attributing motivation to others is seldom useful for producing anything other than offense. I don't see any "fear" among these comments, only people who put more emphasis on notability and others who emphasize the content or political context of the article. These are just interests that sometimes coincide and at other times compete with one another. Please avoid the pop psychologizing.
