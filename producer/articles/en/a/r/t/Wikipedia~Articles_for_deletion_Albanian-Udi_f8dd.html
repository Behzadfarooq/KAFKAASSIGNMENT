<li>You're correct. My apologies for only looking at the <a href="../../../u/d/i/Udi_people.html" title="Udi people">Udi people</a> article. For that reason, the article could be deleted. But as it is, the article is nominated for deletion due to POV concerns, which would be inappropriate; the information presented in the article is definitely of notability and can be expressed in a NPOV manner. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a> 01:17, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Given that this article as is, is copypasted from a section of the article <a href="../../../r/e/l/Religion_in_Azerbaijan_364f.html" title="Religion in Azerbaijan">Religion_in_Azerbaijan</a>, there is no other way than requesting its deletion. First, if we were to delete every non-sourceble parts of this article, no more than three lines would remain, and I am optimistic there. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 22:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

See also [www.nhe-az.org], although I don't know how to make a permanent link to this page. Why can't Wikipedia have an article for a marginal religious community while it has plenty of articles for marginal villages, locations etc?

<dd>So Albanian Udi is a religion? Before assuming bad faith and accusing voters of things, please visit both articles I have cited, more particularly the one on Religions in Azerbaijan. The only reason this article talk about religion is because it was created by copypasting from another article. Its content word by word exist in another article, and its subject also has its own article. Albanian Udi and Udi people is the same thing. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 16:20, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>First of all, I am not accusing, I am guessing. Please, assume good faith yourself. I have read all the articles you had mentioned, but my point of view is different from yours. I don't see anything wrong in creating an aricle by copypasting from some part of another article, expecting that the new article will be expanded by someone. Many WP articles have emerged from parts of other articles. That's all. I am not going to spend my time discussing this anymore.

<dd>Well, if you want my apology, I hereby apologize, although I have not stated that you are AAC. I wrote: <i>that they belong to the Armenian Apostolic Christians or are otherwise linked to Armenia</i>. If it is irrelevant here that you guys are linked to Armenia, excuse me. I just guessed that it could be relevant. Certainly, it could be irrelevant as well. Nobody knows. Again, nothing personal, but as to Wikipedia, I am an inclusionist, and I can hardly understand people who strive to eradicate such harmless articles. They may be not very interesting as of now, but certainly they are not hoaxes and there is a chance that they will be improved. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColchicum_15ab.html" title="User:Colchicum">Colchicum</a> 17:42, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - And following the logic of deletion supporters: Why then have Nagorno-Karabakh and Artsakh pages?-- <a href="../../../a/t/a/User%7EAtabek_e9c3.html" title="User:Atabek">Atabek</a> 07:53, 12 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>This is a stupid comparaison sorry. Artsakh is a historic geographic place when Udi people and Albanian Udi are just synonimous. Artsakh and NK could be compared with Constantinople and Istanbul, while Udi-people and Albanian-Udi could be compared with 'Amenian people' and 'Armenians.' They're both a redirect of the same thing. Requesting keep just because Armenians happened to vote delete, without even bothering to understand the arguments amuses me, really. <a href="../../../f/a/d/User%7EFadix_6a88.html" title="User:Fadix"><i>Fad</i></a> <a href="../../../f/a/d/User_talk%7EFadix_d061.html" title="User talk:Fadix">(ix)</a> 13:21, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
