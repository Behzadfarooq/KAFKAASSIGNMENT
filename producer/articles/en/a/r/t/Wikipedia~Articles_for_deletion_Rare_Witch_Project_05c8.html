<p><b>Keep:</b> This is not a website advertisement. It's a factual resource for information pertaining to the history of a few games and how this website uncovered secrets about them. I would love to know why this article can't stay up, and nobody has taken the time to properly explain why this article supposedly fails to meet <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>. We have "Media re-prints of press releases and advertising for the content or site." The website is <b>the</b> Rareware website, and is very famous within the gaming community. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowjinjo_39a3.html" title="User:Rainbowjinjo">Andre</a> 02:59, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
<b>Keep:</b> This is an informative page citing the discoveries of the Rare Witch Project. I see no bias, just factual information. The Rare Witch Project is a non profit website needs no form of advertisement whatsoever. I know exactly who you are <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a>, you should be more careful with your IP address. This page has <b>absolutely</b> nothing to do with the forums, and should be kept out of your personal vendetta with the forum members. Your viewpoint is unbiased and you obviously have nothing to contribute. piXelQueen</p>
<p><b>Keep:</b> <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a>, who apparently is in fact <a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStylesr_1523.html" title="User:Stylesr">Stylesr</a>, has a personal vendetta against this website and has gone to great lengths to have it attacked. He's a regular member of the <a href="../../../y/t/m/YTMND_ce03.html" title="YTMND">YTMND</a> community and can be found bragging about "trolling" and causing problems at the Rare Witch Project. He accuses the members of taking the internet too seriously, yet all his energy seems to be spent on trying to take us down. So therefore, in turn, I don't think he or his deletion nominations should be taken seriously either. I personally think anyone who agrees with this nomination is feeding a troll. --Gordraf 20:23, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Excuse me? I bragged about trolling? I just saw this article and said it was not neutral nothing worng in that is it, plus I haven;t been to the forums in while and I intend to keep it that way. And what does being a member of the YTMND community have anyhitng to do with this? --<a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStylesr_1523.html" title="User:Stylesr">Stylesr</a> 20:56, 19 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>"I just saw this article and said it was not neutral nothing worng in that is it" There is if the article <i>is</i> neutral again I repeat "no bias, just factual information" how can you say it's not neutral. This isn't about anyone's opinion, just a page showing the achievements of the Rare Witch Project. piXelQueen</p>
<p>SO mandy I haer you been enjopying your admin powers deleting and editiing posts and threads like the fascist you are. Also the trolling ah yes it always the troll but don't worry about the other people who posted death threats, personal insults and other stuff about me since troll and spammers are your top priority. If you feel that your organization has been characterized unfairly enjoy discrimination under the same heavy-handed, pious, one-size-fits-all policy that you've been inflicting upon me. --<a href="../../../s/t/y/User%7EStylesr_1523.html" title="User:Stylesr">Stylesr</a> 01:23, 20 May 2006 (UTC)Stylesr</p>
<ul>
<li>Oh stop victimizing yourself. When you first joined the forums as Lamentofgrunty, people accepted you until you started acting like an idiot. You've brought all this on yourself. If there's certain bias towards you, it's well deserved. If you think you can act like this and do all these things and then turn it around to try and make yourself the innocent party, you're deeply misguided. I've said it many times before and I'll say it again: this is <i>your</i> waste of time. Your actions towards us make no difference in the long run, as we manage to get on with things in the community. You're the one who has to make this persistent effort. We just sit here and take it, and not in a bad way. It's like a mosquito trying to get blood... you keep trying to bite us, but we keep swatting you off with no effort whatsoever. We can't keep this up forever -- one of us has to eventually give up. It's not going to be us. We have nothing to lose. --Gordraf 01:35, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>True to settle this I wil give up the verict is keep anyways all I ask is that you not mention me or anyhting about me ever again in the fourms and I will leave anything to do with RWP alone. If your willing to forget I am --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 01:58, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also Speak for yourselves don't think your completly innocent either you've done somehtings to me that you know were not deserved and your actions to me make no difference either yet people conttiunally get annoyed even thoguth I haven;t been to the forums after the Lolinternet nope not even a peek, I want it to stay that way so Here's the deal stop mentioning me for good, Stop with the stupid stories and RPGs stop with these Retarted childish gimmicks and i'll not be a bother to you anymore. I think the Verdict is Keep. SO i'll go now and you forget about me so I can forget about you and that we we can both be happy. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 02:13, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I admit things haven't been handled in the most respectable of ways, so that seems fair enough if you're serious this time. I'll try and end the discussion of you on the forums. I've already taken care of the RPG. I'll definitely respect your wish if you respect us in turn. In the end, that's all it really boils down to. As for this article, it's a relatively minor feature of the Rare Witch Project, so there shouldn't be any mention of forums, members, etc. Our seperate Wiki will need some work. I'm not exactly sure what's been written about you on there as I've mostly tried to stay away from all of that, but I'll definitely straighten anything out that needs work. --Gordraf 05:01, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well I wasn;t GTFOer on the wiki omly on the forums.. who e er that was I don;t know, but you could delete the article about me also how can you see my IP adress here when your not sysops? Another on Of Andre's Stupid intimadtion things I suppose just to let you know I haven;t visisted the forums since LOL internet. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 13:04, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Actually, despite your persistance to blame me for every last thing, I was tipped off by another Wikipedia member. --<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowjinjo_39a3.html" title="User:Rainbowjinjo">Andre</a> 02:46, 21 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus wasn;t sstzelda worse than me How come no one cares about him? --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 19:40, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Because he doesn't periodically reappear. --s.w.a.t</li>
</ul>
<p>Ah hello swat would you like me to pull out that im convo were you were a total retard?? --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 23:30, 20 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Retard?" Is immaturity your only weapon? Nobody called you names. We find it extremely annoying that you keep popping up and attacking the site/forum wherever you can. This is Wikipedia. It is supposed to be an unbiased source of information. You do <b>NOT</b> bring forum grudges onto Wikipedia. That's a no-no, little mister--<a href="../../../b/o/t/User%7EBottles98_35b6.html" title="User:Bottles98">Bottles98</a> 18:15, 22 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hmmm sure but you should know whoever thatlamentofkings guy is he is not me and he should be banned for impersonation I already said I don;t wanna post on the forums again and I mean it. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 01:33, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>He is not pretending to be you. Although, you really should techinically be banned for having two Wikipedia accounts to complain about us. Or at least, please, rescind your deletion request. This Wiki page is unrelated to your problems with the forums. As you will see on Bottles98's user discussion page, an administrator will soon be brought into this. So please, just end it.--<a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainbowjinjo_39a3.html" title="User:Rainbowjinjo">Andre</a> 02:09, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>The verdict is already keep. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 19:11, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also the <b>Lamentofkings</b> guy is not me I don't ever want to return to the forums he is a imposter cuz I'm not returning to the forums. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathvader_e6bc.html" title="User:Deathvader">Deathvader</a> 19:15, 23 May 2006 (UTC)</p>
