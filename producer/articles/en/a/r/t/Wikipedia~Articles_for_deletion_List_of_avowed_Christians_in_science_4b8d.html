However, there was an attempt to tighten criteria and introduce greater sourcing in the new article and thus they are not identical; after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Splash#Re-created_lists" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Splash#Re-created_lists" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> it was decided to place it back on AfD.

<li><b>Delete</b> not just because it's listcruft, but also because an exhaustive list would be vast (half the Christian Union at uni were scientists, and several of them are now Professors, in the British university system sense of occupying chairs or being head of department). Also, it's arbitrary, and worst of all it entirely fails to explore the fundamental issue (namely the relationship between science and Christianity).

<dd>I'd accept that. I'm normally a rule abiding person and I wasn't intending to hurt the integrity of the place. It's just that on the deletion page of the Christian one I got some sense a list like this would be acceptable. I wasn't "sneaky", in case that's a concern, as if you check the delete page I said I'd make this page to see if it's more what's wanted.

<dd>That said "religious believers" might be broad enough it'd be unacceptable. Possibly "theologians in science"(with sections for different religions) or "Writers concerned with 'religion and science'" would be better. Although ideally I'd prefer it to stay specific to Christianity, as we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Muslim_scientists_and_philosophers_2f5f.html" title="List of Muslim scientists and philosophers">List of Muslim scientists and philosophers</a> already, I'd accept that kind of change.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.

<li><b>Keep and rename</b> I voted to delete the original articles as too vauge, it could encompass any scientist who called themselves Christian or Catholic - which is just about all of them before modern times, and for many scientists their religion has played little or no part in their science. However, I see where this article wants to go, it want to include those people who are notable both for being religious and for being in science. And that is an important cross over, for many of them have been influential in the science and religion debates over the ages - many will have published cross-disciplinary works (e.g. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Polkinghorne_9e70.html" title="John Polkinghorne">John Polkinghorne</a>). Providing this isn't a list of scientists who go to church, or clergymen with an MA in physics, but the subjects are notable for being cross-disciplinary, then keep. But rename - and I'm not sure what. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 00:47, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>If it survives it will be renamed.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Achieves relevance and verifiability. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 07:47, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. More POV mixing of orthagonal groups into a single list. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 20:54, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Refactor</b>. The list is useless as it is. It only becomes useful when it is a list of those who have commented in some way on the relationship of their own faith to their science. I would get rid of all the rest, where they are merely people who have done science and are known to be believers. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Polkinghorne_9e70.html" title="John Polkinghorne">John Polkinghorne</a> is perhaps the canonical (excuse the pun) example who would belong on the list. Some title change is absolutely necessary ('avowed Christians' is POV). However, if this isn't the community consensus, then it would be better to <b>delete</b> and start over again. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 21:00, 24 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. One of the best of these types of lists that I've seen. Could be an extremely useful starting point for students.

<dd>Thanks. I'd prefer it stay about Christianity, others on other religions is fine, but I was willing to expand if that'll save it from delete.

<dd>Okay, I respect that. However statements there included "In brief: the quality of these lists is too low for them to be useful. It doesn't say how they were made or what the criteria for inclusion are, and no sources are given, so cleanup is practically impossible. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">User:Dpbsmith</a>." I tried to make very clear what the criteria are here and pretty much all sources are listed. "First, it's impossible as a list, as all Western scientists prior to Henry VIII were "Catholic," and scientists don't have to declare their affiliation when they get their special Science Card and secret handshake in graduate school." I added that all names before 1600 have to be noted as such. Scientists may not have to list their religious affiliation, but in the case of in least Eyring it was mentioned at the National Academy of Science obituary. Other objections to that list was that it was too arbitrary or too loosely associated. I think that should be much less true now.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T.
