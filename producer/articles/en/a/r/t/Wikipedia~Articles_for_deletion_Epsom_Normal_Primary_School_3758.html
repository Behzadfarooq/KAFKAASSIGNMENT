<ul>
<li>It is never enough. Bands that haven't done anything significant out of their community don't get a mention in wikipedia. The only pub burnt down in my home town - that was massive for the community, but doesn't warrant an article in wikipedia. Why should schools not get the same treatment? What makes every single school so notable that it needs its own article? <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 07:38, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Importance to the local community is usually not enough <i>because</i> it <i>usually</i> means there a dearth of sources that genuinely meet the standards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. A school's own website is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Company_and_organization_websites" title="WP:RS">borderline</a>, as a source. I personally wouldn't reject information from such sources, but I'm not very happy about school articles where the only real source is an external link to the school's website. In the case of the article under discussion, at this moment we currently have a very odd situation in which there <b>is</b> an external link independent of the school... but that link is not used to support any facts that are currently in the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Verifiability is all-important, but that standard is only relevant to notability to the extent that articles on non-notable things are often also unverifiable. School AFD's would be more interesting if the basic verifiability of these articles was under fire, but generally its not. (As far as school websites go, I usually consider these okay sources for basic info, e.g. enrollment, principal, location, etc., especially for government schools.) To address the other points made above -- mention of that burned-down pub might be worth including in the article on the community, if it was as significant as you indicate. Nor does a keep vote on this AFD imply that the school deserves "its own article"; discussion of whether to merge the article belongs on the article talk page; the primary question here is whether the content should be deleted. A keep consensus never precludes a merger that retains the content. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 23:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are a lot more things that are verifiable than are on wikipedia - mainly because they are not notable. AFD revolves largely around verifiability and notability. Schools are the only thing on wikipedia where the majority of keep votes ignore the notability. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't think people are ignoring the notability so much as there is a dispute over (1) whether notability is an appropriate standard, (2) whether schools are notable or not. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 05:56, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Come on, "grow Organically'? The article has been around since 10/2005, and it's still a stub. Only the recent AfD encouraged any 'growth'. There is an innate reason that primary schools are not as notable or important as high schools. School athletics and the fact that this (High School) is where people prepare for college (and/or the rest of their lives). Not everyone graduates highschool but nearly everyone has gone through a primary school. I've never heard of a college recruiting from a primary school. The only time I have heard about primary schools in the news is when a child is sent home for some violation of zero-tolerance or (and I hate when I hear it) some child is injured or some maniac goes nuts in the school. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I actually favor deleting nn primary schools but the age (120 yrs) and the existence of an English/Mandarin bilingual curriculum (which I presume is rare in New Zealand) strike me as (marginally) enough notability for a topic that doesn't have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 21:02, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> I would contend that it does have <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues as one of the sources cited is a government article just talking about school (as the government has tens if not hundreds of these reports...are all the schools notable then?). The other link gives an error however a google cache shows an article created for a government newsletter/magazine. If that is all <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires, lets nominate every primary school around the world as notable--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 21:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and allow for organic growth. Verifiability criteria has been satisfied. <a href="../../../b/a/h/User%7EBahn_Mi_d240.html" title="User:Bahn Mi">Bahn Mi</a> 00:31, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The school was formed in 1886, and the backstory regarding Chinese integration is an interesting one. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 08:28, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
