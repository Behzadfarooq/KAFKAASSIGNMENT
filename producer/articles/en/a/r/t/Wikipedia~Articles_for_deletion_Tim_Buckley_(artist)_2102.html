<li>This article gets a lot of <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> violations, while apparently lots of people dislike this guy, reliable sources don't exist (or at least, never end up getting cited) to back up any of this criticism. This has led to the article being redirected to <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a> in the past, on the basis that there isn't enough information on this guy from "acceptable" sources to ever write a complete article.

<li><b>Redirect</b> to <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a>. While Tim Buckley is one of the most notable webcomic artists, his fame is directly centered around his comic. He's almost unknown outside of webcomics, which means he doesn't really qualify for an article by himself. He's also the target of a lot of hostility. Any article regarding him is going to have a lot of hate directed at it, and per the guidelines on living persons, we should avoid criticisms unless they can be extensively sourced. Most of this stuff isn't even sourced at all. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:16, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for the same reasons that <a href="../../../b/r/i/Brian_Clevinger_6a77.html" title="Brian Clevinger">Brian Clevinger</a> has his own article. Both are very popular webcomics with similar fanbases and both have appeared numerous times at fan conventions to general acclaim. As Brian often says, they're both decently popular "interweb celebrities," and should be kept as such. Just because information here is mentioned on another site doesn't mean that an encyclopedia shouldn't include information on him as well. <a href="../../../r/p/h/User%7ERPH_0dcc.html" title="User:RPH">RPH</a> 22:24, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Redirect</b> as per W.marsh and Lankybugger. Because the <a href="../../../l/i/v/WP%7ELIVING_79ba.html" title="WP:LIVING">WP:LIVING</a> violations are frequent and egregious, I recommend locking the redirect down.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Currently, there's nothing in the article which can't be moved to the article on Ctrl+Alt+Del. It only mentions him in the context of the comic itself, or in direct relation to the website hosting the comic (IE Charities he promoted on the site, merchandise he sells related to the site, etc). There's nothing asserting Tim Buckley's notability outside of CTRL+ALT+DEL, which already has an extensive article. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:15, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>reply</b> if we moved every article that didn't have much content at one point or another, we wouldn't have any of wikipedia's featured articles. This "what's the harm of a redirect" attitude is really not helpful. This person is distinct from the comic he writes/draws and has done things unrelated to CAD. Senseless redirects are a bad idea. Delete the article if it's innappropriate(which I doubt), but don't redirect unless there's honestly a reason to expect one(namely misspellings, synonyms, and non-notable spinoffs. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 19:52, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>rebuttal</b> This is indeed the point of contention, whether Buckley has notable contributions outside his comic. Earlier, Buckley was compared to Brian Clevinger. The difference between them is that Clevinger does have other ventures dealing with separate IP and collaborations involving individuals who <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Oeming_bd3b.html" title="Michael Oeming">do</a> have some measure of notability in their respective industries. Even this article, as it is, reflects Buckley's current lack of non-encyclopedic accomplishments, couching everything in terms of its relation to his comic. And, if we're willing to count there are exactly zero (0) lines in this article that do not mention <a href="../../../c/t/r/Ctrl%2BAlt%2BDel_6254.html" title="Ctrl+Alt+Del">Ctrl+Alt+Del</a> <a href="../../../d/a/o/User%7EDaoKaioshin_8912.html" title="User:DaoKaioshin">DaoKaioshin</a> 22:38, 15 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply again</b> My point was on the notion of theory not on present article state. A person is not the same as a webcomic, and really shouldn't be redirected as such. Redirects discourage actaully making an article out of something. His entry into the "hottest gamer" or whatever it was that was an international competition is a unique aspect that could be ascribed to him without being more than tangentially related to CAD. And while this information is not presently in the article, <i>it could be</i> and a redirect would discourage that and similar information from ever being added to wikipedia, thus is contrary to the fundemental mission of wikipedia, and I strongly oppose any redirect, and would stand for a <b>delete</b> over a redirect. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 05:39, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
