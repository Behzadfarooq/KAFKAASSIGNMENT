<p>Non-notable politician.

<li><b>Keep strongly.</b> Proposer has moved that Fosett and other candidates in the June 14th primary be removed on the grounds they did not do well. He has an article so to make a complete record of the election. I do not think it fair to decide legitimate candidates for an important office do not merit articles because they did not do well in the campaign. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedanticallySpeaking_fbd8.html" title="User:PedanticallySpeaking">PedanticallySpeaking</a> 14:47, August 9, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>, not only did he not win the election, he didn't even get 3% in the <i>primary</i>. I don't even know if that even qualifies him as a politician. Even the real nominated candidates in Congressional elections are rarely notable if they don't win or do something that sets them apart. There's 435 of them every 2 years, going back to the 18th century, and there's <i>many</i> more failed "candidates" in the primaries. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 15:53, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, just to clarify, I know there weren't always 435 going all the way back over 200 years, but there still were loads of them every 2 years throughout the nation's history. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:44, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Uh, probably merge, or something</b>. I can't think of anything significant he did to garner significant attention. I know he got some minor notice from bloggers who were attracted by his economically-very-conservative-yet-socially-moderate stance, but as far as real media attention I know of very little (only the one Enquirer editorial already cited in the article). I agree with PedanticallySpeaking that it is important to have a complete record of the election, however I think that the current situation with separate articles for all is overkill, and that (s)merging them all into the <a href="../../../o/h/i/Ohio_Second_Congressional_District_Election%2C_2005_ca67.html" title="Ohio Second Congressional District Election, 2005">Ohio Second Congressional District Election, 2005</a> article is probably not a bad course of action. Imagine if we had an article for every candidate in the California recall election! (Oh wait ... do we? I really don't want to check, because I'm really afraid of what I might find.) <i>In the interests of full disclosure, I should say that I have a personal relationship with the subject of this article. To elaborate on what R. fiend said: I don't think he considers himself to be a "politician" either. He's a teacher and a "lawyer in rehab" for now.</i> <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a><a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerion_8e19.html" title="User talk:Aerion">//talk</a> 22:07, 9 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP or MERGE</b>. This was one of the rare competitive Congressional elections in recent memory, and one of the few to get national attention. At the very least, the information on each of the candidates up for deletion should be moved onto the main page for the OH-2 election. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 16:06, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The primary reason this garnered national attention is because it was a special election. If this occured during a standard election cycle, these men would be even less than historical footnotes. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 16:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't know about that. There are often up to 3 or 4 special elections every cycle. How much did you hear about the special election in North Carolina last year? That was a district drawn to represent a Democrat and a Democrat won easily. Ohio-2 is a district drawn to represent a Republican and yet, for whatever reason, a Republican almost lost. It's important to note all the people involved so that the reader will get a picture as to why this election was different. I'm not saying they have to have all their own pages, but at the very least they should each get a more expanded mention on the central page for OH-2, and a link to their own websites, if they had a website. I also wanted to mention that out of all the OH-2 candidates up for deletion, I think Peter has the most grounds to keep his own separate page, as he was the only one who seemed to be noted by the local media as having a good future in politics. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 16:37, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I had to choose I'd say that Fossett was probably one of the most irrelevant candidate. Jean Schimdt, a Republican, was chosen by Portman to succeed him. Fosset challenging Portman's pick as a Republican was a sure way to fail quite spectacularly, something he did. 2.3%? Doesn't seem very bright to me. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 17:09, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>He placed 6th out of the field of candidates, and he was specifically praised by the Cinci Enquirer, which may indicate a future run for him. Considering that Schmidt gave the weakest performance of any Republican OH-2 nominee in over 30 years, maybe Fossett wasn't too wrong after all. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 18:10, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Schimdt's relatively poor showing has nothing to do with Fossett. It was directly tied to the backlash against Bush and the Republican party building because of increased numbers of killed soldiers in Iraq, a disturbing number of whom call Ohio home. To assume that anything Fossett said or did impacted Schimdt's campaign or vote count is illogical. If Fossett does run in the future, and manages to get more than a statistically insignificant portion of the vote, he can have an article. Until then, he's just a footnote. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:08, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't feel that Schmidt's performance had nothing to do with Fossett, but you were the one who said that he didn't "seem very bright" for running against her. You connected the two and I went along with your train of thought. As for the rest, I think that based on his coming in 6th and the comments of the Enquirer, there is enough there for at least a small article. But as long as some of that information is moved over to the main OH-2 election page if or when Fossett's page is deleted, the deletion won't bother me. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 19:24, 10 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "seem very bright" that was in response to what you characterized as Fossett's "good future in politics." I meant that his future in politics didn't look bright. Now that you mention it, running against a member of your own party endorsed by the seat's previous holder isn't too bright either. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 19:29, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have no personal opinion on Fossett. What I said was that the Cincinatti Enquirer had praise for him, and that seemed to suggest he may have a good future in politics. They are one of the leading conservative papers in the city, and probably in all of Ohio, so if they see something in him, then they must have had some basis. I don't know why Portman endorsed Schmidt but she was not the choice of a lot of power brokers in that district and she will probably be lucky to survive her next primary. Anyway, I guess this is off topic. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB3_3655.html" title="User:JamesB3">JamesB3</a> 19:47, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Who told you that Rob Portman endorsed Jean Schmidt? That's outright wrong; Portman officially endorsed no candidate in the primary. That reason for claiming non-notability is bogus. There are other ones that are pretty valid. The rest of this discussion belongs elsewhere, which is where I will now take it. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerion_926e.html" title="User:Aerion">Aerion</a><a href="../../../a/e/r/User_talk%7EAerion_8e19.html" title="User talk:Aerion">//talk</a> 01:43, 11 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Agree with Pedantically Speaking and JamesB3. At the very least, this information should be merged into the article about the district or the election.
