<li><b>Keep</b> The content of the article is consistent with its title. The facts cited and presented therein raise sufficient questions about some of the events surrounding 9/11. As such, its inclusion is appropriate and helps to counter the systemic bias for which Wikipedia has been criticized. abhatnag 23:59, 25 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>That is untrue. Convert it to a stub if need be, but I can't believe there's nothing in the article at all that should not be preserved.

<ul>
<li>While the article in question does add include a high degree of detail regarding many of its claims, the existing conspiracy articles are more logically named and NPOV. Adding things like fleshed-out details about the stand-down order to existing articles in a way that is NPOV would be a good thing, as they provide a much more solid foundation for <i>legitimate</i> expansion than the article up for deletion.<a href="../../../n/a/t/User%7ENatusRoma_5ad4.html" title="User:NatusRoma">NatusRoma</a> 19:46, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'm glad somebody got some value out of the article before deletion. My article is too big to merge with smaller articles mentioned, without major edit fights.

<li><b>Keep for now</b> Until all assertions have been merged or the article renamed. Bogus, your article should be merged with existing ones or renamed. "9/11 Open Questions" is too vague. How about "Explanations of the events of 9/11"? One other point: do remove the redundancy from the article and link to the articles containing the information. Go to the discussion pages of those articles to question whether they should be renamed.

</ul>
<p>I am not an American and I don't give a shit if all you are enslaved by a corrupt theocratic messianic dictator, who throws people into jail without due process and who orders murders of American citizens and torture of innocent people abroad. But perhaps this allows me to stay more objective regarding 11/9. The official story is full of holes and inconsistencies. Some can be explained, some can't because of the wall of secrecy surrounding these events. By placing all concerns in a page called <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>, Wikipedians make a judgement statement, implying that all these stories are bullshit.</p>
<p>For an example of a relatively unbiased and well-developed article, see <a href="../../../k/e/n/Kennedy_assassination_theories.html" title="Kennedy assassination theories">Kennedy assassination theories</a>. Compared to it, the 11/9 article on conspiracies is a joke. Supporters of official version are quick to carefully minimize the effects of their opponents' edits, by removing as much as they can.</p>
<p>The <i>open questions</i> article is a good start in fixing this deficiency of Wikipedia. It would be a shame, if a majority rule would essencially censor this topic - especially since most of the "arguments" for deletion center around it being POV. Guess what, the "conspiracies" article is the opposite POV. I vote <b>Keep</b>, but a careful and unbiased <b>merge</b> with existing articles would be a good option as well, provided that Bush supporters can control their urge to silence the opponents. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 07:08, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>keep</b> POV should be rewritten not deleted. 'conspiracy theoy' is what I would call the mainstream George Bush viewpoint... I see nothing very highly POV in this article or anything nonfactual.... and if there is POV, the solution is to edit not delete, if there are nonfactual entries, they should be edited or corrceted, not deleted. <a href="../../../p/e/d/User%7EPedant_30ce.html" title="User:Pedant">Pedant</a> 22:58, 2005 Mar 29 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As a <i>general rule</i>, yes, when an article is POV, it is preferable to edit rather than delete. However, the class of exceptions that leaps right out is when an article is not just POV but a POV fork, which this is -- Bogusstory came right out and admitted that he created this article because he couldn't make people accept what he wanted to do at the <i>existing</i> article on the 9/11 attacks. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 04:27, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A POV fork? Can you get POV knives too? What are you on about? And if there are people who prevented him from altering the existing article, i.e. unanalysingly deleted the assertions he added, does that mean they are right? <a href="../../../m/r/j/User%7EMrJones_864d.html" title="User:MrJones">Mr. Jones</a> 11:38, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you don't know what a POV fork is, perhaps you're not as ready for VfD as you think. A POV fork is similar to a <a href="../../../c/o/d/Code_fork.html" title="Code fork">code fork</a>: there's a difference of opinion and rather than <i>resolving</i> that difference of opinion, one or both parties says "Okay, you do it <i>your</i> way over <i>there</i>; I'll be over <i>here</i> doing it <i>my</i> way." In open source, forking a project can be a healthy response to a difference in opinion. In Wikipedia it is recognized as an unacceptable alternative to actually resolving the issue. We want the best article that can be written on each subject, not one article containing X's slant on the subject, another containing Y's slant on it, a third for Z's, et cetera. That's <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinfo.html" title="Wikinfo">Wikinfo</a>'s major modus operandi, but it's not Wikipedia's. Addressing your "if" -- yes, <b>if</b> the people who reverted his changes at the existing 9/11 articles did it by "unanalysingly deleting" his assertions, that would be against the policies of Wikipedia. Even if that unproven claim that the deletions were unanalysed and unthinking was true, however (and if I had a dime for every user who claims "they reverted my edits for <i>no good reason</i>" when the good reason is plain as day to everyone <i>but</i> that user...) two wrongs don't make a right. We have mechanisms in place for resolving article content disputes and POV forking is not one of them. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:06, 3 Apr 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have a few comments. First, I guess that <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogusstory_01dd.html" title="User:Bogusstory">Bogusstory</a> might want to have a copy of the article in his user space - now is the time to make that copy. Second, I believe that the discussing points out that there are serious shortcomings in Wikipedia coverage of "tricky issues" related to 9/11. The US government was caught lying many times - the whole WMD fiasco, the attack on that Italian journalist, the prison torture, etc. I absolutely fail to see how being contrary to the official line indicates that a version is wrong. It isn't even too farfetched that Bush himself ordered a strike on the towers - worse things happened. Well, this one may be a little bit over the top... but that doesn't mean there is nothing fishy about the 9/11 story.</dd>
<dd>I suggest that we create some placeholder stubs that can be used to expand that coverage. Their talk pages could then be used to discuss how to do it best. Meanwhile, this article should, of course, be deleted according to Wikipedia procedure. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParanoid_098f.html" title="User:Paranoid">Paranoid</a> 09:48, 4 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I improved the article during the election on the evening of March 27. If we count votes from Derek Ross and after, I see 10 deletes, 5 keeps and 1 merge. From my understanding, the Wiki rules on deletion allow an article to improve and address concerns while the election is going on and the consensus is to reflect on the improved article. <a href="../../../b/o/g/User%7EBogusstory_01dd.html" title="User:Bogusstory">Bogusstory</a> 23:18, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>If your belief is that you can get votes discounted by saying "I improved the article; now none of the votes cast prior to that improvement count", you're quite mistaken. That isn't the way it works. The best you can hope for is that someone who already voted might decide to change their vote if they think the change in the article merits a change of vote. I wouldn't count on that if I were you. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 23:40, 8 Apr 2005 (UTC)</dd>
