<dd><b>Comment</b> As I have stated many times before, my involvement has been limited to ensuring accuracy of the content, with much repair that still remains to be done on the page. A pee-reviewed publication is upcoming, although there have been other reputable professional publications as well. The fact that the work is NOTABLE according to Wiki standards is beyond question... It is a sad day for Wikipedia when a spiteful non-entity with no understanding of physics (e.g. see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211080" class="external autonumber" title="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0211080" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) can ask for deletion of an experiment that's the center of much current debate in the academia. Danko Georgieve's complete lack of knowledge on the subject matter is known (and has been publicly stated) by many physicists including Unruh, Drezet, Kastner, Motl, and some wikipedians who've had the chance to engage him in conversation. Many experts who would wish to keep this article are not Wikipedians and are too busy to get into arguments with somebody who's not "even wrong." If such individuals as the nominator of this 2nd deletion request are to constantly interfere and destabilize the article, then I may join the ranks of Wiki critics who have little if any faith in its reliability.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Dear Afshar, personal attacks cannot establish the truthness of your work. There is nothing violating Wikipedia politics for nominating an article for second time to be deleted.

<dd>I beg to differ. Nominating an article for deletion one month after its previous nomination concluded with an overwelming consensus to keep the article without giving any new facts is not going to achieve something. It does not help to build the encyclopaedia. Hence it is against policy.</dd>

<dd>I have made no personal attacks on Georgieve who has been fully rebuffed by other physicists as well as myself in my weblog and elsewhere. Pointing out the facts is not an attack, it is a simple "heads up" for those who do not know this person's motives. As Prof. Hewitt said, this 2nd deletion nomination is an abuse of Wiki procedures.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. There seems to have BIG DIFFERENCE with the last time. Now it seems that the number of DELETE votes has increased. If the work of Afshar was true it would have tendency to corroborate in time, yet this does not happen. The page is almost fully serving the purpose of Afshar AS IS NOW, so it must start with a lot of other basic principles on complementarity. By the way, my entry on complementarity was VANDALIZED by Afshar, and this is evidence that he and his friends control all relevant pages that have something to do with complementarity. THIS IS VIOLATION OF WIKI politics, VANDALISM is not acceptable, and IF Afshar wants to delete an entry he must at least suggest it for voting before deletion. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:21, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s> The Afshar page doesnt contribute to physics but only to disinformation. There is no thing of founded in this experiment untill the result will be published in a peer reviewed journal and discussed by professional on the same criteria. If WP policies don't correct this kind of thing it is all the pertinence of the WP project which seems for me senseless. Naturally the fact that many good works were controversial before to be accepted could look as a counter example. However this works were at least discussed by physicist and not in the public place. It is only science which can define science and discussion like that show there is a problem here. My conclusion since Afsahr work has not been aproved or disaproved by science you should not keep the page .In other case this is more like superstitions and is pseudo-science.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Aureline, this experiment has put an abrupt end to 8 decades of bullying by the orthodoxy, and sadly for your side, the cat is out of the bag and there is no going back. I wonder what other means of stifling dissent you guys would come up with when the paper gets published in a peer-reviewed journal. As for the technical rebuttal, (although this is hardly the place for it) I have responded to your criticisms without receiving a response. As I have asked before, one simple question: what process other than interference can account for the lack of flux on the wires? Please respond using QM formalism.

<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Afshar, there is NO WHICH WAY information in your experiment and the photon is holographically at both detectors. And YES, in order to have holographic image YOU NEED INTERFERENCE, but there is NO WHICH WAY info. See the recent posts of my 4 slit experiment with two different density matrices, and see also the CARL LOOPER's entry suggesting a holographic experiment with "virtual pinhole". Yes, I agree that Aurelien et al., suggest wrong physics and no interference, but others (including me) have explained your experiment with rigorous math and with holography [no which way]. Once you see that this is the loophole in your interpretation, you will be glad that actually you have not yet published the article. The difference between me and you will be that I have withdrawn a preprint [at ArXiv] but I have NEVER withdrawn peer-reviewed paper(!), while you will have withdraw a published one. <b>I am almost sure that you will find some low quality journal without impact factor, and you will publish your work, but my friendly advise is "Do NOT do that", you will score an auto-goal.</b> <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 04:10, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> To Afshar: The problem here is not if my argumentation (or one other ) is good or not (but of course my argumentation is the correct one&#160;:)). The problem concern the objectivity of the WP concerning your work. This page doesnt fulfill the basic rule of a scientific&#160;: don't amalgamate the agreement of the large public with the one of professional. for this reason and many others this page should desapear from WP. Concerning my objection it is not the place here and I said already what I think about Afsahre work's several times: i will nor repeat again Aurelien <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDrezet_d217.html" title="User:Drezet">Drezet</a> January</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Danko, here's what a fellow-Wikipedian says about you: <i><b>"its clear that he [Danko Georgiev] not only doesn't know QM, but he doesn't even understand basic undergraduate analysis."</b></i> Please do not force me to put out the other unflattering remarks from the physicists who have had the misfortune of interacting with you. I do not enjoy doing this, but for the interest of historic record, I will not hesitate to reveal to newcomers the various kinds of opposition I am facing. Enough said! P.S.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have grave concerns that the strong personalities at play in this AfD discussion will endanger the article's NPOV (without a substantial base of qualified experts to balance it out, as might be the case in other controversial articles), and much of the article seems unencyclopedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> Every controversial new result produces visceral reactions, involving "strong personalities." Controversy in itself does not qualify an article for deletion according to Wiki rules. That said, however, we may have an amicable solution at hand. I would like to act upon a suggestion made by Prof. Hewitt <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Autobiography" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>: I will write a version of the page that I believe accurately reflects the facts of the experiment, its implication, a brief discussion of the controversy with references, and post it on my Userpage. Other experts will then be invited to edit and correct the text to ensure its objectivity. Upon consensus on the quality of the material, one of the experts will replace the current article with the "good" version. Of course, as new information (pro/con) becomes available the page can be updated in a similar fashion. Would this offer change your opinion on the article? -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 10:55, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Dear mr. Afshar, you may write new QM textbook if you want. You at various places say that your EPIC article is the TRIUMPH of the last 70-80 years of QM experiments, and this is nothing but parody and unrespect to science. <b>Are you seriously expecting a Nobel Prize, you once said that Einstein's Nobel prize should be taken back BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERIMENT???</b> To all others - why you still haven't voted for deletion of this non-sense entry? <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 16:25, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Dear Danko, I will not engage in a conversation with you, as you have severly failed all the necessary criteria in my book. I fully understand your current bid for deletion of this page is your reaction to the lack of interest in your baseless arguments by every physicist that wasted his/her time listening to you. As to the "epic" nature of my work, only time can tell. For now real analysis and debate is needed, not juvenile antics. As for Einstein's Nobel prize, you have <b>misquoted</b> me. I said: <i><b>"In order to declare Einstein the winner of the Bohr-Einstein debate, we would have to take back his Nobel prize."</b></i> Of course all physicists believe that Einstein should have won his Nobel for Relativity Theories, and I personally revere Einstein. BUT, Einstein was awarded his Nobel prize for the concept of photons (thinking of them like "rain drops" with definite trajectories.) That idea of the photon (with bullet-like trajectories) is certainly wrong as my experiment clearly shows. The above statement was made to signify the seriousness of the problem the experiment attempts to address, and should not be taken out of its context. It took me 18 years of focused research and hard work to come up with this seemingly simple experiment, and I will not allow an inept person like you to halt its discussion. I repeat my advice (which is the advice of all other experts previously given to you): learn the basics and then talk about the bigger issue. <b>It is an absolute embarrassment to say that the image is a hologram...</b> Do not further harm your reputation, and good luck with your studies in Pharmacology. -- Prof. <a href="../../../a/f/s/User%7EAfshar_e060.html" title="User:Afshar">Afshar</a> 17:52, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Dear Afshar, recently Carl Looper has added identical argument with holographic pinhole, and possibly he is physicist working on holography, because he agreed with my argument at 100% percent. <b>It is NOT an absolute embarrassment to say that the image is a hologram</b> and this is where math loophole is. Sorry for you that for 18 years of study you cannot write down one simple density matrix.

<li><b>Comment</b> dear Linas, all the periodicals presented by Afshar are only 1)popular press or 2) conferences. In both cases this is not sufficient to find the agreement of science communauty. A .Drezet (23/01/06)</li>

<li>Clearly, there is no agreement in the science community that Afshar's experiment refutes quantum mechanics. I'd even say that there is a consensus that Afshar's interpretation of the results is wrong (at least, the physicists in my department are not panicking). However, there are some things that people agree on: that Afstar did an experiment, the setting and the results of this experiment, that Afshar claims it refutes the current theory of QM, and that this claim generated some interest in the popular press. It is obvious to me that this yields enough material for a Wikipedia article. I'm sure the article can be improved but I see no reason to delete it. Since you seem to be new here, it might be a good idea to read our <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">deletion policy</a> to get a feeling for when we do delete articles. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is not a serious answer it is clearly says Wikipedia is not a publisher of original thought so why this page is here. secondly it doesnt matter if yes or not this experiment has been presented in popular journals: the topic is so controversial that there is even not a article of afshar availaible in a per reviewed. Perhaps the best choice will to create a WP section for controversial idea (perhaps it exists i dont know). However if one of your student comes on WP and collects the information on the Afshar experiment would you say that he or she learned science&#160;? I will be please to know your point of view.

I would appreciate if you kindly acknowledge the fact that you consider Danko to be totally wrong. In the same post you had said: <i><b>"You [Afshar] are right that he [Danko Gerogiev] is 100% wrong on his interpretation of QM, electromagentism and even optics."</b></i> I expect higher consistency from Prof. Zeilinger's ex-student.

<li><b>Comment <s>and delete again</s></b> dear Afshar 1) it doesnt matter if my vote is not considered as official or not. 2) DG is indeed ignorant in physics but it is not my fault if we have a common point&#160;: we believe both that your result is wrongly analyzed. 3) I was never a student of Zeilinger even if I learned a lot working in his group as a post doc. 4) On my 3 remarks only 1) is connected to the present suject which is: Do you have the right to create a WP page on your research which are still so controversial.

<li>Dear Hans, I agree that not all topics covered in Wikipedia need scientific publication before coverage. Examples are literature, movies, e-games, some popular topics. But when it comes to mathematics and science you cannot publish yellow press. Afshar is offending Einstein, takes back with easy hand Nobel Prizes as IF he is in the Nobel Cometee, and possibly himself expects a Nobel Prize for his parody of science. Everyone who understand matrix algebra and what is called density matrix of quantum state will immediately SEE that in order to have violation of complementarity you need to have 2 different density matrices in the same time! This is absurd, and as I suggested Afshar may write down new QM textbook if he wants, but it will be science fiction, not science. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanko_Georgiev_MD_25a6.html" title="User:Danko Georgiev MD">Danko Georgiev MD</a> 07:01, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

There is even frequent mention of the fact that it is an on-going debate, with references of submission to two journals of which I have heard (and are of quite some merit).

<li><b>Keep (changement of last minute after meditation in the lonelyness of a tibetan monastry</b> After a discussion with linas he convinced me that the best thing to do is not to destroy the page but to fix it in a good norm and a good standard. The work of afshar is controversial and i dont subscribe to his interpretation. however the experiment exists and it is not the first time thata physicist present somehing of controversial concerning complementarity (remenber the experiment of dipankar Home for example). I proposed now to prof. afshar to write down a theoretical section to replace the present one (he seems to accept). This new section should says at the beginnig this is the interpretation of afshar. The rest will stay objective since the introduction is already fine and the list of reference is I guess correct. I will add a link to the page concerning complementarity which needs to be modify too. Concerning the work of DG I have no idea what to do with thaT since the physics is too badly presented to give even a unity or a impression (perhaps there is something behind but i dont know what). If he wants he can let a link to his work on my user page (talk) i will tra to read it and give honestly my impression.

As long as he remains on Wikipedia, the article will never be reliable as a source of information, and so I can't see the point of retaining it.
