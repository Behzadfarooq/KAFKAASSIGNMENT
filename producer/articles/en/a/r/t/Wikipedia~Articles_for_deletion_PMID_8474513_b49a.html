<p>Minor point is that the research paper's name is not the <a href="../../../p/u/b/PubMed_05d8.html" title="PubMed">PubMed</a> abstract number later given. this might suggest at least a rename/move.</p>
<ul>
<li>Furthermore PMID followed by a space is automatically externally linked by the wikimedia software and article names are not noramlly links offsite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Major reason is that this is reporting of just one study, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>fails describe background to purpose of study (that screening might reduce rates of colon cancer)</li>
<li>fails describe if advances knowledge or changes clinical practice (i.e. fails establish notability for inclusion in an encyclopaedia)
<ul>
<li>This of course needs great care as dewscribing how a large study is important or has changed clinical practice risks being personal opinion (i.e. fall foul of <a href="../../../n/o/_/WP%7ENo_original_research_1420.html" title="WP:No original research">WP:No original research</a>), unless one can <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECite_a996.html" title="WP:Cite">cite</a> <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">reliable 3rd party sources</a> to <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerify_6da8.html" title="WP:Verify">verify</a> any claims made on behalf of the study's influence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a directory listings and that should include listing out all and any research papers.</li>
<li>If this study has a major influence, then surely better as a footnoted citation in an updated <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorectal_cancer.html" title="Colorectal cancer">Colorectal cancer</a> or <a href="../../../f/e/c/Fecal_occult_blood.html" title="Fecal occult blood">Fecal occult blood</a> test articles.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Rename</b> to Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study. As a result of my discussion with Badgettrg I am convinced that the topic is notable, and DGG has done the leg work to confirm the details. The current article text forms a good foundation for the expanded topic and it already also meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, so I dont see that the article must be rewritten before it is acceptable.

<li><b>Please keep for the moment</b> - I do not see a problem with an article that reports one study. In fact, WikiPedia has many such examples. Look at <a href="../../../f/r/a/Framingham_Heart_Study_52d2.html" title="Framingham Heart Study">Framingham Heart Study</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/s/Tuskegee_study.html" title="Tuskegee study">Tuskegee study</a>, <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurses%27_Health_Study_49e4.html" title="Nurses' Health Study">Nurses' Health Study</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Comorbidity_Study_b163.html" title="National Comorbidity Study">National Comorbidity Study</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middletown_studies.html" title="Middletown studies">Middletown studies</a>, <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whitehall_Study_00f4.html" title="Whitehall Study">Whitehall Study</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heart_Protection_Study_8223.html" title="Heart Protection Study">Heart Protection Study</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_prison_experiment.html" title="Stanford prison experiment">Stanford prison experiment</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/l/Milgram_experiment.html" title="Milgram experiment">Milgram experiment</a>, <a href="../../../l/a/n/Lancet_surveys_of_mortality_before_and_after_the_2003_invasion_of_Iraq_2d8d.html" title="Lancet surveys of mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq">Lancet surveys of mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq</a>, <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavian_Simvastatin_Survival_Study_bdc3.html" title="Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study">Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Gothenburg_Study_of_Children_with_DAMP_5523.html" title="The Gothenburg Study of Children with DAMP">The Gothenburg Study of Children with DAMP</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/6/1964_Chesapeake_Bay_crossing_study_8655.html" title="1964 Chesapeake Bay crossing study">1964 Chesapeake Bay crossing study</a>. Admittedly some of these are noted for historical reasons, but many are not. Some suffer from not having their numeric results summarized in a standard way that may influence the decision making of doctors and patients. Because the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study (that we are discussing), and many other studies report their benefit in relative terms only, they can be misleading (see research on reporting problems: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8474513" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=8474513">PMID 8474513</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14687273" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=14687273">PMID 14687273</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10612327" class="external" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=10612327">PMID 10612327</a>, etc). I am hoping that PMID 8474513 leads to a template on scientific reporting. A decision to delete here for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> seems an arbitrary value judgment. So WikiPedia can have subtle Star Trek and Andy Griffith trivia, but cannot have a report of an article that affected people's health? WK has templates for baseball scores, but not for scientific reporting? If you delete this for lack of notability, you start a slippery slope - where do you draw the line? Does everyone have the same values on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">WP:NOTABILITY</a> as you?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>To me as the author, the better question is how to fix what I have started. Does an article in its first 24 hours of life have to be perfect to avoid deletion? The shortcomings listed above are accurate and I will get to them. The toughest point to fix that you make is the naming of this article - the article probably needs renaming. Keeping the [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources/example_style#Medical_journal_abstracts" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources/example_style#Medical_journal_abstracts" rel="nofollow">PMID</a>] in the name helps it be linked to related content around the web (like shopping on the web with a model number rather than a description). Should the name be be 'Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study' as done by the studies listed above? Problem is that are multiple publications from the study and so this would not be a unique name. How about 'Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study (PMID: 7580661)'. This seems tedious, but better bibliographically.</dd>
<dd>This is a very interesting discussion. Regardless of the fate of this article, how is the current discussion archived? Please pardon any deviations I may take from WikiPedia norms, this is a new process to me.</dd>

<dd>This study does not present itself as significantly notable enough to be compared with <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a>, which has been running from 1951 to 2001. I'm sure the same applied to other studies you have mentioned. Note that <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a> covers many publications related to the same study, rather than an individual publication on a topic. If the topic this article covers is comparable with the studies you have mentioned, the article needs to be expand to demonstrate this.

<dd><b>Reply</b> - When I go to <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a> and judge their original source (BMJ 1954), it has 211 citations in other medical journals per <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Scientific_Information_b216.html" title="Institute for Scientific Information">Institute for Scientific Information</a>. The more recent article cited (BMJ 2004) has 135 citations. The Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study that I am reporting has 1231 citations. While I am perseverating on this one imperfect metric, the point of it is subjective judgments of notability of this study are risky.<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgettrg_d35e.html" title="User:Badgettrg">Badgettrg</a> 14:31, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply</b>. Those figures are a good start, but ground-breaking and scholarly are not sufficient to meet my notability yardstick. As the basis of my previous comment, I found <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22British+Doctors+Study%22&amp;start=390" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22British+Doctors+Study%22&amp;start=390" rel="nofollow">374</a> google hits on "British Doctors Study"; having briefly looked through those results, it appears that the study is referenced by govt agencies (other than the UK) and laymen, reinforcing its notability and reason for inclusion in Wikipedia. I've now done the same for "Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study" and found <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Minnesota+Colon+Cancer+Control+Study%22&amp;start=600" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=%22Minnesota+Colon+Cancer+Control+Study%22&amp;start=600" rel="nofollow">343</a> hits, and they appear to put it in the same league.</dd>
<dd>To a certain extent, inclusion will also be based on subjective judgements, and inclusion of this study will be used to justify the inclusion of others (if not on paper, it will certainly be used as rationale inside peoples heads). i.e. there is a slippery slope on the other side of this hill. I am definitely warming to this article being kept as Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study.</dd>

<dd><b>Reply</b> - I think it very risky to judge the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7Enotability_75cc.html" title="WP:notability">WP:notability</a> of this article without expertise in both the clinical topic (colorectal cancer screening) and in medical publishing.

According to the <a href="../../../i/n/s/Institute_for_Scientific_Information_b216.html" title="Institute for Scientific Information">Institute for Scientific Information</a>, this article has been cited by other medical journals 1231 times as of today. This makes is a very <a href="../../../i/m/p/Impact_factor.html" title="Impact factor">impactful</a> study. <i>Please explain the basis for Wikipedia allowing an article on <a href="../../../a/u/n/Aunt_Bee_2d82.html" title="Aunt Bee">Aunt Bee</a> and not on one of the most important studies of colorectal cancer screening</i> [personally, I like the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Andy_Griffith_Show_b993.html" title="The Andy Griffith Show">The Andy Griffith Show</a> show very much, so no offense intended towards its aficionados]?</dd>
<dd>Here is more explanation of the purpose of my wanting to summarize and individual study. Editing medical articles to the highest standards of <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence-based_medicine.html" title="Evidence-based medicine">evidence-based medicine</a> is very hard and time consuming.

<dd><b>Reply</b>: I agree this is a very nice summary and is quite constructive on Wikipedia; however Wikipedia is not a directory of journal articles. Perhaps a Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study page would be more fitting, with a summary of each journal article derived from the project on a subpage. I think this would probably be better than incorporation into the <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colon_cancer.html" title="Colon cancer">colon cancer</a> page (main or as a sub page). <a href="../../../d/l/o/User%7EDlodge_1452.html" title="User:Dlodge">Dlodge</a> 16:57, 12 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Concur</b>. Now we're talkin'. What's really important here...the article itself or the study it's reporting? The latter is more plausible in my mind, and is easier to support and more relevant to a wider audience. <a href="../../../d/m/a/User%7EDMacks_c1d8.html" title="User:DMacks">DMacks</a> 17:59, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>, <b>Delete</b> the wiki is always asking for verifiable data and this is it, and page references could link to pages like this one. I guess that the editor is new to the wiki (please correct me if I am wrong), so I feel that allowances could be made for this. Presentation and readability could be improved, but it is a good idea in my opinion, for what it might become. In may be encyclopaedic to list notable papers. The wiki is not short of space. There is a science in summarising and evaluating research articles and the wiki should not ignore this science. It may be new to the wiki, but the techniques and methods of evaluating statistical medical papers is a science in its own right. It is wiki policy to start articles at a simple level and works up to a very technical level for technical readers and both general and technical readers might want to see some evidence, if it is well presented. If this is deleted perhaps the author should write a new page on an paper that is undoubtedly notable. <a href="../../../s/n/o/User%7ESnowmanradio_64ad.html" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> 17:30, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> A Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study might be a worthy article but I can't judge that, nor should it be up to us editors to judge. If the study is widely referenced in review articles, textbooks and other media then it could be said to be important. This article is no more accessible than the original paper, making it too close to the primary source. In fact, the paper's abstract is more accessible – its concluding sentence contains the essential information that is just not apparent in the article. An encyclopedia must help to reader understand the significance of the results and probably the actual raw figures are not helpful to quote. Interpretation is vital but must draw on secondary sources rather than the editor's own abilities. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 22:13, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep and Move</b> to Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study , about which there are, according of PubMed, 251 articles. A major long-term clinical study reported in NJEM is notable, since this is the most prestigeous international journal for the reports of these study--no. 1 in Impact Factor in medicine in Science Citation Reports for decades. (don't be put off by "New England"--it means, among other things "Harvard Medical School" and its affiliated hospitals.) We do not have to judge notability, because there are secondary sources to report: first, the editors and peer-reviewewrs of NEJM, second, the authors of all the 251 other articles; This is not OR, this a report in a prestigious journal of the results of research. as CH said, "if the study is widely referenced.." and so it is--of the articles about it <i>29 are review articles</i>, iincluding a review for Annals of Internal medicine, &amp; Archives of Internal medicine, the 2 top internal medicine journals, and JAMA. It does not belong in fecal occult blood test, although that is one of the topics studied. The only problem is that this WP article has been naively edited.</li>

<dd>This particular paper would be one of the referebces, though the main one, because apparently --following the links in PubMed, it is the major publication of the results. Though we're not a medical encyclopedia, it meets the tests for science--under the name of the study of course. CH, either you or I could upgrade it--WP should have gotten this study in earlier. <i>Please rethink and re-comment.</i><b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 03:52, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>In terms of this AfD review, both the title and content are currently unsuitable for WP, so I still think delete is the appropriate choice. You make very a good case for Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study. A newly created article would start with information from the review/book sources and work down to details from the original paper as and where necessary. The <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Doctors_Study_9a6e.html" title="British Doctors Study">British Doctors Study</a> would be a good model to follow but it could be longer with more detail if warranted. I'm not qualified to "upgrade this", nor do I have access to the journals and books required. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Medicine_54a3.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine">WikiProject Medicine</a> should be able to help, and I'd be happy to post a request there once this AfD review is complete. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_66ca.html" title="User:Colin">Colin</a>°<a href="../../../c/o/l/User_talk%7EColin_65e3.html" title="User talk:Colin"><sup>Talk</sup></a> 09:37, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
