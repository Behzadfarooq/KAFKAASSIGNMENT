	    <p><b>Arthur Clarence Pillsbury</b> (1870-1946) <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photographer.html" title="Photographer">photographer</a>.</p>
<p>Pillsbury's career spilled over into nearly every kind of application for photography. His career began in <a href="../../../1/8/9/1895.html" title="1895">1895</a> when as a <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student.html" title="Student">student</a> he documented in one hour with 60 different remarkable images the first fraternity rush at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>. Pillsbury studied <a href="../../../m/e/c/Mechanical_Engineering_d69b.html" title="Mechanical Engineering">Mechanical Engineering</a> at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> and is credited with the invention of a specimen slicer (for microscopy) and a circuit panorama camera before leaving college.<sup id="_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> Two years later he invented the first circuit panorama <a href="../../../c/a/m/Camera.html" title="Camera">camera</a> and soon after took it to the <a href="../../../y/u/k/Yukon.html" title="Yukon">Yukon</a> to capture the opening of the mining fields and towns. By <a href="../../../1/9/0/1900.html" title="1900">1900</a> he had photographed most of the notable features of the <a href="../../../w/e/s/Western_United_States_afd6.html" title="Western United States">Western United States</a>. He used both the <a href="../../../p/a/n/Panorama.html" title="Panorama">panorama</a> and conventional cameras to capture the panorama images that went around the world in the immediate aftermath of the <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake_ad8f.html" title="1906 San Francisco earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and fire. He also worked for the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Examiner_bcd8.html" title="San Francisco Examiner">San Francisco Examiner</a></i> as a <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photojournalist.html" title="Photojournalist">photojournalist</a> from <a href="../../../1/9/0/1903.html" title="1903">1903</a> to March of <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906.html" title="1906">1906</a>.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the earthquake, he began returned to a career as a <a href="../../../l/a/n/Landscape.html" title="Landscape">landscape</a> photographer when he purchased a studio in <a href="../../../y/o/s/Yosemite_Valley_14c6.html" title="Yosemite Valley">Yosemite Valley</a>. During this period he also produced art photographs and started using motion picture cameras, producing the first nature films which he showed in Yosemite at his Studio of the Three Arrows. Here is also invented the first lapse-time motion picture camera for the specific purpose of saving the wild flowers of Yosemite that were then threatened with extinction from excessive mowing.</p>
<p>His candid photos captured the sense of wonder experienced by people in Yosemite as they saw its natural wonders. His inventions in later life included the microscopic motion picture camera, the X-Ray Motion picture camera and the underwater motion picture camera. His work was done without filters because his background as a photojournalist and his life <a href="../../../p/h/i/Philosophy.html" title="Philosophy">philosophy</a> had lead him to the conviction that his job was to produce images and let the viewer bring to that experience the interpretation.</p>

<p>He arrived in Yosemite for the first time by bicycle in 1895 while still a student in mechanical engineering at <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanford_University_8e23.html" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a>. He had been drawn there by stories from an old friend of his mother's <a href="../../../s/u/s/Susan_B._Anthony_4753.html" title="Susan B. Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, who was then making a tour through <a href="../../../c/a/l/California.html" title="California">California</a> speaking on the issue of <a href="../../../w/o/m/Women%27s_suffrage.html" title="Women's suffrage">women's suffrage</a>. The young man fell in love with Yosemite and in 1897 bought a studio there. But his young wife refused to spend summers in the wilderness and left him. Despondent, he took his newly finished senior project, the first circuit panorama camera, and went to the Yukon where he photographed the opening of the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mining.html" title="Mining">mining</a> towns and fields.</p>
<p>Pillsbury often visited Yosemite after returning to the lower 48 in 1899. There he photographed <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Muir_ac2a.html" title="John Muir">John Muir</a> for <i>Camera Craft Magazine</i> in 1901, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galen_Clark_6ef5.html" title="Galen Clark">Galen Clark</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Fiske_6878.html" title="George Fiske">George Fiske</a>, and <a href="../../../t/e/d/Teddy_Roosevelt_286e.html" title="Teddy Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a>. These and other photos were later published as <a href="../../../p/o/s/Postcard.html" title="Postcard">postcards</a> by the Pillsbury Picture Company. Pillsbury had begun producing post cards with his photos as soon as this innovative form of communication was authorized by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Congress_8653.html" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> in 1898.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the <a href="../../../1/9/0/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake_ad8f.html" title="1906 San Francisco earthquake">1906 San Francisco earthquake</a> and fire, Pillsbury, who had just quit his job as a photojournalist with the <i><a href="../../../s/a/n/San_Francisco_Examiner_bcd8.html" title="San Francisco Examiner">San Francisco Examiner</a></i> to found the Pillsbury Picture Company, took the panoramas of the destruction of that great city which flashed around the globe. With the proceeds he was able to fulfill his long time ambition to buy a studio in Yosemite and purchased the Studio of the Three Arrows later that same year. His background in <a href="../../../b/i/o/Biology.html" title="Biology">biology</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/t/Botany.html" title="Botany">botany</a>, encouraged by his parents who were both medical doctors, made him aware of the steady reduction in the number and types of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Wild_flower.html" title="Wild flower">wild flowers</a> that blossomed in the <a href="../../../m/e/a/Meadow.html" title="Meadow">meadows</a> there. So in 1912 he built the first lapse-time camera, made the first nature movie showing the lovely dance of a <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flower.html" title="Flower">flower</a> raising its face to the <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sun.html" title="Sun">sun</a> and managed to persuade the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Park_Service_2873.html" title="National Park Service">National Park Service</a> to stop the practice of mowing the meadows to produce fodder for their <a href="../../../h/o/r/Horse.html" title="Horse">horses</a>.</p>
<p>His specimen cards of flowers, hand tinted at the studio, were as often framed as used in the meadows to identify the many types of plants blooming there. His work in Yosemite included both the classical production photos of such artists as Adams, d'orotones that had the depth and clarity of <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hologram.html" title="Hologram">holograms</a>, and his own unique work with flowers and also his candids of the people of Yosemite. That, with his inventions which later included the first microscopic motion picture camera, "Sunset Magazine, May 1927", the X-Ray motion picture camera and the first underwater motion picture camera, "Picturing Miracles of Plant and Animal Life and Popular Science, January 1929", were used on his extensive lecture tours to all the major forums and universities in the United States, England and the South Seas. His many nature films, eventually shown in theaters as well as in schools, clubs and for his lecture tours awakened the public to the need for conservation in the wake of Muir's death in 1914.</p>
