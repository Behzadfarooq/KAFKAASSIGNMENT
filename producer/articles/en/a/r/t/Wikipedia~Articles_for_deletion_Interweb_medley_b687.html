<dd><b>Comment</b>: I think you're reading too much into the "Inclusionists" article. The article is about the philosophy of Wikipedia inclusionists, and while it does illuminate the differences between inclusionists' and exclusionists' philosophies, it doesn't take sides and certainly doesn't stoop to insults. <a href="../../../l/u/v/User%7ELuvcraft_7624.html" title="User:Luvcraft">Luvcraft</a> 18:03, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Any insults on my part come from me alone and have nothing to do with whether or not I believe the inclusionist creed. As for that creed, my point is that if an article has already been created, is accurate and truthful and doesn't harm or liable anyone, why not let it stay? <b>Note</b>: When I went to the Wikipedia (my primary general information source) after seeing the BoingBoing post and entered "Interweb medley" into the search dialog, not only was no article returned, <b>the standard Wikipedia plea for the user to CREATE an article if it doesn't exist was displayed.</b> I chose to follow that invitation to create the article.

<li>I knew it was linked on BoingBoing.

Most bona-fide internet phenomena don't get Wikipedia articles because they're passing things or just don't get big enough. This isn't even yet an internet phenomenon, and any notability that it currently has is "instant" notability by borrowing from existing notable internet phenomena. That Cory Doctorow liked it doesn't make it any more notable. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 03:40, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> No more obtrusive than articles on albums from obscure artists. The criteria cited above for article deletion, e.g. number of google hits, should not necessarily be taken into account as the song is new. The main reason for my vote: the article combines through linking many other quality articles. If the article in question is eventually removed, the original author should add info on the "Interweb medley" to the respective song articles. <a href="../../../r/f/e/User%7ERFenno_052a.html" title="User:RFenno">RFenno</a> 05:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Getting linked from BoingBoing doesn't make something notable in and of itself, and a link from BoingBoing is the only thing going for this song as far as notability is concerned.

<li><b>Comment</b> RGTraynor: Is sarcasm/mockery really appropriate for somebody who posts their opinion here? Have you lost sight of what we are doing here? --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 01:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>The vanity article you wrote about your grandfather, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Vermette_6be2.html" title="Claude Vermette">Claude Vermette</a>, only gets 143 hits in Google - the first of which is the article here on Wikipedia. Hardly seems notable, especially prior to your creating the article. Will you be proposing deletion for that article as well? By your standards it should have been deleted long ago. The inclusionist in me, however, says that since it does no harm, your article should stay. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 01:18, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>You seem to be taking this personally and trying to make this personal. Please note that nobody <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">owns</a> articles and editors should not try to exert power over them as if they did. You are welcome to nominate <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claude_Vermette_6be2.html" title="Claude Vermette">Claude Vermette</a> for deletion so that the community can discuss whether it should be deleted or kept. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 01:23, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>No - I am <i>genuinely</i> an inclusionist. I do not want to see the vanity article you wrote about your grandfather deleted. If you were to nominate it for deletion, I would vote <b>Keep</b>. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 01:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Inclusionism is only one philosophy, not the only philosophy. Using inclusionist arguments will only sway inclusionists, who, presumably, would have voted keep before hearing such arguments. Unless you have anything new and policy-based to offer, I'd suggest you take a breath and let the process play out. If enough people agree with you (or you have new arguments that are based on policy) the article will be kept. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 02:03, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that the <b>right</b> thing for you to do at this point would be to withdraw this deletion request. You seem to feel very strongly about having this article deleted, however the reasons you have stated apply equally to the vanity article you've written about your grandfather and proudly displayed on your User page. One must conclude that you have other unstated reasons to seek the deletion of this article. I do not pretend to understand this. Why not withdraw the deletion request for now so that you may spend some time deciding whether or not this article is a legitimate intended target for your aggression? If, in time, you decide that it is, by all means renominate it for deletion. I would hope, however, that some time spent looking within yourself will shed some light on your real motivations. --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 02:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I said, <a href="../../../o/w/n/WP%7EOWN_4008.html" title="WP:OWN">nobody owns articles</a>. This AfD isn't "mine", and judging by the response to this so far there are those who would have nominated it in my place had I not. Not only would withdrawing it be disruptive, but I have no authority to do so. (See "not mine".) Furthermore, impuning the motivations of another editor with whom you disagree is an <a href="../../../a/d/_/Ad_hominem.html" title="Ad hominem">ad hominem</a> fallacy. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 03:26, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>As that's a comment on the merits of the article ("if it walks and quacks like advertising, it's probably advertising") and not an attempt to discredit someone's arguments by attacking them personally, it's not an <i>ad hominem</i> fallacy. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 07:06, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I am getting 12000+ Google hits for <b>interweb medley</b> and 14000+ hits for <b>"interweb medley"</b>. Are you sure that you spelled it correctly when you searched? I know nothing about songwriting and recording but I doubt this creation was only a day start to finish - and since it utilized some sort of recording technology, I doubt it took place at a school. The "day" test is specious anyway, particularly with art or pop-culture or news events. Arbitrarily declaring the worth of something based on an uninformed third party's guess at how long it took is a yardstick for nothing. Some of the greatest artistic achievements in the world took less than a day... Some of the most narcissistic and lame took months or years. You get the point. I hope that nobody is still under the impression that I am the song's creator or have any connection with the song. I am a 36 year old parent and Wikipedia addict with at least 1600 edits made over the course of 20 months (the counter seems to be stuck at 1616 for me - I don't understand why). --<a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> 00:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Note that I said "in principle". Like a zen koan, there is something of value to be gained by contemplating the <i>why</i> behind a Wikipedia essay that has high community acceptance. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 00:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I, for one, disagree that you're applying the principle correctly. None of the "checks" seem to apply - unless you're still arguing that AStanhope is the author of the song. Internet fads/memes seem to be well-established candidates for inclusion; this fad appears to be growing as we speak.--<a href="../../../b/l/t/User%7EBltpdx_5318.html" title="User:Bltpdx">Bltpdx</a> 00:59, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't see anywhere a well-established precedent for articles on unestablished memes. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a> indicates the opposite. — <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> <a href="../../../s/a/x/User_talk%7ESaxifrage_324d.html" title="User talk:Saxifrage">✎</a> 01:12, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I am a first-time editor AND a friend of the original author, which twin facts I understand would normally render my opinion rather meaningless. However, I am supremely confident that the raw power of my argument will prove impossible to ignore. Behold: There is a Wikipedia article for each of the songs in the Interweb medley, save one. Is a Wikipedia user who comes to read about <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a> not ill-served if she comes away without the knowledge that <a href="../../../b/a/d/Badger_Badger_Badger_29ac.html" title="Badger Badger Badger">Badger Badger Badger</a> has been collected into the Interweb medley?

<li><b>Comment</b> Has anyone here read <a href="../../../m/e/m/WP%7EMEME_0b58.html" title="WP:MEME">WP:MEME</a> (which was rejected as a proposal), or <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>/<a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> both of which cover this subject fairly well? Testing through these guidelines fail to produce any significant support for the article. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> would support the article if it were to gain additional notability through an additional 1 or 2 media outlets other than boing boing. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> would seem to support converting the article into one based on the composer, should the song/composer become notable. I retain my delete vote above. Additionally I think both <a href="../../../s/a/x/User%7ESaxifrage_6800.html" title="User:Saxifrage">Saxifrage</a> and <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstanhope_1188.html" title="User:Astanhope">AStanhope</a> need to refrain from posting comments here unless additional questions are posed directly to them, they can present additional evidence, or the article is significantly modified. --<a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattarata_b773.html" title="User:Mattarata">Mattarata</a> 18:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)
