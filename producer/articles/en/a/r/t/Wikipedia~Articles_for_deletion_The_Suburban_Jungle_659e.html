<li>Hi, Nekura. Plan 9's wiki article has to do with its validity as a publisher in the same way that all questionable claims on wikipedia must be backed up with third-party reliable sources and as yet we have none on this publisher (unless for some strange reason they are in some other article). You're right that "<a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> #3 has no qualification that the books have to be 'significant' or 'notable.'" In fact, WP:WEB #3 has absolutely nothing to with books, it has to do with online distributors, which I pointed out earlier. I have no idea what exactly a non-trivial print run is; you might want to ask User:Kizor which reliable source he's using for that claim since he's the one who is claiming these books exhibit such a thing. Myself, I'd expect four notable books from a notable publisher containing notable comics to attract some decent book reviews we could use as sources. Are there any? -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 19:02, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per Dragonfiend.

<li>Actually, what WP:WEB #3 is looking for are things which are "well known" in a general sense, not "well known" within a subculture. That is, "well known" enough that we can expect there to be multiple trivial reliable sources. Comics hosted on sites like Keenspot, Modern Tales, Girlamatic, etc. do not meet this as the vast majority of them do not attract attention from multiple, non-trivial reliable third-party sources. . -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 19:07, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

It's no Amazon, but it is a major publisher among the webcomic industry, including publishing some large comics, such as <i>Kevin and Kell.</i> Additionally, the comic itself has been going almost constantly for the last eight years, has been nominated for some noteable awards, such as "The Ursa Major Awards" <a href="http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2004.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ursamajorawards.org/UMA_2004.htm" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>, and the creator is a regular panelist at many conventions from the popularity of the comic. This makes it a very notable webcomic. This comic is very popular among the fandom, and is significantly more then just a start-up webcomic. Just because it's not huge in the "mainstream," or hasn't been reviewed in the New York Times, does not mean it is insignificant, or not-notable, or can be deleted out of hand.

<li>If you want o have the results from an "English" google, you take whatever Google you want (be it.com, .ca, .be, ...) and restrict the search to English language only (you can only get <i>less' results that way, not more). Every Google search, no matter what .XX it is, gives the same result (perhaps with the exception of China?), so the results I posted are perfectly acceptable for tyhe English wiki, and are identical to thos you would get by searching via .com.</i></li>

<li>Fine, different views of the same data.

<li>No, I'm trying to argue the value of Keenspot and Plan9 wrt this comic, and it seems that no one is reviewing it, no one is carrying (selling) it, no one is really bothered about this comic. While it may fulfill the notability guideline literally, it does not meet it in the spirit: there are no verifiable third party sources (i.e. not the author, the online publisher or the paper publisher) asserting any notability for this comic. If I get a weekly column in the New York Times and no one outside the NYTimes ever comments on it, then I (or the column) don't deserve an article, even though it is published by a very well known medium. We are a tertiary source, we need secondary sources, and I can't find the necessary independent <i>secondary</i> sources to establish the notability of this comic in either form. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 08:06, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>At risk of invading the process here, it seems to me that you are arguing, essentially, the formal existence of Plan 9 as a publisher. It can be asserted that they do exist and that they are publishing Suburban Jungle books; I myself have all four books sitting beside me at this moment and use them regularly as an archival reference when discussing the strip. The problem is the establishment of "notability" for the comic, not the publisher. As an historian, I would like to reccomend that you look at this a different way. The SJ article was painstakingly written and reviewed by several fans of the work, using the books as published to represent a primary source on the comic strip. If you're going to declare notability as being published, then perhaps you need to accept that any work published in book form-- by any publisher-- is an acceptable primary source for itself and therefore establishes its own notability. If the standard of notability you are using to eliminate Plan 9 were to be used by historians, our history would be a mere shadow of what it is now. Instead, we value first primary source material from reliable sources. I reccomend that Wikipedia include a notability category, it could be called WP:PriSrc, that non-printed media may self-cite once it is published by any house, major or minor, so long as that published work is cited as a primary source material for the topic of the article. 67.185.101.54 16:34, 18 January 2007 (UTC)Guest comment from Tora Kiyoshi 16:32, 18 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While your comments are thought out, they do not match with Wikipedia policies. Wikipedia is a tertiary source, not a secondary one: we report what other secondary sources (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> for the correct and complete policies and guidelines) have said about a subject. Furthermore, it is consensus on Wikipedia that not all published sources are notable: self-published sources are no indication of notability (although in exceptional cases like <i><a href="../../../b/o/n/Bone_%28comic%29.html" title="Bone (comic)">Bone</a></i>, they can nevertheless be notable), and publication by a minor publisher is not a strong indication of notability either. But as I have argued above, even a publication by a major publisher can be still non notable for Wikipedia, if we have little or no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> sources about the subject, which is the case here. It doesn't matter if Keenspot and Plan 9 are notable and important: those are points in favour of the comic, and should encourage us to look harder and think twice, but ultimately, when we don't find the necessary sources, we have to follow policy and delete it. Now, since no such sources have been shown by anyone in this AfD or in the article, it should be deleted. (about the sources and claims to fame in the DRV: the Ursa Major nomination was a mention in a list as one of 39 furry comics for that year, and the nomination for a Shortbread Award was an award by some website which again got very, very little attention (not only for this comic, but in general). There is nothing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in either the article, the AfD or the DRV to suggest any notability as recognized by independent sources for this comic, and that is all that should concern us. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 20:15, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To be anal, it's a disservice to say that the Shortbread Award comes from 'some website': Eric Burns, the man behind those, is a prominent expert in his field, and there's precedent for acknowledging him as such in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/i/z/User%7EKizor_34ff.html" title="User:Kizor">Kizor</a> 22:31, 18 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Exactly. My point is that, speaking as a professional historian and with no intended disrespect, your policies may be flawed and need themselves to be reviewed. Just because you are a teriary source does not rule out the use of primary sources.67.185.101.54 04:29, 19 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While you're free to debate that the policies may need changed, that's irrelevant to the current debate.
