<p><b>Delete</b> Very minor author.

<li><b>COMMENT</b>This Roger Moss who is a Philadelphia historian did not show up in any resarch that I have done. It is either he is so noteworthy that there are no Google hits for a historian from Philadelphia by that name, at least in the first couple of hundred hits or that he is just some minor person who may or may not be a historian that someone hates, did you even read the article? <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 22:00, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on the grounds I may be biased (I don't know the guy, but I certainly know his work), but Roger Moss was <b>very</b> well-known in U.S. historic preservation circles, at least in the 1980s and 1990s. His book about historic American paint colors was pretty influential at the time. I don't know what's going on now. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 18:34, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I take it back. I <i>am</i> going to vote. He's a large part of the reason old American houses are no longer automatically painted white. <b>KEEP</b> and <s>expand</s> rewrite in NPOV--<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 18:40, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC) (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 10:57, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC))</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Also, google "Roger Moss historic American paint colors" and there are 70,900 hits (except I forgot to turn off French and Italian, so that may be wrong, still...). Add "Sherwin Williams" to that phrase and you cut it down to about 40,000, but Moss was involved in getting that paint company to put out a whole line of what, at the time, were pretty outré but historically accurate colors, Arts and Crafts stuff, really deeply pigmented . And the line <i>sold</i>. Still does, as far as I know. Even has imitators. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 19:06, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Just because this guy is a paint expert doesn't mean he is notable. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 14:51, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>And yet another <b>comment</b>. Okay, now I'm getting pissed. I've been out of the preservation loop for a few years, but after doing a little checking around, it's obvious to me that Toast up there and other anonymous contributors to the article as it stands now are writing it because they can't stand the man. It has nothing to do with the executive director of the Athenaeum of Philadelphia for the last 36 years who just got a life-time achievement award for his works in Philadelphia preservation, or the man who has written multiple influential books and articles about preservation, or the man who was one of the first to start collecting historic architectural drawings for the Athenaeum's library, or... I could go on, but I would prefer to save it for the article, which should be wrenched from the POV-slimed hands of these disgruntled folk. <b>You should not delete this article. This man is notable.</b> And yeah, you do make a lot of enemies in the preservation field in the U.S. The concept of stewardship is all too often viewed as unAmerican. I feel myself going off into a rant. I will stop. But seriously, please do not delete this article because of misunderstandings as to who Moss is, or where the article comes from. For you article "authors", go write a letter to the editor or something. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 21:31, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Then why does this not come up while Googling the person? He is not notable and doesn't meet any of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guidelines. Also, if he is so important why does he seem to only have two how to books in the collections of major libraries? That defines not notable! If we list very minor authors like Moss where will we end up? <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 14:51, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I forgot to answer your question, and I do not want you spiraling out of control with worry. If we list influential stewards of our historic and cultural heritages - like Moss, their professional achievements - like Moss's, and their educational legacies - like Moss's, we will end up with a pretty fine encyclopedia. At least until the asteroid hits us. So you can calm down until then. --<a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMothperson_66a8.html" title="User:Mothperson">Mothperson</a> 16:50, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Moss belongs in the phonebook and a couple of library card catalogs for his how to books, but thats it. After he is dead, nobody but his family will care, so he will have a negilable legacy, if any. <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 19:50, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b> preservationist Roger Moss. Absolutely notable, absolutely important works, absolutely belongs in Wikipedia. Unfortunate to have caused the ire of religious leaders for his favoring keeping churches unrenovated for their historical value rather than remodeled. All in all, very interesting. --<a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#006699">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused">focused</a> 16:56, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> on the grounds that he is a notable figure in the historical preservation movement, and on the grounds that some of the delete votes appear to be a coordinated sockpuppet effort (similar to the VFDs on <a href="../../../h/i/s/Historical_Mississippi_License_Plates_38e4.html" title="Historical Mississippi License Plates">Historical Mississippi License Plates</a> and several others). <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 20:48, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. He is listed in <i><a href="../../../m/a/r/Marquis_Who%27s_Who_acb8.html" title="Marquis Who's Who">Marquis Who's Who</a></i> and the <i>Directory of American Scholars</i>. Add that to the fact that he's director of a notable institution, author of a number of books, and the facts noted by others in this discussion. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:00, 14 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I could have been in Who's Who or the Directory of American Scholars, too but I didn't want to pony up the money for it. Everybody knows those things is a scam designed to bilk people out of their money. Didn't you see that episode of Dragnet? The guy is a minor player in his field, and should be deleted! <a href="../../../t/o/a/User%7EToasthaven_99cb.html" title="User:Toasthaven">Toasthaven</a> 19:47, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Interesting, then, that my library school reference work textbook says the series "has a long history of reliability". Sure, there are plenty of books you can buy your way into, and these may be some of them, but I'll rely on a long established series of respected reference works rather than your word. Note that I don't suggest that people use an appearance in a work such as this to be the sole criteria for inclusion, but this added to the other evidence and arguments presented is plenty convincing. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 20:02, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would like to add that "After he is dead, nobody but his family will care" is really not a very nice thing to say. Especially if you consider yourself a good Episcopalian. Besides, it's not true.
