This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and full-length magazine reviews except for the following: Media reprints of press releases, trailers, and advertising for the film. 1 Trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that simply report the film name and where it is being shown.

<p>And another thing, just because a film was made with little or no budget doesn't make it a bad film. Its about talent not money.

<p>Alright, I don't know if it was any of you, but I won't pay any attention to any rascists here. Since someone wrote a comment on the <a href="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" class="external text" title="http://townefilms.proboards100.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1163283227" rel="nofollow">forum</a>. Now perhaps the other person I would agree with to a certain point, but this isn't just about degrading or upgrading, this is about whether someone can write an article about a piece of art that one found wonderful. Now obviously if that piece of art were made by my boyfriend, I would have no business making an article about it. However, if a 3rd party wrote it, that's the difference. I think some of you are concerned that because I am a fan of the movie, I have conflict of interest, but then if not a fan, who can write an article? Most articles here were written by fans of their subject matter. The film was approved to be on fanfilms.net, and has been shown for educational purposes in high schools, therefore it is notable imao. MaraJade85 02:30, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>When I read what could not go on wikipedia, it stated clearly no advertising and no self-promotions. I have in no way promoted myself, and I don't wish to. I simply wrote an article about a film I liked. How then is that conflict of interest? I'm sure any of you would write articles about stuff you like, and how can this be considered advertising? It could if I told people to watch the film no matter what, but rather I took an analytic approach which discussed the films drawbacks and some of its historical innaccuracies. If that is considered advertising, then lets just delete the articles on other films since they discuss those films too, and while we're at it let's delete the article on the Arizona Cardinals since that article is advertising them. If all I did was praise the film and tell people beg people to watch it, then I could understand the advertising accusation. However, I took a non-partisan critical approach when I wrote the article. It is quite notable as I repeat, it has been showcased in high schools, online, it has a fanfilms.net listing (and that site does not accept all movies), it has been discussed in forums about Rome Total War and HBO's Rome, and furthermore, I found it. I don't even know these people personally, yet I found this film online and that's saying something because it would be different if I was a family member of someone in the production. However since I found it online, and so have others. In fact I've been excited about this film since like it was first announced, and this isn't just any ordinary home video, it took lots of months and to make and the filmmakers almost went broke putting their money in it, and I waited all those months and I saw the "making of" video which showed everything the filmmakers went through. Its an online movie, I love it, and I wrote this article about it. So where do we set the line between what people can write about and what they can't, between what one subjectively thinks is notable compared to what another person thinks is notable? Certainly this film has attracted attention beyond its local sphere, or else I would not have seen it, and it has been viewed in other places and discussed in other websites. Perhaps, since I'm only a fan of the movie, we need somebody else who hates the film to write the article...MaraJade85 04:55, 12 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><i>I simply wrote an article about a film I liked</i> I liked the movie also, but I wouldn’t write an article about it here. You asked where the line is drawn, well this is basically it: if the film is getting more publicity from 3rd party outside sources than from wikipedia, then it could be possible to have an article, but if wikipedia is giving the film more publicity than the outside sources are, then it doesn’t belong here. There are hardly any outside sources of publicity for this film. I found a few forums related to Rome Total War and HBO’s Rome that talked about the film, but that was it. I couldn’t even find the trailer on Youtube! If you want this film to have more publicity, I suggest that these “Towne Films” get off these obscure vidiac networks (who ever goes there) and move to youtube. Though money spent should not be considered, neither should be the film's content nor potential of the filmmakers. Even if these people are future George Lucases and Steven Spielbergs, <i>their</i> earliest films when <i>they</i> went out with camcorders would not have qualified for wikipedia at the time they were made. <b>Delete</b>129.108.96.131 15:22, 13 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
