<dd>which to me suggests that this club is clearly non-notable as per a million other AFDs on amateur indoor "hobbyist" teams. Note also zero Ghits for "northcote league" and "northcote super league". Therefore I now&#160;!vote <b>Delete</b>. I'm also nominating the club's "stadium", the rather unconvincingly named Estadio Northchetti (which again produces no results on Google) and&#160;!vote to <b>delete</b> on that one too..... <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 08:52, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> the team as (at best) a very minor-league team. They aren't in the A-League, which is the top league in these parts, and what little indication there is of the level at which they <i>do</i> play suggests that it's a local-league affair. As full disclosure, I previously Speedied the team and was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BigHaz#Deletion_of_Deportivo_Football_Club" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BigHaz#Deletion_of_Deportivo_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">questioned over it</a>, which may explain the claims that the team is "very <b>notable</b>" in this version of the article.

<li>Guys, please let this stay. I've added a real valuable source at the end of ext.source section.

<li>I can understand that you're keen to have this page on here, but WP has a whole bunch of policies which articles need to satisfy, the main ones being <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a>, neither of which your team seems to meet (or be able to meet). I'm sure you understand that these policies are there for a reason i.e. if we didn't have them the encyclopedia would drown in articles on everybody's garage bands, kids, pets, school projects, etc etc. I seem to recall a recent AfD discussion mentioning that there were something like 5000 indoor soccer teams active in the UK alone - can you imagine the effect on WP if we let every such team, not just in the UK but in the whole soccer-playing world, have an article.....? <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 10:55, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The two sources cited at the bottom of the Deportivo page (there was a third, but it was a link to the article on the stadium which is bundled with this one for AfD purposes) consist of a series of forum posts and a directory entry proving that the club exists. We can thus be reasonably sure that it's not a hoax (although the flagicons of some of the players still seem unusual). We cannot, however, be sure of the notability of the team. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>1.) regarding the picture, it is copyrighted for 7 years, under the Australian copyright act that any picture produced in Australia is of automatic copyright for 7 years, so please dont insult me on that.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2.) Ok, can we please reach an agreement, I havn't been lieing about anything here at all. The only semi-lie ive/weve told is the on eregarding estadio Northcetti. The place is actually (as im sure you all know) "Insportz Northcote" and we just made up the northcetti for fun. ill remove that now, and replace it with Insports Northcote - and Wont make a wiki for that. Please let this stay, it does no harm, really. It is a serious and yes, notable thing. Im not sure where you guys are from but if you were from Melbourne you would be aware - although, if you were a football fan (as that also applies to any league in the world)</dd>

<li>You still need to address the failure of the article (as it stands) to meet the requirements of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and especially <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. Your argument seems to hinge on the team being "big in Melbourne" - presumably if this is the case then you can cite coverage it has received in Melbourne newspapers, which would go a long way to satisfying <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisTheDude_2fd4.html" title="User:ChrisTheDude">ChrisTheDude</a> 12:36, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>You see, this is my problem, as you can probably guess i've exumed all internet resources. When i say big i dont mean everyone in the state knows, but to the football fraternity it is known. Local community newspapers do not publish their articles on the net. which leads me to my second point - you guys rely too much on the internet. Not all sources are internet. Is there a way for me to take a photo of my medal, then scan it on and imageshack it to be viewed. Note: i am being serious there, are there other ways of providing sources other than pre-made url links. i will take the photo if it means you'll allow the deportivo wiki in.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable. It's one team of many, from one location of many, from one city of many. One of the referenced websites lists nearly 20 sports centers in the Melbourne area, and this appears to be a team from a league at only one of those locations. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGregorytopov_19e7.html" title="User:Gregorytopov">Gregorytopov</a> 17:12, 6 March 2007 (UTC) <b>Further comment:</b> The user who posted the article is Domenic Demaria, one of the players on the team. He is a 15 year old who posts in forums at football.co.uk, see all his posts here: <a href="http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25" class="external free" title="http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25" rel="nofollow">http://forum.football.co.uk/search.php?search_id=1019827224&amp;start=25</a> - which includes a post that mentions his age. With team members identified with names like "Billy" and opponents like "Jacob's Team", it seems clear this is just a local team composed of 15 year old amateurs at best. Claims in a forum post about the team being the subject of a Sportsnet article seem unverifiable and fabricated. The evidence points strongly to a non-notable amateur team like thousands worldwide, and a vanity article from the author about his teenager friends.
