<li><b>Keep</b> "Since 1893" indicates a long history with lots of details to be found. A very good school stub so far, and will be improved over time. However, I would encourage anyone feeling bold to move it to a more specific name as soon as one is decided. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 04:38, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> 20+ schools are added a day. Nominating one now and again is pointless and mass deletion attempts are heavily defeated. Please don't nominate any more schools. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 08:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - So nobody should nom a school for deletion just because nominating 1 is "pointless" in your view and mass noms are frowned upon? That is ridiculous reasoning. Unless there is a policy that all schools are notable, noms like this are going to happen and should happen until there is a standard set for notabilty of schools. Just because you don't agree isn't reason enough for someone who believes schools are not notable to stop nominating them.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:33, 29 September 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Still, there is no policy to prevent a nom for deletion. I understand where you are coming from <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> but just because it ruffles a few feathers is no reason to abstain from a nom for AfD. I also disagree with your contention that it achieves nothing: it keeps the issue of school notability alive on the AfD pages. Hopefully this will prompt a discussion where a consensus can be reached pertaining to school notability. Otherwise we will be having this conversation over and over...--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:56, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We also have 100+ articles written on non-notable people and websites every day.

<ul>
<li>Many people believe all schools have notable. We have the upper hand and have established a de facto policy. Schools shouldn't be nominated just as countries shouldn't be nominated. On the other hand almost no-one believes all people are notable and many biographical articles are deleted every day. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 20:14, 29 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>How many schools have to survive the AfD process before we can declare that a concensus exists "not to delete school articles" simply because they are about schools? What percentage of nominated school articles must survive the AfD process before we can declare such a concensus? How many poorly-written articles have to be fixed through the AfD process before we can declare a concensus that "it is better to just to fix a poorly written school article rather than immediately send it over to AfD"? How many months of schools surviving the AfD process are needed before we can declare a concensus that "it is better to work together to build the quality of school articles instead of gaming to system in a vain hope to get even one school article deleted"? While these are partly rhetorical questions, I think that those that nominated and vote to delete school articles on the basis that either A) "They are schools and non-notable" and/or B)"This school article is poorly written", should consider answering the questions. How long must the charade of AfD rules-gaming continue?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:00, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. These sort of time wasting exercises can be avoided by either tacking on a {{school-stub}} or merging the article somewhere until it can be expanded.
