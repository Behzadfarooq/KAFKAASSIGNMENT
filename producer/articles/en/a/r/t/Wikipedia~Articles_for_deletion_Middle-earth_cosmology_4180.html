<dd>I think the point here is that its not notable. Yes its correct but how is it noteable? Does the cosomolgy play a major role in the book? As per <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFACT_e22d.html" title="WP:FACT">WP:FACT</a> major characters/places should have articles, not minor ones. I find it hard to believe the structure of the cosmology has is of major important to the story of LotR but would be for other books of middle earth maybe.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 03:18, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Another point here is that the article is being improved all the time. I am extremely uncomfortable with the way this was nominated so soon after creation. Wikipedia articles should not have to be written fully formed, and some on-wiki development is both natural and helpful. I understand that articles have to pass a notability barrier, but that can't be fully evaluated until the article has stablised after the initial editing following its creation. The AfD could have waited a week. Wikipedia would not have imploded if the AfD had been delayed by one week. And to answer your question, yes, the cosmology is relevant to the overall strucutre of Tolkien's writings, which go far beyond just LotR. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 12:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

This article is not a plot summary. It should end up being an article that describes, using reliable sources, what the author said the names meant, what language they are, and where they are mentioned in Tolkien's works. Its notability comes directly from the notability of the article <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle-earth.html" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, which it should be considered a subarticle of (the Middle-earth article is too long for this to go there).

Twenty-six seconds after the article was created? Then slapping a 'not many pages link here' tag on it? How many <i>newly created</i> pages DO have alot of links to them? Then calling 'original research' on something which had <i>thirty-six</i> references in the initial stub? All very strange. The 'What Wikipedia is not' claim is within the bounds of reasonable (deletionist) interpretation, but I don't agree... Wikipedia also is not PAPER. Meaning that it can be the equivalent of a 'Mammals encyclopedia', plus a 'Star Trek encyclopedia', plus a 'Pokemon encyclopedia', and yes... a 'Tolkien encyclopedia'. Indeed, it already IS all of those things... as evidenced by the numerous existing pages of Tolkien articles which this one linked <i>to</i>. The benefit of this article is in laying out the various terms and their relationship to real world equivalents where possible. I also wanted to explore the possibility of merging some of te shorter pages on individual items into this one. I'd only made ONE edit to the page so far... there's alot left to do, but I don't see how that stub was anything like a candidate for deletion. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 01:56, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I know what you mean. A lot of fiction stuff slides in. Only notable 'major' things are meant to get an article, yet if you look at LotR stuff and Harry potter even minor characters get pages and then these pages are argueed as if they are major characters even when they are blatently minor. Either way this article is more of a list and it would be much better to start with deletion of 'Ea' and 'the Void' articles since they fail WP:FICT as non major. Just be prepared for all the fans to claim that its 'not minor'.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 04:25, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> per there's no chance in Hell there's been a scholarly study of "Middle-earth cosmology." And, yes, it is original research if it's all being sourced from the books themselves, because that's using primary sources to write the article. It ceases to be original research when we're citing what somebody else has written about middle-earth cosmology in a reliable source. Seriously, though, sourcing everything about Tolkein's works to Tolkein's works is somehow supposed to demonstrate notability? I rarely invoke the word cruft, but this is dangerously close to being such. GassyGuy 19:09, 22 January 2007 (UTC)

As to 'no way in hell there has been a scholarly study'... actually there have been several (Dr. Kristine Larsen - 'A Definitive Identification of Tolkien's "Borgil"', Naomi Getty - 'Stargazing in Middle-earth', et cetera)... but there is little (read 'zero') reason to cite other people citing Tolkien. Citing the primary source for factual information (as opposed to opinion / interpretation) is <i>anything</i> but 'original research'. I've been pondering whether it is worthwhile to cite these scholarly studies to include their opinions on identifications NOT specified by Tolkien... which <i>would</i> be 'research', but not 'original'. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 22:31, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To quote the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> policy, "Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. All articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from published primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." In short, you are mis-using the term 'original research' in a way that would invalidate <b>everything</b> on Wikipedia. Every article is an 'original compilation' of referenced materials... but that is NOT original research, its the <b>correct</b> way to do things. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> 10:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think the problem might be the first six entries, which haven't been referenced yet. I would hope that Lee Vonce read further than those six entries, and saw that the rest is well-referenced. But I can understand why someone not familiar with the subject matter might think that the first six entries are speculation by fans, not assertions of the author. Sticking in references and selected quotes from the 'Ambarkanta' material might help. Currently <a href="../../../a/m/b/Ambarkanta.html" title="Ambarkanta">Ambarkanta</a> redirects to the HoME volume it is in, but it would be good to have an Ambarkanta section in the Middle-earth cosmology article. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarcharoth_bbd5.html" title="User:Carcharoth">Carcharoth</a> 14:01, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Indexing collections of referenced information is normally acceptable. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the above.

<li><b>Keep</b> Verifiable information on q rather complex subject, relating to the works of a famous writer. Wikipedia at its best by other words. <a href="../../../d/i/m/User%7EDimadick_2b95.html" title="User:Dimadick">User:Dimadick</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm gonna assume this was spun off from <a href="../../../m/i/d/Middle_earth.html" title="Middle earth">middle earth</a> which is getting really frikking huge and seems like it could use being split up. The article could clearly use work but I'm not ready to delete it without giving it a chance because there's a lot of potential. <a href="../../../p/l/y/User%7EPlymouths_dcb2.html" title="User:Plymouths">Plymouths</a> 02:35, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../e/%C3%A4/_/E%C3%A4.html" title="Eä">Eä</a> since this is mostly a list of the named components thereof. This is not original research since the identifications are sourced (mostly to commentary by Christopher Tolkien as it happens), but the lack of third party sources suggests limited notability. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:55, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: The first two items in the list are outside the physical realm, so <a href="../../../e/%C3%A4/_/E%C3%A4.html" title="Eä">Eä</a> (the universe) was merged into it instead. <a href="../../../u/t/h/User%7EUthanc_61f6.html" title="User:Uthanc">Uthanc</a> 12:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I did notice that, which is why I didn't change <i>mostly</i> to <i>entirely</i> in my previous comment. I still think that having <i>Eä</i> as the main article with links to the Timeless Halls and the Void is the best way to organize this, but that's mostly just an article title dispute (I certainly prefer Quenya titles but few others do) since the final form (minor entities merged into a single article) would be essentially the same. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 13:37, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Per above. I think some of the confusion the opposers have with Tolkien's fiction is that they want interpretive references as opposed to the historical references (i.e. the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christopher_Tolkien_6f84.html" title="Christopher Tolkien">Christopher Tolkien</a> refs). There aren't that many interpretational references out there because Tolkien emphatically states his work was not alegory. As a constructed history (of incredible impact), Tolkien's work deserves <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">special consideration</a> in relation to the drawing of sources from his son and the work itself. If this was a real historical or astronomical article, we wouldn't be having this discussion. <a href="../../../i/r/o/User%7EIrongargoyle_444b.html" title="User:Irongargoyle">Irongargoyle</a> 20:15, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
