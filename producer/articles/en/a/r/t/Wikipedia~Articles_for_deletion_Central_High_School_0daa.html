<li>Actually, no, I do not beleive any school could be expanded in this way. If this school is really recognized nationally for academic excellence and has the only student orchestra ever to perform at Carneigie Hall, it just meets notability standards as far as I am concerned and is acceptable because there are not stringent space limitations. I think out of the thousands upon thousands of schools that exist in the United States alone, there are probably only a couple of hundred that reach even this minimum level of notability. That is still quite a few entries that would be acceptable, but limits the coverage of the subject to what is important. That is exactly what an encyclopedia is supposed to do: weed out the unimportant and highlight the unusual and/or important. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 20:41, Oct 27, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually, no. I examined this stub. It says it is the second-largest school in its city, gives the school colors, and mentions that an NBA player went there. This does not merit inclusion in my opinion. Just because my standards are different than yours does not mean I am deleting without considering. If this article were to change and meet my standards during the vfd period, I would change my vote. Comments like yours show a complete intolerance for the opinions of others and something of a holier-than-thou attitude. I understand why you want to keep the article; I just disagree with your position. You fail to see that there can even be another position.
