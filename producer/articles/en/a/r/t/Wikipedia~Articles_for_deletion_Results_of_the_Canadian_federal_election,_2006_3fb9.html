<li><b>Keep</b> on the grounds that the Election and the Results can exist in two separate articles. <b>However</b> I believe the assumption that Wikipedia is not based in Canada and therefore does not have to abide by certain Canadian election laws is a false one. Wikipedia a <b>worldwide</b> web site and there is no control over the location of the editors who contribute to this page.

<li><b>Speedy Strong Keep</b> I'm not sure what the person who nominated this is trying to do. I note that they have now been blocked, so perhap this is vandalism? If this isn't vandalism, I don't know why the user just doesn't edit the article, rather than trying to delete it. I just can't fathom why one wouldn't think this page is necessary, given we already have <a href="../../../r/e/s/Results_of_the_Canadian_federal_election%2C_2004_aba8.html" title="Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004">Results of the Canadian federal election, 2004</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/s/Results_of_the_Canadian_federal_election%2C_2000_c707.html" title="Results of the Canadian federal election, 2000">Results of the Canadian federal election, 2000</a>.

<li>No, because I've been complaining that the ones who started it are actually leaning too far the other way - deleting early results!

<dd>I'm confused, the delete process is week-long process. The polls close in 47 minutes, and your asking the article be deleted because it violates Canadian law for those 47 minutes?

<p>Perhaps you should read Section 329 of the Elections Act and find out. What you quoted is misleading. --199.44.251.2 02:11, 24 January 2006 (UTC) .. BTW if anyone is interested. Reuters has posted the results. A link can be found on the discussion page for the article.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I read Section 329 and found it unclear on the exact application of the law. Here's an article from the CBC today that sheds some more light: <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbc.ca/nb/story/nb_web_20060123.html</a>. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 02:20, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Canadian law does not apply outside Canada. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcandeto_0bda.html" title="User:Dcandeto">Dcandeto</a> 02:24, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p><s>:*Section 329 seems to specifically address the idea of "outside Canada" and I think that's wrong. Besides, Wikipedia is not "outside Canada." What's relevant is that people inside Canada can access the information. It doesn't matter that the servers for Wikipedia or the offices for Wikipedia are located in the U.S. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 02:29, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</s> never mind.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. We're going to want this page again shortly anyway. And until an international treaty says otherwise, Canada can't force censorship on the rest of the world. Maybe Wikipedia could block Canadian IPs... but I don't think so&#160;:). -Nichlemn 02:32, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b>: The publication law has been upheld for now. The Supreme Court may rule on it in the future, but it currently still stands.
