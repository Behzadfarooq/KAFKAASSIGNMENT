<p>It is a vanity article about a non-notable website, and is unfinished. Badly edited. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 13:31, 28 December 2006 (UTC)[[]]<br />

<p>I created this page because I am a <b>fan</b> of cokelogic. This page not only contains relevance to an art, but a place in time with numerous references source. All facts are accurate and related to the subject matter. I ask, is Wikipedia an encyclopedia for <b>only</b> "popular" material? Not a record of history, but a catalog of pop culture. Exactly how many records must be sold before a band is noteworthy enough to be recognized by Wikipedia?<br />
I submit that no violation has been committed with this page. I am <b>not</b> a member of the band. I am a <b>fan</b> making a page for one<br />
of my favorite bands. And there is <b>nothing</b> in Terms of Service that that tells me I can't; in fact it encourages me to do so.<br />
Pernambuco's argument holds no water. I will overlook the personal attack laid upon me: I will debate his AfD submission, but I will not stand to be criticized as a "bad editor". To delete this page would be to deny useful and relevant information.--Paul Dempsey 14:33, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The new website contains many resources and useful links to learn more about the bands history, and experience their sound. I think this is a fantastic article with poignant thoughts and relevant info. It would be a shame to deprive so many people of this bands richly textued sound and arrangements. --Melissa Skorupa</p>

<p>This is outrageous. Am I actually reading that cokelogic is not noteworthy because, "they haven't won a Grammy"? The Doors never won a Grammy. Led Zeppelin never won a Grammy. Queen never won a Grammy. Should we tear them out of the history books? Madness.<br />
And let me understand that you must now have toured internationally, as a simple inner-national tour amounts to nothing in the eyes of Wikipedia?.<br />
And finally, I would like to point out yet another, 'editorial' in this so call fact sheet: "XM Radio...maybe? Not sure because XM will play nearly anything". Please site facts, not opinions. Suddenly we're calling in the merit of an international satellite company? It's becoming clear that this is not a matter of what is noteworthy for Wikipedia, but what people 'feel' is a popular, view 'hitting' page.<br />
Finally, let me editorialize a little myself. I can't remember when I had a bigger laugh than when Brian posed the question, "have they created a theme for a network TV show or movie"; oh, dear lord. Are these really your points for deletion consideration? As far as I can recall, The Rolling Stones never wrote a TV theme songs and they got into Wikipedia just fine. So if you are keeping score: The Rembrandts (the band that wrote the Friends theme song), one; The Rolling Stones, zero.<br />
Why don't we just delete that Beatles page because they never did a Mountain Dew jingle?--Paul Dempsey 00:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Paul, all I did was look at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> (Had you looked at it before making the article?). What I did was take each point from what that guidelines states and then stacked CokeLogic next to Wikipedia's standards. This is NOT personal. I enjoy their music, but they do not meet Wikipedia's standards. Even if one of the artists was a friend or relative, I still would have the opinion of Delete. Don't be upset at me for pointing out the short comings. No, the doors never created a theme, but they did have multi platinum records and were charted. They did tour internationally. Same with the Rolling stones. You are grasping at straws here. --16:24, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - to clear up Paul Dempsey's confusion, think of it as a point-scoring system. You get one point for a Grammy, one point for having one or more charted hits, one point for having at least two albums on a major label, one point for major national or international tours, etc. So if you add up the scores for the Doors or the Beatles, you get at least five or six. The minimum score required for Wikipedia is one. Cokelogic scores zero.

This is alarming. The negativity from this site is beyond words. Shot and a miss for our friend Xrifr; so brave to pass judgement while hiding behind a screen name. Wikipedia has accepted pages for <b>Paris Hilton</b>, <b>Ralph Wiggum</b> and <b>Toast</b>. <i>Three examples that hold only the most important of information in the great halls of this great institution</i>. A rich man's daughter who's claim to fame is gonzo pronogrpahy, a fictional cartoon chracter (not even a main character of The Simpsons, mind you) and Toast. All of these subjects are seen fit in the Wikipedia record books, but not the musicians of Cokelogic? If this Cokelogic page does not stand, there is something inherently wrong. Both with the structure of this site and the elitist navs who pester these grounds.--Paul Dempsey 12:18, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Paris Hilton was on the cover of many woman's mags, has many articles written about her from reliable, reputable sources and has co-starred in a TV show. (has CokeLogic done any of these?) Ralph Wiggum is a part of the popular 'Simpsons' TV program. Normally, instead of creating a very large page, information on each character is seperated out into it's own article. As an asside, most Microsoft software has it's own wikipedia page because adding it to the main page would create information overload. As for Toast...well who doesn't know about toast?&#160;:) Anyway, the point is...Do the above mentions meet wikipedia standards? Paris Hilton with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? Yes. Ralph with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENotability_56d5.html" title="WP:Notability">WP:Notability</a>? Yes. Toast with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>? Yes. CokeLogic with <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>? no.

<li><b>Delete</b> Sorry Paul. The difference between cokelogic and Ralph Wiggum, Paris Hilton, and Toast is that I've heard of those three but never heard of this band before. It shows only 2840 hits on google and I could find no mention of them in any sort of verifiable source. Please see <a href="../../../s/o/u/WP%7ESOURCE_b1c9.html" title="WP:SOURCE">WP:SOURCE</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> regarding this article. While Wikipedia does encourage people to <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">Ignore All Rules</a>, this is only in the context of places where the Wikipedia policies are vague or simply fail... and while <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not limited</a>, it is also a place for information which can be verified. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 16:28, 29 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

So let me get this straight, because Lankybugger has not heard of Cokelogic, the information is therefore insubmissable? This is your arguement? Perhaps with a place like Wikipedia you can learn about something you haven't heard of. Learn about Cokelogic. Is this not the point of the site? But no need for any new information, if Lankybugger hasn't heard of it, it doesn't exist. Please counter-point this respond and sound ridiculous; I need a good laugh.--Paul Dempsey 21:57, 29 December 2006 (UTC)<br />

Oh, I see. It's not about research information, it's about popularity? We're not trying to make Wikipedia into a resource for information?

They are notable simply by virtue of their immersion in popular culture.

Demiurge, I've read these before. If you <b>actually</b> read the debates above you'll see that you are last to point this out. I've stated before that I am a fan of the band putting up a page for Cokelogic. Now I'm being asked to be a professional investigator and pull up articles, TV apperences and the like. Since when has any page started "finished". Why do some of you add to the article. Do some research. The page should be dismissed because I don't have <b>all</b> the answers?

<dd>Paul, I'm sorry if you're feeling picked on, but this is just one of the <i>hundreds</i> of articles listed for potential deletion each and every day. And this one (unlike many) was considered borderline enough to be listed for discussion first. Which means that it was posted where people who <i>do</i> know how to do some research are able to review it, and see if it can be salvaged. Many people (including me) browse the daily lists of articles to discuss to see what, if anything, can be salvaged. I know how to do some research on musical acts, and have helped salvage many articles, but I cannot find anything to help salvage this one. I'm sorry. [[Us<br />

You have only argued with us and been generally uncivil, falling short only of <a href="../../../s/p/i/WP%7ESPIDER_911a.html" title="WP:SPIDER">climbing the Reichstag dressed as Spiderman</a>, and according to the article's history, the only thing you've done to the article is create it, not improve it. If you wish the article to be kept, then you need to improve the article, and likewise, you need to stop trying to <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">lawyer</a> your way around with irrelevant examples as precedent for a keep, decontexted quoting, and generally being uncivil; by doing this, you aren't exactly going to win people over to your point of view. To distill this: if you want to change our minds, you need to improve the article, and stop wasting your time arguing. Unless you improve the article, my vote (for one) stands as delete. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 22:30, 1 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Hello, this is Pernambuco again, I am the person who listed Cokelogic for deletion, and Paul was angry with me for that, but it was nothing personal, I just gave my reasons and I wanted to hear what others think. My own opinion is unchanged until now, I still support deletion, and if it is not deleted, then at least it needs to be rewritten and improved, it is one of these two. The current article is just not very good, this is why I always thought it needed either delete or improvement. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 04:29, 2 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You've done fine, Pernambuco. The ball is now - and frankly, has been - in Paul's court: like I said above to him, he needs to quit arguing and fix the article if it is not to be deleted. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 04:56, 2 January 2007 (UTC)<br />

<dd>thank you, it is normal that pages are deleted or improved, I saw this one, and I listed it for deletion. It was nothing personal against cokelogic or Paul (I do not know Paul, and I have never heard of this band cokelogic before in my life) and I want to say that this is not the first time that I am suggesting a page for deletion, however, it is the first time someone is angry about it, I am sorry, but I still feel the way that I do. <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 14:58, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I am open for suggestions. I'm hearing, 'improve the page' now. I'm not sure how to improve things here on a text based article. If anyone has suggestions, I'm will listen as it's closer to keeping the page up without threat.--Paul Dempsey 06:19, 2 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As suggested before, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> will tell you of the verifiability guidelines, and <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> will tell you of the notability guidelines. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> in particular will apply here. Read those guidelines, and look for clues of this on the 'net. In particular, we're looking for anything - newspaper articles, for one; magazines, for another. Those are examples, and are by no means the limit - the articles I quote here will give you good guidelines of what to look for. In this case, Google is your friend - do your research.</dd>
<dd>One thing that's important to keep in mind - <i>we are not prejudiced to a deletion</i>. If you can get these guidelines going before the AfD here is complete, it's probably a keep; if you can't, and it gets deleted, keep up with your research, and go to <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a> to get it undeleted when you complete it. What <i>would</i>, however, make us prejudiced to deletion in the future (should this get deleted in the meantime) is insistent recreation of the article with a failure to follow these guidelines. In I think a good idea behind this is probably looking at the recent AfD for comedian <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_2_the_Ranting_Gryphon_%282nd_nomination%29_93a2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2 the Ranting Gryphon (2nd nomination)">2 The Ranting Gryphon</a>. (I submitted this one myself. I like the guy, and he's funny as hell, but <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">I like it</a> is not a suitable reason to keep something here - and he's only really that notable within the <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furry_fandom.html" title="Furry fandom">furry fandom</a>.)</dd>
<dd>As soon as I (or someone else) can get it, there'll be an introduction to Wikipedia on your talk page, explaining what we're about, and explaining in brief the five "pillars" of Wikipedia. In the meantime, you may want to make a backup of the article <i>just in case</i>, and work on it in your userspace somewhere if it gets deleted.</dd>
