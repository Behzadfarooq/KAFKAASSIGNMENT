<li><b>Weak Delete</b> or <b>Transwiki</b>. I was a bit surprised at how many hits I got when I searched usedthis term (on AltaVista, just to be contrary).

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>. My first reaction on reading the article was strong delete.

The term "Google generation" is even in use by the British Library, so if it gets deleted now, it's only going to be recreated later. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 02:01, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> A Google search (how ironic!) shows that this does seem to be a term used in news headlines and such. It's already expanded beyond being a dicdef. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 02:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge with Google</b> at present this is essentially a dicdef of a neologism, with some examples. Yes, it's apparently widespread. But, there's nothing to really say about it, other than it refers to young people who grew up using Google. Or, Wiktionary maybe? <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrillig20_55d1.html" title="User:Brillig20">Brillig20</a> 03:39, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable from reliable sources (Urban Dictionary is not a reliable source, neither is number of hits on Google). Could be transwiki'd to Wiktionary, since they accept popular usage as a crieterion for inclusion. We don't. We require coverage in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable secondary sources</a>, otherwise it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. Kudos to Tyrenius for making the effort, which was undoubtedly the right thing to do, and well done for adding some sources (better than none, which so many articles have) - however, without citations, we can't keep it. Call me a <a href="../../../w/o/n/WP%7EWONK_b33f.html" title="WP:WONK">policy wonk</a>. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 11:46, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you not consider the British Library, and newspapers such as the Guardian and the Telegraph to be reliable sources? They have all used this term and commented on its implications. Amongst the Google results are many usages by colleges and librarians etc, defining characteristics which relate to it, and seeing it as a phenomenon which needs to be addressed. It didn't mean anything to me, until this AfD came up. I suggest looking into it a little more thoroughly. I think it would be a credit to Wiki to provide this information, and disappointing if it doesn't. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 12:20, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's still popular usage - which makes it a dictdef, albeit a great and really comprehensively attributed dictdef. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 13:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As it says in <a href="../../../g/e/n/Generation_Y_bc53.html" title="Generation Y">Generation Y</a>:"generations are defined not by formal process, but rather by demographers, the press and media, popular culture, market researchers, and by members of the generation themselves". There is also an article on <a href="../../../i/g/e/IGeneration_a315.html" title="IGeneration">iGeneration</a>. Those two are proposed for a merge, and I can see the ultimate viability of merging <a href="../../../g/o/o/Google_Generation_41bc.html" title="Google Generation">Google Generation</a> with them too.</dd>
