<li>I edited it a LOT. I kept all the previous information (let's call it "BS") in the bottom two sections, with a note that says it's disputed. If somebody can point to a source (for instance, MK: Defenders of the Realms or some such), then that'd be fine, but as it was, it sucked. The other sections now come straight from the games, except where noted. It's very complete, though maybe somebody could find a better word for "roboticization", as it currently links to a site from Sonic the Hedgehog&#160;:-) As for keeping, I say <b>Keep</b> if only because of the time I spent on it (cross-referencing as necessary).

<li>User:Bloghate's crusade notwithstanding, this guy's really only notable for being a moron. <b>Delete</b>, although I wouldn't oppose a merge somewhere; say, into <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a>, where this could be used as an example of the perils of blogging about your employer. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 03:59, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This guy is notable. I learned about him recently when he was interviewed in a <a href="../../../n/p/r/NPR_8c1a.html" title="NPR">NPR</a> program. I can't remember the exact program (need to check it out), but believe it was a country-wide (i.e. USA) program (could be <a href="../../../t/a/l/Talk_of_the_Nation_f0b9.html" title="Talk of the Nation">Talk of the Nation</a>, but not 100% sure). From what I heard, he is a very sensible guy and sound nice. He wrote his blog in his private time to keep in touch with family and friends, and Google was too harsh to fire him for that. Google didn't accuse him of acting in bad-faith or making false statement, the corporation just don't like an employee "talking". This raise a number of issues regarding employee's rights, blogging and <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle_blower.html" title="Whistle blower">whistle blowers</a> (They are not "morons" and I strongly object the use of this word by AиDя01DTALKEMAIL).

<li>If he said he "wrote his blog in his private time to keep in touch with family and friends" on that show, then he misrepresented himself to quite a large degree. He revealed information about <i>unreleased products</i> and <i>financial issues</i> at Google. Perhaps calling him a moron was a bit harsh, but publishing this sort of information on the Web within weeks of being hired without thinking about the potential consequences is a bit naïve, to say the least. His case has almost nothing to do with civil rights or whistleblowing. I <i>have</i> researched and considered this – I read all about it when it hit Slashdot – and took a look at his blog again before casting my vote above. The guy is not notable outside of the context of this flap with Google. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 12:55, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article itself is an encyclopedic explanation. The four examples only serve to clarify the concept more.

<li><b>Keep</b> although I also share R. fiend's concern about this becoming a list of one-hit wonders. Hopefully editors will boldly remove songs that are not really signature songs, although as FCYTravis says, it is not very objective. In my mind, a signature song means the one song that a popular and well-established singer (a much higher standard than merely a "notable" singer) is identified with even though he has had success with a variety of songs. I don't really understand what the current article means when it talks about songs the artist is "praised" for. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 23:48, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is the problem, we need someone who's had more than one hit (because, let's face it, "567-5309 Jenny" is not the sort of thing we need in this article) but they have to be widely known for one song above all else, but not <i>too</i> much above all else (or we're back in the one hit wonder grey area). I'm sure someone will add Tom Jones singing "It's Not Unusual" and I have no idea if that's enough above the hits like "Delilah" or "What's New Pussycat" to qualify, and I can see debates going on about such things (if anyone cares). These things are always tricky. And I still don't think anyone's taken care of the needed work on the <a href="../../../c/u/l/Cult_musician.html" title="Cult musician">cult musician</a> article, which has similar issues. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:01, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wahoofive, I don't think a <i>list</i> is verifiable (although I think the example of "I Left my Heart in San Francisco" and Tony Bennett would gain almost universal acceptance as a "signature song") but I think an explanation with a few examples is verfifiable (i.e., the concept of a signature song is valid). I am <i>not</i> proposing a list of signature songs and I would hope (maybe unreasonably) that additions that don't garner almost universal agreement should be removed. <a href="../../../d/s/1/User%7EDS1953_d23a.html" title="User:DS1953">DS1953</a> 00:05, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I hope you're right. I have visions of revert wars everytime somebody adds the latest top-40 hit. Without the list it's still just a dicdef (and a pretty clumsy one at that: "an artist may have one or many signature songs...").

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a really bad idea for all the reasons given by the delete voters. Look at the article, <i>after</i> keep voters have improved it. "A signature song is a song considered to be the best material produced by an artist when they are at their artistic peak." -- considered best by who? Who says when they are at their artistic peak? "These songs are often praised by a particular performance of them by an artist at a concert or other event of significance." -- how is a song praised by a performance? I don't understand that sentence. "An artist can have one or many signature songs and they can have different signature songs in different parts of the world depending on where they are praised." -- lovely. One or many. How about I just say that all 38 of <a href="../../../e/l/v/Elvis_Presley_0230.html" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a>'s top 10 hits were his signature songs. I see no hope of verifiability of this ultra-subjective categorization, and not verifiable means not encyclopedic.

<li><b>Mild Shock</b>, I am Travis Fahey. I must say I am a little shocked by the reaction to this listing, thus far. Upon checking my email yesterday, I discovered that a close friend of mine had created a listing in Wikipedia as a joke. I took it as that, a joke, despite the fact that I am, indeed, a two-time award-winning journalist from Burlington, Vermont. When you google my name, you'll mostly find references to my careers since; I have since worked in public realtions at Middlebury College and currently work as a corporate communications specialist. I think you all need to find something else to do with your time than berate what is clearly a humorous, albeit factually accurate, entry and a playful jab between two friends. - [[User:travisfahey|[[User talk:travisfahey|08:28, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Merge</b></s> (Changed mind: <b>Keep</b>) - It is a tough decision. (Keep or Merge) "PC Load Letter" is a notable phrase in a cult movie. (Slashdot's references it a lot especially with the "IT" post icon, the red stapler) It is not a neologism. It is a printer/copier machine phrase, too. <a href="http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/hp-list/2001q2/000458.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/hp-list/2001q2/000458.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> However, it is probably best known because of Office Space. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChill_Pill_Bill_4117.html" title="User:Chill Pill Bill">Chill Pill Bill</a> 06:02, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi, i am the author of one of the below "keep" comments. i would like to adress the sock puppets accusation... im not sure what exactly sock puppets means, but i guess it's something to do with all the votes being from the one person? you may find with a little research, perhaps contact the institution mentioned on the ian hedger page (st. bede's college, mentone, victoria, australia), that many of these comments come from students. they have heard about the page through word of mouth, and are supporting the <b>TRUE</b> story about their friend/acquantance. You may also find that the two entries from the same IP adress are entries from step brothers, using two computers on the same network. I urge that these facts be considered before this page is dismissed as a hoax or a joke. Before dismissing this, someone please do some research.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is no hoax. I am a Social Work student at Monash University doing a paper on teenage risk factors. My teacher, Dr. Max Liddell actually referred me to the 'Ian Hedger' case study in Australia. I couldn’t seem to find any good resources for the Ian Hedger case on Yahoo or Google, nor my own library, but i stumbled upon this excerpt here. If you are interested more about the Ian hedger case you should try emailing the social work department at Monash.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't believe this story is being considered for deletion. I think one will find over the next few years a number of websites and articles being made in devotion to this story. The myths surrounding this case are simply untrue and unjustified. A depressed boy goes missing, and immediately people begin pawning off murders onto him. The chances of the boy still being alive are virtually zero, and it is my belief that he has found a happier place. Ian Hedger must not be forgotten, and I hope anyone who tries to remove this tribute to him, or deface it, suffers a similar fate. - Brother Paul Kenjamin, F.S.C. - <i>anon vote by User:203.31.184.154 - only three edits to Wikipedia are on this VFD and the page.</i></li>

<p>I know there was a VfD for this one already, but that was more than a year ago, and I think it needs to be reconsidered. This article is some of the most blatant POV I’ve seen yet on Wikipedia. Even the American mainstream media, which has a definite pro-Israel bias, does not refer to suicide bombings as massacres. “Massacre” is a very emotive word, and does not fit with the mission of being informative. A list like this should simply be called what it is – a “list of major suicide-bombings against Israel since 2000.” The page was designed to give readers the impressions that Israel has been victim of repeated “massacres,” while killings of Palestinians are left out. The Israel human rights group BtSelem, however, reports that more than three times more Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during this period than Israelis killed by Palestinians <a href="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>. The authors of this page claim that it wasn’t designed just for killings where the victims were Israelis, but the wording was cleverly designed to exclude any actions by the Israeli government, since of course it will always deny that any of their actions intentionally targeted civilians. So therefore none of them will ever appear on this list. So anyway, unless this article is dramatically changed, so as to remove the word “massacre” and either include violence against Palestinians or be clearly labeled as “violence against Israelis,” then it deserves to be <b>deleted</b> as POV propaganda. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlackcats_1f78.html" title="User:Blackcats">Blackcats</a> 08:07, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

We could have one giant "List of all events in which more than 10 people died at one time", but that would be mush, so we divide things up into neat categories that are bounded by identifiable markers.

<li><b>Rename</b> If this is a list of suicide bomb attacks then that is what it should say.

<li>Well, they could be investigated to see if they fit the description. I would assume that something which without warning deliberately kills, say, ten unarmed civilians going about their daily business would generally be described as a massacre, any effort to pretty it up would be adding a POV; sometimes things speak for themselves. Compare to the constant campaign to delete quotes from Ann Coulter from her wikipage because they make her look bad and thus are POV. We could put a comment in for each whether it was suicide bomb or more personal methodology if we're dubious about calling a suicide bombing a massacre. I don't know if ten is the accepted threshold for a massacre or not. <a href="../../../g/z/u/User%7EGzuckier_c12c.html" title="User:Gzuckier">Gzuckier</a> 16:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

The term "massacre" is an appropriate description for killings of large numbers of civilians at once, and I would consider it an accurate description of at least some of the events linked. However, 10 is probably too low a threshold (I used 50 myself), and Blackcats is certainly right to highlight the weasel wording that allows massacres by Israel to be kept out of the list. <b>Keep and cleanup</b>. - <a href="../../../m/u/s/User%7EMustafaa_9e9a.html" title="User:Mustafaa">Mustafaa</a> 17:16, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: Since in Greek an /h/ is merely an aspiration mark and, in general, /h/ is not a consonant, it's quite likely for an "Herb/herb" divergence to take place, but it's just as likely that they're separate words from separate languages. It's just not logically necessary for one to be from the other, and "Americanizing" names doesn't usually involve aspirating their initial vowels. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 17:45, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</dd>

A poorly-chosen neologism that was recorded in only a single article in an online political magazine, it suffered a well-deserved death.

<p>While reverting some sneaky vandalism done to my user page, I checked the vandal's edits. There I found this page, and as the person mentioned seemed unnotable, I nominated him here. <b>Note:</b> The name gets a lot of google hits, but they seem to be for other Jay Blanchards, such as the state senator or the professor. <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 15:35, 15 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>Keep-- This is a legitimate entry. The above statement is incomprehensible &amp; seems like more of a revenge vote than an actual dismissal of the page. Jay Blanchard's work can be found online, as well as much of his writing about experimental film, which has published domestically and internationally.

<li>You'd be surprised just how many people in how many countries in the world have heard of individual Pokémon characters, too. People apply the "Pokémon test" but don't really comprehend how widely known Pokémon actually is. The Pokémon test actually sets quite a high bar, not the low one that people make it out to set.

<li>Of the 534 edits to the article since it was created on 17 July 2004, almost all of them have been reverted as "vandalism" or as the addition of inappropriate content (all the "Totse-isms"). The vandalism and reversions has been fairly constant throughout the life of the article. The alexa ranking is currently at about 15,000 but has been <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=totse.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?&amp;range=2y&amp;size=large&amp;compare_sites=&amp;y=t&amp;url=totse.com" rel="nofollow">highly variable over time</a> and appears to have centered around 25,000 or so. If the claims of the current article are to be believed, there are only 30k users - not all that many for an internet forum.

Reasoning is this: If we count the nomination and the bolded votes we find 5 deletes and 1 keep. That <i>is</i> a consensus to delete. Reading the comments however we find two of the delete votes saying that the useful info should be merged with the Norwood article. I will interpret those as merge votes. The GFDL license does not allow merge and delete, so it will have to be merge and redirect. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:13, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

Knowing the number of R-rated movies this list would be huge and unmanageable; it gets even more complicated when movie rating systems in other than the U.S. are brought into the picture, some of which have their own R ratings; and this is arguably promoting a POV in favor of the MPAA's rating system by even having such a list. <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaibabsquirrel_3907.html" title="User:Kaibabsquirrel">Kaibabsquirrel</a> 23:28, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>While some of us may have been slightly harsh I would like to point out that while, yes, we all were new users once, I sincerely doubt <i>any</i> of the above voters ever behaved like this, particularly after being told <i>numerous times</i> that such behavior was disruptive and not appreciated. He continued to make lists only slightly more viable than List of movies with the words "good", "bad", and "ugly" in the title on one extreme, and List of movies about stuff on the other, as well as making substubs that didn't even contain the most basic information an article requires. Most had to be salvaged by some of us who cleaned them up to make them even minimally viable. I can't speak for the user's intent, not knowing what it is, but keep in mind intent is the difference between murder and manslaughter. It doesn't get you off the hook entirely. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:48, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Likely vanity. Only claims to notability are "bit" roles in three films, but Internet Movie Database doesn't list her in any of them. (IMDB lists five Melissa Lees, but not this one.)

<li><b>Delete</b> I may well be one of the most inclusionist voters when it comes to actors, as I generally believe that an IMDB entry should equal a WP entry. However, this one is way too non-notable even for me. Might even be a hoax, as it's hard to imagine anyone behaving like a "diva" whilst cast as an extra(!) Even if we swallow the whole thing, though, it's still non-notable. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 21:26, Jun 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I'd be <i>very</i> hesitant to make the claim that an IMDb entry should equal a WP entry. IMDb has no rules against self-promotion as we do, and they really will list just about anyone. I don't know if your criteria extends beyond actors to Key Grips, Gaffers, 3rd Assistant editors and the like, but if it does I'd encourage you to think about this policy of yours, especially when we consider the B and C grade films that are made and sold straight to DVD on the interent these days. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 02:26, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I doubt that anyone is exactly hurrying to write an article on some guy who was second-unit assistant dolly grip on some early-70s spaghetti western, I don't see why WP couldn't or shouldn't include such an article if someone was willing to write it. The obvious question would be: <i>why bother to waste time duplicating info that's already on the IMDB?</i> The answer to that is simple: the IMDB is not open information. It's riddled with ads, including incredibly-intrusive Flash ads, and some of it already requires a paid account to access. The information needs to be freed. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 12:30, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>I can think of one person who might be anxious to write an article on the second-unit assistant dolly grip on some early-70s spaghetti western, and that's the second-unit assistant dolly grip on some early-70s spaghetti western. We've had problems with people using IMDb to justify wikipedia vanity articles before, and I'm not anxious to encourage it. IMDb basically promotes vanity, and if we mirror them then we are promoting vanity as well, which I am loath to do. While actors, based on their prominent physical appearance in films and our culture's obesession with celebrity, are generally much more notable than people of equivalent ability in other professions, I hardly think anyone in any way associated with a movie is. Have you been to a film recently? Have you seen how long it takes all the credits to scroll across the screen at the end? Is every one of those names in every single movie worthy of an encyclopedia article? Even actors, I would say, should have a substantial role or two in a film/TV show (and by substantial I don't mean "leading" or even "major", but something better than an extra/nonspeaking/uncredited role or "Man in cab line #4"). Wikipedia and IMDb serve different (but overlapping) purposes, and wikipedia should not try to be IMDb. They will always be a better film database than we are, but we will always be a better encyclopedia. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 16:25, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, if you want to claim that it is widely used and understood I would like to see some evidence of that. The fact that I have never heard it used (and that nobody else has said that they have heard it) is evidence that it is not widely used or understood, as is the fact that it is not listed in the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com" rel="nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a> and the fact that I cannot find any instance of the word being used as such on Google.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The author is not using WP as a soapbox in this case mostly.

<li><b>Keep</b> By fully covering rebuttals for each point, this is a pretty good way to present such an article fairly and in a relatively NPOV format. While I do think this should be kept, I hope we're not showing a "nerd" bias here. I would imagine, for example, that a similar article collecting inconsistencies between the Pokemon anime and games would probably be deleted as "cruft". My point, friends, is that if we keep this article, we're setting a precedent or a "bar"... let's not forget that fact in future VfDs. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:12, Jun 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> although as a regular editor of the page in question I'll understand if my vote is discounted. As Andrew says above, attempts are made to keep this as balanced as possible, and the reason this page exists is because when it was originally part of the original article on Enterprise it was weighing things down. Now that the show is cancelled and the debates for and against the series are going to eventually fade away, this article can no doubt be shortened. It certainly does need to be trimmed regularly for NPOV. But I think it's a worthy article because it discusses what was (and still is) a hot topic in the science fiction community. Tone Sidaway's comment about it being a debate format is well taken as this is indeed the intent of the article <i>initially</i> because it was felt this was the easiest way of organizing opposing viewpoints (while reducing the possibility of vandalism or POV rants being added). But, the time is right to reformat and reorganize the article. PS. I see someone just added a cleanup tag to the article. Isn't this overkill? One would assume a VFD tag is by definition a cleanup request. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:43, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>From early votes, it seems fairly likely that it will be a keep consensus. It is possible that the vfd notice will be removed before the clean-up is complete. Sorry if I have offended you, remove it if you like. --<a href="../../../j/i/f/User%7EJiFish_180b.html" title="User:JiFish">JiFish</a>(<a href="../../../j/i/f/User_talk%7EJiFish_ceec.html" title="User talk:JiFish">Talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JiFish_b9a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/JiFish">Contrib</a>) 00:55, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>What most concerns me is the lack of references. As it stands it could be interpreted as original research, with fans using Wikipedia to enter their own personal findings of apparent continuity problems. This is not permitted on Wikipedia. If some of these points and rebuttals are covered elsewhere, in one or more sources doesn't matter, then during cleanup those points should be retained and the references explicitly included. Points that just seem self-evident to the editor--no matter how obviously correct they are--should not be included if he can find no reasonable, citable source for them. Editors wanting to do that kind of work should take it to an appropriate fan forum and then maybe some other party will think the report notable enough to cite. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 11:37, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This is a good article, just needs a cleanup RussellG 10:12, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. First of all, any of the major continuity problems that aren't notable enough to be mentioned in the main entperise article are fancruft. Second of all, this genre of article strongly implies original research, and if its kept I will delete any addition to the article if it is not accompianed by a refrence. The debate format makes it even worse because in the popular discussion (ie. the external to wikipedia discussions) its possible that many points will not have a counter point making any wikipedians attempt at a counterpoint necessarily a forbidden original research.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that the format needs to be changed for conformity's sake, but some echo of the point-counterpoint current format should be retained. And, in response to the last voter, I don't see anything that is truly original research, and there is nothing wrong with simply noting that some alleged continuity questions remain unanswered. I think you're jumping the gun here in assuming the worst of people who might add new points. Isn't faith in fellow users supposed to pervade this place? June 19, 2005</li>
