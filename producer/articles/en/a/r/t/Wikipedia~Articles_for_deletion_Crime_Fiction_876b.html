<li><b>Delete</b> without prejudice toward recreation when (if?) it gets released. IMDB is proven unreliable on projected movies, and I have to wonder about a movie that was listed as "Post-production" 8 months ago and hasn't had an update since. It's not exactly an A-list cast. Could get released and be a big hit, could go straight to video, could get dumped as not worth the expense of releasing.

<li><b>Comment</b> It's rather annoying that how the word "student film" is being thrown around. If you are a student and make a film, it's not immedially a "student film." It is a student film if made for a class, anything on your own is a "film." And if something is a student film that doesn't imply that it is bad or poor (i.e. THX1138). Sorry for my mini-rant. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 23:47, 17 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that's a fair point. To my mind, if the film gets a distribution deal, it graduates from "student film" to "indie". That ok? <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 02:18, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The problem is that student film is restricted to class. Indie deals with an actual deal. You can actually make film for the love of it (i.e. Channel101.com and Channel102.net). <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 02:25, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I don't. I wouldn't expect a film that has apparantly just recently gone through post-production to be released at this time. The Web site for the production company says that it will premiere this fall, which is a reasonable schedule for any film. A film that has professional actors cast, has a score written and recorded by a symphony orchestra, and has all of the other necessary crew is not easily abandoned - it has a producer, an insurer (required by the Screen Actor's Guild and other unions) and most important, a contract dictating its release. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 16:30, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We see indy films here all the time that have been completed but never released. That's why they schedule all these festivals, looking for a distributor. Where do you see indication of a contract dictating its release? <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 16:41, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you were familiar with the workings of the film industry, you would know that no actor in the Screen Actor's Guide can work on a movie without a contract. The contract ALWAYS stipulates the release of the film. In this case, the article cited in the comment below (strangely, Arniep alleges a hoax and then posts evidence disproving his allegation) indicates the use of an Experimental Contract which stipulates that the actors don't get paid until the film is <i>distributed</i>. You confuse the use of the terms <i>released</i> and <i>distributed</i>. A film is released when it is screened. This film will be screened barring extreme circumstances, and plenty. If a distributor decides to put the movie into theatres and/or DVD, that is another thing - and that decision is based on the potential commercial viability of the film. So what you are really arguing here is that art forms that are not deemed marketable by large corporate distributors are inherently non-notable and should therefore not be covered in Wikipedia. Am I correct? <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:13, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Art that is not seen by more than a few dozen people is not notable. That is correct. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:20, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Okay, and I respect that opinion even if I disagree. I just wanted to clear the table of "to release or not release" and hoax discussions and get the real issue out there. If you can build a consensus that art has to be seen by a significant number of people to be notable, then so it shall be. <font color="#3300FF">Aguerriero (<a href="../../../a/g/u/User_talk%7EAguerriero_5985.html" title="User talk:Aguerriero">talk</a>)</font> 19:28, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry if there was some confusion over terms. I suspect to most people, "release" means more than a few showings. The main point, I believe is that if a movie is not distributed, and 99% of the country will never even have a chance to hear of it, much less see it, it can't be regarded as notable. It's not a judgement on the quality of the work. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 20:32, 18 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Look, there is good evidence that these students have deliberately conducted a hoax campaign of inserting a large amount of false information to Wikipedia and releasing false press releases as part of a hyping campaign. We shouldn't have any articles on anything minor that hasn't been released full stop as it's just an encouragement to use Wikipedia for that sort of manipulation. This article <a href="http://screenmag.tv/feature.aspx?fid=676" class="external autonumber" title="http://screenmag.tv/feature.aspx?fid=676" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> states that the film was directed by Will Slocombe <i>of the award-winning student film “Stoke Mechanics”</i>. Google shows no results for any film of that name or any award it supposedly received (which would be expected if the film or award were of any significance). Arniep 17:10, 18 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Last month there was a lot of sockpuppetry over the AfD for Riki Lee Travolta, who is in this movie; and Arniep has found blog posts by the creators of the film that he believes shows they were using wikipedia to hype the film. I'm not (entirely) convinced but more importantly it's an <i>ad hominem</i> attack; judge the article on its own merits. There doesn't seem to be a specific notability guideline for films. So it comes down to whether you believe an unfinished independent film that has not (yet) been shown at a notable festival and does not (yet) have a distribution agreement should have an article here at the present time. If instead of notabilty you simply wish to consider verifiability, the film has no Lexis/Nexis hits (even in Illinois regional newspapers) and the only sources currently available are IMDB and the U of Chicago student newspaper. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 19:46, 18 May 2006 (UTC)
