<p><b>Delete</b> - since this aricle is being (improperly) cited as a defense for the also-nominated article <a href="../../../c/h/i/Children_of_the_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada_4da0.html" title="Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada">Children of the Prime Ministers of Canada</a>, I thought perhaps this one ought to be nominated now rather than later. The children of world leaders, whether they are the children of a US president or of a Canadian Prime Minister or a Filipino president, are not inherently notable in and of themselves. The proper place for the otherwise non-notable offspring of presidents to be listed is in the article about the individual president. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:58, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> I haven't seen the other debate. This is one of the few instances where I feel justified to invoke <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a>. I feel the information about children of presidents should be preserved, especially since many (but not all!) of them do have articles, and because presidents themselves are inherently super-notable. Perhaps I would have created this information discretely in each president's article, but what's done is done, and it's too much trouble to alter the status quo with a massive merge. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 04:11, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> As above. Just because information may come up in a game of 'trivial pursuit' doesn't mean the information is trivia. This is a discriminating classification of people a sufficiant number of which have by their actions shown that this classification has historical relevance.</li>

<dd>It's not about them being "entitled" to anything. Being included in a list isn't a benefit, and it doesn't suggest that they need a separate article if they're not notable. This logic would apply, basically, to eliminate any list. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 06:08, 5 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, you hit the nail on the head. To be worth keeping, a list has to provide a benefit over and above other ways that we can present the information. With this list and the related list of children of Canadian Prime Ministers, there needs to be some value in the list itself. Ask yourself: why would anyone need such a list other than for the sake of knowing trivia? If you can't come up with a good answer, then the list should be deleted. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 03:41, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I don't need to repeat myself; later in the page I point out that the children of political leaders have been studied within political biography, history, and sociology, and give a few cites. Apparently, people go with their gut instinct on what is trivia. Unfortunately, I don't think that's a very useful rule.--<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 04:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry, us Wikipedians contribute as best we can with the knowledge we have. It is one of the joys of Wikipedia that in the course of AFD, I learn all sorts of stuff that I didn't know before. I read what you wrote below and it is perhaps convincing. What I propose is that somebody (perhaps you) write the article as a stub right now (a paragraph or two with the references you provided below will suffice). If this had been done at the outset, this entire discussion might have been different. I suspect, however, that it will eventually turn out that children of Presidents are not far different from children of CEOs and other community leaders. That's just my personal speculation, though, and, as OR, has no place in this discussion or anywhere else in Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 06:29, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is useful information. They may not all individually be notable enough to have wikipedia articles, but there are issues that come from being a child of a US president / world leader - that can and will make it useful to have such a list. (And it's exactly the sort of thing that, if it were to come up on <a href="../../../c/f/d/WP%7ECFD_d190.html" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a>, I would say <b>delete and listify</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Information already found where it belongs - in the article on each Prez. Being a child of a President is <i>not</i> inherently notable, and the subject of "Children of U.S. Presidents" is not worthy of an article, thereby making this list similarly unencyclopaedic. GassyGuy 06:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Being related to someone, even someone as obviously notable as the President of the USA, does not confer inherent notability.

<dd>Would Folantin, Morschi, and all the other people who say this is a list of non-notable people please explain how a list of "non-notable" people has so many blue links (and I note that some of the ones who don't, should, and will, no doubt, someday)? And why a topic which is of obvious sociological importance -- the study of access to power &amp; transfer of power among kin -- is being dismissed as "non-notable"? I would refer people to the entire <a href="../../../n/o/b/Category%7ENobility_b1ae.html" title="Category:Nobility">Category:Nobility</a>, an automated list basically tracking families with political power, and ask for someone to make a clear distinction about why political families in democratic country are somehow "not notable". --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:17, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Pretty obvious really: because nobles inherit titles and power and hence notability, whereas in democracies children of presidents and premiers don't. --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 14:47, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then those would apply only to the method for inheritance, such as primogeniture; and I would note that in democracies children of presidents are considerably more likly to become presidents themselves, than children <i>not</i> of presidents. ... Regardless, "non notability" applies to articles dedicated to the individual; it doesn't apply to them being mentioned or listed in other articles. An article (list) about children of the presidents of the US must be judged as to whether that topic, is, itself, notable. Judging by presence of published literature and scholarship on the subject, it is. Inclusion or being mentioned in the article doesn't require independent notability. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 16:02, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let me tell you, this will not survive as a category (it may have been deleted already).

<li><b>Keep</b> many people on the list are notable whether being a child of a President or not. Were they not notable then as the Bush twins are today? I guess Chelsea Clinton and JFK, Jr. are nobodys too. Throughout history the media has made them notable if they hadn't made themselves notable. Many of them have just been forgotten like several Presidents. This page should be kept. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 13:18, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. RockMFR makes a good argument. References listed, including "All the presidents children", so it meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and when someone writes a whole book on the subject, it meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> as well. The president's immediate family are <i>always</i> well covered in decent biographies, so the subject is of sufficient interest to support a list like this. Many of the children have individual articles, and the page is therefore a useful navigational tool as well. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 13:29, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd like to point out that there are, in fact, a number of books and studies on this specific topic -- e.g., Underwood, <i>All the President's Children</i>; Zwicker, "America's Royalty", <i>Presidential Studies Quarterly</i>; Wead, <i>All the Presidents' Children</i>; Angelo, <i>First Families: The Impact of the White House on Their Lives</i> -- and that's just the top few listings from an amazon.com search; I haven't yet done a search of a major research db. This is a well-studied topic, clearly a topic which begs for an article; and a comprehensive list would be an indispensable complement to the article. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:10, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> family and friends of world leaders affect their characters and decisions, making them notable and important to historians, biographers and political scientists.

<li><b>Delete</b> I looked all through <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and could not find where it said notability was inheritable. There is no need to merge as if the child is not on the parent article, it's lack of notability there speaks for it's self. <a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeepday_ab54.html" title="User:Jeepday">Jeepday</a> 14:36, 5 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> However, Wikipedia:Notability addresses a subject's suitability for individual articles. This is a list; therefore while some of these individuals may not, on their own, warrant individual articles, taken as a group, they do. Put another way, presence of some of the more obscure First Children on this list may preempt the creation of articles on said children later, in turn preempting future AFD debates when their articles are nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:34, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per several above, especially Lquilter. Nb Members of royal families (a category quite widely defined) are, under a proposed guideline, inherently notable. This is the relevant passage from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28royalty%29_f89d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)">Wikipedia:Notability (royalty)</a>:</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Anyone who was, at one point, an official member of a ruling family of a country is considered notable. The definition of a royal family may vary by country, but generally includes the spouse of the reigning monarch, any or all surviving spouses of a deceased monarch, and the children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and cousins of the reigning monarch, as well as their spouses.</i></p>
<p><i>This includes former monarchies - if the person was born while the monarchy was still in existence, they are notable on that basis. Any children of a deposed monarch, even if born after the deposition, are automatically notable (thus, for instance, the younger children of the former King of the Hellenes, or all the children of the former Kings of Romania and Bulgaria). Other close relations of formerly reigning royal families must qualify under WP:BIO.</i></p>
<p>- since the US seems to be moving fast in the direction of a hereditary political class, the same could well be argued for this lot. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 17:00, 5 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

Then we have Jenna, Barbara and Chelsea making national news doing common things, like having a fake I.D., having a purse stolen, or have voter registration problems.

<li><b>comment</b> - I suspect that the people who are voting delete don't get the historical significance of the relationship, probably because this is merely a list (which raises a trivia red flag for folks). It strongly suggests that the list, as such, needs at least a preface describing the scholarship that has studied these people as an identifiable group, and their significance in political and biographical studies. It's a larger problem with lists: That some lists are clearly trivia, and some lists are really the germ of an important idea; but it's difficult for people to distinguish between the two without context and information. Perhaps the deleters (who appear to be a minority, albeit a substantial one) would be willing to suspend judgment for a while until the most robust of these Children-of-leaders articles (the US presidents' kids) can be fleshed out with some additional text &amp; supporting references. --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 16:08, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

To me this is more a specialized genealogy directory or something that belongs in the (literally) parent article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I'm stunned this is even being debated. Notability is not inheritable, but the children of US Presidents have always and will always be notable people -- they are members of the First Family of the United States.

The people on this list have been thrust into a common spotlight. The US President is not just president, but also <a href="../../../h/e/a/Head_of_State_4553.html" title="Head of State">Head of State</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Some of these children become more notable then others, especially those put in the spotlight or have a political future because of their political parent's status. They would most likely be considered 'nobodys' if they were not children of a president. They play an important part in the life of the president. Look at the Bush twins, they have done nothing notable, yet because their father is President of the U.S. they have become notable. Take away his Presidency and his daughters wouldn't even have an article in Wikipedia. Same goes for Chelsea Clinton, no Bill and they'd say "who's that girl?" Being a child of a U.S. President or any world leader, current or not, is notable. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 14:11, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b>: A number of people have argued, above, that the list should be deleted because it contains people who are not notable (gist: "If they're notable give them their own article."). That is a misapprehension of how <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> works. WP:N applies to the <i>subject</i> of an article; not to every individual fact within an article. In a biographical article, the <i>subject</i> of the article -- the person discussed -- must be notable. In a article about a topic (which is what a list is), not every individual component need be individually notable. See, e.g., <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> which describes making lists of characters in books, rather than individual pages for books.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I think the problem is not whether or not the children of Presidents are individually notable. Obviously, many of them are. The question is whether the group is a worthwhile collection of information as a group. Many graduates of West Point are notable but a list of every graduate of West Point would be ridiculous, partly because of the number but also because so many of them are non-notable. At the risk of repeating myself, the question is - "To whom would this list be useful?" If, as <a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">User:Lquilter</a> suggests, the group is of interest as a group then we should keep this list but then the article on Children of the Presidents of the United States should also be created. --<a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichardshusr_5976.html" title="User:Richardshusr">Richard</a> 06:54, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>There are people who can use this information while researching U.S. Presidential history. Their children play a big part in their lives, some even effect their politics. Franklin Pierce even mentioned his last of three sons to die in his inaugural. His three sons may not be considered notable, but the event of Benjamin Pierce's death definately was. The article also helps compare all the U.S. President's children all at one time; who is the oldest, how many are still alive, how many did each President have, etc. It is useful to those who are obviously interested in this. If you have no interest in Presidents or history it would be easy not to care and suggest to delete. There are alot of "lists" here I would get rid of, but I know there might be a reason to keep them. This article is very new and still needs work. Not every article has to be useful to every person. It is definately useful to those who want to keep it. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 12:00, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Article creation comment</b> - A couple of people have now suggested that the list is appropriate if an existing article is there to support it. I initially preferred a single article, with text and an incorporated list, and I wrote two paragraphs at the top of the current list that could serve as a stub. But now I see perhaps the virtues of a separate article: One article could explain the sociological aspects of being a child of a political leader, placing it into context with inherited nobility, economic class, personal life outcomes, and so on; and there could be short sections that discuss any specific national effects, national political history, or other specific national research that have been done, which would link to the relevant supported lists (children of Canadian PMs, children of US presidents, and so on). (Heck, we could probably cannibalize some of the arguments on this page to flesh out the text.) --<a href="../../../l/q/u/User%7ELquilter_ee8e.html" title="User:Lquilter">lquilter</a> 14:01, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b><a href="../../../e/d/w/Edward_Baker_Lincoln_2e85.html" title="Edward Baker Lincoln">Edward Baker Lincoln</a> died at the age of three, nine years before his dad became a U.S. President, yet he is notable enough to have his own article as a child of a President. Then I'd say they all are notable enough. The article creation idea by lquilter sounds excellent. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 14:48, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, a very good idea. Without wishing to sound peverse, even those of them who went on to lead totally "normal" lives have an interest by virtue of doing just that. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 15:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not to mention the "Children of Presidents of the Philippines", if that hasn't been chopped already. Some interesting contrasts between the three I expect! <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 16:35, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yeah, they chopped it. At least the Canadian one survived. Not enough people supported the Philippine list apparently. All three lists deserve to stay. <a href="../../../j/j/m/User%7EJjmillerhistorian_b2eb.html" title="User:Jjmillerhistorian">Jjmillerhistorian</a> 23:15, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> The List is relevant because it reflects important information about the Presidents. For example, alleged slave children such as <a href="../../../s/a/l/Sally_Hemmings_5e04.html" title="Sally Hemmings">Sally Hemmings</a>'s, say something important about the character of President Jefferson that is useful to historians and other researchers. Children are relevant to understand the psyche of presidents.<a href="../../../s/w/a/User%7ESwampyank_74e0.html" title="User:Swampyank">Swampyank</a> 18:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think that a number of the notability "voters" miss the point. Of course some presidential children aren't notable (though a few are even as children). But this is a list covering a notable topic (as shown by sourcing) and may in fact help prevent the creation of stubs of non-notable presidential children, since they can have their bio-stubs here. <a href="../../../e/l/u/User%7EEluchil404_d241.html" title="User:Eluchil404">Eluchil404</a> 09:00, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Subjects that we know generate curiosity and (limited but serious) historical interest should be kept in Wikipedia. Usefulness (as a record related to the serious historical interest) and Being Damn Interesting to, say, tens of millions of people should be standards of inclusion in Wikipedia. If that means we keep the Children of the presidents of Pakistan the world will not come to an end. At least not for a while. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 14:25, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
