<p>Gango is a monster that <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultraman.html" title="Ultraman">Ultraman</a> had to fight in epesode 11 (called "The Rambunctious One From Space" in the American dubbed DVD,) of the first <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultra_Series_127f.html" title="Ultra Series">Ultra Series</a>.</p>

<p>Gango was created by a con-artist who stole a meteorite that could grant wishes (as long as the wisher thought about the wish he/she wanted, otherwise, the meteorite would return to normal). At first, Gango would only scare the people. Eventually the con-artist wished for Gango to grow "to the size of a giant," which he did. The man was knocked out, so Gango couldn't changed back into a meteorite because the man was thinking about his last wish. He was defeted by being wished away and is one of the few monsters Ultraman couldn't fight without outside help.</p>

<p>None. Gango fought more like a child than a monster and has no special powers. He would often pretend to be greatly hurt to act upon the compassion of his opponent. Ultraman used very few (if not any,) of his powers and fought the monster by splashing water on it, or hitting it occasionally.</p>

<p>Seven hundred years of foreign rule in medieval period had sapped the political vitality of the Hindus, and uprooted whatever national consciousness they ever possessed. Their civil and religious rights were constantly trampled down, their property often plundered, and their blood was wantly shed. They were reduced to the position of hewers of wood and drawers of water. All this led to a general deterioration in Hindu society and religion. The society was honeycombed with caste, sub-caste and rigid distinctions. The characteristic of the society were a rigid caste-system with its attendant restrictions about touch, food, and marriage, and the strict prohibition of the re-marriage of the widows, Sati-system, rigid untouchability and the old inequitous attitude towards the lower castes. Dishonesty and corruption were rampart and the people were selfish and devoid of conscience. The purity of domestic life was threatened by luxury and debauchery, fashionable in the court, aristocracy and well-to-do families, and the sensual literature that grew up under such patrons.</p>
<p>So far as the Hindu masses were concerned, religion meant only an unending series of rituals and ceremonies, performed instrict accordance with scriptural rules. Many abnoxious rites were practiced by the common people and immoral customs, with belief in witchcraft and sorcery, were in vogue. These were partly legacies of tantric beliefs and practices which had a strong hold in the country. Religion as a source of moral purity and spiritual force, exercised little influence ever a large section of the common people. In fact, religion had become the handmaid of voice and folly.</p>
<p>The British rule in India introduced English education and western culture. English education opened the floodgates of the western ideal which almost overwhelmed the Indians at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It brought in a spirit of rationalism which seeks to inquire and argue before accepting anything. It made the Indian mind revolt against the tyranny of domgmas and traditional authorities, beliefs and customs. The impact of western culture and English education affected many aspects of Indian life and society, and he Brahma Samaj was its early outcome. Its founder Raja Ram Mohan Ray challenged the current religious beliefs and social practices of the Hindus as not being in consonance with their own scriptures. He openly protested against the blind acceptance of whatever passed current on the authority of priesthood or its interpretation of scriptures. He set in motion that liberalism in thought and action which has enabled Indians to shake off the fetters of ages. His Brahma Samaj effectively helped the progress of the Hindu society and religion by holding a living example of society, based on progressive and liberal views, and religion based, on rationalistic principles. Tow main planks of the Samaj were theistic worship and social reform-such as abandonment of caste-system, introduction of widow remarriage, encouragement of female education, and the abolition of Purdah and child-marriage.</p>
<p>Like Brahma Samaj in Bengal, Prarthana Samaj was established I Bombay and it had its branches in Bombay and Madras Presidencies. The Prarthana Samaj did not regard the Vedas as divine or infallible, nor believe in the doctrine of transmigration and incarnation of God. It drew its nourishment from the Hindu scriptures and used the hymns of the old Maratha poet-saints in the prayers.</p>
<p>But more important than the Brahma Samaj and the Prarthana Samaj was the Arya Samaj, socioreligious movement of the second half of the nineteenth century. It was founded by Dayanand Saraswati. The Arya Samaj condemned polytheism and monotheism as preached by Christianity and Islam. If the Brahma Samaj appealed to the English educated classes, the Arya Samaj appealed to the emotion of the masses. The Arya Samaj laid down that which every one should study. It tried to inculcate virtue and morality to which no religion can possible take any exception. It aimed at the reform of religion and society by reviving Vedic rituals and institutions, rejecting the hereditary caste-system, and not recognizing the authority and superiority of the Brahmans merely on the ground of birth. The Samaj denounced the worship of gods and goddesses and preached that only the Supreme Being should be worshipped; it proclaimed the right of everybody to study the Vedas and Hindu scriptures, it encouraged inter-caste marriage and adopted a brisk programme of education, especially female education.</p>
<p>A new religious movement called neo-Hidnuism also came in the lime light in the second half of the nineteenth century. Its common characteristic was the glorification of Hindu religion and society in their current forms and a spirited defense of these against hostile criticism both by Indian reformers and European missionaries. It sought to reconcile ancient Hindu ritualism and medieval Hindu faith with modern science, and it made people feel a new pride in their culture and religion, Pundit Sasadhar Tarka-Chudamani, Krishan Prasanna Sen, and Bankim Chandra Chatterji were great advocates of neo-Hinduism.</p>
<p>Another important religious movement of the last century was the Ramkrishna Math and Mission. Ramkrishna, a priest and saint of Dakshineswar Temple near Calcutta realized divinity in humanity and emphasized the service of mankind as a means to salvation. He expressed the highest wisdom or greatest truth in simple sentences and parables. The theme of all his discourses was the realization of God as the highest human ideal, attainable only by development of high spiritual life. This was only possible by discarding desire for material prosperity (vishayavasana) and lure for gold and women and turning all thoughts and actions towards God. He believed in the harmony of all religions. He demonstrated by precept and example that all the different religions are true in their essence and may lead to salvation if properly persued. He said that the different creeds are but different paths to reach the same God. He put on a high pedestal the virtue of toleration and reverence for all religions. The catholicity of view is great contribution of Ramkrishna to the modern world which religion has divided into so many watertight compartments. He said, “In whatsoever form or name you desire to call God, in that very form or name you will see Him.” The teaching of Ramkrishna gave the Hindu Revivalism a moral sanction, a philosophical basis, and a new spiritual significance of immense value. Swami Vivekanand, the worthy and noble disciple of Ramkrishna, stressing unflinching faith in Hindu religion, carried the divine message of Ramkrishna far and wide all over the world. He aimed at the elevation of masses by means of education based on religion and for this purpose he established new organization Ramkrishna Math and Mission the greatest spiritual force and centre of social service in Modern India. Vivekanand and Ramkrishna Mission saved Hinduism from destruction by the reactionary elements. It placed Hinduism on high pedestal and resisted onslaughts of Christianity and Islam.</p>
<p>The religious movements in the nineteenth century led to similar movements in other sects of Hinduism, Jainism, Sikhism, etc. Various existing religious sects reacted in the same way to the new spirit of the age. The Madhavas of South India, the Shrivaishnavas of Mysore, the followers of Chaitanya cult in Bengal, the Shaivas, the Lingayats, the Smartas, the Radhaswami Satsang in Uttar Pradesh etc. launched their reformation and revival movements, to preach the principles of their sects and to strengthen and defend their position.</p>
<p>Jainism did not lag behind in this age of religious reform and revival. It also breathed the new spirit of the age. Jainism in the last century was divided and sub-divided into narrow sects. Superstition and dogmas rather than true rational principles of religion dominated them. The holy scriptures of Jainism including Agamas were stored in dark dingy cells in temples and Upashrayas, and they were forgotten. The study of holy books was callously neglected. To masses Jainism was an unending series of ritual and ceremonies, a rigid observance of certain beliefs, practices and fasts. Religious knowledge was based upon blind faith impervious to reason. Religion as a source of ethical values, moral parity and spiritual forces exercised little influence over a lager section of Jain community. The Jaina was expected to observe non-possession (aparigrah) and non-violence (ahimsa) in their daily life. They were to follow certain ethical code and moral values, but they set them at naught. Greed of possession and lust of gold were rampant in the Jain society. The Jain temples, which once were resounded with the recitation of prayers to Tirthankaras, songs of devotion and sayings from the holy saints and verses from scriptures, were now in dilapidated conditions, and were neglected. Some of the were in the custody of non-Jains and were used as armoury. Various types of arms were divided into different narrow sects. The life of a Jain monk was over burdened with the observance of rigid beliefs and practices. They neglected the study of holy books. The institution of Jain yati had degeneration considerably. The yatis were expected to be pious in life, observe celibacy, and be custodian of Jain scriptures. They were to be earnestly devoted to the cause of preaching and propagation of the principles of Jainism. But in the last century, the yatis were callously indifferent to the noble ethical code of Jainism. They neglected teaching and preaching. They lived in palacial mansions, surrounded by bond of admirers. They indulged in princely luxurious life and enjoyed all the privileges and pastimes of wealthy persons. The life of yati Dharnendrasuri bears testimony to all this. Jainism, therefore, needed reformers and revivalists like other religious sects in the nineteenth century and providence provided one in Ratan Raj, better known as Rajendrasuri. Reformation of Jainism was one of the main currents of the religious movements of the century.</p>
<p>Ratna Raj was born on the 3rd December, 1827 at Bharatpur (Rajasthan) in a family of business man named Rishabhadas Parakh. Having religious bent of mind he renounced the worldly life and was initiated as Jain yati by Hemavijayaji at Udaipur in 1846 and he was now known as Rajendrasuri. He had studied diligently the Jain scriptures, philosophy, literature, grammar, rhetoric, lexicography, etc. under Pramodsuri and Sagarchandji, the well-known yatis of the age and soon he acquired proficiency. Shri Dharanendrasuri yati was so much impressed by the profound scholarship of Rajendrasuri that he appointed him his daftari and entrusted the task of teaching the groups of yati disciples. But soon Rajendrasuri was disgusted with the princely and luxurious life of Dharanendrasuri, it was an utter disregard and contradiction to the Jain principles of non-possession and non-violence. Consequently Rajendrasuri left Dharanendrasuri in 1864 and this was a turning point in the life of Rajendrasuri.</p>
<p>Now he raised his voice against the corrupt and luxurious life of the yatis and condemned their abundance of possession and insisted on a pious ideal life in accordance with the principles laid down by Jain Tirthankaras and Jain holy scriptures. After prolonged deliberations, he issued none-point manifes to for the purpose and explained to the Jain world the significance of his nine principles of reform that the yatis had to follow. It was a vigorous attempts to reform the institution of yati and place it on sound, simple and rational principles and get rid of its age old traditions and superstitions. Though opposed in the initial stages, the attempts of Rajendrasuriji were ultimately crowned with success. His nine-point manifesto was accepted and recognized by the leading yatis of the age and even Shri Dharanendrasuriji also signed it. As a result of this the yatis had given up their worldly life and surrendered their princely symbols like silver rods, chanwar, palkhi, arms, etc. to the Jain temples, and tool solemn oath to lead a life of purity, simplicity, celebacy, non-possession, non-violence, teaching and preaching. Thus Rajendrasuri reformed and simplifies the yati institution, tin thui sect of Jainism, and a new life of revivalism was infused in them.</p>
<p>Rajendrasuri did not end at the reformation of the yati institution, it was his first task of revival movement. His other achievements were restoration and reconstruction of Jain temples and installation of Jain images and establishment of different socio-religious organizations for the uplift of the Jains and propagation of Jainism. Like a pious, true, diligent monk, devoted to the cause of Jainism. He walked from place to place in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Malwa, etc. teaching, preaching and infusing new spirit of the age among the people. He appealed to the masses by delivering his discourses in simple dialects of the people, the common spoken languages of the masses, - Malwi, Gujarati, Marwari, etc. He inspired the Jain monks to study profoundly the Jain scriptures. He himself devoted to the deep study of Jain works. He was bitterly opposed to the storage of Jain works in isolated places; he eagerly desired to bring them to light for the propagation of Jainism. He himself wrote collected and edited certain important Jain works. He complied the famous Jain encyclopedia Abhidan-Rajendra. It is a monumental work in seven volumes. This work itself places Rajendrasuri on a high pedestal of Jain scholars and pioneers of religious movements of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>UCSDementia was a TV show that ran on the Student-Run Channel at UCSD (SRTV) from 2000-2002. The show was started by Brian Uiga and Justin Mauk, though apparently their divergent artistic visions led to Mauk leaving the show, leaving Uiga as the sole producer and director.</p>
<p>Although the early episodes tended towards in-your-face, raunchy humor, the later episodes were primarily sketch comedy, generally in the style of Monty Python's Flying Circus, Kid's in the Hall, and their ilk. The episodes produced by Brian Uiga during 2001 and the beginning of 2002 are generally regarded to be the best.</p>
<p>In spring of 2002, Clay Walton-Hadlock, a friend of Uiga's, convinved him to produce a mock documentary about UCSDementia. The two of them produced the documentary together, and the former production schedule of UCSDementia <i>proper</i> was abandoned. Following the completion of the documentary, Uiga went on to focus on more ambitious film projects, and no new director took his place.</p>

<p>John I, last name Kourkouas and surnamed Tzimisces (Greek: Ioannes "Tzimisces" Kourkouas, written Ιωάννης «Τζιμισκής» Κουρκούας), lived c. 925 - January 10, 976 and was East Roman Emperor from December 11, 969 to January 10, 976.</p>
<p>He was born c. 925 to a father belonging to the Kourkouas family and to a mother belonging to the Phocas family. Both were distinguished Cappadocian families of Armenian origin, and among the most prominent of the emerging military aristocracy of Asia Minor. Several of their members had served as prominent army generals, including the brother of John's mother, Nicephorus Phocas.</p>
<p>Contemporary sources describe John as a rather short but well-built man, with reddish blonde hair and beard and blue eyes who was attractive to women. He seems to have joined the army at an early age, originally under the command of his maternal uncle Nicephorus. The latter is also considered his instructor in the art of war. Partly because of his familiar connections and partly because of his personal abilities, John quickly rose through the ranks. He was given the political and military command of the province of Armenia before he turned twenty-five years old.</p>
<p>At the time the Empire was at war with its eastern neighbor, the Abbasid Empire. Armenia served as the border between the two Empires. John managed to successfully defend his province. He and his troops joined the main part of the army, which was campaigning against the enemy under the command of Nicephorus. Nicephorus means "bearer of victory" and Phocas justified his name with a series of victories, moving the borders further east with the capture of about 60 border cities including Aleppo. By 962, the Abbasids had asked for a peace treaty with favorable terms for Byzantines, that secured the borders for some years. John distinguished himself during the war both at the side of his uncle and at leading parts of the army to battle under his personal command. He was rather popular with his troops and gained a reputation for taking the initiative during battles, turning their course. He was regarded by some as a military hero.</p>
<p>On March 15, 963, Emperor Romanus II unexpectedly died at the age of twenty-six. The cause of his death is uncertain. Both contemporary sources and later historians seem to either believe that the young Emperor had exhausted his health with the excesses of his sexual life and his heavy drinking, or suspect Empress Theophano (c. 941 - after 976), his wife, of poisoning him. Theophano had already at the time gained a reputation as an intelligent and ambitious woman. She would later gain a reputation for ruthlesness in achieving her goals. Romanus had, before his death, already crowned as co-emperors his two sons, the later Emperors Basil II and Constantine VIII. At the time, however, Basil was five years old and Constantine only three years old, and they were not able to assume the duties that came with their title. Theophano was named regent. Svyatoslav I's meeting with Emperor John.But she wasn't allowed to rule alone. Joseph Bringas, a eunuch palace official who had become Romanus' chief council, maintained his position. According to contemporary sources he intended to keep the authority to take decisions for the actual matters of importance at his own hands, rather than those of the young Empress. He also tried to remove part of the authority that had been concentrated at the hands of Nicephorus Phocas. The victorious general had been accepted as the actual commander of the army and maintained his strong connections to the aristocracy. Joseph was afraid that Nicephorus could claim the throne with the support of both the army and the aristocracy. Joseph's intrigues during the following months turned both Theophano and Nicephorus against him. Unknown to Joseph, Theophano and Nicephorus had started negotiations with each other.</p>
<p>After helping his maternal uncle to obtain the throne as Nicephorus II and to restore the empire's eastern provinces, he was deprived of his command by an intrigue, upon which he retaliated by conspiring with Nicephorus' wife Theophania to assassinate him.</p>
<p>Elected ruler in his stead, John proceeded to justify his usurpation by the energy with which he repelled the foreign invaders of the empire. In a series of campaigns against the newly established Russian power (970-973) he drove the enemy out of Thrace, crossed Mt. Haemus and besieged the fortress of Dorystolon on the Danube. In several hard-fought battles he broke the strength of the Russians so completely that they left him master of eastern Bulgaria.</p>
<p>He further secured his northern frontier by transplanting to Thrace some colonies of Paulicians whom he suspected of sympathising with their Saracen neighbours in the east.</p>
<p>In 974 he turned against the Abbasid empire and easily recovered the inland parts of Syria and the middle reaches of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>He died suddenly in 976 on his return from his second campaign against the Saracens. John's surname was apparently derived from the Armenian tshemshkik, meaning "red boot".</p>

Esio (pronounced Ĕs-ē-ō) is a revolutionary NEW single serve, on-demand, Hot or Cold Beverage System for the home or office. The Esio utilizes a patented technology in the system that works with the special proprietary “pump” on one end of each beverage package called an Esio-Pak™. The system also allows you to select the strength and choice of your hot or cold beverage and each Esio-Pak will dispense 14-18 servings of each product selected. You can choose from Premium Blend Coffee, Dark Roast Decaf Coffee, Peach Tea, Green Tea, Diet Cranberry Juice, and Vitamin Fitness Water (Mixed Berry). The Esio Beverage System was developed by Esio Beverage Company LLC., and can be used with a three or five gallon water bottle or “plumbed” directly into your waterline or existing R/O system. The Esio will be available in the United States from your local Home and Office Delivery dealer in the first quarter of 2007. www.esiobev.com</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-25_523f.html" title="Edit section: Technology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Technology</span></h3>
<p>The Esio utilizes a brand new, patented, on-demand, beverage technology integrated into a standard hot &amp; cold water dispenser. This new “drop’n drink”™ technology allows the end user to easily drop a small flexible air-tight beverage pouch called the Esio-Pak™, into the system. Once the consumer selects the beverage of his/her choice, and drops the Esio-Pak into the beverage compartment, he/she simply presses the hot or cold button, and the beverage product is dispensed from the Esio-Pak through its proprietary dispensing pump, at the same time the water is dispensed. The water and beverage product are actually mixed in mid-air as the glass is filled. The “interchangeable” Esio-Paks are as easy to change as a CD. The Esio-Pak contains 3 ounces of concentrated beverage product that will produce approximately 18 six-ounce servings. There is NO cross-contamination when changing between Esio-Paks because it seals airtight between uses. The Esio-Pak is completely disposable when empty, and is eco-friendly. The Esio-Paks are packaged in a small box of three, with a shelf life of over 18 months. Consumers can save up to 40% off of their current beverage purchases with the Esio Beverage products. <a href="http://www.esiobev.com/esio-products.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.esiobev.com/esio-products.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.esiobev.com/esio-products.htm</a> Another unique feature of the Esio Beverage System is the Strength Selector Dial. At the top of the Esio is a dial that allows the user to select the strength of his/her beverage. This feature provides ultimate convenience as each user in the home or office can select the strength of his/her individual beverage. This enhances the efficiency of the system because there is no waste of old, stale, or strong coffee; the Esio does it all, one serving at a time. Now consumers have the ability to have complete freedom of choice with their beverage selections in their homes or offices. With the Esio, home and business owners get what they want, the way they want, on-demand. Because the Esio has a one gallon cold reservoir, and a half gallon hot reservoir, you can dispense your beverage, into any sized cup, glass, or pitcher. No brewing, no filling reservoirs, no waiting to fill your cup or glass. The Esio is ready when you are! In the center of the strength selector is a child protection “lock-out” button. By simply pressing the lock button for three seconds, the Esio will lock-out all functionality of all of the other buttons to prevent injury to small children. The Esio also includes an Esio-Pak storage compartment just below the drip tray. The compartment folds open and includes a divider to store and organize up to 9 Esio-Paks.</p>

<p>The best known of all Robin aircraft is the DR400, which is a wooden sport monoplane, conceived by Pierre Robin and Jean Delmontez. The Robin DR400 first flew in 1972 and is still in production in 2006. It has a tricycle undercarriage, and can carry 4 people. The DR400 aircraft have the 'cranked wing' configuration, in which the dihedral angle of the outer wing is much greater than the inboard, a configuration which they share with Jodel aircraft. This model is considered easy to fly by many and quiet during flight due to its wooden frame. One drawback however, is that the DR400 likes to be hangered.</p>
<p>The wing, a distinctive feature of the Robin DR400, and is what immediately separates this aircraft visually from other similar light aircraft. It is a derivative of the earlier Jodel designs, is light, stiff and strong, with the dihedral of the outer panels imparting substantial lateral stability in flight. Being fabric covered, it presents a smooth surface to aid airflow, and not hindered by typical overlapping panels or rivets found on metal aircraft. The secret to the DR400's relative high performance lies in the pronounced "wash-out" (twist) in the outer panels. Since they have a lower angle of attack to the airflow than the centre section, they create less drag in cruise flight. This characteristic also embues rather benign stall behavior and DR400 subsequently does not suffer from the need to install retro-fixes like leading edge stall strips.</p>

<p>Waffle House is a song written by Tony Wolf. It is about how nasty the food is at the Waffle House, (He even mentions in the song that the food gives him "the runs" ), how creepy the servers are, and how much the place is filled with smoke all the time.The song goes to the tune of "My Father's House".This song is featured in one of his acts. He is talking about one thing, and randomly comes up with how nasty the Waffle House is. The song has possibly hurtful lyrics to the waitresses and cooks at the Waffle House ( The song says "There's a big, big gap in the waitress' front teeth" and "I'm kinda glad I can see the grill Cause the cooks look mighty strange. It's Hannibal the Cannibal and Karl from Sling Blade.")</p>

<p>Gravity separation is an industrial method of separating two components from a suspension or any other homogenous mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficently practical. All of the gravitational methods are common in the sense that they all use gravity as the dominant force. Often other methods are applied to make the separation faster and more efficient, such as <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flocculation.html" title="Flocculation">flocculation</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/a/Coagulation.html" title="Coagulation">coagulation</a> and suction. The most notable advantages of the gravitational methods are their cost effectiveness and in some cases excellent reduction.</p>

<p>Clarification is a name for the method of separating fluid from solid particles. Often clarification is used along with flocculation to make the solid particles sink faster to the bottom of the clarification pool while fluid is obtained from the surface which is free of solid particles.</p>
<p>Thickening is the same as clarification except reverse. Solids that sink to the bottom are obtained and fluid is rejected from the surface.</p>
<p>The difference of these methods could be demonstrated with the methods used in waste water processing: in the clarification phase, sludge sinks to the bottom of the pool and clear water flows over the clear water grooves and continues its journey. The obtained sludge is then pumped into the thickeners, where sludge thickens farther and is then obtained to be pumped into digestion to be prepared into fertilizer.</p>

<p>The duration it takes for the solid particles to set to the bottom can be illustrated with <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stokes%27_Law_9e60.html" title="Stokes' Law">Stokes' Law</a>:</p>
<p>v = (ρ' - ρ) g² x / (18 μ)</p>
<p>Where...</p>
<pre>
- v = velocity of sinking / floatation (cm/s)
- ρ' = density of the solid particle (g/cm²)
- ρ = density of the liquid (g/cm²)
- g = acceleration of earth's gravitational pull (9.81 m/s²)
- x = diameter of the solid particle (cm)
- μ = viscocity of the liquid (g/cms)

<p>Syclonic separarion relies on both, gravitational and centrifugal forces in separation of components. Syclonic separation can be used to clear gases and fluids that contain rough particles.</p>
<p>When fluid or gas enters the cyclone with high enough pressure, a spiral flow is created. Rough particles, being heavier, are thrown into the wall of the separator where they sink down into the bottom of the separator where they are removed and the fluid flows out from the outlet pipe that is situated at the center of the cyclone.</p>

<p>When clearing gases, an often used and mostly working method for clearing large particles is to blow it into a large chamber where the gas's velocity reduces and the solid particles start sinking to the bottom. This method is used mostly because of its cheap cost.</p>

<p>Eddie Rubin- Adj. V. N. Eddie Rubin was born Mach 12th 1987. When he popped out of his moms tummy he was the greatest looking baby around. He was also the strongest and was able to lift a baby elephant. He won the guniess book of world records for most bench presses of a baby elehpant at age 5 hours. People could not beleive his strength and by age 5 he beat up fidel castro along with Mike tyson. Although mke attempted to bite his ear he thre a left hook and smashed in his face. Eddie became a model and lives in pakistan.</p>
