<li>I am happy to see the article deleted so long as you can answer this question- what do you call a frim?? Are you suggesting that there is no word at all for that sort of thing??
<p>I would also like to note that neither Splash nor FreplySpang are Hollywood TV writers. A lot you two know about sitcoms, with your noses in philosophy books or political science articles all day long. Have you ever been to a Hollywood pool party??? Well, then: You wouldn't know.</p>
<ul>
<li>In response to your challenge I will take what I hope is not flaimbait at its word and suggest <i>comedic misunderstanding</i>, the classic <i>miscommunication</i> or it's more verbose brother <i>getting the wires crossed</i>. And what about that old favorite, <i>dramatic irony</i>? Sure, perhaps they don't have the flair or brevity of "frim," but what of that ignoble day, thousands of years in the future, when we've run out of four letter words and there is a more important concept than this that needs rapid communicaion. It is that day that I will raise my tequila and celebrate what I believe will be the outcome of this VfD. <a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESirmob_3a04.html" title="User:Sirmob">Sirmob</a> 03:55, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Neologism. Presumably these Hollywood TV writers would write the word into a drama or sitcome if the word was that common in those circles. This appears not to have happened. Apart from this, it would have to convince us that it wouldn't be a dictdef. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 01:27, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, we've heard from the word police, now let's hear from the people. What concerns me is the slippery slope that we are on. Sure, a child word, just a few years old and getting used to life, like "frim" is easy to attack. The gang of bullies has gathered around this tender child, knocked her down and are ready to try to kick her to death. I say "NO." Let us unfurl the banner, raise the roof beam high, light my candle, break out the tequila. Where will it stop. One day "frim" is got rid of, next day perhaps another newish word like "spam" used to mean unwanted Email will be axed. Then day by day the nitpicking, jack booted word police will get rid of more and more words on one pretext or another until we are reduced to trying to communicate with a few guttural utterances. Imagine scientists, poets, philosphers trying to communicate with "arrrghh" and "aye aye." A new dark ages will be ushered in made worse, and perhaps prolonged by the lights of perverted science. Let us, the DEFENDERS OF LANGUAGE, therefore conduct ourselves so that if we exist for a thousand years, historians will look back and say, "this was their finest hour."
<p>I would also like to point out that I was not the one who put the "definitions" section in the comedy article. If it is forbidden to discuss word meanings in Wikipedia, then the whole "definitions" section should be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>Somewhere deep in my soul I do wish I could say wictionary, but I cannot, so my suggestion to the most determined author is to save the wikitext and fight this battle himself where it has the slightest chance of survival, if he feels he truly must.

<li>There is no "strong delete" option. In fact, you can only delete something, you can't do it strongly or weakly. Just shows what an absence of intellect you are working with that you would write something like that. So sad.

<dd>I therefore maintain that my <b>transwiki the corrected definition</b> position is the correct one. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:27, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Since I also have no doubt that someone will claim that the OED doesn't say what it says (does anyone besides me have a subscription? I can't be the only one), here's a freely available that provides evidence that I'm not just fabricating the OED text. Here's the early form of the word used <a href="http://gnu.mirrors.tds.net/pub/gutenberg.org/etext06/8bwlf10ua.txt" class="external text" title="http://gnu.mirrors.tds.net/pub/gutenberg.org/etext06/8bwlf10ua.txt" rel="nofollow">in Beowulf</a> (search for "fremu", in context means "excellent" or "lusty" or "vibrant"). I 100% agree that the original definition was idiotic, and should have been replaced. But given that the people that posted it somehow managed to stumble on to a <i>real word</i> that <i>isn't in the wiktionary</i>, I think it would be irresponsible of us not to correct the error and transwiki it to wiktionary. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 13:40, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
