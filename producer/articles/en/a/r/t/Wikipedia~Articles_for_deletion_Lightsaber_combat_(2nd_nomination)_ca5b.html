<li><b>Wow. Well, if not delete, then massively, massively cut of all the fancruft and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>.</b> I'm having big trouble believing this to be adequately <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">sourced</a>: wikis are not <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources,</a> and fanfiction hardly helps establish notability on the level of any sort of encyclopedic importance. A fan magazine, one fanbook and multiple fan websites hardly count as reliable sources, and certainly not the type of reliable souces that establish real-world notability. The article contains large amounts of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, classic examples being:
<blockquote>
<p>"The Jedi or Sith employ an attack in rare instances to use the cutting power of their lightsabers for an object at an unreachable location called the saber throw, or a throwing of his or her lightsaber. The lightsaber is thrown; usually the blade tip spins in a circular motion about the hilt; and the saber hits its target, usually to cut it. Skilled practitioners will use the Force to manipulate the trajectory of the lightsaber and then redirect it back to their hand."</p>
</blockquote>
Love that. Not sourced at all. Incidentally, also horribly POV: "Trained in all forms by Dooku, a master of his own 4 arm style and advantage to almost invincibility; however, incapable of using the Force, one of his only weaknesses" - alright, so I don't care, but someone who did might find that large chunks of the article violate <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>.</li>
<li>Virtually no real-world <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> is asserted at all as to why we should care about this form of fictional combat. As it stands, the article reads like a how-to guide - not permitted - and a purely <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">indiscriminate collection</a> of non-real-world information.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b>. Much of the article is sourced through statements from the novels, "making of" documentaries, and published magazines. Yes, the fancruft and OR needs to be removed. Yes, more sources, such as the various roleplaying books (from where some of this information is derived) need to be cited. Yes, "real world" information needs to be added and expanded on - I recall one of the SW "Making Of" films describing how lightsaber combat 'evolved' from the slow double-handed movements of Ep IV to the rapid speed of later films. But these are issues for continual editing and cleanup - not wiping the slate. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">saberwyn</a> 21:21, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Burn it!</b>, or just Delete. The article is a good read, but goes far more into depth than should be on Wikipedia. Nothing indicates that these are notable. Indeed, even in most of the EU books I've read they're barely discussed and they aren't mentioned in the movies at all. Take it over to Wookiepedia, if it doesn't already possess a copy. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 21:38, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b>. OR and fancruft aside, this has virtually <b>no</b> bearing on any canon outside the RPG. The vast majority of SW canon (including <b>all</b> movies and videogames and almost all novels) offer no explanation of lightsaber training or feats of the Force because it's like magic, and magic is self-explanatory. It is only for the intricacies of pen and paper role-playing that applying rules to saber fighting and the Force becomes necessary, and therefore the significance of this information to the Star Wars phenomenon as a whole is strictly limited. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Garrett</a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/s/User_talk%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_0893.html" title="User talk:Master Thief Garrett">Talk</a></sup> 22:00, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Seems to me that you are confusing "External Links" with "References". While the "External Links" are indeed pointing to various wikis and message boards, and while SOME of the references are pointing to those, there are significant references to published works in the Reference section. While some may consider the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_Insider_2bdf.html" title="Star Wars Insider">Star Wars Insider</a> to be a fan-based publication, the plain fact is that the article concerning lightsaber forms has been used and referenced now by computer games, role-playing games, and novels in the Star Wars genre, a number of which are in the "References" section of this article. Declaring the entire article as "original research" and void of valid sources is a fallacy at this point. Otherwise, you might as well ditch the articles on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Force_%28Star_Wars%29_f4bd.html" title="The Force (Star Wars)">The Force (Star Wars)</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/d/Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> and just about everything from <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Star_Wars_2be9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Star Wars">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Star_Wars</a>, because most of the content of those articles came from similar sources. Like it or not, those sources are being used by authors writing for Star Wars games and Star Wars novels. This article needs cleaning, and perhaps some rewriting-because some of the article IS questionable-but not deletion. -- <a href="../../../g/j/d/User%7EGjd001_0a78.html" title="User:Gjd001">GJD</a> 20:38, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> If they are sourced they need to be sited. The way they are stated reads like the article authors opinion. "This style is likely based on iaido."

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Editors have already decided to keep it at least once, someone else here said three times. Like it or not, the lightsaber combat from Star Wars is becoming a part of popular culture, and this is by far the best article I have been able to find on it in the web. Yes, it needs cleanup, yes, it needs more source citations, but it is very relevant to the StarWars WikiProject.

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Keep in mind that *all* published Star Wars stuff is canon per Lucasfilms... they have some odd tiered system. Lucas himself &gt; films &gt; books/tv shows &gt; games &gt; magazines &gt; comics (or similar order), where all is canon, but anything contradictory higher in the chain supercedes anything else--so hence, no continuity breaks, and all valid in that sense to include in Wikipedia as "not something made up"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_canon#The_Holocron" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_canon#The_Holocron" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. Star Wars Insider is an OK source, it's official. Only needs some sourcing, but can be sourced to game books, RPGs, mags, starwars.com, video games, etc. We use those sources of that nature for all sorts of stuff so it's fine here.

<dd>No need to get hostile or bellegierent, and try to AGF on my statement. I said it's all sourceable, and isn't material made up by people (and yes I know what OR means). It comes from the games (numerous books and video games, fine as sources), the comic books (fine as sources), the novels (40+), etc. It's a content matter, not a policy vio of an article. please argue based on policy with examples. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 08:13, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Who's getting hostile? You completely sidestepped all the problems with the article with vague proclamations about sources, while still not addressing the notability argument.

<dd>Declaring something to be non-notable doesn't make it so... Lightsaber combat is a central feature of six of the most popular films of all times. It is central to DOZENS of novels, which also do touch on the forms and so forth mentioned here, and I saw last night that Lucasfilms is actually coming out specifically with a book about the Force in their fictional world this year now, which will additionally cover all this material. I'm not sure I understand your claim of it not being notable. have you watched any star wars film, or read any of the novels? This is all sourceable--I'm simply saying that the article expanded without people actually adding footnotes as often as needed, and more people are saying the exact same thing basically. Whether it's fictional or silly is illerevant. A film series of six movies alone where each film makes roughly $1,000,000,000&gt; from release through to DVD, about a family whose people basically do "<a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">Lightsaber combat</a>" makes "lightsaber combat" notable, before you even get into all the monster volumes of side material...</dd>
<dd>I challenge you politely to explain how it's <i>not</i> notable, as your non-notability push is perplexing and baffling... thanks... - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:18, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that further demonstration of notability, if you want to see just how often the 'forms' and what not are mentioned by names, go look at the links at the bottom of the article that go back to the star wars wikia site. If no one else beats me to it (going offline for a very long time now) I will work to implement those as sources--the specific novels each appears in. keep in mind that many of the forms, etc., are mentioned in multiple novels or play roles to some degree in many... so, further solid demonstrations of notability. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 13:21, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> As an additional aside...a more appropriate check for notability guidelines on this subject is <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. Somehow, I don't think anyone will argue that Star Wars is a work of fiction. As to whether or not lightsaber combat is considered a major or minor concept within Star Wars...well, the vast majority of SW fiction certainly contains instances of lightsaber combat, particularly the prequel era works and the post-movie works. Within the genre, I would say that it has distinctly established notability. The OR argument has been debunked so many times in this AfD that I suspect people are simply not even trying to look at the references section of the article. Ironically, I feel Moreschi has the best take on this-chunks of the article do need cleaned up, because Wikipedia isn't a how-to guide; the article on <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karate.html" title="Karate">Karate</a> doesn't go into detail on how to perform its art; neither should this article try to do the same. Those segments of the article should be removed. -- <a href="../../../g/j/d/User%7EGjd001_0a78.html" title="User:Gjd001">GJD</a> 14:05, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Strawman/red herring, I didn't say the wikis were RS. I said they had listings of all the RS, down to detailed breakdowns of which book featured which thing (fighting form, etc.) detailed in THIS article. The sources exist in abundance, and anything officially owned by Lucasfilms is a fine RS for the Star Wars articles. The ONLY question is one of notability, but being as the lightsaber combat features heavily in six of the most successful films of all time, and a hit TV show (Clone Wars) plus other old (80s) animated shows, plus the forthcoming live-action Star Wars shows, plus 30-40+ novels... yeah, notable. But that is the ONLY question here. The rest is article clean up stuff. - <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDennyColt_8821.html" title="User talk:DennyColt">Denny</a> 20:55, 12 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>
