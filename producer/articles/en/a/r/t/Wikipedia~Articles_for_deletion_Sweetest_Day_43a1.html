<li><b>Weak keep</b>. A google seach returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sweetest+Day%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Sweetest+Day%22" rel="nofollow">over a half million results.</a> Many of these are reliable, albeit dedicated solely to romantic topics. I once sent a Sweetest Day card. It's a "Hallmark holiday" but in midwestern states it does bring in a lot of revenue in for flower, candy and card shops. I'd say that makes it notable, if only for the economic benefits for certain industries. It may also be notable for the controversy surrounding it. I wouldn't oppose a <b>merge</b> into <a href="../../../h/a/l/Hallmark_holiday.html" title="Hallmark holiday">Hallmark holiday</a>. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 16:16, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added the hoax tag to the article because the <i>Herbert Birch Kingston</i> story of the origins of Sweetest Day is a hoax in my opinion. <i>Primary source</i> information from The Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper published October 8th, 1921 and October 8th, 1922 shows a very different beginning to the holiday. Here is a more factual account of how Sweetest Day began: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sweetest_Day&amp;oldid=71758612</a> . (I realize that this version needs further editing/removal of caps/formatting) I do not believe the category of Sweetest Day should be deleted; it should just be reported for what it is: an 85-year-old hoax. <a href="../../../m/i/r/User%7EMiracleimpulse_29b6.html" title="User:Miracleimpulse">Miracleimpulse</a> 16:25, 30 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure I agree with your hoax tag. There is a difference between "hoax" and "popular mythology". The popular mythology of the day is that Kingston created it as day to honor orphans and shut-ins... and that version of events has been widely reported. This should be in the article (see <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> <b>verifiability not truth</b>). If there is an alternate version of events that can be sourced (i.e. the Cleveland Plain Dealer Newspaper article, this could be included as well as an alternate, sourced, version of events. The article space is big enough for both versions without making any judgements as to which is true.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:33, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and yes... this is real. It's a "second Valentine's Day in the fall" celebrated in 4 midwestern states, and it is fairly prevalent there (as are the allegations that this is a "Hallmark Holiday"). Midwesterners are strange folk.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 16:27, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I've lived in 3 of the 4 states listed in the article, and I can attest to the fact that this is a real phenomenon (I hesitate to call it a "holiday," as it is a sick invention of the flower, candy and card industries--then again so are much of the practicies in the modern versions of Halloween, Valentine's Day and Christmas).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I live in Wisconsin, and i have accually celebrated this day. It is an emerging holiday here in the mid-wast, that seems to be getting more and more popular by the year.

<li>Well, show me some wiki guidelines on holidays which say that a non-religious, non-official, non-notable holiday, and I mean this strictly--not just what has been mentioned--should be included. I wouldn't even have problems including fictional holidays, like "<a href="../../../f/e/s/Festivus.html" title="Festivus">Festivus</a>", from <i><a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i> which I'm sure is on wikipedia, because that's notable, but its notability stems from the fact it was on <i>Seinfeld</i>, not from the fact it's a real holiday. I take the position that holidays, real holidays, not just those invented, as this one is, by corporations and without involvement from the people, at a religious or state level, must include celebration or commemoration--I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this. If it were fictional, it'd be notable as a joke. But as real, it's about as notable as "Win a Hawaiian getaway week". A few pop culture references do not a holiday make--they may make something else. But as long as it's an entry whose purpose is presenting a holiday, <b>delete</b>. If they want to call it other than a holiday, they can add it back.-<a href="../../../k/m/a/User%7EKmaguir1_5504.html" title="User:Kmaguir1">Kmaguir1</a> 08:27, 31 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><i>I take the position that holidays [...] must include celebration or commemoration — I'm not sure how people celebrate or commemorate this.</i> — Then please read the article. It actually tells you how this holiday is celebrated or commemorated.
<p><i>A few pop culture references [...]</i> — There are no pop culture references in the article.</p>
<p><i>real holidays, not just those invented</i> — Most of the holidays that you categorize as "real" were in fact invented. Many religious holidays, which you accept, were invented, for examples. They were just invented longer ago than 1921. All secular holidays, such as <a href="../../../a/r/b/Arbor_Day_7e6a.html" title="Arbor Day">Arbor Day</a> and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labor_Day_%28United_States%29_60e9.html" title="Labor Day (United States)">Labor Day</a>, are invented. Your espoused criterion that holidays must be "real" and not "invented" is an entirely faulty one. Your <i>actual</i> criterion appears to be who the inventor of the holiday is. You're happy to accept holidays invented by churches, legislatures, unions, and television programme scriptwriters, but not holidays invented by greetings cards and gift companies. That's a highly subjective judgement, and not a particularly consistent one (given the inclusions of scriptwriters and unions). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_On_notability_91e7.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">Notability is not subjective</a>. It is a failure of our duty as encyclopaedists to exclude things from Wikipedia that we personally don't like, or think shouldn't exist. As encyclopaedists, we should be looking at what the sources say. The sources discuss this holiday. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 10:34, 31 August 2006 (UTC)</p>
