<li><b>Delete</b> indiscriminate and arbitrary list, with the fuzziest of justifications. From the intro <i>Having "Lemon" at the beginning of a band name is a good way to suggest that the band is some way wacky or that they maybe couldn't think of a name for a while and so strapped two random words together. Either way, any band that begins with the word "lemon" is clearly off-kilter in some way and worth noting.</i> <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not for oddball theories concocted while sitting around the dorm common area at midnight</a>. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:35, 13 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, of course. Because this page isn't worse than a lot of other ones, as the above mentioned List of three-letter English words and many others.

<dd>But that's the thing. How can you claim that this information is not beneficial to anybody, and still maintain the thought that a list of one-, two-, or three-letter English words is? How can you suggest that a list of musicians fitting into certain genres is more notable; that a list of video games beginning with the letter 'F' is more practical and useful than a list of bands containing the word "lemon"? I've already discovered many new bands because of this list; it's rather ignorant to state that nobody benefits from such lists. Now if you'd please quit making such empty claims and instead come up with actual support for your argument, perhaps a decision could finally be reached. And to the rest of you, quit shouting "sockpuppetry!" like mindless peons. It doesn't make you look intelligent or clever; just pretentious and clueless. Just because there are multiple people speaking out about an issue that YOU find to be "daft" doesn't mean that they're all the same person.

<dd>I don't believe I ever stated that a list of 3 letter English words is useful...although some boggle and/or scrabble players may disagree. If you honestly believe that a list by genre is the same as a list of bands that start with "lemon.", I really have no desire to try to reason with you. By the way, people wouldn't be crying sockpuppetry if there wasn't so much blatant sockpuppetry here. --<a href="../../../o/n/o/User%7EOnorem_b6c2.html" title="User:Onorem">Onorem</a> 20:16, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In addition, I seriously doubt that the admin who will close this AfD would appreciate the personal attacks by AriasSerathe above. I'm also sure that the trolling for votes that is mentioned on the article's talk page will also be taken into consideration.

<dd>It didn't seem to me as though AriasSerathe (who had some very good points) was attacking anyone. Arias was merely stating that the continual calling of "sockpuppets!" was getting repetitive, as it had already been stated many times before. Arias was not attacking the people, only the people's actions. - <a href="../../../m/e/w/User%7EMewtation_8b09.html" title="User:Mewtation">Mewtation</a> 01:23, 14 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Uh, "The Lemonheads" DOES start with the word Lemon. Words like "the" and "a" are removed from the beginning of a title when it comes to classifications. Let me guess, you look in the T section of an encyclopedia when looking for "The U.S. Civil War", or the T section of a rental store for "The Legend of Zelda"? 72.201.77.164 21:19, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Uh, no it doesn't. It begins with the word "Lemonheads". The band is not called The Lemon Heads.
