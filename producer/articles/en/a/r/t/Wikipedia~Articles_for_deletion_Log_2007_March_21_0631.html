<li><b>Keep</b>, I agree that the article is biased -- because it is not named "Palestinian terrorism." But that is a different issue. Obviously there is no justification for deletion. <a href="../../../6/s/j/User%7E6SJ7_69d8.html" title="User:6SJ7">6SJ7</a> 16:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Bias isn't normally a reason for deletion of the article, but for improvement. However, I'm not sure an article with this title <i>can</i> be made NPOV, it only focuses on one side of the issue by definition. Balancing it would require making it into an article about, say <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_540b.html" title="Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> ... but we already have all those articles. It's a complex issue, and I'm not an expert on the subject, so if someone explains how this article can be balanced, I won't argue for deletion, but unless they do, it does look bad. --<a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:55, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Edit it to make it what it should be, merge some of the other pages, or rename it yet again.

<li><b>Keep</b>, The introduction to the article clearly states that the perpetrators of the violence maintain that the violence is justified. The only reason this article is being attacked as POV is the fact that such acts of "political violence" will invariably reflect badly on their perpetrators... hmmm, perhaps we should delete any article that reflects badly on anyone - for instance, <a href="../../../w/a/t/Watergate_scandal.html" title="Watergate scandal">Watergate scandal</a> reflects badly on <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Nixon_9d26.html" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, etc. etc. Also, it's pretty clear that there is some degree of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> in this nomination, but that's beside the point.--<a href="../../../d/l/a/User%7EDLand_35ee.html" title="User:DLand">DLand</a><a href="../../../d/l/a/User_talk%7EDLand_38e8.html" title="User talk:DLand"><font color="green"><sup><small>TALK</small></sup></font></a> 17:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If it's POV, make it NPOV. If there's a better title, move it. If it needs further sourcing to make claims for "legitimate" violence, source it. It's clearly an important topic that should be covered. <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a> is not a reason to delete. -- <a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScientizzle_e07a.html" title="User:Scientizzle">Scientizzle</a> 17:10, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Perfectly legitimate topic that used to be called Palestinian terrorism, and which was moved to Pal political violence is order to be as NPOV as possible. It would be obtuse to pretend there's no such thing. It's also of concern here that the nominator says she is a "an official of the Palestinian authority and a member of Hamas' political public relations division; I am an official representative of the authority in the online field." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Asucena" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Asucena" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> if that's true, there's a clear conflict of interest. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 17:16, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> - If any of this can be verified &amp; sourced (which I doubt it can), then any meaningful bits should be moved into another article if one exists. The term thug has been around a lot longer than the "hip hop" era, so already the article is incorrect. The article smells of OR &amp; as the nom said, Wikipedia isn't a dictionary.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It may be a poorly written and unsourced article, but the concept is real and encyclopaedic enough. A quick academic journal search on "thug" did turn up plenty of sociological articles on hip-hop culture.

<li>In my experience, any article which is on afd &amp; is found to be a copy vio is speedied right away. If parts were copy vios, then that would be different &amp; rewritable. But this is the whole article &amp; it is so obviously either OR or a Copy vio. What's the editor going to say when you message him? Okay, I commited copy violation, silly me delete it.

<li>Of course, another article's possible lack of validity is irrelevant to this one's possible deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I see my position is rather shaky, but the whole discussion seems perched on a slippery slope. Self-promotion? Much of politics is essentially self promotion. If you adopt that criteria, you need to be prepared to remove John Cox, and Michael Savage, Mike Gravel, Al Sharpton and probably all the Third Party candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would propose you think more in terms of a broader wiki “mission.” Although it’s not practical to publish an all-encompassing catalogue – it should be the objective to capture meaningful perspectives and serve as a resource for voters to assess candidates on the basis of political philosophy. From that perspective it could be argued that my presence is more meaningful as a philosophical contrast than the myriad social conservatives who offer little meaningful distinction between their positions.</p>
<p>The internet and wikipedia hold a promise of increased information and “democracy” of ideas and access. You seem to be working contrary to that objective, ironically falling into patterns established by the conventional media that wikipedia aspires to replace.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> He's a declared and active (campaigning) candidate for President of the United States. The fact that he isn't a current office holder or subjective determinations that he "doesn't have a snowballs chance" are completely irrelevant. Smith has received press coverage and a lot of attention on the internet, and is embarking on a novel endeavor. Subjective determinations on how much press coverage is needed to justify an article are shaky at best, as the mainstream media tends to focus on the horse-race aspects of an election. Active campaigning is enough, and the "self-promotion" claim is basically irrelevant when it comes to political candidates.

<li><b>Comment</b> Active campaign is one thing, but his strategy of campaigning for a national office in one state (the equivalent of wanting to be a professional boxer but refusing to get into a boxing ring) makes him non-notable, and it can hardly be seen as "actively" campaigning. His coverage has been limited mostly to local papers curious about his Quixotic run. I'm extremely sympathetic to anyone who wants to run, and if he became notable for his longshot run, that's one thing, but many other candidates are putting efforts into all early primary states and have gotten coverage for doing so, making them notable. - <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 19:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> - indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture examples of any film where the lead actress is older than the lead actor, regardless of whether the age difference has any significance either in the film or in the real-life relationship between the two. The entire intro is POV/OR, a number of the listed relationships are not clearly "romantic leads" which thus requires POV judgment in deciding to include them and the standard for inclusion can never be anything but arbitrary. Whoever made the list apparently decided that a three year age difference was the cutoff point since that's the closest in age that's listed, but there is no possible objective reason for setting the age gap at any number. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:54, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Ageism against women in Hollywood casting of romantic leads is a frequent topic in the news.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Ignoble. This is hardly an "indiscriminate list"; the criteria for inclusion are clear enough, and can be verified by linking to the pages about the actors in question. If differences less than two years should be added, let them be added. The data compiled here are of interest to some folks for the reasons related by Ignoble, among others.

<li>See, this is <i>exactly</i> why the rationale given for keeping the POTUS article is bogus. There is nothing culturally significant about playing either Elvis or a president. People advocating to keep the POTUS article did so on the basis of the POTUS being such a special case. Now here's another such article and the arguments about <i>this</i> being a special case start up. If every case is a special case, then there doesn't appear to be anything all that special about any of them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 11:33, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Two</i> cases in which a rationale <i>may</i> apply does <i>not</i> make "every case a special case". As I've said before, I believe in judging each case on its merits, and accepting the consensus of the community. I do not see one or two AFD keeps as setting a precedent, or violating policy. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 13:21, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>All well and good to say, except that you cited the POTUS article being kept in your opinion to keep this article. You know as well as I do that people look to similar closed AFDs in evaluating new ones, and should another of these lists come up for deletion then just as sure as God made little green apples this AFD will be pointed to just like you pointed to the POTUS one. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:04, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Fair point, I was actually citing the POTUS example because I believe that your deletion rationale there was equally as questionable - that playing the President is not an important acting role out of many - not because it was kept. As you've correctly pointed out though, it looks like I'm citing a precedent and saying it's not a precedent! --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 21:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Which points out yet another problem with these sorts of lists being kept under the premise of "the person being played is a cultural icon" or "the person is a special case." It requires editors to make POV judgments as to what historical characters are "icon" or "special" enough to warrant articles. There can be no objective definition of what historical personages have achieved that status so looking to such alleged status is problematic to say the least.</li>
<li>Nor, I have to say again, does keeping the article under the theory that people will use it as a research tool on how actors approach the role make any sense. These lists tell us nothing about how actors approach the role, only that they did. The same argument could be made for any role or character type and unless we want bloated lists of every actor who ever played a cop or a bank teller the argument should be put down as well. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>OK, but Wikipedia pretty much requires editors to make POV judgements on "cultural icons" and "specialness" every single day, especially on AfD, due to a little thing called "notability". Once again, you're conflating something notable with non-notable slippery slope portents like "unless we want lists of every actor who ever played a cop or a bank teller" - I would agree that such lists should probably be deleted (including last week's Nazi one): anyone, actors or otherwise can play many such roles - so I definitely see your point, but I don't agree that it applies in a small number of cases. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 00:09, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Note that in my opinion this probably passes the relevant section of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics", since the list's entries are directly associated with a specific topic (Elvis). As an example of how this could be useful, consider if someone is researching or writing about Elvis and wants to look at how various people have portrayed him. The first obvious course is to find a list of either movies and shows that have included Elvis as a character or to find a list of actors who have portrayed Elvis. Both lists would produce the same general list of entries for further study.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>However, all that being said, I am concerned that the list appears to be original research as it is relying on an original collection of inclusion criteria not apparently found in previously published sources.

<dd>I have only suggested an edit a couple of times in wikipedia (once where someone had spelled my wife's name incorrectly as she is a notable person but just barely) thus if I am doing this incorrectly forgive me. A couple of things about Marc, his podcast is #1 in the catagory of hobbies on iTunes, He made the best or podcasting list on iTunes for 2006, his podcast was featured on television in Canada, he has been sponsored by Finewoodworking.com and has been featured in their print publication, he has also been sponsored by Festool and Powermatic which does not come easy. Within the woodworking (online) community he is very well known and well regarded.</dd>

<p>I'm completing a nomination for an anon who's attempted two separate PRODs. According to the message left at my talk page, "It is hardly a noteworthy book. Rather it is a book that is part of a noteworthy series. This page provides nothing except blatant plot summary and does not benefit Wikipedia at all. Clearly nobody has bothered to improve on it. Instead they create new pages for other books in the series with only one sentence descriptions. If someone needs a summary of every single book in this series, they can go to Google." The edit to the prior debate is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_Princess_Diaries%2C_Volume_II%3A_Princess_in_the_Spotlight&amp;diff=116703854&amp;oldid=108257365" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FThe_Princess_Diaries%2C_Volume_II%3A_Princess_in_the_Spotlight&amp;diff=116703854&amp;oldid=108257365" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

One of the most noteworthy series in young adult literature, highlight notable author, parts of the book were used for the second film in the series, it's a bestselling novel, plenty of reviews can be dug up, etc etc etc. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 04:02, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Taken from <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENOT_aef6.html" title="Wikipedia:NOT">Wikipedia:NOT</a>: <b>Plot summaries</b>. <i>Wikipedia articles on works of fiction should contain real-world context and sourced analysis, offering detail on a work's achievements, impact or historical significance, not solely a summary of that work's plot. A plot summary may be appropriate as an aspect of a larger topic.</i> As it stands now, this article is just a plot summary. While that in itself is not a criterion for deletion, the article is in need of some repair before it becomes respectable. How long can it exist in its present state before action should be taken? --<font face="Times New Roman"><a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrus_Andiron_ae23.html" title="User:Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><strong>Cyrus Andiron</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrus_Andiron_c02a.html" title="User talk:Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cyrus_Andiron_3174.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cyrus Andiron"><font color="blue"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 15:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I'm feeling rowdy, I usually remove the plot summaries until the articles can be expanded otherwise. I've been dealing with other things rather than the Princess Diaries as of late, but it's something that can be dealt with via editing - the article is still a functionally acceptable stub. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 16:25, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Do not fear to convert the list into paragraphs analysing these several allusions on the bogus grounds that the analysis needed to turn the lists into running discourse is "unreferenced" or "original research". Only allusions in notable works should be included, and in a notable work, a Wikilink is all the reference you need; and the fear that the brief synopses needed to explain allusions are "original research" is just silly. <i>The *Lord of the Flies</i> is a work of fiction, originally written to entertain: it <i><b>already is popular culture</b></i>, even if it is taught. - <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of Tlön</a> 14:11, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b>. This is <b>not indiscriminate information</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> as Dugwiki has noted above. Nor would I say that it is indiscriminate per the common definition of the term; there is a clear discriminating criterion, namely, reference to LOTF. Also, this is <b>not unsourced</b>: it is sourced by primary sources. For instance, the reference to LOTF in <i><a href="../../../h/o/o/Hook_%28film%29.html" title="Hook (film)">Hook (film)</a></i> is sourced by the film itself. However, despite the fact that a nomination based merely in the vague accusation of "cruft" is just begging for a "Strong keep", this article violates <a href="../../../t/r/i/WP%7ETRIV_4692.html" title="WP:TRIV">WP:TRIV</a> and should not remain as a stand-alone article. Most of the entries in the article are merely passing mentions, but some are more significant.

<li><b>Rewritten</b>. I have rewritten the article: deleting most of the content, converting the remainder into prose form, and adding some references (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_of_the_Flies_in_popular_culture&amp;diff=118201262&amp;oldid=116708899" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lord_of_the_Flies_in_popular_culture&amp;diff=118201262&amp;oldid=116708899" rel="nofollow">diff</a>). I have made statements that tie the various elements together, but also deliberately limited their scope to keep them factual: I can't say that LOTF has greatly impacted future literary works, but I can say that it "has influenced or inspired multiple cultural works". Any additional cleanup would be appreciated, as I'm rather tired now and may have missed something (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, content organisation, etc.). I feel this is short and selective enough (and also sourced) to be merged back into <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord_of_the_Flies_1843.html" title="Lord of the Flies">Lord of the Flies</a>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 06:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

The television show he co-hosts seems to be limited to Pacific Northwest (so far), and as for being "the first person to effectively capture the behavior of salmon and other fish in freshwater striking lures and baits with underwater cameras", that's moderately impressive, but not quite enough, IMO. But mainly I'm concerned by the weakness of the references. Two seem to be mostly press-releases, and the third appears to come from a blog. And much of the personal information appears completely unsourced. Seems like someone who could easily achieve sufficient notability, but unless and until there's better coverage from more independent sources, I think this has to go. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 08:11, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Absolutely, positively, without doubt keep</b>. <a href="../../../k/o/r/Korean_name.html" title="Korean name">Korean name</a> is an article about Korean names (both given and surnames) in general, and is not meant to house all the surnames, thus this article is the logical one for this data. We do, in many other subjects, have articles covering the broad subject (such as <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johann_Sebastian_Bach_d0b5.html" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>), as well as other articles listing Bach's compositions, which provides an excellent and valuable reference that could not be easily contained in a single article. It is a waste of time and energy to nominate this for deletion a second time, and does nothing to advance Wikipedia's aims to be the best and most comprehensive encyclopedia. I frequently refer to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames_de0f.html" title="List of common Chinese surnames">List of common Chinese surnames</a> and this article is equally useful. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 05:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Comment: at Wikipedia, I believe *reasonableness* is more important in such cases than stringent, legalistic rulings like "delete all lists of names." The fact that there are so few Korean (and Chinese, and Vietnamese) surnames makes it possible to list, and explain them, and I, for one, use these articles as a reference. Cutting them out to fulfill the stipulations of some sort of severe ruling does not advance the cause of knowledge, nor our encyclopedia. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 06:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Comment: don't you think a list of, for example, European surnames (with all their infinite spelling variations) would be unworkably huge? I think that's been largely agreed on by consensus, with the exception being for the Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese surnames since there are so few of them. Just my comment. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadagnani_11ed.html" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> 07:24, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Chinese surnames may be <i>relatively</i> few, but they're not that few. The <i><a href="../../../h/u/n/Hundred_Family_Surnames_916b.html" title="Hundred Family Surnames">Hundred Family Surnames</a></i> are not comprehensive, and there are many, many rarer surnames that nevertheless are used. I suspect that to be the case with Korean and Vietnamese names as well. I do believe that they're few enough that a list will still have some use, but I think that if the other lists are all deleted, this should go, too, for consistency. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 13:05, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>With regard to Korean surnames, this list is fully comprehensive, as it includes all surnames registered in the South Korean census.

<li>Well, you all seem to have reached the consensus that I'm a liar. I suggest you call the Redlands Daily Facts ( and ask for STEVEN SABEL who wrote the article himself which ran on THURSDAY 12 JANUARY 2006 on PAGE C1. You might also want to ask DIANE SHOLLEY of the INLAND VALLEY DAILY BULLETIN who wrote the article about me that ran TUESDAY 3 OCTOBER 2006. The reason your lazy research efforts can't find the article is because it is cleared off the internet after so many weeks, and obviously you do nothing BUT the internet. Also, I recommend you research the AFOSI; do real research and make a phone call. I carried BADGE NUMBER 1911, from April 1994 to June of 1999. In fact, I recently received a call from an AFOSI agent in Los Angeles who knows me: NELSON FINK, assigned to LAAFB, El Segundo, AFOSI Detachment 110, as does SPECIAL AGENT DAVID HARPER. Call the FBI HQ and ask to contact SA LES SZASZ, he'll tell you who I am. Better yet, call my ex-wife LAURA EIMILLER, MEDIA REPRESENTATIVE for the FBI in Los Angeles (That's a good task for you, Jokestress). She hates me, but she'll tell you who I worked for. You can also contact General FRANCIS X. TAYLOR, retired AFOSI commander, former Ambassador at Large for Terrorism at the U.S. State Department and ask him to tell you who I am. You can contact my last commander LT COL JAMES MCDONOUGH. I can provide each of you with a copy of my DD214 discharge paper. What access do you have to USAF records? Oh, you don't have access to AFOSI records??? You may also contact author GREG BISHOP who has checked on my bonafides as a journalist. Oh and Miss Jokestress, you may contact a writer named CINDY ROBERTS who worked for ALIAS, because I was referred to her by the FBI in Los Angeles, and she has used me as a source for a couple of years now for that show and other scripts she has written. If she uses a different last name when writing, I'll gladly provide you with her phone number. And also talk to KEVIN SMITH at kevinsmithshow.com because he's checked me out. Do you people do ANYTHING but internet searches??? That's why you haven't even gathered the basic facts because if you can't find them on the web, you give up! Some encyclopedia! Why couldn't you just ask me? Because it's more fun and makes you feel more significant to be cocksure. You guys really need to get out more often; there's a lot more in the world besides your Google. Go ahead and make fun of the theories about nine-foot-tall men. I'm perfectly OK with that. Go ahead and make fun of my publishing company and the fact that, among OTHER authors, I publish my own works. I'm OK with that, too. Contact CHRISTOPHER SPELLMAN at SPELLMAN PAUL ENTERTAINMENT in LA or New York, he's my agent. Ask me to provide contact numbers for these sources, or ask me to provide better backup for the archeology stuff. But don't be morons when it comes to professional things I can prove or YOU can prove by doing more than a Google on so-called USAF 'archives'. Someone who works for me thought it would be a good idea to have this page up on me, because they believe what I do is interesting enough. I don't need to be on Wikipedia to serve my ego, believe me, but I do not like being called a liar where my professional credentials are concerned, especially by the likes of what I see in your profiles.{Lostcontinentlib 07:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)lostcontinentlibLostcontinentlib 07:04, 22 March 2007 (UTC)}</li>
<li>To the above: please understand that notability and importance are not the same thing. Contacting primary sources requires resources that not all people have access to, so primary personal sources do not, sadly, meet the requirements of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifibility</a>. No one doubts that you exist, but in order to have a properly sourced wikipedia article, multiple, secondary, reliable sources need to be found; ones that talk *about* you, not merely confirm your existance. Without that, there just isn't enough verifiable information for a wikipedia article. Also note that in general subjects are discouraged from writing their own wikipedia articles, under the grounds of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">Conflict of Interest</a> issues. Please remember importance, existance and notability are not the same. The standards of <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">Notability</a> apply to all articles of wikipedia, they're our last protection against spam in many cases, unfortunately people can and do get caught by that standard, but they're very important to the project. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 08:36, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

If reliable sources do exist however, feel free to add them to the article, drop me a line at my <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">talk page</a> or mention them here so they can be added. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 08:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I can think of no reputable encyclopedia that exists that would take someone's naked, unsupported word for a damn thing (or, alternatively, "call up my friends and they'll vouch for me"); if Mr. Bosley doesn't believe that, he should feel free to contact the Brittanica or Encarta with the exact same information and the exact same lack of verifiable sources, and see if they'd be any more likely to give him his own article. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 13:33, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I didn't think you'd take the time to really verify anything beyond Google. My sources are officials who can verify the fact of what was entered about me, but because they don't splash it all over the internet, it's not valid. Because they don't 'talk about' me in internet articles, I'm not valid. I didn't write the article. An employee logged on with my email address to create it. Sorry that person violated the 'standards'. I see now. You essentially Google for your facts and go no further. It's sort of like television. Higher ratings mean 'better', rather 'it must be good'. It's all based on popularity, really. Yes, I get it now. By the way, very funny Mr Traynor, putting yourself and Wikipedia in the same class as Encyclopedia Britannica. Remove the article, if you want. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. I recommend you read 'Atlas Shrugged', if you can understand it. Oh, and RG, you state on your own page that grammar and punctuation are peeves of yours? For crying out loud, learn how to spell 'Britannica' correctly in a public forum, OK? That alone makes your contributions to an encyclopedia suspect already.{Lostcontinentlib 15:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)}</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Leaving the personal attack aside (I'd recommend a peek at <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> myself), suppose you review the provisions of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (governing notability) and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> (governing verifiability). In particular, the mandatory policy expressed in WP:ATT runs "The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is whether material is attributable to a reliable <b>published</b> source ... The burden of evidence lies with the editor wishing to add or retain the material. If an article topic has no reliable sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on it." (emphasis mine) Further, "Reliable sources are credible published materials with a reliable publication process ... Material that is self-published is generally not regarded as reliable ... Any unsourced material may be removed, and in biographies of living persons, unsourced or poorly sourced contentious material must be removed immediately." As someone who claims to have had a career in the military and law enforcement, you cannot be unaware that rules and standards exist. Meeting these thresholds are fundamental to Wikipedia's standards, and working to meet those standards is a far more productive use of your time here than chastising or insulting us for following them. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 15:37, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Per all the comments above, I will ignore the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">personal attacks</a> to note one thing. In one of the few published sources cited, the <i>Redlands Daily Facts</i>, you are merely quoted. It is not a biographical interview about you. The threshold for notability is multiple non-trivial works. See <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>. Please add more published sources where you are the subject of the article. It's a more producitve tactic than attempting to insult people.

<li><b>comment</b> as to the accusations of using only google as a source I can assure you that most of our best articles, in fact many of our articles period, cite published books and scholarly journals. Google is used, along with things like Alexa pagerank (for websites) or Amazon rankings to determine the <b>likelihood</b> of the existance of sources. In an AfD debate, we don't often care what the sources are (beyond the requirements of reliability and verifibility) simply that they exist or could be found to improve an article. For a biography it's not always accurate, but in the abscence of compelling sources, a low number of gHits (especially when news articles are often indexed by Google) is oftentimes indicative of non-notability. This doesn't mean it's a foolproof test, but it does often allow us to either say "woah, this subject has a solid web presence, maybe it's more notable than the article leads on" or confirm that no sources exist. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWintermut3_65e1.html" title="User:Wintermut3">Wintermut3</a> 23:34, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hmm. You make a good point. If it was the other way around, it would make more sense: a person searching for "Yes, We Have No Bananas" might be looking for this song, which uses the phrase in its chorus.

<dd>IIRC the Bicycle book on poker also gives rules for a 6-card variant using all six cards to make the hand. I don't believe the rules match this, but I can't be sure because I can't find my copy (curse it all!). At any rate, the bit on increasing "fairness" is POV, and sort of irrelevant. — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 05:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Peety1 claims that IMDBpro shows multiple films in development - unfortunately, this is either a lie or fabrication. Since a direct link is impossible, due to the pay nature of IMDBpro, <a href="http://img92.imageshack.us/img92/1540/logolitewc5.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img92.imageshack.us/img92/1540/logolitewc5.jpg" rel="nofollow">this image</a>, captured this afternoon from that site, shows that Logolite has no films listed in development on the IMDB.

<li><b>Delete</b>, neither "their agenda is great" nor "has several prospective projects" are reasons for keeping an article on an obscure company that clearly fails to meet <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. As for the article being "one of the better written articles on this site", allow me to disagree. This is an uncited, unsourced stub with spammish overtones.

<li><b>Keep</b> Having written "there's no reliable sources out there to expand the article with" where "there's" is a contraction for "there is," making the sentence "There is no reliable sources our there...," I'd hardly consider Xtifr the authority on good writing. An encyclopedia is meant to inform the world and community at large. If I was considering submitting a screenplay to Logolite Entertainment, the more I can read about the company the better. If you find any of their statements to be false, edit the page--who are you to judge who might benefit from the information given.

<p>Did you miss the mention of dissident's Jungletek Movement record label, on its 5th release of a 4 track EP featuring original music? A notable contributor to the UK party scene, one of only a handful of soundsystem's that represent the UK on an international level at the European teknivals. People calling for deletion would do well to research freetekno rave culture before shooting their mouths off calling for deletion. Claims of "background music" are ridiculous, have you ever heard background music on a 12 killowatt soundsystem? Activities are not limited to the Bristol area, or even to this country, as they have been as far as Czech republic, Italy, France etc. with the soundsystem. For someone whose sole interest appears to be ice hockey, RGTraynor's ego outsrips his knowledge on this matter and should keep his ill informed oopinions to himself.</p>

<dd>It's not my list. I had no idea it existed before finding this AFD. Nor do I particularly care if the list is restricted to people with articles or not but this sort of list in my experience tends to end up with mostly bluelinks anyway. As for the list being "controllable," it does not appear that there has been any great rush to add people to it at all, let alone add people inappropriately. And if people are being added inappropriately, well, that's what editing is supposed to be for. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:37, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm actually quite neutral on whether this <i>should</i> exist or not, but I can clarify that the reason it <i>does</i> exist is because people such as David Bowie and Lou Reed kept being added to the main LGB people lists. <i>Every</i> person listed at present <i>is</i> reliably documented as having changed their identification.

<li><b>delete</b> and susceptible to BLP. I agree with RGTraynor above. A person has there right to decide how he wishes to be labeled.

<li>Hm? It really is all the things I said. It's a pioneer in constrained webcomics because it predates other constrained comics.

<li>Tsubasacon is the primary subject of all three articles, so I don't see how anyone can declare them as trivial.

<li><b>Keep</b>, nominator has not given sufficient reason for deleting this article: on talk page, nominator commented that the article is promotional and has a photo. However, many biographies include photos, and if the nominator feels the article has a promotional tone, that's grounds for improving it, not for deleting it.

<li><b><s>Speedy</s> keep</b> There was a previous AfD, and there was no rationale introduced for re-nomination that wasn't already covered in that debate.

<ul>
<li>Betweeen 25 April 2005 (last AfD) and now, Wikipedia policy about biographies and level of sourcing in general became much more strict. But the article showed almost <i>no improvement</i> during that same period <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audrey_Tang&amp;diff=110567655&amp;oldid=12789412" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audrey_Tang&amp;diff=110567655&amp;oldid=12789412" rel="nofollow">[27]</a>; a few things got reworded, a footnote was added about her surname, external links were put in to some blogs, and that's it. The only things even resembling really solid sources were the O'Reilly interviews, and those might be considered shaky for establishing notability for a variety of reasons (the interviewer using a pseudonym, the subject having worked for O'Reilly as a translator in the past, etc.) A reasonable person could feel that the article the way it was at the time of nomination <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audrey_Tang&amp;oldid=116617229" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Audrey_Tang&amp;oldid=116617229" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> was no longer valid under the newer, stricter criteria. Anyway, it's improved and this AfD will almost certainly close with a much stronger precedent to keep; no harm to let it run the remaining days rather than invoking <a href="../../../s/n/o/WP%7ESNOW_7008.html" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> (which might provoke future controversy). BTW <a href="../../../s/p/e/Wikipedia%7ESpeedy_keep_5dff.html" title="Wikipedia:Speedy keep">Wikipedia:Speedy keep</a> is technically only applicable in cases where the nominator withdraws or acted in bad faith. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECaliforniaAliBaba_4aaa.html" title="User:CaliforniaAliBaba">cab</a> 23:45, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I apologize. I had either misunderstood the definition of "speedy keep" or it changed sometime in the past year or two. I had understood it to mean "this nomination is not appropriate," not a more deeply damning statement about the nature of the nomination. As such, I have struck out the "speedy" in my edit, above. Thank you for the clarification. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 21:52, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Changing vote to <b>keep</b>. One, reading on what IrishGuy points out, the nom has made few edits beyond this, and seems to know what s/he's doing - I suspect SPA or sock, ergo bad faith. Second, while I'm still concerned about secondary and tertiary sources, reading up on FISM, seems like this could make him notable. Even without point the second factored in, I feel safe with this assertion. --<a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDennisthe2_7280.html" title="User:Dennisthe2">Dennisthe2</a> 23:41, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There are approximately 2,480 postcode districts (e.g. <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_N1_ba0a.html" title="London N1">London N1</a>) in the UK. They are arranged into 124 postcode areas (e.g. <a href="../../../n/_/p/N_postcode_area.html" title="N postcode area">N postcode area</a>) which cover regions usually centred on a major town or city. There are articles for most of the postcode areas. There should not be articles for each of the 2,480 postcode districts. The information contained within them is replicated in the postcode area articles and in the articles of the places they relate to. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMRSC_7aab.html" title="User:MRSC">MRSC</a> • <a href="../../../m/r/s/User_talk%7EMRSC_d090.html" title="User talk:MRSC">Talk</a> 12:35, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> MRSC sets up a straw man. Nobody is saying that every postcode district should have its own article, only those in the London postal area, which are far older and better-known than those elsewhere. Does MRSC know how many there are in London? it is absurd to suggest that something as notable as a London postal district should not have its own article. true, some of these articles are less good than others, but these should be improved, not deleted. Some of the articles do contain useful information, and this should not be thrown away.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can see the sense of not having articles on Bournemouth BH1, etc., because nobody thinks of them as areas. However, most people in London do think in terms of London postal districts - far more than of the larger areas - making them highly notable. And with MRSC's logic, we should have no articles on villages or localities. if he is not inconsistent, he will next want to subsume Earl's Court into its borough or even London.--<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHoldenhurst_0f7e.html" title="User:Holdenhurst">Holdenhurst</a> 16:44, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>You are the only person broaching these ideas. A little pragmatism is required, as there are a variety of ways to present information. Postcode areas make far better Wikipedia articles than individual postcode districts which remain stubby and repeat information from the postcode area article, and detract from the settlement articles (which will benefit, not lose out from their deletion). <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMRSC_7aab.html" title="User:MRSC">MRSC</a> • <a href="../../../m/r/s/User_talk%7EMRSC_d090.html" title="User talk:MRSC">Talk</a> 06:03, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I can see the logic of redirecting (but <b>not</b> deleting) articles where the postal district is identical to a recognised place name. However, this is often not the case. London N14 is in two London boroughs and includes three areas that have articles on Wikipedia. Where do we put general information on N14? The situation for N20 is even more confused; it covers two areas and most of a third.--<a href="../../../l/o/n/User%7ELondoneye_eeac.html" title="User:Londoneye">Londoneye</a> 12:14, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> Post code articles should only contain information on the <i>post office</i> within that district, not localities themselves, as the system was only ever supposed to help postal delivery - not be conterminous with real localities. An area like Shoreditch is covered by five postcodes, none of which are relevant to the place. Hoxton is in N1, should that be conflated with Islington? I don't think we're going to achieve consensus on this, I don't think a bare majority is sufficient justification to can them. I did think MRSC had achieved a schemata that was clear and didn't involve over-searching, I for one never thought that it would raise such passion. <a href="../../../k/b/t/User%7EKbthompson_3796.html" title="User:Kbthompson">Kbthompson</a> 12:30, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia should contain an article on everything that is sufficiently notable. Clearly, this includes each London postal district. Where they are identical with an area with its own article, a re-direct (with an appropriate note in the other article) will do, but very often they are not identical.--<a href="../../../r/6/1/User%7ER613vlu_fd45.html" title="User:R613vlu">R613vlu</a> 13:25, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If they are so notable on their own (and not by postcode area groups) why have even the most significant and central districts remained stubs for over 2 years? The postcode district articles on their own have no purpose whatsoever. It isn't as if anything is being lost by their deletion or redirection. I can't invisage any expansion of them that isn't already contained in the postcode area articles or the geographic district articles. If postcode districts are notable, this can be alaborated on in these articles.

<li><b>Keep</b> where they do not match areas. Londoners often define where they live by their postcode as well as/instead of their location.

<li><b>Keep</b> London postcodes have a unique and increasingly powerful identity, which needs to be detailed in its own right. Mass redirects and mass noms are not the way to address this issue.

London postcodes are an alternative take on the complicated geography of the city, and sometimes more coherent than the "village" or London borough approach. As such they are used all the time by Londoners. Some articles might only need to be short &amp; link to areas by name, others not. Unlike the full 2,000+ codes, they date back to 1917. I would say the same for the "old" codes for the other major cities - "Liverpool 8" has achieved particular erm, fame &amp; is very often referred to that way in the media (65,400 ghits, some about rowing) <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnbod_859e.html" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> 07:28, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The sentimentality in these comments is all well and good, but redirecting a load of stubs to articles which cover no more than 20-30 postcode districts and contain all the same information is not "mass redirection". There is nothing to stop these articles being recreated at such a time that there is sufficient information to warrant it (just as any sub-article would normally be spun out of an article). The fact is these are tiny stubs that have remained that way for years and look unlikely to expand in the near future. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMRSC_7aab.html" title="User:MRSC">MRSC</a> • <a href="../../../m/r/s/User_talk%7EMRSC_d090.html" title="User talk:MRSC">Talk</a> 08:06, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I see observation and analysis rather than sentimentality. "A load" = "mass". I have certainly noted in some of your redirects that information has been lost which is not in the 30 postcode districts.

Because of the way people write about (and have long written about) places in London, people trying to find out more about a reference to a place in London might well have nothing but the postal area to go on, and a short article directly about the postal area is the most polite way of helping them - which is what an encyclopedia is for. And, as others have commented, the London postal zones are long-standing (older than any of the current local government entities within London) and have distinct social meanings. <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESeglea_8627.html" title="User:Seglea">seglea</a> 00:51, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep, with a comment</b>. Given the number of articles involved, this issue probably ought to have been raised on a talk page instead of being brought to AFD. I think redirecting per Dr. Submillimeter may be a good idea, but that should be done with consideration for whether information truly <i>is</i> duplicated in every case.

<li>That's dumb. I'm sorry, but it just is. What do you want? A scientific paper saying, "we reject AGW, but this isn't a conspiracy theory!!!" Of course not. Why? Because no one labels them as conspiracy theorists besides overzealous journalists. Scinetists are not obliged to reply to such nonsense.

<li>Read the article. It does not say that criticism of global warming theory (whether published in a scientific journal or not) constitutes a conspiracy theory. It quotes various people (mostly not scientists) presenting, in mass media, the theory that global warming theory is a fraud/scam/swindle perpetrated by sinister interests, and others criticising them as putting forward a conspiracy theory. If this criticism is incorrect, they might reasonably respond.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:41, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I'm not yet sure where I stand on global warming itself. <s>That said, here's why this article is wrongheaded:</s></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><s><s><b>Title</b> It doesn't describe a "conspiracy". At points it describes various "conspiracies." It also describes conflicts of interest as well as narrow-minded ideologues doing what narrow-minded ideologues do. <i>That does not add up to a conspiracy. It doesn't even add up to a collection of conspiracies.</i> It is unfair to call it a conspiracy or only conspiracies. That's <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> if you're drawing the conclusion that any of the items in this sorry article are conspiracies when that hasn't even been alleged. And when you pile them all up in a giant heap, you add fuel to the overheated brains of conspiracy theorists who are off their paranoia medication. Wikipedia Is Not An Asylum.</s></s></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><s><s><b>Indiscriminate</b> This isn't an article. It's an indiscriminate list of different types of things tied together because they disparage, rightly or wrongly, the pro-global warming crowd: fictional representation; the use of the word in a TV documentary that apparently just uses it in tabloid fashion to get viewers (and admits it really isn't about a conspiracy after it hooks in the viewers); and charges or critiques of various sorts (sometimes using "conspiracy" for shock value). Wikipedia Is Not Tabloid Journalism.</s></s></li>
<li><s><s><b>POV fork</b> The real subject of this article could be titled something like "Charges of improper actions against global warming activists". I have no doubt some of those improper actions exist and I'm all for covering them. But there's a place for that: in fact there are a number of places for that in proper Wikipedia articles. And when you can't find a place for a <b>specific</b> charge of conspiracy or other improper activity, you create either a specific article that meets notability standards because the subject of the article has been the subject of at least two independent, responsible sources that you can cite (<i><b>surely</b></i> not impossible to do if the charge has even an airy whiff of plausibility to it, and if not, <i>wait until it does before sticking it in an encyclopedia.</i>), or come up with an article that can link them all together in a responsible way. Wikipedia Is Not Advocacy Journalism.</s></s></li>
<li><s><s><b>Irresponsible</b> Treat the other side as you would wish to be treated yourself. Even if you just want to be an effective partisan, irresponsible charges always hurt your cause in the long run, usually in the medium run and sometimes even in the short run. There's nothing wrong with making sure political views and even noteworthy, responsible accusations of wrongdoing are represented in the encyclopedia. But your customers have a finely tuned ear for what seems irresponsible. When you toss around pejorative words like "conspiracy", "racism", "sexism", "unpatriotic" and the like you denigrate the responsible allegations against those for whom those words actually apply. You use those words only when you can offer specific proof and when you report on others who use them, you do it with specific citations. And you carefully describe the charges, showing how they've been presented and by whom and what reasons or evidence have been offered for them, if any. Yes, Wikipedia only reports what others have said, but it reports responsibily or it's not worthy of the name of an encyclopedia. Is it? Wikipedia Is Not A Pedestal For Calumny.</s></s></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><s><s>At the very least, the name of this article needs to be changed. If "conspiracies" is kept in the title, then all nonconspiracies need to be eliminated from the article. Personally, I don't have any hope at all that it will become an encyclopedic article in any form. And if any editor has added to this article with the purest of intentions, I apologize for not assuming good faith, but there appear to be very obvious patterns to the way this page has been built.

<dd>All the references in the paper refer to the claim you describe in your opening para, namely that environmentalists, scientists and others have acted in concert to promote a theory they know to be false, on the basis of ideological or financial motives. This alleged concerted action has been referred to as a conspiracy on several occasions, as cited (three references were given - I apologise for the referencing problem that may have obscured this, and thank you for fixing it). More frequently, such claims have been described by critics as "conspiracy theories". The predominantly pejorative nature of the usage is noted right in the first sentence. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 20:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Oh, I get it. This is a way to attack the global warming skeptics. The more I follow the links, the more horrible this article looks; sometimes the sloppiness is evident right on the page:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>"The Greenhouse Conspiracy" documentary on Channel 4 in Britain: "It may not quite add up to a conspiracy, but [...]"</li>
<li>The quote from the Cooler Heads Coalition says of someone who criticized another skeptic of promoting a conspiracy theory: "Sounds plausible to us." That was the last line in their press release (or whatever announcement it was on their Web site). Absolutely nothing in the words that precede that statement shows that they seriously believe it's a conspiracy. The quoted statement was a rhetorical flourish (irresponsible, in my opinion, but not a claim that there's a conspiracy).</li>
<li>The Washington Post "article" is a Sunday magazine piece that engages, more than most, in rhetorical flourishes of its own and doesn't pretend to be objective. It characterizes the statement of a skeptic as a "conspiracy theory" but the quote used to back it up (shown in the WP article) could be interpreted as either describing a conspiracy theory or describing ideologues run amok. A couple of paragraphs before, the author writes that both sides have their own charges of a "conspiracy theory, of a sort." <i>Of a sort???</i>. Let's change the title of this article to Global warming conspiracy theories of a sort.</li>
<li>"The general claim that the theory of global warming is a lie promoted by members of one or more interest groups <b>secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes</b> has been made on a number of occasions [...]" (emphasis added). The problem is that none of the citations back this up:
<ol>
<li>On its Web page, the Oregon Petition does say global warming is "a lie" but doesn't say it's a conspiracy of groups "secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes"</li>
<li>Melanie Philips calls global warming theory (in 2004) a "fraud". An irresponsible rhetorical flourish, not a charge of a conspiracy.</li>
<li>Same with Martin Dirkin calling it "a lie ... the biggest scam of modern times." Nothing else in the article where this quote comes from supports the idea that Dirkin actually thinks there's a conspiracy of groups "secretly acting in concert for dishonest purposes." What we have is another rhetorical flourish from a filmmaker hawking his movie.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>And what we have overall is an article that is full of holes and not worth keeping. Overheated rhetoric is not conspiracy theorizing. Writing Wikipedia articles is not propagandizing. Or at least it's not supposed to be.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 00:40, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment on changing my vote</b> The article has been improved quite a bit since I saw it last. It proves to me that the charge that there's a Global warming conspiracy has been made numerous times both as an explicit statement and at other times as a clear implication. I think the article should make it clearer up top that this is often more a rhetorical tic than a serious charge (that many of the people who make the charge don't take it seriously is clear from the quotes in the article). But my problems with the article no longer warrant deletion: There's clearly some value here.

<li><b>Keep</b> There is a differences between critics of he conventional scientific view, and those who think it a deliberate internationalist ( or whatever ) plot. This is a fair documentation of the latter. The critics have every right to have their views fairly represented objectively and treated seriously. The reader can safely be left to judge the merits. The conspiracy theorists have also the right for their views to be presented fairly, and if a fair presentation leaves them somewhat silly, that's not the fault of the recorder who describes what they say. Any detailed problem of NPOV on a particular point is for the talk page. That there are such theories is real, and unfortunately the theories are notable. The possibility that they might be right is for them to prove, and we show what the say they have proved. Again, the reader can be safely left to judge. We deal with all such pseudo scientific views the same way as we do scientific ones, so we don't have to decide which is which. If they are publicly notable, we present them. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Right, leave it to the reader to judge when the article name is conspiracy theory. There's a distinct difference between theory and conspiracy theory. Saying the CIA killed JFK is conspiracy theory. Saying the Sun's variations have a real impact on Earth's climate while presenting discernible evidence is a theory. In fact, there's also a legitimate article on the <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, no where in which so-called conspiracy theories are mentioned.

<li><b>Comment</b> As you say, the solar variation theory is not a conspiracy theory, which is why it isn't mentioned in the article. The claim that the whole theory of global warming is a swindle/scam/fraud with many participants is (at least in the view of those accused of being participants) a conspiracy theory, and hence it is mentioned.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 06:00, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Oh no you don't, JQ. Where's the proof in the article that we've got multiple conspiracy <b>theories</b> instead of over-the-top rhetoric? It's easy to see the difference: Someone with a conspiracy theory would explain the details, try to show proof of what was going on behind the scenes, name names. Someone with a theory would get into it more. No one's doing that, at least not so far as a reader could tell from either the article or its sources. Conspiracy theorists act altogether differently from people going too far in their rhetoric. The theorists generally can't get elaborate enough; the others make a passing reference and jump on to the next point (just like they do in the source material for this article). I'm not asking for the equivalent of UFO conferences, the books on how the theory works, the intricate diagrams of the grassy knoll: Just give me someone with something more than a rhetorical tic.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>I see UBeR's got you literally surrounded, DGG, and he brings up an excellent point: there's no proof whatever that there's any conspiracy <b>theory</b> here. And my comments above are better addressed in a deletion discussion rather than a talk page because the problems are so pervasive in the article that they can't be fixed. Take out all the irrepairable passages and there's only a whisp of an article left. What remains is too weak to sustain what the article says exists. I'm sure that somewhere some nutcases have actual theories to go with this article. But it would have to be shown that the <b>theories</b> — the actual crackpot beliefs, not some over-the-top rhetoric — have attained enough notability for a Wikipedia article. Show us evidence that that's likely to happen and I'll change my mind to "Keep", or join us in deleting this article. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 06:21, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - As it has been pointed out above, few or even no source at all speak of a conspiracy theory per se. But I would agree that there exists enough material to introduce the idea of a "Global warming hoax". I have added some material in this regard. This title would help solve the POV issue (conspiracy theory is pejorative, as the author himself pointed out). Also, if this article is to be kept, it must focus on the fact that some skeptics or other people have found grounds to believe that climate science is not used for its stated aims or is being "hijacked" by special interests, rather than to focus on accusing skeptics of being "conspiracy theorists", since then the POV fork accusation would hold. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 16:07, 23 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If every time some controversialist uses the word "scam" and "hoax" we have a full-fledged conspiracy being described, then: "go to hell" would always be a serious wish to see someone condemned to everlasting damnation; "I could kill you" would always be a threat; "get outta here" would always be an invitation to leave; "son of a bitch" would always be a comment on that person's mother, etc. etc. etc. JQ, you're displaying the same problem in this discussion as in the article itself: you're being slippery with terms. If conspiracies are really being alleged, it shouldn't be too hard to back that up. As I say, conspiracy nuts shout from the rooftops and post on the Web.

<li>Maybe we should clarify terms here. I have no doubt that most of the sources I'm quoting (for example, Inhofe, Melanie Phillips, WorldNetDaily) are alleging conscious fraud as opposed to applying a rhetorical flourish to a claim that people's views on this issue are influenced by their general political position. The statement has been made too many times, in too strong terms, to be a mere flourish. Are you disagreeing with this, or are you endorsing <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a>'s position that 'The article states "the claim that the theory that global warming is caused by humans is a conscious fraud, perpetuated for financial or ideological reasons" can be described as a conspiracy theory.

The behind-the-scene mastermind is named as Maurice Strong, who's described as being " best known as the godfather of the environmental movement, who served from 1973-1975 as the founding director of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) in Nairobi. UNEP is now a globe-girdling organization with a yearly budget of $136 million, which claims to act as the world’s environmental conscience. Strong consolidated his eco-credentials as the organizer of the U.N.’s 1992 environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro, which in turn paved the way for the controversial 1997 Kyoto Treaty on controlling greenhouse gas emissions." As you'd expect, the details are far too complicated to summarise (Iraq, China, NK, SK and Ted Turner all get a run) but part of the claim is that Strong is pushing Kyoto so China can profit from trade in emissions credits.

Time for a new article? Iceage77 20:17, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A good suggestion, Iceage77. The claim that science is really a form of religion has also come up (largely from the same people) in the creation/evolution debate, so it is certainly notable. Maybe you'd like to make a start.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 21:38, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But like this article it would be inherently POV. The argument of course is not that science is a form of religion but that belief in AGW is based on faith and irrationalism. Iceage77 22:12, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The solution to POV problems is not to suppress points-of-view. The NPOV solution is to include the POV you describe and the alternative POV, citing the overwhelming majority of scientists who point to the mountains of factual evidence in favour of AGW and say that any rational person would be convinced by it. The article could then link back to the counterclaim that the mountains of evidence have been fabricated by a global conspiracy/swindle/fraud, in which the scientists themselves are participants, as stated in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Global_Warming_Swindle_4743.html" title="The Great Global Warming Swindle">The Great Global Warming Swindle</a> and other sources discussed above. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 22:22, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The phenomenon of public figures calling GW a hoax or a conspiracy certainly exists and is notable: Sen. Inhofe and Michael Crichton should probably have the top spots. The article certainly does need a major clean-up. I'd like to see a lot less qualifying and apologizing - something simple like: "several people have claimed that global warming is not just false but is known to be false by its proponents" then go on to describe how Inhofe has made this a key position in his role as chair of the Senate Energy committee; and recount how Crichton's State of Fear has be selling widely and sum up how it pictures the situation (conceding that it is fiction, but that does not take away the sting of its implied message that this is also what is going on in the real world.<a href="../../../b/i/r/User%7EBirdbrainscan_dd4d.html" title="User:Birdbrainscan">Birdbrainscan</a> 00:43, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Er, I think you're misunderstanding. The article isn't stating the people are calling GW a hoax or conspiracy. That's given. What the article is saying is that anyone who calls GW a hoax is a conspiracy theorist, based on three people's opinion! There's quite a difference, and I'm assuming that's why most people have unknowingly voted keep erroneously insofar. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 01:03, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, you're misunderstanding. In nearly every comment you've made, you've confused the claim "AGW theory is incorrect" with "AGW theory is a hoax". The former is a scientific claim, though one that has notably failed to convince any significant section of the scientific community. The latter (given the large number of people who have to be involved) is plausibly described as a conspiracy theory, especially when the article documents numerous unequivocally conspiracy-theoretic statements of the same view. However, some people (you and Noroton, for example) may want to draw a distinction between "hoax/fraud/swindle involving thousands of participants" and "conspiracy". The article mentions this and there is a stubby section where citations to this POV can be included.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 02:31, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Precisely. You explain it well: "'AGW theory is a hoax' . . . is plausibly described as a conspiracy theory." Note the word "plausibly." I'm sorry, but Wikipedia is not here for you to draw conclusions on people's thoughts. Just because you think people calling AGW a hoax is a conspiracy theory doesn't mean you get your own article to say because this person denies AGW he's a conspiracy theorist. That isn't how Wikipedia works. See <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, specifically, <a href="../../../s/y/n/WP%7ESYN_b7b5.html" title="WP:SYN">WP:SYN</a>. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 04:40, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is why the article makes no OR claims and cites notable and verifiable sources who have described it quite directly as a conspiracy theory - notwithstanding your attempt to claim that a leading figure in the IPCC and journalists writing for major news sources are not notable . Of course, if you are serious about the claim that three sources aren't enough, give a number and I'll be happy to meet it, at the expense of added listiness. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 10:21, 28 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have 3 people calling two documents conspiracy theories. What you're doing is turning that into anything that is critical of AGW is a conspiracy theory. Wikipedia doesn't allow that. P.S. I said or implied the founder of International Society for Science and Religion is non-notable&gt; he's a scientist, but that brings up another point: Is it a scientist's job to determining what is a conspiracy theory? I'm pretty sure that's beyond the scope of science, but that's neither here nor there. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 17:36, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>OK, so I've added a very prominent Minister in the UK government whose portfolio covers the area in question, referring specifically to conspiracy theories.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The conspiracy theory is notable and thus should have an article here on Wikipedia. This article is different from the aticle on global warming controversy, because that article does not focus on conspiracy theories, but rather on (a priori) bona fide objections to global warming theory. <a href="../../../c/o/u/User%7ECount_Iblis_817f.html" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> 14:53, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> on <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a>&#160;: Many editors here have supported the "Keep" camp on the ground that the subject is notable. I am not decided yet on whether this article should be kept or deleted (see my comment above) but only to clarify things about notability (which is so easily misunderstood because of partisan views), here are a few rules taken from WP:Notability&#160;:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>- A notable topic has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple non-trivial published works that are reliable and independent of the subject.</dd>
<dd>- "Reliable" means sources need editorial integrity to allow attributable evaluation of notability, per the reliable source guideline</dd>
<dd>- In order to have an attributable article, a topic should be notable enough that the information about it will have been researched, checked, and evaluated through publication in independent reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>- <b>In order to have a neutral article, a topic should be notable enough that the information about it will be from unbiased and unaffiliated sources; and that those interested in the article will not be exclusively partisan or fanatic editors.</b> (core problem here, imho)</dd>
<dd>- General notability is not judged by Wikipedia editors directly. The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works.</dd>
<dd>These rules exist for a good reason, and it is in order that WP remains an encyclopedia and does not become some blog. So, I think that if this article can be saved, it is by removing the focus on the "theory" willing that skeptics think that GW is a conspiracy theory, and by focusing instead on serious motives that made some skeptics say that GW was a <b>hoax</b>. Right now we're far from that, and I dont know whether this would leave enough material to warrant an article. --<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildhoodsend_bd14.html" title="User:Childhoodsend">Childhood's End</a> 19:29, 29 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This article obviously fails in notability on points three and four. ~ <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a> 22:21, 29 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There's no problem with notability here - the sources are prominent figures (a UK Cabinet Minister on one side, a senior US Senator on the other, scientists, prominent journalists), quoted in prominent publications. In fact, the listy and badly structured nature of the article reflects an overload of this kind of thing, added in response to claims that three sources weren't enough, and so on, claims that were promptly abandoned as soon as more sources were put in. Obviously, it would be good to have someone uninvolved edit the article, and given the many notable sources, this would be easy, though I doubt anyone will want to get involved until this afd is over.<a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Quiggin_69ce.html" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> 22:31, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>keep</b> it seems in response to <a href="../../../u/b/e/User%7EUBeR_2da6.html" title="User:UBeR">UBeR</a>'s original AfD reasons, that this has now been proven notable and has been pumped full of sources. The "counter-arguments" section still looks messy, but the rest of the article doesn't otherwise smell of POV to me, it looks rather neutral. It seems to establish its point. "Global warming conspiracy theory" is, the article establishes, really used to "refer the claim that the theory that global warming is caused by humans is a conscious fraud, perpetuated for financial or ideological reasons". I'd be perfectly happy to see all this material merged into <a href="../../../g/l/o/Global_warming_controversy.html" title="Global warming controversy">global warming controversy</a>, though. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllGloryToTheHypnotoad_177b.html" title="User:AllGloryToTheHypnotoad">AllGloryToTheHypnotoad</a> 00:07, 30 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The subject's work has been the subject of uncritical reviews in a hoemopathy journal (of unknown significance), but there is a dearth of independent review of this man and his work, and the book reviews indicate that this work is at the hard core pseudoscience end of homeopathy. The text is still pretty much the original lifted from his website, since he (or his webmasters) changed the copyright notice specifically so the article would not be deleted as a copyright violation. I can't find any evidence of mainstream coverage, certainly nothing outside of sources which are promoting homeopathy. I do not myself consider a review of a book by a journal committed to promoting the subject of the book to be independent under the meaning of the act, but even if we did this is a source for the book not the author, I think. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:34, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

The guy has 100,000 hits on Google (and before anyone jumps in again and says "how do we know those hits are for "this" Vithoulkas", please do a random browse through those hits. You'll find that at least 98% (if not more) are for George Vithoulkas, the subject of this article). His books have been translated into twenty languages. His writings are considered fundamental to modern homeopathy and have been integrated into the main software applications used by thousands of homeopaths all over the world. You can find him cited many times in PubMed, the Who's Who directory(!), Google Scholar and virtually anywhere that homeopathy is discussed. People travel from all over the world to study with him or to receive treatment. He's the winner of the Alternative Nobel Prize and has been honored by various governments. Whether homeopathy is "pseudoscience" as User JzG claims above, is entirely irrelevant to the question of notability and to suggest that someone of his statue and fame (or notoriety if you please) is somehow not notable enough for Wikipedia is just preposterous.

WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE? I have shown you that there are dozens of books published all over the world by a variety of publishers that describe him as THE central figure in modern homeopathy. There's even a bio of Vithoulkas in German that I didn't mention. I can no longer accept that you are discussing this matter in good faith.

<p>He's far more notable than most modern homeopaths, so if we're going to include modern homeopaths, it's pretty much down to him and <a href="../../../r/a/j/Rajesh_Shah_ec37.html" title="Rajesh Shah">Rajesh Shah</a>, as far as I can see.

<dd>The Pubmed, Google, and Google Scholar bits are just indexes - they reference anything they can. Surely every scientist who ever published research isn't notable enough for an encyclopedia. Any of the following would probably make him notable:
<ul>
<li>Newspaper reports, in any major newspaper, detailing the awards and putting them in context. Why was he chosen? What does the award mean? (This is, of course, slightly dependant on the award's significance. An <a href="../../../o/b/e/OBE_5508.html" title="OBE">OBE</a> isn't particularly notable, for instance - Any person in the higher ranks of a charity is likely to get one, and, while they deserve recognition for their work, this doesn't necessarily make them notable.</li>
<li>A few articles about him in major newspapers, of reasonable length, and reasonably independant of him himself.</li>
<li>A few criticisms of him by a reasonably notable <b>anti</b>-homeopathic people or organisations. If he's notable to attract their eye, he's probably notable, and POV problems cease.</li>

<dd>My point is that Wikipedia includes articles on very obscure subjects. The standard for notability is generally the publication of a couple books that have been noted at least within the author's field. For musicians, you only have to be pretty well-known in your local area (representative of the local scene). Here's a person who has written many books some of which have been translated into twenty languages and they are acknowledged as standard references for his field (ie. they are incorporated into the two or three main software databases for homeopathy). Aside from all the other stuff (listing in Who's Who, the awards, etc) that ALONE would make him more notable than probably 50% of the bios in Wikipedia. What we have here is a strange new bar that's been set only for this article. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 19:31, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

The notability guidelines, while they don't specifically talk about medicine, do give examples of notability being people who are leaders in their field (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), a credible independent biography (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), a large fan base (Vithoulkas meets this criteria), endorsements of notable products (Vithoulkas meets this criteria, maybe arguably if you don't think homeopathy is notable), wide name recognition (i.e. hits on Google), known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique (Vithoulkas certainly fits this criteria), has won significant critical attention (Vithoulkas meets this criteria). Now even ONE of those criteria would establish his notability, but Vithoulkas meets every possible angle you can come up with. No, he hasn't yet competed on American Idol, but otherwise, I can't see any area in which he fails to meet the requirements. Unless, of course, you believe that homeopathy is just rubbish and the tens of millions of people who practise it don't count. Which is, apparently, what you believe, so beyond this point words fail me. --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 23:12, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Right. So we have a BBC documentary that google only shows mention of on that site [<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=HdU&amp;q=The+HEALING+ARTS%3A+GEORGE+VITHOULKAS+-+HOMEOPATH+BBC&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=HdU&amp;q=The+HEALING+ARTS%3A+GEORGE+VITHOULKAS+-+HOMEOPATH+BBC&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;hs=HdU&amp;q=The+HEALING+ARTS%3A+GEORGE+VITHOULKAS+-+HOMEOPATH+BBC&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=</a> a Hungarian award, the video showing it being handed to him, with a few other people present, a little clapping, him shaking hands, then returning to his place. A clip of a few people in professorial gear standing about, purporting to be Vithoulkas getting a professorship. The video claims the award by the Indian Ministry of Health was for him as Homeopath of the Millenium. This is NEVER SAID in the video clip. Why on earth would that be left out if it was said, given the video was assembled by Vithoulkas according to the first splash page. The BBC documentary is mentioned in the last few seconds, of the google video, after which it abruptly ends.</dd>
<dd>I'm sorry, if anything, this makes me less convinced. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam_Cuerden_bd4e.html" title="User:Adam Cuerden">Adam Cuerden</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam_Cuerden_a555.html" title="User talk:Adam Cuerden">talk</a></sup> 21:49, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Nothing would convince you Adam...</dd>
<dd>MarcoTolo, Vithoulkas was awarded the Indian 'Gold Medal' as Homeopath of the Millenium for his contribution to Classical Homeopathy. This video on Google is a shorter version of the original one, in which it is stated clearly. Same goes for the BBC documentary (is not included in this specific video, besides the final note) - it is an old one (1986) and it's a miracle i even found that reference. As far as the Hungarian award is concerned, that is in Hungarian, which would not make much sense for english-speaking users - same goes for the award in Kiev, the speech is in Russian. The purpose of this short video was to include the highlights of the awards. Now, BEFORE someone doubts again what i'm saying, i'll be more than happy to contact the webmaster of Vithoulkas.com and ask him to upload the FULL video (which i have too, containing the BBC doc, the Indian, Hungarian, Kiev ceremonies). If some extra time for the AfD is given (48 hours at least), i can prove this is the truth (if there's any point in it).Homeopathic 22:16, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, just like the above article. We are not called upon to decide the merits of homeopathy, We just present what they say for themselves. He is considered notable among his fellows, so there is an article about him and his views fairly presented. Nobody could possibly mistake them for ordinary medicine. If the article makes advertising type claims, or tried to expound the theory in excessive detail, that's for the talk page. I think the article is sober enough. Every believer and ever disbeliever should equally want the views expressed. I am among the total disbelievers, and to let the views be presented is the strongest and most effective, and fairest criticism.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>One of the comments above amounted to saying that homeopathic sources are inherently not reliable. If we were trying to prove the truth of the matter, perhaps. If we were qualified to judge the science, most decidedly. As a source for what homeopathy say, and how any particular homeopath is regarded, of course they are. I can not see how anyone without bias would regard this as biased in favor of the subject. Keeping this is NPOV. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b></dd>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. There's a lot of discussion to parse here and it's not especially easy. The problem that we seem to have here is the reliability of the sources. As stated in <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, we rely on secondary sources to determine notability - primary sources are only acceptable once secondary sources have satisfied that problem. Since it appears the sources being used to support this article are of a pro-homeopathy bent, I would say that qualifies them as <i>primary</i> sources - <i>documents or poeple close to the situation</i>. Homeopaths writing about homeopaths is not a reliable, secondary source. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan"><b><font color="#0000FF">A</font><font color="#1818EF">r</font><font color="#3030DF">k</font><font color="#4848CF">y</font><font color="#6060BF">a</font><font color="#7878AF">n</font></b></a> • <a href="../../../a/r/k/User_talk%7EArkyan_109e.html" title="User talk:Arkyan"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 18:35, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Background information</b> <i>There are literally hundreds of books on homeopathy that cite Vithoulkas</i>. I've provided a tiny sample earlier in this page. This was met with, what I consider, the entirely fatuous argument that they don't count because they are written by people who favor homeopathy. This seems absurd and kafkaesque (since when did we need the confirmation of people outside of one's field to confirm whether you might be notable). Remember we're only trying to determine whether he's well-known in his field not whether he's right or whether he's the most famous person who ever lived. In any case, there was an insistence, particularly by Cuerdon, that there be some non-homeopathic publications cited to prove his notability. Here are two which I think should suffice. He is cited in <i>A New World Order</i> by Paul Ekins <a href="http://www.amazon.com/New-World-Order-Paul-Ekins/dp/0415071151/ref=sr_1_8/103-5082920-2572631?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174699713&amp;sr=8-8" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.com/New-World-Order-Paul-Ekins/dp/0415071151/ref=sr_1_8/103-5082920-2572631?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1174699713&amp;sr=8-8" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> a book that was reviewed favourably by the Times Higher Educational Supplement, New Statesman and Society and Third World Quarterly. It's a book about military statistics. Why he talks about Vithoulkas I don't know but he does. We also have the <i>Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health</i> by Scott Shannon, a book that received a glowing reviefrom the International Review of Psychiatry, from Andrew Weil, M.D and others. The author describes Vithoulkas as a "contemporary master of homeopathy". One of the specific indicators for notability is the existence of an independent biography. I draw your attention to <i>Georgos Vithoulkas Der Meister-Homöopath Biographie und Fälle</i> published by Random House (Germany) <a href="http://www.randomhouse.de/book/editiondetail.jsp?edi=107914" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.randomhouse.de/book/editiondetail.jsp?edi=107914" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>. So now we have a person who has many publications (published by major publishing houses), has several books translated into twenty languages, is cited in hundreds of books in many languages also published by mainstream publishers, has an independent biography published by a major publishing house, is cited in medical journals, is almost universally acknowledged as the leading person in his field, has a listing in Who's Who, has received a major international award, has been honored by several governments and on and on. How can there be the slightest doubt of his notability? --<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELeeHunter_0ab1.html" title="User:LeeHunter">Lee Hunter</a> 01:46, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, seems clearly notable. Suspicion about homeopathy is probably making people unreasonably skeptical about the subject's notability. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:51, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>based on notability, if nothing else the controversy makes him notable. WP doesn't require biomedical research to be reveiwed by cosmologists or literary critics or homeopaths. Homeopathy and GV may be nonsense (is, in my opinion), but the same argument could be made for endless people and ideas. Anyone who has written, had published, and sold many books on any topic is notable. Wrong maybe, but still notable.

<li>What I can say about this article is that I checked its reference to Papyrus-Larousse-Britannica, because I was indeed suspicious after the long discussion in WP:ANI. Well, the reference is absolutely accurate! There is a long article about him in the encyclopedia, where he is called one of the most important personalities in his domain. And Papyrus is regarded as the most prestigious encyclopedia in Greece. My conclusion is that, at least in Greece, he is important enough to deserve a full page of biography in the country's most prestigious encyclopedia. And there are references in this article, indicating that in his domain he has made his presence noticeable even outside Greek fronteers.

<p>I nominated this page with a delete template because it is obviously a violation of WP:BIO and WP:NOT, however the creator of the page chose to remove it and so I have been forced to apply an AFD, this page does not comply with several Wikipedia guidelines and is nothing more than a promotional page for a candidate in an election which does not even have a date, and the person is not notable other than for this reason, I feel that this page does not serve any encyclopedic purpose and the creator of the page is not fully aware of Wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalwatchmen_4381.html" title="User:Politicalwatchmen">Politicalwatchmen</a> 16:48, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This article is not particularly informative, and does not even relate in my considered opinion to any legitimate candidacy for an election, as the said election has not to date been called, this therefore is a presumption of candidacy, rather than a confirmation. Wikipedia cannot predict the future, and as each election is very self-contained, there is very little guarantee that this page will still be relevant come the time for a UK general election, as the party concerned is perfectly entitled not to go ahead with this prospective candidate's formal nomination. The political party is not the issue here, but I am arguing from the point of view of the relevance of this page. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPolitical_Avenger_6919.html" title="User:Political Avenger">Political Avenger</a> 18:27, 21 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> A google search for "Paul Uppal" only brings up his own page, a few references to the nomination on Conservative sites (most of which just list the nomination), and the wikipedia article itself. If there are third party refernces then they aren't apparent through google. Even the Guardian page which comes up first just lists his position in the 2005 election and nothing else. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalwatchmen_4381.html" title="User:Politicalwatchmen">Politicalwatchmen</a> 15:16, 24 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> MattRevell, if you live in the constituency that Uppal is running in then no doubt you will be able to talk to him directly, the nomination for this page's deletion is all about Wikipedia policy, and gaining a nomination for an election which has no date and a page which contains no sources seems to me to be an obvious violation of Wikipedia policy.

<li><b>Comment</b> Politicalwatchmen - I could go and find information about all sorts of things by talking directly to the people involved. However, I don't always want to trust only their version of the story and it seems a rather inefficient way of doing things. In this case, I think the Wikipedia policy is wrong and that this is an excellent example of one of the flaws of Wikipedia: i.e. that there are people using Wikipedia who spend their time deleting content, and stifling expression, in a thoroughly jobsworth manner. As an aside, how do you respond to the allegation that Political Avenger is just another name for you? <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattRevell_a5df.html" title="User:MattRevell">MattRevell</a> 17:57, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have already addressed that matter on the relevant page. As for "stifling expression", I'm not sure where you get that from. Wikipedia's policies are agree upon by the whole community, and reached through consensus. The Wikipedia servers are not infinite, and this page (and other) do nothing encyclopedic, they are just there for vanity. Paul Uppal came third in the 2005 general election, does that make him notable. There is nothing on his page other than personal information, and that information is better suited to a blog or homepage, not an entry in an encyclopedia. The fact that candidates are not viewed as having inherent notability is not just my own personal view but rather the view, reached by consensus, of the whole wikipedia community. There are many policies with which I disagree, but while they are policy I will follow them rather than ignore them. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalwatchmen_4381.html" title="User:Politicalwatchmen">Politicalwatchmen</a> 18:16, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I would say that consensus has been reached, and the article has not been improved or changed since the 27th February, and no additonal sources have been cited. The creator of the article is a friend of Paul Uppal and so in addition to the various <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> issues ther is also an issue of <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. I don't think it is neccessary to salt the earth, but any recreation should be subject to speedy delete, at least until the election is called. <a href="../../../p/o/l/User%7EPoliticalwatchmen_4381.html" title="User:Politicalwatchmen">Politicalwatchmen</a> 11:35, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Administrator's reasoning</b>: The debate below was exactly a tie between well-reasoned debaters. However, the important point is the provision of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The sources provided in the article, and quoted below, are absurdly limited if the organisation has the claimed notability. There were, in effect, three sources. One of these was the organisation itself - not reliable in so far as Wikipedia would require for obvious reasons. Another was cparchives.com - this one is good, but is clearly firmly biased towards such organisations - I can't get anything that would suggest a neutral point of view from it. The best source was post-gazette.com, but sadly it managed to rarely refer to the group itself, sticking to talking about "protesters" in general - nothing relaible when it comes to making a decision on the verifiability and notability of the subject of the article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Therefore, on grounds of Wikipedia policy, I'm going with a delete because my researches agree with the delete people's arguments below. However, nothing in this decision prevents the article being recreated and I would encourage the keep people to do so - but the resulting article needs to have far less to do with the organisation's view of themselves and far more to do with reliable, third-party sources. The decision is, of course, open to review and does not reflect any personal opinion or bias I may or may not have on the subject at hand. <b><a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedvers_ab65.html" title="User:Redvers"><font color="red">RΞDVΞRS</font></a> ✖ <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERedvers_29e5.html" title="User talk:Redvers"><font color="thistle">ЯΞVΞЯSΞ</font></a></b> 21:20, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is getting ridiculous. None of those City Paper articles were written by a participant in POG. Chris Potter is the editor of City Paper and Marty Levine was the news editor when these articles were published. Both are well respected and paid journalists. What in particular needs to be sourced and I will source it. You can see by looking a the media page for this group that there are about 100 corporate news stories that info can be sources from. Should I simply put an attribution to back up each and every line in this article? To do so would make for a fairly ridiculous read but I'll do so if necessary. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.17.162.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.162.248_0f9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.162.248">contribs</a>).</small> <small>— 70.17.162.248 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.17.162.248_0f9d.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.17.162.248">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A shadowy outfit whose existence isn't attested by reliable sources. All we have is that there is some group of people, who protest in Pittsburgh, that the Post-Gazette is willing to call the 'Pittsburgh Organizing Group.' This group seems to have no named leaders or members (people who, when interviewed, say that they are members). It's not clear why we should call it a 'Group.' The blog posting that is linked from the article (by Jonathan Barnes) implies that the members' anonymity is their choice. If they are too shadowy to have named members, perhaps they are too shadowy for Wikipedia. Seems like the possibility of a hoax. Their contact address is said to be at the Thomas Merton Center. Maybe that Center would be a more logical subject of an article? The Center actually seems to exist. If the article is kept, note that many of the details in the article (as noted above by other commenters in the AfD) are attested only by the group's web site, so they would have to be removed as unsourced. <a href="../../../e/d/j/User%7EEdJohnston_759e.html" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> 05:05, 29 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

My brief search did not turn up anything worthwhile, though Google is rarely a good measure of notability for anyone born before the latter half of the 20th century. Given how little content the article contains, I am also not inclined to dig deeper. A JSTOR search for "George Fairholme" produces 3 results. I checked the one I thought to be most relevant, titled "The Scriptural Geologists: An Episode in the History of Opinion", but it only seems to mention Fairholme trivially (admittedly, I only skimmed the article). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:09, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

WjB's link calls him a "lecturer in summer session" which seems likely to be a lesser position than the standard lecturer, and not one held by an academic of any prominence. The usenet thing is an interesting bit of color which I think should be irrelevant for this discussion: not evidence of notability, obviously, but also not something to hold against him. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 03:07, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> It seems he got his degree in 86, made usennet posts in 95 through 97, wrote up his dissertation into this one book--found in every university library--and then disappeared from the scholarly scene. He's not even in ratemyprofessors for Davis. Probably has an interesting life, but until someone tells us more, I don't see how we can keep the article. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:51, 23 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There is no such channel as YTV Japan. Also, the "history" goes back to 1960, while YTV itself signed on in Canada in 1988. The poster, Odin_Swidzinski, created this article solely for his own amusement, and has created similar articles containing 100% fiction, or has altered existing articles to reflect his own vision, like he did to the real YTV article. I originally marked this article as 'Patent Nonsense" because that's how I feel it is. This article was nominated again for Proposal for Deletion, but Odin removed the tags with no reason. The fact that this article is fiction is grounds for deletion. <small>Previous unsigned comment by Asumanga1 &amp; <i>Categorizing debate: <b>M (Media and music)</b>.</i> <a href="../../../z/a/h/User_talk%7EZahakiel_da59.html" title="User talk:Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">◄</span></font></a><a href="../../../z/a/h/User%7EZahakiel_17aa.html" title="User:Zahakiel"><font color="indigo"><span style="text-decoration:none">Zahakiel</span></font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zahakiel_b87e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zahakiel"><font color="#777777"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></font></a> 19:18, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</small></p>

<li>Thanks for running the search. I've reviewed either the text or the abstract of all 85. All except six were press releases. Three of the hits on page 7 were nonsense hits. (Here's an example quote: "the poor man who needs money to iret It at <b>aderant</b> rate".) The other three were general business articles that used this company as a passing example or that interviewed a VP of the company. None in that search pass the independence requirement for sources.

</li>
<li>As the article points out, while <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASF_1672.html" title="BASF">BASF</a>'s name originated as an abbreviation, it is now simply a 4 letter name, consistently spelled in all-caps. The "REALTOR" example is not really applicable, as it refers to non-standard typography of arbitrary words used as product trademarks or for effect, promotional purposes, etc., not a company name.

<li>All of which are acronyms, and therefore <i>should</i> be capitalised. Aderant is a "stylized typography".

<li>Again, read <a href="../../../b/a/s/BASF_1672.html" title="BASF">BASF</a>, while historically an acronym, is now simply the name of the company. If they had decided for some reason to go with, say, <b>MASF</b>, would their article suddenly be forced to <b>Masf</b>? REO happened to be the initials of Ransom E. Olds, but it was never the <b>R</b>ansom <b>E</b> <b>O</b>lds Company, simply REO as a "word". "RAND" is similar. Should THX Ltd. be forced to Thx Ltd? If the ADERANT people came up with some bogus story about how the name was actually an acronym, would that somehow require a change to all-caps? There is <a href="../../../n/o/v/NOVA_Chemicals_436d.html" title="NOVA Chemicals">NOVA Chemicals</a> (and I'm sure others), which seem to have no historical abbreviation roots at all, although it shouldn't matter in any case. I have no problem squashing arbitrary typography of common words or product names sprinkled in an article, but if a company name is commonly capitalized, then that should be reflected, abbreviation or not. I would also note that that things like "<a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>" is also a stylized typography, and Wikipedia goes to some trouble in apologizing for not reproducing it properly. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 05:05, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, without prejudice.

As mentioned, it is mostly a (good-faith) rehash of information available from press releases and the company site. A quick Google doesn't seem to indicate any obvious sources of further information - as a private company there seems to be nothing on revenues, sales, etc. that could serve to indicate size, or anything compellingly indicating that lawfirm accounting software necessarily requires an entry. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 06:54, 22 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I think David Oberst raises a good point that the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> guideline creates a <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">systemic bias</a> against private companies. Public companies generate lots of press coverage due to their public filings and access to media covering the securities industry.

Each time we discuss it, we again realize that can not become Wikipedia's job to solve that particular problem. Encyclopedias are, by definition, tertiary sources. We synopsize what others have already written about. When reputable, independent sources correct their bias and begin to cover private companies in the same depth that they cover public companies, we will be able to follow and synopsize those writings. Until then, we must not compromise our existing standards of independence and verifiability. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>

<li>Companies generate lots of press releases, so they are rightly devalued. But reputable publishers do not reprint every press release they receive, so when a press release is re-published, it adds value. When they are consistently picked up, this is circumstantial evidence of notability. Not sufficient on its own, but better than used bathwater. The point is to use common sense here--the company is obviously not trivial.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hoovers at least guarantees the reliability of the basic information and the names of the prominent users. LTR news items may derive from the company but such professional newsletters do not include disreputable companies, or nobody would read them. Francesco Partners is a leading technology investment group. All that is necessary is the comparative market share report by Law Firm Inc. As it is apparently not avail. directly, perhaps a direct quote can be given. I really do not see what else is wanted. If they had taken a reporter for a newspaper to lunch and he had written an article about them, what would it have added? I might want to see their audited balance sheet if i were investing in them, but our standard is not quite that. We can assume that reputable trade publications do not publish unjustified press releases; I consider them RSs in real life, and I do here. (Now, if there were any actual challenges to the veracity, that might require more of a demonstration.)

<li>Nobody said they were disreputable. What was said was that we apparently lack the independently verifiable sources on which to base a current article. Press releases, even if republished in many newspapers, remain an inherent conflict of interest. Press releases are routinely published without verification in the business sections of newspapers. Articles written by reporters employed by the newspaper, however, are fact-checked and reviewed by other staff before publication and are given greater weight because the newspaper has put their reputation behind the accuracy of the report when they authorize the byline. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small></li>

I think this is a case of anti-commercial bias creating an unrealistic standard for inclusion of company articles. I am by no means an inclusionist who would want to see articles about every sole-proprietorship, but obviously this company's products are well known in it's industry, so the subject is inherently notable, and better references probably exist. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 11:21, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Actually, not. A7 is no <b>assertion</b> of notability. Since various editors (and/or socks) have asserted notability, the discussion now revolves around whether the notability criteria of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> are met or not. <a href="../../../l/e/u/User%7ELeuko_dfa4.html" title="User:Leuko">Leuko</a> 00:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This discussion has not forked because it was never about speedy-deletion criterion A7 - that decision was answered when the speedy-deletion was overturned. This discussion has always been about whether there are sufficient sources to meet the criteria of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> - a significantly higher standard which requires research and discussion and is therefore inappropriate for the speedy-deletion process.<br />
Having read the almevents.com link you provided above, I remain unconvinced. That page contains a passing mention to ADERANT but is not primarily about the company. It confirms only that ADERANT has a blackberry interface. I also challenge the independence of that source since the almevents.com site files it under "advertisers" and every paragraph in that page includes a sales contact. Advertising materials, like press releases, do not constitute independent sources. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:50, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>The nomination only mentions A7, so that is what the discussion should be about. If it was about <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> and whether the references given were good enough, then the page should have been tagged {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} first. If your assertion is correct, then taking a short cut by going from Speedy-A7 directly to AfD without giving editors notice and time to do additional research sets a bad precedent, and is only further evidence that this process is fatally flawed and should be stopped now. I have no procedural objection to closing this without prejudice, tagging it {{<a href="../../../n/o/t/Template%7ENotability_8ef7.html" title="Template:Notability">notability</a>}} and after a reasonable period of time, if an editor still thinks it should be deleted, renominating it making a cogent argument for deletion. <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:01, 25 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Regarding the <i>In Brief</i> article by Karen Jones, I disagree with your analysis. Almvents.com was the sponsor of the trade show, and hosted a reprint of the magazine article because it was about the trade show. ADERANT was an exhibitor, and therefore an advertiser of the trade show. Karen Jones was publisher of <i>In Brief</i> magazine, which covered the legal industry and is independent of both. It only published between 2000-2005 and is now defunct, so any additional content they may have had on ADERANT is no longer available online. I also disagree with your devaluing of the article content because it was not exclusively about the subject. An article covering several related subjects is even more valuable than a feature article primarily about the company because it gives context. Feature articles can be bought and paid for, either by buying advertising, taking a reporter to dinner, or passing money under the table. Because this article discusses both this company, and its major competitor, along with related companies, we can judge relative importance, which is really the basis of notability. Because the author did not list all the exhibitors, and only focused on a hand-full of them, this is tangible secondary source evidence of notability. And it does not just talk about the Blackberry. The money quote is the one added to the article: “Aderant...have developed real time reporting and analysis that is becoming essential to profitability in law firms.” <a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhaluza_b69d.html" title="User:Dhaluza">Dhaluza</a> 10:35, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Article has been created by the subject so is both a vanity article and a conflict of interest. The current text has been lifted from the author's <a href="http://www.bentyree.net/html/about.php" class="external text" title="http://www.bentyree.net/html/about.php" rel="nofollow">webpage</a>. There is an award mentioned but I don't know how meaninful the Wammies are. Otherwise, the article lacks multiple non-trivial sources to allow the information to be verified and to help us establish notability. I'm also concerned that the author commented on the article talk page that it was his own personal bio so there may be issues with <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSER_5ae6.html" title="WP:USER">WP:USER</a>. In the event that the award makes the subject notable (dunno about that myself) than I suggest we stub the article and let it start fresh. Otherwise, the vanity, COI, lack of sources and possible copyvio makes this a problem article. Note that I removed the speedy myself in favour of an AFD. <a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpartaz_f576.html" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpartaz_4c0a.html" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i></sup> 20:51, 21 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Again: This cannot be compared to the Roy C. Strickland article. There is not too much here. The Roy Strickland article is concise, thorough, and very well-written. There is no comparison. Strickland ran for office in two states. He was a pioneer of the LA GOP. No comparison, as I see it. In addition, Strickland has an impressive business career.</p>
<p>If one checks the articles considered for deletion, virtually NONE of them comes anywhere near to the standards in the Roy Strickland article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. You've misunderstood me. I'm not saying the articles are directly comparable. <i>One</i> of the arguments posed by two of the editors in favor of keeping Strickland is that all major party candidates for U.S. Congress should be considered automatically notable, regardless of other notability criteria. If Strickland has other item of notability, then that's applicable in his debate, but it's beside the point that I'm addressing here. The point <i>here</i> is that if that <i>specific</i> argument gains traction and indeed seems to be a consensus among editors, then that sentiment does directly affect this one. I've started a new topic on the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28people%29_07f7.html#Politicians:_Losing_congressional_candidates_automatically_notable.3F" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (people)">talk page of WP:BIO</a> to solicit input there on the issue. <a href="../../../m/w/e/User%7EMwelch_1043.html" title="User:Mwelch">Mwelch</a> 06:14, 22 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Lead of Daily time's article:<i>Iran’s schools are nurturing a siege mentality in children with textbooks showing preparations for war and depicting Israel and the West as the enemy, an Israeli think tank said on Tuesday.</i></li>
<li>Title of Japan today's article:<i>Sudan, Iran vow to defeat "enemies of Islam"</i>(The text isn't available)</li>
<li>Relevant part of BBC's article: <i>Arab countries are trying to forget the existence of a cancerous tumour in the heart of the World of Islam and are closing their eyes to this real enemy of Muslims... The Islamic Republic of Iran and any other country that enjoys sovereignty should do their best to launch an Islamic anti-Zionist movement against Israel.</i></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - this term is potentially so broad as to be virtually meaningless for encyclopedic purposes.

<li><b>Delete</b> - Not a 'special' term deserving of its own article. Someone can be an enemy of America, enemy of Christianity, enemy of whatever... enemy of Islam is just a basic term for an enemy of Islam.

<dd>The issue of blatant advertising...article is very similar to several other articles, such as Worth1000, the only real difference is that it is another photoshop contest site that plays by slightly different rules. Both sites have a rich history and considerable references. The entry ' photoshop contest ' already exist in the wiki and cites references to terms that are attributed to these photoshop contests. There are only three longstanding such sites, fark, Worth1k, and photoshopcontest.</dd>
<dd>These terms include 'chop, chopping' and 'cliche' as pertains to photo manipulation' , two terms from that article that would only refer to Worth1k if not for the existence of photoshopcontest.The term chopping, originated at Photoshopcontest.com as a matter of the sites users showing respect for the Adobe copyright, one that Wiki has ignored by actually keeping in place the entry "photoshopping", and "photoshopped" on entries such as [b3ta], which is in direct violation of Adobe's copyright policy, which can be linked from the 'photoshopping ' article's link section.I personally was a member at Worth1k and Photoshopcontest.com when the term 'chopping' came into existence, and it was by users such as myself that the term came into use and was spread among the photo manipulation community.If for some reason someone feels this is inaccurate, then why does the term 'chop, chopping' already exist in the article 'photoshop contest' without any validation for the use of the word or it's history as pertains to image manipulation?(the only source or reference for those terms can only come from the users of the contest sites themselves)The redirect [Photoshopcontest.com]. the request to have that redirect deleted, by Pious7, would this effect all of Wiki? Is your request actually to have one of the three top photo manipulation contest sites excluded from the entry [photoshop contest]&#160;? The request by Mr. Z-man to have the entry deleted due to COI, I have read the COI, and see in no way how that could possibly apply here. You linked to a forum post by a PSC user that wrote this article, may I ask how that could possibly be relevent to this article?</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - TofutheGreat The COI arguement is questionable. Are you labeling this article as a conflict of interest simply because the originating author is a forum member of the site in question? Or because the author asked other forum members for assistance in refining the article? The article was not started or endorsed by the previous, or current, owner of the website in question. The originating author of the article makes no financial gain from any promotion of the site. If you feel that an article started by someone with an interest in the subject is a COI then you should nominate ALL article for deletion. After all why would someone start an article about something that didn't interest them? If it didn't interest them at any level then they wouldn't have looked into the subject at all in the first place. Also the notion of this article being deleted as an advertisement or spam would demand the deletion of articles on Worth1000, Fark, Photoshop software and any other tangible product or website. It's highly prejudicial to label and delete an article before it's had a chance to be "fleshed out" by contributors. From what I've read PSC began before Worth1000 and is therefore is just as worthy of notation as Worth1000. If you delete this article you must delete the others as a matter of integrity.

<li><b>Comment</b> One problem with using the fact that "small-town newspapers in diverse areas of the country" print examples of this term's use to synthesize the conclusion that it does have widespread use, is that such an inference constitutes <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Can you provide any sources that make this leap for you? Commentators who have mentioned how widespread the term has become? ≈≈<b><a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarolfrog_505f.html" title="User:Carolfrog">Carolfrog</a></b>≈≈<a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarolfrog_b5b5.html" title="User talk:Carolfrog">♦тос♦</a> 05:27, 20 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I don't think you are right in general. The use of the ability to read and count is not OR. Having seen a word used in a number of local newspapers, it immediately follows that it is used throughout the country. Normally, the context makes it clear what the meaning is. It is every bit as valid to see it used twice and conclude it's real, as to see the OED listing it, because they do just the same. To discuss the etymology, one needs a source--a dictionary uses specialists for that, and so that part is OR. Waiting for commentators is like expecting a town newspaper not just to have an article about the town high school, but to specifically discuss how notable it is.</dd>

<li><a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> isn't a vote count; the closing administrator examines the quality of the arguments made for and against the retention of an article. I am not going to attempt to work against my own purpose by trying to flesh out your argument for you simply because you are choosing to be curtly brief. If you feel this article should not be deleted, it's your responsibility to — <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civilly</a>, by the way, and without the condescensing tone you're using in your responses — explain your argument, in the hopes that the closing admin will lend greater weight to the quality of the argument you laid down.<br />
It is my position that given that Wes Mendell appeared in part of one episode and has been referred to only very sporadically — if at all — since, and thus very easily can be defined as a minor character, whereas one would not make the same argument about, say, <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Hayes_03cf.html" title="Harriet Hayes">Harriet Hayes</a>. The notability criteria guideline you link to, and suggest that I should adhere to, states that minor characters "should be merged with short descriptions into a 'List of characters.' This list should reside in the article relating to the work itself, unless it becomes long, in which case a separate article for the list is good practice."<br />
My nomination is based on this very guideline you're linking to, especially given such a character-list article for <i>Studio 60</i> already exists. And the appropriate venue to discuss removing the articles of minor characters and merging their content into a character-list article — the solution advocated by the page you linked to — is <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>, this very venue we're in at the moment. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 20:10, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wrong. What I've written is perfectly civil. I've linked to the pages with the explanations; there was and is no need for me to re-type their contents here. That's why we have such pages. As for your nomination being based upon the guidelines and this being the appropriate venue: This is not "Articles for merging". This is Articles for <i>deletion</i>. Please go and read the guidelines again, clicking on the hyperlink on the word "merging". <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 22:17, 16 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think I can count on one hand the number of times someone accused of being uncivil has said, "You're right, I'm being uncivil," so there's really no use us debating the issue of whether or not you've been civil. Obviously, I disagree, but it's not as black and white as other situations on the wiki. As for the explanations, I've quoted portions of the pages <b>you'</b>ve linked to which support my nomination, and, again, it's really up to you to support your statement with arguments. This venue was once called votes for deletion; it no longer is. If you're content to let your statement stand upon what you've already said, I'm certainly not going to argue, as such an action only assists the deletion of this article. — <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhedonette_62db.html" title="User:Whedonette">Whedonette</a> <small>(<a href="../../../w/h/e/User_talk%7EWhedonette_ff0b.html" title="User talk:Whedonette">ping</a>)</small> 00:21, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
