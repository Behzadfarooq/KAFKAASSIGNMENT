<dd>Dude, you're dead wrong about the page not being helpful. Being a participant in a now-resolved lengthy edit war over getting a definition of capitalism in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article, I know that the creation and editing of the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_capitalism.html" title="Definitions of capitalism">definitions of capitalism</a> article was essential and instrumental. If it's deleted, I predict more unnecessary edit-warring from people who have no clue how capitalism is commonly defined and who are unwilling to go research tons of dictionaries, encyclopedia, and works of thinkers to find out. The article serves to consolidate all of that research in one place to avoid unnecessary battling in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article. The claim that's it's not useful is definitely wrong. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 04:08, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your argument is a false characterization. This article is <i>exactly copying entries</i> from <i>twenty-six</i> dictionaries (and three encyclopaedias), rather than "quoting one paragraph from a dictionary". If you think that copying copyrighted dictionaries and encyclopaedias into WikiMedia project articles is acceptable, then you should discuss this with the WikiMedia Foundation, and on the talk pages of the various copyright policies for all of the WikiMedia projects, which all say otherwise. (You'll have a have a hard time of it. The <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a> is a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issues">foundation issue</a>, and non-negotiable.) Why did you think that Wiktionarians and Wikipedians are specifically pointed in the directions of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Webster" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Webster">Webster 1913</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_18ad.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">Britannica 1911</a>? There's plenty of explanation, of why Wiktionary and Wikipedia must not copy (non-GFDL licenced) copyrighted dictionaries and encyclopaedias, linked to from our copyright policy, a link to which is on this and every page, and no need for us to spoon-feed it to you in this discussion. Please go and read it all. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:53, 2005 May 19 (UTC)

<li>Your reasoningis strange. So what if it's "twenty-six" dictionaries? If it's not a copyright violation to provide a quote from one dictionary, then it's not a violation to quote a definition from a hundred <i>different</i> dictionaries. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:06, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- very useful, in that it allows editors to get beyond unresolvable definitional disputes in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> and <a href="../../../s/o/c/Socialism.html" title="Socialism">socialism</a> article.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- yes, wiktionary is indeed for definitions, but also for pronunciations, etc, as long as it is an aid <b>for use in language</b>. Wiktionary is also for the simple definitions of words. However, these articles address the definitions is the context of the idea or philosophy, which can never be dictionary-like, for it is no longer a <b>guide for language use</b> but rather another <b>body of knowledge</b>. I suggest though, one, to restore the articles but edit it according to the definitions of notable people, rather than dictionaries, and two, to discuss the history of how those definitions began, developed, and evolved. Making the articles like that will resolve all standing issues. --<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumble_Guy_3b88.html" title="User:Humble Guy">Humble Guy</a> 15:37, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- integrate content into capitalism and socialism articles, respectively. If a consensus cannot be reached on how to define socialism and capitalism, simple give <i>multiple</i> definitions in the introductions to their two articles and explain which group uses which definition (although I really can't see why it's so hard to reach a consensus, especially on capitalism - in general, both supporters and opponents of capitalism define it in the same way). -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 21:24, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Not true. I just, a minute ago, had to revert a change in the definition. Somebody tried to assert that it's commonly defined as an economy where "capitalists" dictate prices, etc, rather than the market. This is probably because the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_capitalism.html" title="Definitions of capitalism">definitions of capitalism</a> article is unavailable right now. The definitions article helps prevent useless battles over how capitalism is commonly defined. Apparently a lot of people have no clue. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 21:39, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
