<p>Response from Fredrick Pritchard:</p>
<p>First, I DID remove the previous tag placed on the page, in the belief that the article had been accepted. Apparently <a href="../../../k/o/n/User%7EKon-Tiki001_1156.html" title="User:Kon-Tiki001">User:Kon-Tiki001</a>, had placed the tag, but I replied on his/her talk page (Section: Autobiographies). I presented my arguments and appeal there. He replied, "Your article is probably an exception to the rule, and should in my opinion be allowed to stay." However, I will make efforts to provide sources, and carry out all above requests. Obviously, only someone who knows much about me in each area (composer, performer, theory, and education) would have a reasonably complete basis to act as an editor. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 19:21, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If an editor would have to know you personally in order to properly write this article, then you aren't notable.

But the above-named will probably have information to contribute to the Fredrick Pritchard article, as will others. (Are quotes from the above artists considered acceptable?)

<dd><b>Response to ERcheck</b> This is NOT salting! The above-named artists were first consulted, and were most enthusiastic regarding my contributions, and endorse my article 100%. Why not "wait and see" if these artists remove these edits...or else contact them yourself! (Greg's comments on the Fredrick Pritchard page would help verify this, had you not removed it.) [See Fredrick Pritchard History page.] Furthermore, I have only referenced myself in "Musical Notation" as a PUBLISHED composer. (Perhaps it would help to take an overview of said article, and recognize that this reference helps to "round out" concepts of musical notation.) <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 03:23, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Those who may know we well as a performer may not know of me as a composer or educator. (And so on, in circa.)

There's a certain <i>noblesse oblige</i> and also it is invidious having to argue that another Editor is not notable. So I've amended my vote to Delete. But I'm afraid that even if it weren't an autobiography I would still vote delete because there are no reliable <i>published</i> sources cited for the information in the article, and almost <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Fredrick+Pritchard%22+composer&amp;btnG=Search|no" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Fredrick+Pritchard%22+composer&amp;btnG=Search|no" rel="nofollow">ghits</a>.

True, I edited their pages. However, I have consulted all parties concerned, and they have first approved and supported my moves, and will make it clear. If they support my edits, can this be considered "salting"? (Surely, if a number of these successful artists still return to me for lessons, this must say something!)</p>

<dd>The Wikipedia articles did, but did not cite any sources. I was commenting on the personal websites of the artists, none of which contained any reference to you that I could fine. And yes, direct comments by the artists are not admissable, since there is no way to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> that they are who they claim to be. - <a href="../../../r/a/i/User%7ERainwarrior_5180.html" title="User:Rainwarrior">Rainwarrior</a> 03:28, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>To <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">User:NBeale</a>: Thank you for changing "Strong Delete" to "Delete". Is another editor not notable if Wikipedia contains an article about him/her? Please refer to the article's talk page for "published sources", and also please check the References I have provided. (I could add more, but should the page be smothered with references?) Again, I regard this issue as not primarily about me, but about Wikipedia policies, and their interpretation. Whether or not the article is kept is less important to me than the interpretation of Wiki policies. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 01:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>To <a href="../../../e/r/c/User%7EERcheck_559a.html" title="User:ERcheck">User:ERcheck</a>: And why shouldn't I reference myself regarding the <a href="../../../m/u/s/Musical_Notation_08e3.html" title="Musical Notation">Musical Notation</a> article? I spent many hours researching the subject, and contributing to the page. The quote (to which I refer) is published and verifiable. Even if my contributions were not founded (contradictory to the page history's evidence), what on earth does it have to do with THIS article? Shall we then question I am a devoted and honest editor, and hope to remain so. I have contributed untold hours to the advancement of Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I can hardly be accused of "salting" when all such edits were done with the approval and support of the subjects of the articles in question. I don't want to argue this case, but please, let's play fair! <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 01:16, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Whether the Fredrick Pritchard article is KEPT or DELETED, (a matter which doesn't matter a great deal to me); I am just bursting with such remarkable attention! I think its time for a little humour here! Whatever your stand, let's all take a moment to laugh at the entire issue, which, really, is of less importance to the world than we may believe! Not one of us (editor, adminstrator, or the like) can hardly become so absorbed in this issue that it effects our daily lives! Please, everyone, PRO or CON, take some time to put it in perpsective, and LAUGH!!! Wikipidia policies are more legitimately destined to scrutiny, than I am! <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProf.rick_6928.html" title="User:Prof.rick">Prof.rick</a> 06:46, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
