<p>I request opinions on this article, which since its creation has been a magnet for edit-warring (with WP:3RR and other problems) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Dbachmann_reported_by_User:Rayfield_.28Result:.29" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Dbachmann_reported_by_User:Rayfield_.28Result:.29" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> and of a lot of uncivility and disputes on the talkpage.</p>
<p>About one half to two thirds of this article can already be found in the <a href="../../../o/u/t/Out_of_India_Theory_6239.html" title="Out of India Theory">Out of India Theory</a> and in the <a href="../../../a/r/y/Aryan_Invasion_Theory_%28history_and_controversies%29_49df.html" title="Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)">Aryan Invasion Theory (history and controversies)</a> articles. The remaining part of the article could be safely merged as a section into the OIT, AIT and Hindu nationalism articles. Most of it can easily find place in OIT, and the rest in the other two articles.</p>
<p>Here we have an article that claims to be about the "ideological position" that may manifest itself as "Out of India Theory", and that seems to have been created to paint views such as the "criticism of Aryan migration theories" as some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112042069" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=112042069" rel="nofollow">Hindu nazism</a>. The article has also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory#Neutrality" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory#Neutrality" rel="nofollow">neutrality issues</a>.</p>
<p>It does not need a separate article. Wikipedia has articles on theories like <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_hypothesis.html" title="Armenian hypothesis">Armenian hypothesis</a>, <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paleolithic_Continuity_Theory_3136.html" title="Paleolithic Continuity Theory">Paleolithic Continuity Theory</a> and many other theories, but Wikipedia has not articles only on the psychological motives or ""ideological position" for these theories. Such claims belong in the article of the theory, not in a separate article.</p>
<p>I suggest that this article be merged as a section into the mentioned articles, or that at least a suitable title for this article is found. Such a title could be <a href="../../../i/d/e/Ideological_positions_in_the_Indo-Aryan_migration_debate_4a5c.html" title="Ideological positions in the Indo-Aryan migration debate">Ideological positions in the Indo-Aryan migration debate</a> or maybe Out of India Theory (Ideological positions). --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 01:47, 3 March 2007 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 01:53, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>it is not, as you can read up in the article. "OIT" is shoddy scholarship, while "Indigenous Aryans" is nationalist propaganda. The two overlap, of course. Bakaman's google search is spurious of course (surprise, surprise), since it includes the "theory" part which we want to get rid of by a {{<a href="../../../m/o/v/Template%7EMove_e1dc.html" title="Template:Move">move</a>}} anyway. (as you can extrapolate from Bakaman's 'dabcruft' neologism, this isn't even about any topical issue for him anymore, he just follows me around wikipedia and tries to disrupt things in various small ways). "Indigenous Aryan position" is just a term for what <i>proponents</i> (or should we say, <i>disseminators</i>) prefer to call things like "exciting new emerging evidence found by eminent professors" (and permutations, ad nauseam), which is hardly preferable as an article title. <a href="../../../d/b/a/User%7EDbachmann_498c.html" title="User:Dbachmann">dab</a> <small><a href="../../../d/b/a/User_talk%7EDbachmann_4b96.html" title="User talk:Dbachmann">(𒁳)</a></small> 16:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Win has not voted on this AFD. I am also not responsible for the personal attacks that the involved editors exchange with each other on the IAT and other articles. If this article gets merged, I am resposible that there will be one page less where they can exchange this. The allegations of vote-stacking surrounding this AFD are interesting, care to explain this? I'm not involved in any way with the RFC on Dbachmann, which was not started by me. My decision to put this article up for discussion came after the AFD for the Nicholas Kazanas article which made me again for a short time active on wikipedia, where I began a discussion on the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Talk%7EIndigenous_Aryan_Theory_3c2d.html" title="Talk:Indigenous Aryan Theory">Talk:Indigenous_Aryan_Theory</a>, which you can read there. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 20:17, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. The IAT == OIT reduction is absurd. Generally, writers in the IAT rubric <i>avoid</i> trying to make definitive statements about OIT (and even if they do, the theorising usually ends at the Hindu Kush), or dismiss linguistics altogether. Bryant's book as a source is unfortunate, because as anyone familiar with the popular literature knows, the indigenousness of the Aryans has to do with (a) the indigenousness of Hinduism in <i>all</i> its antecedents and, thus since the 1920s, (b) the relation between the Vedas and the IVC. Everything else is secondary. Bryant does not cover these aspects in any particular depth. But they are the core of the "position", and rife with fringecruft. The point of this article in WP is to offer a home for the kookery, rather than have the nonsense vitiate other subjects. There really is no "debate". It's all jingoistic pseudo-historiography. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 20:12, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If Bryants book as a source is unfortunate, this means that you are also somehow confused over the article title? I admit I am still confused over the article title, and its relation to Bryant's use of the term (in my opinion Bryant uses it as a synonim for OIT). Which authors on history then advocate IAT as opposed to OIT? The creator of the article has defined the article this way: It is about the ideological position that may manifest itself as OIT, among a couple of other positions. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=112034563&amp;oldid=112021277" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;diff=112034563&amp;oldid=112021277" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> And looking at the content, I see no reason why it cannot be merged to OIT, AIT and Hindu nationlism. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 20:27, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Personally, I think "Indigenous Aryanism" might have been better, or even "'Indigenous Aryan' Thesis" (note the two levels of quotes). And I disagree with your reading of Bryant. It's fairer to say that Bryant would <i>like</i> to equate the two (mainly because he considers linguistics important), but this confuses the <i>theoretical</i> implications of mainstream linguistics with the <i>historiographic</i> concerns of the IA "school". <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 20:43, 3 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Even if it were correct that Bryant's term is about the same thing that the article is about (which I doubt), the term is not in current use outside the work of Bryant. Bryant is notable, but not every term coined or used by him must automatically be so. The term IAT was already used by H. V. Sreenivasa Murthy in 1963 in A History of Ancient India. --<a href="../../../r/a/y/User%7ERayfield_f2e4.html" title="User:Rayfield">RF</a> 11:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please stop playing word games. No one has to wait for someone to <i>coin</i> a term like "Indigenous Aryan(ism)" for the subject to remain in limbo otherwise. Conjoining "indigenous" and "Aryan" in a phrase has been around for a long time, earlier than 1963 for sure. (Try Vol I (1951) of Majumdar's <i>History and Culture of the Indian People</i>, Appendix to Chapter X.) If you want a subject title like "Indigenousness of Aryans to the Indian Subcontinent", say so, instead of quibbling. Thanks. <a href="../../../r/u/d/User%7ERudrasharman_3689.html" title="User:Rudrasharman">rudra</a> 18:27, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It is essential to the neutrality of WP that articles about historical theories espoused by different political groups be maintained equitably. That such a theory is under attack as representing the view of only a nationalist group, is all the more reason to support it. The article seems reasonably fair and adequately referenced. That this is not the mainstream theory held on a global basis is made clear. Any effort at suppression of any POV by technical arguments, or by detailed discussion of the weakness of prima fascia RSs, or by merging in such a way as to diminish the influence or the number of articles of the minority group in such matters is to be guarded against by resolving doubts by keeping the article. (And personally, I skip over discussions of the editors involved; I think most uninvolved people here would do so also, and so I do not see the purpose of such attacks.) <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:57, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>if you would please <i>read</i> the article, you will note that this is not the case. "out of India" can be proposed without "indigenous Aryans" ideology (Schlegel; Elst at least <i>claims</i> to not follow this ideology. Funny tough he should write a dissertation on Hindutva (sympathetic), and then, for completely unrelated reasons, come up with a "out of India" suggestion), <i>and</i> "indigenous Aryans" can be proposed without any sort of "out of India" concepts (such as, by ideologues who ignore linguistics or reject Indo-European as a colonialist conspiracy).

The article only has some sources NOW since I kept pushing to include sources (look at the previous version to see how many citation you can find [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;oldid=108051893" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Indigenous_Aryan_Theory&amp;oldid=108051893" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]). Dab is STILL misquoting the sources in the article (items ref in (3) and (7)). He refuses to provide correct citation for controversial statements in the article or to remove the statements. I have been working with a third party mediator to tackle one issue at a time. Dab refuses to participate in the mediation effort. The question is do we need 2 article on Wikipedia to discuss same content? AIT is long established article for same content that is better referenced than this article and includes efforts of lot more than 1 editor.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 14:15, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I refer to user Rayfield, or RF as the User signs. I correct my above statement-RF had "particpated" in a rfc and taken a stance opposed to dab.- <a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 15:05, 6 March 2007 (UTC)- Also in light with the request for deletion, it is misplaced as in the same request a suggestion to "merge" is also made, merge has a seperate template than afd, and if merge was the objective than the appropriate tags and discussion should have been placed and made. If the content can be added to the other article, then deletion / redirection suggestions can be looked at, but I think that should precede a request for deletion.<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHaphar_4edd.html" title="User:Haphar">Haphar</a> 15:14, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just to clarify Rayfield (RF) has neither "certified" or "endorsed" the RfC. On talk page of RfC he has provided some advice (which any fair person would have difficulty disagreeing with) to Dab [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Dbachmann&amp;diff=112660032&amp;oldid=112655348" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Dbachmann&amp;diff=112660032&amp;oldid=112655348" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>]. It would definately make it easy to work with Dab if he followed WP:CIVIL policy. I made effort over 4 months to resolve this, how long can I keep clapping with one hand. I am still having difficulty understanding how enforcing WP:ATT on all editors evenly is not the best solution to this controversial problem. Don't allow anyone's POV.<a href="../../../s/b/h/User%7ESbhushan_3b43.html" title="User:Sbhushan">Sbhushan</a> 15:20, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>. "Indigenous Aryanism" gets enough Google results to be notable on its own, and it looks like there are good sources for describing Indigenous Aryanism as an ideological position. However, it may be more useful to have this material in the same article as the Out of India stuff, as that might give the reader a better idea of the role these theories play in contemporary Indian politics and culture, as well as international Vedic scholarship. I have to say I'm disturbed by the tone of this discussion, the AfD seems like it's about attacking a particular author rather than a sincere discussion of the content of the article. <a href="../../../a/k/h/User%7EAkhilleus_723e.html" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="../../../a/k/h/User_talk%7EAkhilleus_f0d5.html" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 16:10, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
