<li><b>Delete</b>. I was going to vote keep until I realized that this was a misleadingly-titled article about an indivdual chapter of the sorority rather than an article about the sorority itself. If someone wants to rewrite this as an article about the actual sorority, I wouldn't be opposed to keeping it, but, until then, I support deletion in that articles kept on the grounds that they should be rewritten never seem to actually get rewritten. If someone wants to start an actual article about the sorority itself later, I have no problem with that. As mentioned above, this article is also extremely NPOV. BTW, are there really sororities where members are only known by numbers, rather than their names (as this article asserts)? <a href="../../../e/r/g/User%7EErgot_f9f1.html" title="User:Ergot">ergot</a> 13:51, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>cock rock</b> slang, rock music, esp. heavy metal, characterized by the ostentatious male sexuality of its lyrics and performance; so <b>cock rocker</b>.
 
<b>1971 M. SAUNDERS</b> in <i>Creem</i> May 74/2 As much as I hate heavy music—*cock rock, macho rock, or whatever the current name for it is—I have to
admit to having every Blue Cheer album ever made. <b>2003</b> <i>Kitchen Sink Winter</i> 19/1 [Led Zeppelin] truly were the creators of ‘cock rock’, in the
hyper-masculine sexuality of their sound, their songs and in the presentation of their actual packages, which were often practically visible
through their tight-ass bell bottoms. <b>1977</b> <i>Creem</i> July 50/3 I can't help but wonder if part of their popularity is due to the fact that they're
the last of an era of *cock rockers who play dirty and, if you'll excuse the expression, ‘chauvinistic’ rock 'n' roll. <b>2002</b> <i>Independent on Sunday</i>
10 Feb. 3/1 It's big enough to mean that..student bands don't play there and small enough to deter cock-rockers on the enormo-barn circuit.

<dd>Thanks for the translation. I have been researching a bit, and I have found an extensive thesis on medieval monster (in Italian) <a href="http://www.sslmit.units.it/crevatin/franco_crevatin_homepage.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.sslmit.units.it/crevatin/franco_crevatin_homepage.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which cites the blemmyes (blemmii) while discussing about <a href="../../../a/c/e/Acephali.html" title="Acephali">acephali</a>. The english definition only marginally discusses the monsters, and the Italian definition is absent. Maybe merging the blemmyes with other acephali monsters could be a solution. The thesis cites that acephali are first cited by Erodotus. Apparently, Plinius associated a Lybian legend to an actual nomadic population. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikelima_4278.html" title="User:Mikelima">Mikelima</a> 16:45, 4 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> A Google search is not a fair indicator because the character from the Smurfs has thousands of links. This causes links from the band to appear less prominently than they would if the band had a less ambiguous name. The criteria for notability is ambiguous; the band is well-known in Florida, but perhaps not established in other regions. I have added a couple of links to articles about the band, both from established Orlando newspapers. A brief entry seems commensurate with this band's modest level of notoriety. Upon reflection, I have removed the line about the lead singer's "stage presence" to keeps things more NPOV.(Disclosure: I contributed the article. I am not actually in the band nor friends with any of the band members.) Mister Tog 02:31, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I added a link to a 1999 article about the Orlando Music Awards, where the band won the "Hard Rock" category. The band also received a positive review in a 2002 edition of <a href="http://www.metaledgemag.com" class="external text" title="http://www.metaledgemag.com" rel="nofollow">Metal Edge</a> magazine.

<li><b>Keep</b>, as a contributer. Firstly, I have no problem in removing the first section of the article. It's unencyclopeadic, and, frankly, rather poorly written. My own contributions, which interestingly, themselves have not been questioned, are short, all sourced, and all are pertinent to the subject matter of the article. <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlibabs_bdec.html" title="User:Alibabs">Alibabs</a> has alleged that my edits are partisan and sectarian. When asked to provide some sort of evidence to back up these statements, none has been given, other than that my edits make the article allegedly unbalanced. I did invite <a href="../../../a/l/i/User%7EAlibabs_bdec.html" title="User:Alibabs">Alibabs</a> to make amendments to the article to rectify what they perceived to be unbalanced editing, but they have chosen to list it here instead. The fact that the nominee wants to split this article over both the Celtic and Rangers articles would maybe indicate that it is not as unbalanced as originally stated. No explanation as to how my edits allegedly make the article unbalanced have been given, therefore I vote to keep. Hell, it doesn't even qualify for deletion using the criteria set out in WP:DEL --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadTim_6ed4.html" title="User:TheMadTim">TheMadTim</a> 01:49, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

This whole section reads as a discussion on what is and is not considered sectarian, and as such is Original Research. The other question I have for this user is in what way is this historical as every article seems to be under 5 years old? It also seems that you are using Wikipedia as a <a href="../../../s/o/a/Soapbox.html" title="Soapbox">soapbox</a>, as every source seems to be critical of Rangers and there are none which are critical of any other Scottish teams, I am not knowledgable about the subject but the article does not appear to have a NPOV, your incessant pestering of every contribution to this discussion is also quite strange.

<dd>Assuming that Big Jock Knew will not take me replying to his questions as 'incessant pestering' (I assume that if you are asking questions you must want replies?) then I shall proceed. You have said that your 'other question' (I'm not sure quite what the first one was. Are you asking me which section of the article is mine, or are you enquiring about some content?) is what way is this historical? The first bit of it, which deals with history, is not my contribution, and in this version at least, not something which I am personally inclined to provide sources for. Given that I only found the page 12 hours ago, I'm not quite sure what sort of contribution you expect in that timescale, and given that it's currently 5 AM where I am, I'd actually be inclined to think that I had done rather a good job in improving a rather shabby article. Perhaps you think I should have this article ready for listing on the main page a few hours after first seeing it? It seems to you that I 'seem' to be doing a lot of things. I'll thank you to keep your argument based around the contributions I have made, and not to formulate and foster opinion as to any suspected ulterior motives without very good reason. <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>&#160;?

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. The article as it stands is worse than useless, and clearly a single user's hobbyhorse currently. But some information about this would be notable.

And not to <a href="../../../r/a/n/Rangers.html" title="Rangers">Rangers</a>, Celtic, or Hearts or Hibs for that matter - too general. But I think some information on the historical associations of particular clubs with particular sects/ethnicities is definitely notable. If nothing else, it would have made all the references in <a href="../../../i/a/n/Ian_Rankin_1081.html" title="Ian Rankin">Ian Rankin</a>'s last but one a bit clearer.

<li>To clarify for anyone that needs it: This article is original research because it comes to conclusions that aren't supported by the external links.

It has the potential to be a fascinating article if it's done properly, which hopefully it will, when existing or additional editors get to grips with it. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 05:50, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as original research. If I wrote an article entitled, say, The Great Pyramid of Giza was built by time-traveling Furbies, I could cite a dozen books telling where the Pyramid is and what it is made of. I could provide a score of webpages about <a href="../../../f/u/r/Furby.html" title="Furby">Furby</a> anatomy, and I could cite something by <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stephen_Hawking_e11c.html" title="Stephen Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> to show that at least a few physicists think time travel may be possible.

<li><b>Keep:</b> this article, while badly-written, has merit. It certainly does not constitute Original Research: unlike The Great Pyramid of Giza was built by time-travelling Furbies, sectarianism in Scottish football is a well-documented and dangerous phenomenon which has damaged many people in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You misused the test. Zoe's search said "start=180" but came up with nothing past 129. Your test said "start=130" and came up with 130-140, but there are plenty more. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:03, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No so. Try doing Zoe's test, then simply type "Microsoft" over top the text. In both cases the number of "non-similiar" results was well under 200 (provided quotation marks are used). In both cases the actual number of "raw" results was well in excess of the number that Google will allow you to display. The purpose of my point, is that the test fails to reflect the true number of "unique" results. Yes, of course, I know there are more results for Microsoft, then that small number. My point was to show the flaw of the test given by Zoe. No matter how you do the test, Google will never display more then a thousand results. The "non-similiar results" (what Zoe called "unique") is a subset of the first thousand results. For searches with over a thousand "raw" hits, this figure is wortheless. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:19, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Added: Feel free to re-do the test from scratch. Go to Google. Search for "Microsoft" (be sure to include quotes). Now, proceed to the very last page of results. When you get there, you'll see you get the same figure I did. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 22:22, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I did just as you said and got <i><b>far</b></i> more hits than you claim you got.

<dd>How many "unique" hits did you get for "Microsoft"? As we know, they likley have over a billion pages in Google. However, the "unique" figure (which is what you're using) is guarenteed to be under one thousand. My point is that this figure grossly under-represents what's actually out there. Also, if my comments don't address notability, then how did your original comments about google do so? --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 00:36, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Based on information right from this very link, bygames and trickery.net are 2 totally unrelated entities. Sure, trickery.net was founded as a direct result of bygames' closure, but since "<i>bygames, the Internet Gaming Service Provider (GSP) has today closed its doors</i>", how can it be currently closed (which implies it is non-functioning) and at the same time be operating as trickery.net? <a href="../../../k/i/m/User_talk%7EKimchi.sg_9ead.html" title="User talk:Kimchi.sg">Kimchi</a>.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Kimchi.sg&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">sg</a> 16:39, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I would ask regular Wikipedians to hold fire until some of the more notable members of the Wireplay/ByGames/Trickery community have had a chance to update and expand upon the entry, trickery is indeed only a single community but its formation and community history is a tale of the Dot Com era and the rise and fall of notable GSP's, please do not consider the entry upon the merits of trickery.net alone but on the whole tale (yet to be represented) of its formation and history..

<li><b>Keep</b> every single one of you has mentioned that wikipedia is not a dictionary, and that continues to be true for Afro-denial. It only explains two versions of what the term refers to. I defy you to say that Wikipedia does not include articles that list definitions of words as a single entry. For instance, a search of the word "<a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrance.html" title="Entrance">entrance</a>" on wikipedia listed 5 different <i>definitions</i> of the word rather than what I expected; a thorough explanation of different types of entrances (this same feat of wikipedia <i>defining</i> words can be repeated with the word "pop". As to the intent of Urban Dictionary, if it is truly meant ot humorous, perhaps Tobyk777 would like to explain why it is included <i>standard</i> under quick searches (along with Wikipedia, Google, and Dictionary.com) in the Mozilla Firefox bookmarks.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Something else on Wikipedia does it, therefore, it's ok for this to do so as well" isn't a valid argument for inclusion. Rather, it's an argument to improve those other pages. Further, regardless of the intent of Urban Dictionary (by the by, inclusion in Firefox isn't relevant (not that it seems to be included in the version I'm using)) it's in some form, as the name implies, a dictionary. The article itself is little more than a dicdef, and citing a dictionary as a source for a dictionary style entry isn't appropriate (as I understand it). Further, it's a non notable neologism (as the nominator said). It was used once, in a recent Boondocks. Maybe if the word catches on down the line, it will be worth having. Further, the external link to "Afro-Denial" has nothing to do with the article's sujbect matter, and in fact only has that hyphenated word in common (and at that, only once within the whole article linked to). <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarquis_ead0.html" title="User:Darquis">Darquis</a> 21:42, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Rebuttal</b> As to whether lead by example is or is not valid: If this article is subsequently deleted on the basis that it is the same as others, then I expect those articles to be nominated for deletion as well, on the basis that those articles break the same lines of conformity as Afro-denial allegedly does. Perhaps I haven't read my wikiguides thoroughly enough, but it seems to me that someone citing webster's in an article would probably be accepted, people (specifically, the voters for Deletion) doubt the validity of Urban Dictionary on the basis that their definitions come from the same place our articles do: ourselves. As to whether or not Afro-denial is used enough, I've seen it used in a number of news articles citing it in use as a symbol of African-American attempts to conform to white society pressures (a search of google should make that apparent). The second link and through that, the second explanation of the term, is important not for the number of times that the word "Afro-denial" is used throughout (a shallow way to prove the invalidity of something, I might add), but important because in the Pallo Jordan's speech, he uses Afro-denial as the denial of things African, of African importance. You say Firefox inclusion isn't important, but as a multinational corporation with a very popular usage, it is able to reach a number of people, lending credibility to things it supports (for instance: Wikipedia). To get Deny Afro-Denial is to become Hypocrites in effect, and this you must not do! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadjester_8bef.html" title="User:TheMadjester">TheMadjester</a>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You are treating this as if this is a debate on the "validity" or value of the term. It is not. It is about whether it is notable. It does not appear so, as it does not seem to be a commonly used term (I get a total of 159 hits on google), and therefore fails the Wikipedia policy on <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologisms</a>. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 22:34, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> No I am treating this as a debate on the validity of the accusation of whether or not it is notable for wikipedia. I am saying it is. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMadjester_8bef.html" title="User:TheMadjester">TheMadjester</a>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I think the following lines from the policy are relevant: (1) <i><b>Protologisms</b> are neologisms that have not yet caught on widely.</i> (2) <i>Articles on protologisms are almost always deleted as these articles are often created in an attempt to use Wikipedia to increase usage of the term.</i> If the word were in widespread use, this would be a different discussion, but it isn't. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 03:14, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I never said this page was a case of advertisement, I said it was a case of self-promotion. Further, I've already explained why I think the other sources you've cited aren't significant to the discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b> This building is listed and linked on the on KSU's Wiki page just like all the other buildings in the campus. The College of Architecture is contained inside the greater University just like Arts and Sciences and Enginering, etc... Seaton Court (part of Seaton Hall) is also one of the oldest buildings on campus so how can it be a non-notable building? KSU is one of the 2 largest colleges in Kansas, along with KU, so the University would also be notable. User:Googletree
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - clearly the university is notable. However, just because something is contained on a different Wiki does not mean it belongs here. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 04:27, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> Yes, but just because those pages have their own articles here on Wiki isn't a justification for this one to have it's own as well.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Several other buildings of the Kansas State University have articles. I don't know if there's a precedent for keeping all college buildings, or only the most notable ones (i.e. those on the National Register of Historic Places or those of particular importance to the university). In the absence of any real strong reason to delete it, though, I don't think it's hurting anything. --<a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_Esperanza_be6e.html" title="User:Elkman/Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a><a href="../../../e/l/k/User%7EElkman_f6c6.html" title="User:Elkman">lkman</a> - <sup><a href="../../../e/l/k/User_talk%7EElkman_bf81.html" title="User talk:Elkman">(talk)</a></sup> 05:06, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> A quick Google search of Seaton Hall puts the top 2 results as sites that show pictures or talk about this building and its uses. (discounting the Seton Hall University which is an alternate spelling) User:Googletree 05:25, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Response</b> That's hardly valid logic. If you google my Wiki user name, I show up 3 times in the top 10 results. My own ego aside, that doesn't make <b>me</b> notable. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarquis_ead0.html" title="User:Darquis">Darquis</a> 08:00, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article fails to state how this building is special. ("<i>In 1999 the East wing underwent major renovations... Ebert Mayo Design Group was responsible for the plans.

<p>the content on this page has been put back into the Hunter x Hunter main article. The main article previously had nothing on the plot, i was going to just write a brief plot summary for the main article. However, the plot summary on this page was brief enough after the redundant character-information bits where removed (hxh now has a separate page for characters). Since all the information on this page is now a part of the hxh main page, this page is redundant. Unless someone decides to write a much more detiled plot summary, i can't see any reason why we need to keep a separate story arcs page for hxh. <a href="../../../y/a/k/User%7EYaksha_03f0.html" title="User:Yaksha">Yaksha</a> 04:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Hold</b>. A couple of weeks ago I noticed while going through a couple of articles on wartime cricketers that someone had just converted all the mentions of particular squadrons to links. Now it may be the case that someone is getting set for a mammoth attempt at reorganising the RAF section of WP, but I dont really want to snoop around and try and figure that out from footprints right now.

<li><b>Comment</b> Is there any specific wiki policy or project that says that schools themselves are automatically notable? I cannot dispute this is a well written article, but I fail to see any notability, outside "it's a school" (outside the accomplishments of one student, not nearly enough to establish the school in that manner either).

<li><b>Keep</b>. Another round of this long school debate. (Cheer up, it was worse before). Although an article on every school would just about double the number of articles we have, and creating such articles is not a priority for me, the precedent on elementary schools is to keep them if the article is reasonable, with the option of merging if it's a stub. Deleted school articles are usually due to utter lack of content (e.g. "A very nice school"), being an attack page, or unverifiable. For some reason, even articles which consist of nothing more than the <i>address and telephone number</i> are being kept. With that clear precedent in mind here, I see no reason to be inconsistent with this one. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:50, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I'm not big on deleting articles, but I see no merit in having one that's purely <b>speculation</b> about a possible military rank in a fictional universe. If the rank were actually used in Star Wars (either the movies themselves, or an <a href="../../../e/x/p/Expanded_Universe_%28Star_Wars%29_acd4.html" title="Expanded Universe (Star Wars)">Expanded Universe</a> source), it would merit mentioning (though probably not as a separate article). But that's not the case, as far as I can tell. Contrary to what the article claims, I'm unaware of this alleged rank ever coming up in a Star Wars novel or comic book, and I've read quite a lot of them. <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERedxiv_dabe.html" title="User:Redxiv">Redxiv</a> 06:01, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong delete</b>. Calling this a "mini series" seems to be a bit pretentious as it looks to be an investigative report from a local news station aired 13 years ago.

If this had greater impact - released on video, converted into a book, etc. - then maybe there would be something worth salvaging.

<li><b>Comment</b> one argument to keep is that this investigative news series is relevant to 3 articles, <a href="../../../h/y/l/Hyles-Anderson_College_8c2f.html" title="Hyles-Anderson College">Hyles-Anderson College</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Hyles_12fe.html" title="Jack Hyles">Jack Hyles</a> and <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Baptist_Church_of_Hammond_9491.html" title="First Baptist Church of Hammond">First Baptist Church of Hammond</a>, so it would have to be merged in 3 places. However, I get the feeling that this article was created to try and counter certain editors who have been wikilawyering that since the story only seems to exist as a series of mp3 files on a private web site, that it is not a reliable source for those articles. My general feeling is to delete, and reference the broadcasts in the footnotes to those articles where it is relevant. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 15:49, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. (THis is a difficult call. Metamagician3000 argues that an AfD should not be overturned even if a 'wrong' result. Whilst that is an interesting proposal, it is not policy - and I'd view it is a far too fixed notion of process. Content considerations are always greater than procedural niceties. Further, the fist afd was not exactly exhausive in its consideration. When that argument is rejected, I see only one vote that disputes the deletion nomination, so I call a consensus to delete. -<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><small><sup>ask?</sup></small></a> 15:51, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Second nomination for deletion. Was previously AFD'd and voted for keeping. While the verifiability of her existence is not in question, the notability of such a person is. The article makes the claim that "Felicia" was indirectly responsible for then-Marvel publisher Bill Jemas' removal. That in itself is not verifiable, and without it, "Felicia" loses all notability. She was not a journalistic source. She was an informant for Rich Johnston, who claims for himself the label of rumour-monger, who warns his readers never to take his column at face value, meaning the information he publishes is not reliable (even when it turns out to be true). "Felicia"'s impact in the practices of Marvel Comics was negligible at best. I consider this article to be nothing more than a piece of fancruft. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../p/c/1/User%7EPc13_2b27.html" title="User:Pc13">Pc13</a> 10:21, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - nothing has changed to justify overturning the previous AfD outcome even if it was "wrong" in some sense.

<p>This is completely subjective. Who's to say you need X sources mentioning your race and then you're notable for it? It's a completely unworkable and unhelpful article. We should create a new article, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_in_hip_hop.html" title="Race in hip hop">Race in hip hop</a>, that goes in depth and discusses the issues, rather than a permenantly misinformative article that claims to be objective fact, supplying a bulleted list of whos notable. By the way, it used to be called List of white rappers, but it was agreed that not every white rapper is notable by default. In sweden or the netherlands, for example, being a white rapper is the norm for hip hop. Basically, the title "list of white rappers" would be biased towards a view of conflict over racial identity in the american hip hop scene, and last time I checked we're a <i>world</i> encyclopedia. <a href="../../../u/r/t/User%7EUrthogie_886b.html" title="User:Urthogie">Urthogie</a> 12:32, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Um I think it should be noted this was called "list of white rappers" until Urthogie moved it to its current title. I can't really understand why one would move an article to a different title and then nominate for deletion based on a criticism of that title. Anyway this information should be kept in some form, readers should be able to find people like Eminem, the Beastie Boys and Vanilla Ice listed in one place. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 13:20, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. If the list clearly explained rules for inclusion, and had cites to back each name up, I might have considered a keep. Currently, it's just a list of rappers who's skin color is white. That narrow fact, while verifiable, is also trivial.

<li>Since you asked, ESPN has an Alexa rank of 23, Yahoo has an Alexa rank of... 1. The Alexa rank of NEARsports is 2.4 <b>million</b>, meaning Yahoo is approximately 2.4 <b>million</b> times more popular than NEARsports. That makes it a little silly to compare the two directly. Since I answered your question, perhaps you could answer a question of mine: I'd like to know where in Wikipedia policy it says that "<i>If you have an entry on Wikipedia for ANY other company on the planet, then you have to allow this one to stay.</i>" That's a new one to me. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:53, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>You and I must have different definitions of "prominently". What I see on your site is a sea of ads. Where are these awards? When you say "our articles" do you mean articles that you wrote, or content from the website? Can you document specific examples? Simply saying your content has been picked up is not sufficient.

<ul>
<li>The awards are located on the main page of the site, directly below the link to the football photos. 95% of ALL stories published on NEARsports.com have been picked up by every newspaper and website on that list in the entry. It can be verified if you search the archives of their websites, or go to a library in their repective towns and look them up on microfilm.--<a href="../../../d/g/r/User%7EDgrim85_d7a7.html" title="User:Dgrim85">Dgrim85</a> 18:56, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>Perhaps they are, but the American Association of Webmasters Award <b>is not</b>. Why have "guidelines" if you aren't going to adhere to them?? The bottom line is, the entry we submitted qualifies to be on Wikipedia according to its own guidelines. I can't be blamed if that fact hurts the feelings of some of the people here.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. OK, let's take the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria one by one</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>"The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself."
<ul>
<li>This refers to multiple non-trivial publications <b>about</b> the content. That is, articles about NEARsports, not articles that NEARsports has contributed to publications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The website or content has won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or organisation.
<ul>
<li>Your strongest argument seems to be he AWWM award, so... from the AAWM site: "The website submitted to us must have a nice clean design and at least 10 pages of quality information (excluding award pages, contact pages, feedback forms and guestbook's). The site must not have any visible error messages. Approximately 40 to 50 percent of applicants win an award from our program." Not exactly a competitve award. 10 pages of quality info and no visible error messages is a pretty low bar, one that most weblogs in the world could meet, and, without meaning to be insulting, if your site is an example of their idea of good clean design, it doesn't inspire confidence in the award.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The content is distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster."
<ul>
<li>Hmm. Well-known is hard to judge definitively, of course, but the Alexa argument is very much not in your favor; as for "independent of the creators," however, there is a claim (not documented) that the content is distributed by a few newspapers. I'm not sure how to interpret this bit, to be honest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>"The article itself <b>must</b> provide proof that its subject meets one of these criteria via inlined links or a "Reference" or "External link" section."
<ul>
<li>I just don't see such proof in the article. Conclusion: your argument that you have "proven" anything is weak, and your hectoring tone is unlikely to win you any friends here. What you seem not to understand is that no one here is "against" you or your site, and no one wishes you or it ill; it's just that your site is <b>not notable</b> by the standards of Wikipedia. <b><span style="color: #f33">·<a href="../../../r/o/d/User_talk%7ERodii_6c72.html" title="User talk:Rodii"><span style="color: #669">&#160;rodii&#160;</span></a>·</span></b> 00:44, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Page has been speedily deleted twice; however, the talk page argues that these were erroneous, and makes some very forceful claims of notability. As such, I think it merits the full AfD treatment - who knows, perhaps it's keepworthy.

<li><b>Strong delete</b> or <b>Speedy</b> again under A7. The talk page says that they are a successful high-school debating team, and I have no reason to doubt that.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. I acknowledge that going purely by the numbers, this is a no consensus, but those advocating keep seem to have a weak grasp of what sort of third-party sources are .necessary to be able to write an encyclopaedia article. I refer specifically to assertions that copying a website's own blurb onto another site constitutes a third-party source (the original editor withdrew this, but others have agreed with his reasoning and not withdrawn), and others which make no reference to Wikipedia policies at all. AfD is not a vote, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> is a non-negotiable pillar of writing an encyclopaedia, this article has poor external references, and the discussion below provides no comfort that this state of affairs will be improved. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 00:55, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am going to go against the trend and argue for keeping this. It is relatively new and most mention is on blogs, but word about it has circulated among the membership of Skeptic Associations. I have put a couple of links on the talk page. The first is an influencial web site run by a member of the Australian Skeptics, but independent of them. The second gives a positive mention of this wiki in a PC Magazine that very sensibly and in a reasonably detailed way discusses medical advice online and its dangers. I think it is mentioned in the "Australian Skeptic" but I do not have the link to hand. I would be surprised indeed if it was not mentioned in the US Skeptics magazine. I think it should be left for a while and it will develop.

<p>I am not sure if this page should be deleted but I think it's worth a nomination. Although it could have a major affect on the local elections, the wider historic significance and notability of this day is as yet unknown.

<li><b>Keep</b>Hi- I was the creator of the above article. My intention was to make an 'Introduction' and leave the details to people more knowledgeable than myself. Provided more is added, I don't see why it should be deleted. Furthermore, the page could be very instructive to the current, undeniable media frenzy surrounding the issue, and could act as an article consolidating information on the tabloid stories concerned with Labour's 'Black Wednesday'. I think it would be best, as mentioned above, that it is mentioned on the page that it is indeed a title used by the tabloid media. However, as an issue which involves but is separate in many ways to the Labour government, I feel that a merge would be a disservice to the issue at hand. The issue is something that is current: while it may affect the local elections, events surrounding it are firmly in the present. <a href="../../../j/m/p/User_talk%7EJmperry88_29ec.html" title="User talk:Jmperry88">User_talk:Jmperry88</a></li>
<li><b>Transwiki</b>. Consider a move to Wikinews until context becomes clear. This is a tabloid term that may be forgotten in a few months (or less)- the 'real' <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Wednesday_bd22.html" title="Black Wednesday">Black Wednesday</a> was a historical <i>event</i>, not a series of loosely related stories. I would support moving this back in time if a) the content can be expanded; b) the context is clear and this becomes a widely-used term with proven staying power. <a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadgerpatrol_9d70.html" title="User:Badgerpatrol">Badgerpatrol</a> 04:07, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

I don't read the papers and had no idea about the title 'Black Wednesday' (which incidentally seems to have been used by some of the broadsheets as well such as the Scotsman and Guardian) so I would never find this article. There's nothing saying a new article couldn't be created in the future if needs be. I also think some of the details need changing, such as the issue with the nurses being more specific to Hewitt being heckled by the RCN and mention of Clarke as spokesman for the Home Office. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinberry_9aa6.html" title="User:Linberry">Berry</a> 17:44, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

Some users also seem adamant in removing tags for verification, etc. Also, considering Sao Pan Thee is supposedly Shan, only the 'Sao' hints of Shan descent (or Sai), as it is commonly used for Shan men. 'Pan Thee' seems like it is Burmese, and alternatives could for 'Pan' may be 'Phan' or 'Hpan', and for 'Thee', 'Thi' or 'Si'. <a href="../../../h/i/n/User%7EHintha_01a1.html" title="User:Hintha">Hintha</a> 04:10, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Wikipedia is not a web directory, web hosting service, resumee promotion service. Such an entry requires significant occurance in "major news articles", preferably printed (not web only). If this entry gets through, a lot of people would get a right to establish similar pages.

<dd><b>Comment</b> wikipedia is not being used to garner notability as I fully believe these videos have a history that extends beyond amplovesyou.net (it is a shock/porn blog, not a producer of adult content. There must be a source). The purpose of wiki is to introduce new topics, leaving them out in the open for all users knowledgeable in the subject to expand upon, and finally with the aid of those who are capable, build a reference that is wholly informative and accurate. Simply because I and Bonnar are not gurus on the matter does not mean users familiar with other aspects of this sudden internet phenomenon will not arise.</dd>

This is history in the making, this is one of the most atrocious depictions to ever be on the brink of mainstream exposure in the history of the internet or even the world, and it most certainly deserves to be documented by an unbiased party like wikipedia. --j <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.82.125.202 (<a href="../../../6/8/2E/User_talk%7E68.82.125.202.html" title="User talk:68.82.125.202">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.82.125.202_bdd4.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.82.125.202">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<dd>This <i>isn't</i> a sudden internet phenomenon, no matter how many times you claim it is. If it was a phenomenon there would be references to it all over...because that is what a phenomenon is.

<li><b>Keep It</b> I think that it is an important reminder of the times that were shared at that house, he was a social icon for many years, appearing at pubs, clubs and other venues to share his inspirational poetry with us all. Those who live in Adelaide will understand his importance. Also, of course you are not going to find anything on Google for his book, it was published by a now defunct publishing press 'Lactic Sweetness Press', and it is now no longer in circulation and is a much sought after collector's item. I cherish my copy. That is the problem with you guys on Wikipedia, if someone is not a major celebrity then you will not accept them, Tom Hutton was a contributor to the culture of Adelaide for many years and is culturally important, thus his article should stay in wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Haggis101 (<a href="../../../h/a/g/User_talk%7EHaggis101_183d.html" title="User talk:Haggis101">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Haggis101_6368.html" title="Special:Contributions/Haggis101">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. This discussion has not yielded anything looking remotely like a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> - instead we have a lot of hot air, some Geocities-level websites mostly consisting of just the lyrics and barely any pretense by those clamouring for keep that this article meets Wikipedia policy.

It's never going to be an acceptable encyclopaedia article, and this discussion has proven that while ably demonstrating why AfD is not a vote. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 22:05, 7 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because Indekosovci was group that also had many satrirical songs about Milosevic ,so they were pretty much banned from all TV stations.But thi particural song was played all over the country,and you couldn`t find A SINGLE SERB THAT NEVER HEARD IT!!! Its very famous even outside Serbia.</p>
<p>Also I should just mention such classics as "Ja sam Ja",those are also even more popular songs by Indeksovci.</p>

<p>yes,but 2 link are Serban,one is Slovenian and one is English.Tha only means that song was popular even outside of Serbia.Ask any Serb if he heard it,everyone did.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Actually, Indeksovci would be Indexovo radio pozorište (or Index's radio theater in English). They where/are an acting company, not a music band. Title of the song is play on the title of El Condor Pasa (to which music it is sang) (padati - to fall, pada - falls, so El Condor Pada == El Condor Falls). Should the article be kept?

<p>I wouldnt agree that we voted because someone told us to vote.We all explained our votes.</p>
<p>Anyway,what I dont see is,why would this Albanians opinion be important in thi case.He can not possible be honest and objective on this subject,so he should be banned from voting here. Also,"Siptar" is not offensive,because thats how they call themselves.</p>
<p>Kris12 have not said anything offensive,I did said what I mean of Siptars,but since I was officialy warned on my talk page that I will be banned,I will try not to use those words again.</p>
<p>And yes ReyBrujo,you got some nerves to say that we did not explained our votes.You was the one to said only few words with your first vote:"Song is not notable". We proved that song is VERY notable,so it would only be fair for you to apologise and change your vote.Off course,you can continue ignoring the facts...</p>

<dd><b>Comment to Dzoni</b>: everybody in Balkans knows what "siptari" means und why the Serbian propaganda uses this. Don’t tell as lies. You are not an angel. You insulted people here. And everyone’s opinion counts in Wikipedia, not just the Serbian one, even an opinion of Albanians, whether you like it or not. Sorry to disappoint you.

<dd><b>Comment</b> There have been 4 keep votes that only have the vote, not even a small explanation of why the song should be kept. As for my vote, I wrote <i>the band seems to fail <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, thus song is non notable.</i> That is explanation enough, unless you want me to tell check every of the WP:MUSIC the band does fail. As for probing, as far as I see in this thread, no, nothing was probed. You provided four links, and I already explained why notability hasn't been probed:

<p>I voted keep, with some suggestions. I think the song has merit as an entry, given what else gets its own entry on Wikipedia. I'm no friend of Dzoni. He's a racist pig. He's an anti-semite. He imagined that I'm Jewish and then spewed his anti-Semitic vitriol on me. I'm not Jewish, I'm not Serbian. I'm...nevermind. He's a troll, basically. But I do think the entry has merit, and ... he did ask me to vote for it. Strange, eh?

<li><b>Delete</b>, I don't think merely being a young prodigy is sufficient grounds for notability. I think this is more "potentially notable", and Wikipedia will be here if or when that happens. As far as being an author his book was only written in Chinese (thus inaccessible to most readers of this encyclopedia) and allegedly sold 50,000 copies which is a lot but not enough in my opinion to make him notable as most best-sellers tend to get up into the millions. — <i><a href="../../../g/t/_/User%7EGT_d0ac.html" title="User:GT">GT</a></i> 01:33, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> One of Wikipedia's criteria for inclusion is to be a published author with over 5000 readers or copies in print. 50000 copies in taiwan is a lot - remember that the taiwan market is much smaller than that forr the US. Its not the language of the book, but the influence that counts. with so many people inspired and influenced by this person, it would be unwise not to include him - it would be a disservice to the community if the entry is not included. Many millions of chinese people also read wikipedia! Andrew Hsu is a great inspiration for thousands of children, and is probably the most significant Hsu on wikipedia. If he's not included, why should those others be? his wco organization has already helped thousands of children in poor countries. He is definitely notable and not just "potentially notable."

<li>First of all, I did not do any sockpuppetting. You have your right to your own opinion or guess, but you shouldn't accuse me randomly. Irishguy, you have said the person is not notable right now, and what grounds do you have for that? GT has said "merely being a young prodigy is not grounds for notability", and I agree. But I am not proposing notability on these grounds. He is a published author with much more than Wikipedia's criterion, which is easily verified through the publisher. He clearly meets Wikipedia's guidelines of "large fan base, name recognition, published a book with an audience of over 5000, autobiography". The guidelines does not say what language the book should be published in. You are entitled to your opinion, but the guidelines are very clear and straightforward.Solaroid 16:58, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please point out where I accused <i>you</i> of sockpuppetry. I simply noted that there have been a couple of newly created accounts showing up here to vote.

<li>To me, “Newly-created accounts” means kids or children or early teens. What you said means, kids’ opinions are generally ignored in the process. That is very true in this world. Your comment are so familiar, but that doesn’t make it right. That is what the world children’s organization is doing, to assert the rights of poor children in the world. Andrew Hsu inspired us.

<li><b>Comment - Keep?</b>. I personally don't see any reason why this is a vanity page. For notability, the article is informative and well-researched, with media reports like CBS, KOMO4, Time for Kids, etc. If you google the english name of Fervent Global Love of Lives, you get 296,000 hits, but if you search for the Chinese name (copy and pasted off a site in Google), I got 7 million results, so this is a notable award. He also seems to fulfill WP:BIO, with multiple features in national newspapers, as his article claims. But is it reasonable to ask for proof of sales figures? Exactly how would the user who created this page go about doing so? Also, I don't see people asking other authors for this. <a href="../../../k/r/0/User%7EKr0nnik_2b93.html" title="User:Kr0nnik">Kr0nnik</a> 21:42, 2 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Kr0nnik's account was created today. His edits so far consist of editing the pages of people named Hsu, nominating pages for AfD, voting on some existing AfD's, and a singular edit to his user page, probably so the link to his username wouldn't be red when he finally came here. Despite this user's intentions I've never seen such a clear (yet creative) <a href="../../../s/o/c/Wikipedia%7ESock_puppetry_eb4f.html" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">sockpuppet</a>.<br />
Anyway, to address your points, like I said we simply cannot just take your word for it that he has sold that many books and that his WCO organization has been as successful as claimed (and everything else for that matter).

You ask for evidence when you accuse other people without evidence? you ask for "veriafiability from reliable soruces." where is your verifiability from reliable sources when you accuse other people? for one thing, I know you're wrong about me being a sockpuppet. the newspapers that are in andrew's article Are reliable sources.

<li>Everyone is held to the same standards here. No exception is being made for this article. Do the newspaper articles discuss his book sales or otherwise demonstrate his notability?

<li>I just would like to ask everyone here to go to see all entries in Hsu and honestly ask yourself how many of them are more significant or notable than this person. If they can be listed, why can’t he be. It doesn’t make sense.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The guideline says</dd>
<dd>1. fan base: If the box on andrewhsu.com titled "ANDREW'S TAIWAN BOOK TOUR" (you have to scroll down) doesn't give evidence of a "large fan base,” what does? Again, how many in Hsu entries have a fan base such as this? They are listed.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>2. book sales: which authors who are listed actually supply documentation on the sales figure of their books? Why ask for it from just one person? That is unfair.</dd>

<dd>I would like to make one thing real clear here. I did not send out any emails to anyone regarding this discussion forum. If I did, the site would be filled with many comments, I am sure.</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Other articles aren't relevant. What is relevant is whether or not this subject is notable...and all signs point to <i>no</i>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Solaroid, your argument is ridiculous and very humorous. By your logic, every thing in the world should be included in Wikipedia <i>as long as</i> it is not worse than the worst article. Comparing other articles is a terrible way of defending the importance of an article. You cannot make significance out of an article by pointing out articles that may be worst than it.

<p>This article is not an appropriate encyclopaedia article. I believe it counts as original research, because clearly it is not reporting someone else's detailed breakdown of the act, but carrying out its own. While a clause by clause explanation of legislation would be appropriate in a legal textbook, an encyclopaedia should summarise information about an act rather than carry out an analysis of it. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:13, 30 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - on February 10, 2006, it was a Wikipedia featured article. There have only been a few minor edits since then.

<li>For the record, I strongly object to using this article's featured status as an argument for inclusion.

<ul>
<li>"Encyclopedic" (e.g, able to survive AFD) is not a criteria we check for on the FAC (because, frankly, I don't want FAC to turn into the shitfest that AFD is). We simply assume it is encyclopedic. So I object to using "it's a featured article" as a justification for keeping it on the AFD when the FA status is based on the assumption that it would survive AFD. <a href="../../../r/a/u/User%7ERaul654_54a3.html" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a> 15:14, 2 May 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are 30 citations to show it's not original research. (Of course, more cites are always welcome.) Moreover, a clause-by-clause breakdown of important legislation <i>is</i> the encyclopedic approach — certainly by the very definition of the word, whose antonym is "summary." <a href="../../../p/r/r/User%7EPRRfan_ba7e.html" title="User:PRRfan">PRRfan</a> 00:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>See below about the cites. Now we're not like other encyclopaedias it is true, but can you find a single other general interest encyclopaedia that has ever attempted to provide a detailed breakdown of a piece of legislation? What they do is describe how an act arose, summarise what it does, talk about criticisms, that kind of thing - <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliament_Act_6934.html" title="Parliament Act">Parliament Act</a> is a good example.

<li>Bugger. Just realised the page I was contributing to. This is <i>not</i> original research. I am writing about what the Act says in plain English. Maybe I should be assuming good faith here, but it's a little tough as you are trying to get an article I spent a lot of time and effort on deleted. I am assuming <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> because you voted down my other <a href="../../../f/a/c/WP%7EFAC_4b7f.html" title="WP:FAC">WP:FAC</a> article based on the title, not really on the content.

<ul>
<li>Right, so <b>you</b> are reading the act and interpreting it into plain english - you are not reporting someone else's published interpretation of the act into plain english. Therefore, it is original research. You completely misunderstood my objection to your FAC, which was entirely about content. You seem to be saying that because you have worked on an article, someone who thinks it should be deleted is automatically acting in bad faith - very arrogant indeed. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>I did this because, while I was complaining about the unencyclopaedic nature of one article, another similar one was pointed out to me. While at least the first unencyclopaedic article was at an encyclopaedic title, this one isn't. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 10:35, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>So let me get this straight: you listed an article for deletion which took me about a month to write because you didn't like the <i>title</i>?

<li>The time it took you is irrelevant. The content is unencyclopaedic - the title precludes anything encyclopaedic being written in its place.

<li>Again I ask why you can't move it? If you are that concerned about it, moving it to something like Sections of Title II of the USA PATRIOT Act would also allow commentary to be added to each section. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 06:07, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> OK, here is why I would like it kept: so far in the <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act_9b8d.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, we have not got any real information on what the Act actually says. Orin Kerr once justly took us to task for such an atrocious bit of writing. Well, I decided to do something about it: I must admit I was somewhat stung by his commentary. On review, he's right though. The article as it stands is a dog's breakfast. So what I'm doing is to write about each of the titles and any commentary that I find on them. I'm currently writing about Title III, which is taking quite a while. I don't think it's unreasonable to read the Act, then write about what each section says. This article was originally in the article <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act%2C_Title_II_8bfe.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act, Title II">USA PATRIOT Act, Title II</a>, but I was forced to split the article when I discovered that my article had ballooned to about 120-130KB. It was only logical that I summarised it and then put the detailed breakdown in its own article. The information is all good in there, and as several people have pointed out it is fully sourced. I genuinely don't see how splitting an article is a large cause for concern, especially when this article is just basically explaining the Act in plainer English. I also fail to see how it might be anything but an article written from a neutral POV. Eventually I'll be working on the other articles, so expect to see a few more of them around the traps. - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 12:15, 1 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I say, the state of other articles is irrelevant. What's happening here is that <b>you</b> are interpreting the act - original research. The references you cite <b>cannot</b> be used to verify <b>your</b> interpretation of what the act means in plain english. Therefore, the article is original research and is also unverifiable. Therefore, it should be deleted. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 15:41, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree with that, but if you mean that you think this article is the latter I would have to disagree - I don't think it can claim to be a summary when it's about as long as the original legislation is.

<li>Friendly question for Worldtraveller: is there a difference between "one person's translation of the legislation" and one person's translation of a legal textbook's description? Either way, the author of the article has to change the text so that it is not a copyvio while attempting to perserve the meaning. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESpangineer_57d1.html" title="User:Spangineer">Spangineer</a><sup><a href="../../../../es/s/p/a/Usuario%7ESpangineer_0822.html" class="extiw" title="es:Usuario:Spangineer">[es]</a></sup>&#160;<small><a href="../../../s/p/a/User_talk%7ESpangineer_c738.html" title="User talk:Spangineer"><font color="brown">(háblame)</font></a></small> 17:21, 1 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>The difference as I see it is that a translation of a piece of legislation into plain english, which this piece attempts to be, requires analysis of the legislation - that is, original research. From the sources given, I can't verify that what is claimed to be the plain english meaning actually is the plain english meaning unless I also analysethe legislation - the sources cited do not show that that is the case. On the other hand, if someone else had already summarised the essentials of the legislation, it's a simple job to describe that summary and cite your source - it's then very easy to verify from the source that what is claimed to be a summary of the legislation actually is a summary of the legislation. <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 17:43, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Alright, let me try to word this correctly. <a href="../../../h/a/m/Hamlet.html" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> is a play by Shakespear that represents one intertwined writing that can be <i>summarised</i> under one plot summary. The <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_PATRIOT_Act%2C_Title_II_8bfe.html" title="USA PATRIOT Act, Title II">USA PATRIOT Act, Title II</a> is a non-intertwined piece of writing that can only be <i>summarised</i> section by section. Just because the author has combined multiple sections, in order to avoid hundreds of articles, and has thus placed those <i>summaries</i> one after another, does not change the <i>summaries</i> to <i>analyses</i>. Now that you are aware of the similarities between this and other articles sumaries, I reccommend (based on your <a href="../../../b/e/_/Wikipedia%7EBe_Bold_7281.html" title="Wikipedia:Be Bold">Be Bold</a> attitude) that you go and delete/change the following sections of the following articles, as they, according to your interprestation of an encyclopedic article, are not.</li>

<li><b>Obvious Keep</b>. This whole debate seems very much a non debate and rather a one man vendetta. Surely it is clear that the majority of people think the article should be included, despite the crusade entered upon by the forementioned critic? The article enables anyone who might have an issue to look it up, failure to have the article would mean people dont have the opportunity to look up quickly and efficiently the inns and outs of the act. And for that matter, almost all articles on history on wikipedia are subjective, and often inaccurate. That does not mean they should be deleted, that means they should be corrected. So if you, Worldtraveller, have such an issue with the article, why don't you correct the points you disagree with?. Fredheir 23:40, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The PATRIOT Act is notable, and an article on it should be considered encyclopaedic.

<li><b>Comment</b> - something which people don't seem to be considering is the nature of the references here. I see lots of comments saying 'it's got 30 references, it must be OK', but actually two thirds of the references are the law itself. This is a bit like me writing an article about, say, the <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helix_Nebula_5dda.html" title="Helix Nebula">Helix Nebula</a> and saying 'it's 100 arcminutes across (reference: the object itself)' - the only way i can verify that this article's analysis of the act is correct is to do my own analysis, just as if I told you the size of the Helix Nebula that I'd worked out myself from looking at it, and that number didn't appear in any peer reviewed journals, your only way of verifying my statement would be to carry out your own observations. I don't doubt that most people would agree that would not be acceptable, and would count as original research. Now how is this situation different? <a href="../../../w/o/r/User%7EWorldtraveller_741f.html" title="User:Worldtraveller">Worldtraveller</a> 23:00, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>Maybe my analogy is not the best. Let me try a different one - this detailed breakdown is 80% as long as the piece of legislation it's looking at.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Encyclopedic topic ... and an Act is a legitimate primary source for its own overt contents (though not for contentious matters of interpretation). Similarly, a movie is a legitimate primary source for what it contains (though not for contestable interpretations). I realise that there is no bright line between overt contents and interpretation, but the concept of original research has to be applied with common sense, rather than in a spirit of radical epistemological scepticism, and not stretched too far beyond the job it is designed for (eliminating crackpot theories, etc).

<li><b>Keep</b> The administrators wanted to delete the article stating that writing specific information for a musician's tour doesn't need its own page. I find it to be unfair. There are other musicians's tours that has each of their own pages for example, Madonna. I don't see the reason why the article should be considered for deletion. All the information about the article is completed and accurate. I see other musicians that has a page for their own tours. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Lucy2006 (<a href="../../../l/u/c/User_talk%7ELucy2006_f8ec.html" title="User talk:Lucy2006">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lucy2006_5a76.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lucy2006">contribs</a>).</small></li>
