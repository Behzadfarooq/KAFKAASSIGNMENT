<p>User (posting as various IPS) clearly doesn't want a page and has vandalised WP to such. I should note that I filed this afd only after a person claming to be Samuels has made multiple legal threats against Wikipedia (see <a href="http://jimmywales.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://jimmywales.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jimmywales.blogspot.com/</a> for a cite. I suppose one could say my objectivity is biased by the fact that I am accused in the above vandalism posts, so I will not be voting either way in this AfD. <a href="../../../t/a/w/User%7ETawker_141a.html" title="User:Tawker">Tawker</a> 07:58, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. It's not a registered political party <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=pol&amp;document=index&amp;dir=par&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=pol&amp;document=index&amp;dir=par&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, so how would this be any different from you calling yourself the "Caesar Party of Canada" and rating a Wikipedia entry as a national party leader? The registration requirements are hardly onerous <a href="http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=gen&amp;document=ec90530&amp;dir=bkg&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=gen&amp;document=ec90530&amp;dir=bkg&amp;lang=e&amp;textonly=false" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, there's a registered <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marijuana_Party_of_Canada_6ee4.html" title="Marijuana Party of Canada">Marijuana Party of Canada</a> among others. Notability would depend on whether he's rated any mention in the media (a passing mention in a <i>Time</i> magazine article and various newspaper stories is cited, which may be significant). Regarding complaints about having a Wikipedia article, it would seem that if a person is a self-described "national political party leader" then he imagines himself to be a public figure, and public figures usually come in for public scrutiny, for better or worse. The <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan_Party_of_Canada_38b3.html" title="Cosmopolitan Party of Canada">Cosmopolitan Party of Canada</a> could certainly also be nominated for AfD. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 08:45, 25 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'll admit I haven't heard of the party before, but as I said there's references- you note Time Magazine, the article also gives the Toronto Star and Ottawa Citizen. The Marijuana Party is, by the way, a well-known party, or at least it is as much as it can be without being among the four that get into Parliament. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanadianCaesar_5124.html" title="User:CanadianCaesar">CanadianCaesar</a> <small><a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECanadianCaesar_4741.html" title="User talk:CanadianCaesar">The Republic Restored</a></small> 08:56, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>While this is a well-written and referenced article, I doubt that he meets <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. He is the head of an unregistered party and he seems to barely get 100 votes in his constituency. <b>Delete</b>.<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:45, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Stong keep</b> He's run for election three times, written a bunch of books, created a bunch of websites and founded an unregistered political party. While each of those things on its own may or may not be sufficient for inclusion in Wikipedia, together they certainly are. Is Wikipedia diminshed by including this material? It isn't. Not one bit. Is it diminished by deleting it? Yes, it is. Firstly, there are people, like me an CJCurrie, who are interested in the characters who populate the firnges of the political scene. Wikipedia is exactly the right place for this sort of information because <b>Wikipedia is not paper</b>. Secondly, wha sort of message do we send out by deleting a lengthy article largely written by a fine Wikipedian like CJCurrie just because a few people think that the subejct isn't "notable" enough. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 13:04, 25 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> . I like Ground Zero's summary, it pretty much sums up my thoughts on it. What's really good about the Wikipedia article is that it gathers so many sources into one article. This man has run in pretty much every election happening federally or provincially since around 1992 or so, and if he's now leader of a federal political party, which does occasionally get radio coverage (he's been interviewed), print media mentions, and has been endorsed by two federal politicans (see endorsement page on his site), it warrants an article. The fact that he's going on a rampage to complain about it in this case reinforces the need to keep it (if it wasn't so well sourced that would be another matter), not the need to delete it.

<li>A further comment on notability: I do not believe that one can (i) advertise oneself as the leader of a national political party, (ii) register over 65 ISBN titles and extensively advertise one's books, (iii) campaign for public office three times and (iv) [apparently] oversee a quasi-religious movement, and then (v) claim not to be a public figure. Raymond Samuels is hardly the most notable person in the country, but his "publicity" is ultimately of his own design. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 20:48, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
