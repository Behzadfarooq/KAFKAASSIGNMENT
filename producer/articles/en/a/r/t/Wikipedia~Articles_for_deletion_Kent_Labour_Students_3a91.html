<li>No, that would probably be something like Noodlesoc or the Varsity Trainspotting team. 60 active members isn't bad: it's larger than any of the societies I was involved with in my uni days. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>No need to be nasty, just delete it if you have to. Like I say, I assumed it is equally as "notable" as ones for other uni societies of similar subject and size. Just make sure you demonstrate consistancy. - Author <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.12.200.50 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.12.200.50.html" title="User talk:129.12.200.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.12.200.50_a7e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.12.200.50">contribs</a>) 10:11, 15 November 2005.</small></p>
<p>Incidentally I clicked a link saying "Kent Labour Studnets" and it said there isn't an article, but I could write one.

<li><b>Comment.</b> Of course the author is correct. If I type “qwertyuiop1234567890” into the search box, the Wikipedia will respond with a page that practically encourages me to write an article with such a title. ♠<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanMS_20a7.html" title="User:DanMS">DanMS</a> 19:14, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> a summary into <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Kent_2cce.html" title="University of Kent">University of Kent</a>; it and the Tory equivalent have a couple of sentences in the "trivia" section, which could easily be expanded into a paragraph on student politics without unbalancing the article. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 22:29, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>This is a very good idea. All I ask for is consistancy. I wasn't going to name names, but "the Tory equivalent" has already been mentioned by Haeleth. If you delete Kent Labour Students you have to delete Kent Universaity Conservative Association as well. How, exactly, do I go about changing the article as suggested above? Do I have to implicate myself in petitioning for KUCA to be deleted? I appreciate any help - negativity not so much. - Author <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 129.12.200.50 (<a href="../../../1/2/9/User_talk%7E129.12.200.50.html" title="User talk:129.12.200.50">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.12.200.50_a7e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.12.200.50">contribs</a>) 23:46, November 15, 2005.</small>

<li><b>Note</b> LOL! I don't know who edited it but it's truely sad!! I assume it was you, Tim? Anyway, whoever it was, it's certainly a KUCA activist and that just goes to show what lengths tories have to go to to win an argument. I've already suggested this article can be deleted, but it's still here: yet yours got deleted! Must be gutting for you. I have the original still on disk but I'm not THAT bothered that I'm going to re-post it.
<ul>
<li>The only edit I have made to the article is to put in the <a href="../../../u/n/i/Category%7EUniversity_of_Kent_4408.html" title="Category:University of Kent">University of Kent category</a> as part of a wider building up of both that and several other University categories. I don't know who wrote what about the numbers on the mailing list, but perhaps the number of paid-up members would be a better statistic to use. That the KUCA article got deleted is not gutting for me - it had been VfDed before. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimrollpickering_f409.html" title="User:Timrollpickering">Timrollpickering</a> 05:41, 23 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> As Chair of Kent Labour Students, I can say with some authority that this page is entirely pointless. For the record, we have over 40 paid up members (plus 100 more on the mailing list), but if people are going to edit articles out of spite or some childish attempt at "politics", then the whole thing is even more pointless. We are a Labour Club at a University; one of hundreds in the UK and no one in the world cares about us apart from our loyal members. If anyone is interested in finding out more about us then they can visit our quite extensive website. Therefore I see no reason for there to be a Wikipedia page at all.
