<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>. Holy smokes peoples. Emotions have run a bit hot in this one, (could we not get quite so hot in future? Could we not use pejorative "cruft" terms in noms of articles that clearly have had a fair number of contributors? Could we not cast aspersions on the nominators and fellow commentators?) but on balance I think the keeps (which numerically far outnumber the deletes) have the stronger argument here. Some admin has to make the call on this, it's way overdue for a close. I think Keep carries the day here. Disagree? Heck I have one <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> going already, why not two?

<li><b>Strong keep.</b> Given my other votes, you'd think I'd be in favor of this removing this article. I'm not. I think there's far too much Trek fancruft on Wikipedia, and by my AfD <s>votes</s> noms am attempting to prune it down considerably (to the great outrage of the Trek fan community), but that <i><b>doesn't</b></i> mean every single trace of Trek fan films has to be stamped out, especially a useful article like this that can absorb some of the contents of the articles that do pass AfD.

<li>Where on Earth do you get from the two sentences above that I am insinuating that you are milkandwookiees???!!! I was suggesting nothing of the sort! Are we reading the same thing? Could you explain the logic behind it? Because I'll be jiggered if i can! You're right i didn't sign that last post but i don't have any fancy techie hoogywhatsits to do all the donkey work for me and i am fallible. Mea Culpa. I would go back and fix it but i can see that you have. You're not perhaps assuming bad faith that I was trying to hide my identity are you?

<li>We've come to a peace, hopefully, and this is an old comment, so I'll just very calmly point out the reasoning behind my assumption was the phrase "what an amazing coincidence," which referred to my AfD deletions the same day, as well as the reference to civility, a charge I had been bringing up in our disagreement at the time. As for signing your post for you, it's common practice for others to sign unsigned comments and votes by using the {{<a href="../../../u/n/s/Template%7EUnsigned_e4f5.html" title="Template:Unsigned">unsigned</a>}} template so that we have a clear record of who said what ... and, no, I wasn't assuming you were trying to hide your identity, as that's intensely difficult to do here given Wikipedia's tracking of page histories. —&#160;<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 96%; font-weight: bold"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">Mike</a></span>&#160;•&#160; 21:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Milkandwookiees removed the second one, which was not kosher, as he's not an admin. However, in that particular board you posted on, the admins remove concerns once they are removed — due to its extremely high traffic, it serves not as a permanent record, but as a "to-do" list — with items removed instead of crossed off once they are accomplished. —&#160;<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 96%; font-weight: bold"><a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike">Mike</a></span>&#160;•&#160; 21:29, 7 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> My POV on this entry is probably no surprise to some here. From the begining, I wanted to contribute to this entry and was blocked. I want to be inclusionary, but others here have stopped that. This entry is greatly biased and gives an incorrect, wrong, and hugely misinformed impression on this fan film subject. It is clearly exclusionary and is selectively biased. This entry negates the huge amount of pre-Internet fan films that were available just because of a lack of Google hits. Many well known fan film producers know of this Wiki biase problem and just do not care to contribute here. Fan film listings are handled more fairly and even handledly on other Internet sites. This faux fan film Wiki entry has been very selectively written to keep some already produced fan films out of this entry by the selectively and unsophisticly enforcement of wikipedia policies to accomplish a censureship objective on this fan films subject. How can any unfinished fan film have an entry here? They do. While many finished fan films entries are treated to a gauntlet of a draconian enforcement of the Wiki rules heaped on them by other Wiki members here that keeps their information out of this fan film entry? This is the state of this fan film entry and this causes a biased fan film entry. When one unpopular fan film producer adds an entry about his film, he is told by other psuedo non-Wiki staff members here that his entry is dissallowed because his entry is not a 'neutral POV', all the while other 'favored' fan film producers are allowed to write their fan film entry with no such interferance or pre-requisites. This results in a biased misinformed entry. Tracing the affiliation of many of this Wikipedia fan film entry's contributors with the many competing fan film factions and fans(who have contributed here) would certainly enlighten prudent people as to the likelihood of their biase motivations they choose to exhibit here by their wholesale elimination some other competing fan films listings. It would also be informative to illustrate the biased motivations of many of the Wiki entry authors who repetative delete opposing other fan films information to be openly shared here. My contention is the entries authors have colaboratively published an misinformed 'elitist' fan films entry based on an antagonistic agenda to other fan films trying to be listed here. This group of authors or 'clique' keeps other fan films information out of this entry by unfair and improper means. Please check the LONG discussion page for who is doing unfairly what to whom here. It could be seen that this much flawed fan film entry is monopolized by a few fan film maker factions very much like a prejusticed Good Olde Boy Club of very questionable parental ancestory.

<li>OMG YES! Whilst we have attention on this article, could someone please look at the manner in which it has been conducted and give this man a fair and unbiassed opinion on whether he has been unfairly done by! Perhaps we can get some closure on his interminable allegations this way. God alone knows I've made every attempt to engage in dialogue but he deletes what he doesn't like, ignores the questions and suggestions that might solve his problem and rants on about the same thing again and again. This was the subject of a recent disgusting flame on the talk page of this article.--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 20:51, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the essay above an admission that the sole motivation for deletion is that his contributions have been rejected? From long experience with this person, I doubt that even having a properly constituted authority look over his work and rendering a judgement will work. He has a habit on the IMDB, TrekBBS, and IntrepidBBS of claiming that those authorities who find against him are also biased, or have somehow been "subverted" by the "other side". He made similar accusations against the Variety writer of a positive article on Hidden Frontier. But by all means, let's get his contributions looked at by someone who isn't involved. Whether he's been treated unfairly or not, he deserves his day in court.JohnWhiting 00:37, 12 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> You are wrong, John Whiting non-neutral point of view and self promotional motivations of Hidden Frontier fan film commenting here. Trouble with your reading&#160;? YOu are wrong, just like the many times that you try to put words in my mouth in other public places. The entry is clearly biased because it only includes certain elite cliquish video projects over others have similar or more worth. Even unfinished videos are listed here over finshed ones. Consistant requirements, I don't think so. The listing requirements are slanted and change according to the most recent Wiki member's whim and based on the unethical collaborative efforts to censure this entry against other valid fan film producers and me.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>Just what exactly does all that have to do with the discussion of the article's deletion? Are you saying that because you can't get your film listed the article must be deleted? The whole subject of Trek fan films must be exsponged from the field of human knowledge because this article does not recognise your film? The subject in question here is whether Trek fan films <i><b>as a subject</b></i> should be included as an article on Wikipedia. NOT the quality of the writing OR the content OR any other problems. I am supporting the call for some sort of closure on your interminable and repetative rants. It is a waste of time and effort - time and effort that could be put to better use writing a article which is what we are supposed to be here for!--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 14:18, 13 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> In the middle of <a href="http://www.conflux.org.au/" class="external text" title="http://www.conflux.org.au/" rel="nofollow">Conflux III</a>, the major SciFi Con in Canberra, Aus, where I have arranged the screening of Borg War and Star Wreck. They would have been overjoyed to have had more such as New Voyages, Exeter or Hidden Frontier but we could not get a waver from CBS Legal. If this can be resolved, Star Trek fan films could and <i><b>would</b></i> be shown as exhibition films in film festivals, comparing favourably with other fan films and Indies. The artistic merit and social impact of fan films is at least comparable to low budget Indies, to deliniate between the two smacks of elitist discrimination.--<a href="../../../k/i/r/User%7EKirok_5555.html" title="User:Kirok">Kirok of L'Stok</a> 20:59, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>&lt;ahem&gt; If I might ask the indulgence of the group to address Netwriter's off-topic comment? That's right. Stoney silence, so we did the right thing and didn't show them. Luckily Star Wreck has its own creative commons license as a parody and Borg War isn't a fan film at all technically - it's "new game material", check <a href="http://www.borgwarmovie.org/FAQ.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.borgwarmovie.org/FAQ.htm" rel="nofollow">his website</a>.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Here's my arguement: Just because something isn't 'noteworthy' in someone else's opinion, doesn't make it so for everyone else. There are people who go to the Wikipedia to find general information about fan films, or more to the point, about Star Trek/Star Wars/etc fan films specifically. If these links are just sites that just go to only paysites, then I would have to agree that pages like that have to be deleted. But fan films aren't generally made for profit, what little money is made goes to production costs. Plus, if someone wanted to see more fan films abou the subject, Wikipedia is a very reliable source to find links to other fan films. Art for Art's sake. That's what being a fan is all about. --D2K 15:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you hit it right on the head D2K. I know I've asked my parents about "noteworthy" events in history that they lived through and they didn't consider the events noteworthy. (quote by my mom "Cuban Missile Crisis? Didn't pay attention to it. I was just worried if I had a date on Saturday night.") as they say "one man's trash is another man's treasure" and I think that sums up all these fan films. PirateGent 19:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
