<dd><b>Comment</b> the meat puppet reference is that it is obvious that the subject of this article has asked his family, friends, and coworkers, who have never contributed to WP before, to come and vote, with little to no understanding of the policies that WP is run under, most notably <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>.

<li><b>Leave It Alone</b> - I was just watching him on C-SPAN and came to Wikipedia specifically to find out more about him.

<li>On what grounds does BlueValour propose to delete the article? I'm looking at the criteria at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a>. I don't know how anyone can claim that Zeese doesn't qualify based on those criteria. Here's a brief rundown of his multiple qualifications for notability: 1)He is a "[m]ajor local political figure who receive[s] significant press coverage." 2)He is a published author who has received multiple independent reviews of his work (32 hits on Amazon.com). He also qualifies under several "alternative" criteria. To wit: the professor test, verifiability, expandability, and, as mentioned by previous posters, the Google test (205,000 hits for "Kevin Zeese" and 38 hits for "Kevin Zeese" in the "News" search). I think it's a mistake to only use the criteria at <a href="../../../c/a/n/Wikipedia%7ECandidates_and_elections_9303.html" title="Wikipedia:Candidates and elections">Wikipedia:Candidates and elections</a> for a person who is well known outside of their candidacy. <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJessesamuel_8842.html" title="User:Jessesamuel">Jessesamuel</a> 15:58, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep it as its own article</b> - For the same reason as listed immediately above: from what I know of Zeese, he's significant enough for his own article, and not just for the sake of being nice SCGC</li>
<li>Keep, its not just about his running for office, he has been a leading advocate for civil rights issues and ending the war on drugs for 30 years. His run for senate is unusial as he unites parties at opposite ends of the political spectrum (G's and L's), this is the first time in History that has happened in the state of MD if not the US.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>It states that the article lacks sources, I am unclear as to what it is refering too. I have known him my whole life and I will testify that all of its background history is accurate, -Alex Zeese (his son). PS- I personally think this is a partisan Democratic attack to get rid of this page, I don't see any threats on any of the Democratic Senate Candidates, or Republicans pages to get rid of them, and most of them are less significant then my father is.</li>

<ul>
<li>Keep: I have known and worked with Kevin Zeese for years and can testify to the accuracy of the article (as does his own son! SEE BELOW). I have run into people throughout the DC metro area, Maryland and across the country who know and value Kevin Zeese's long history as an adocate for human rights and an end to the so-called "Drug War" which has become a war on American communities, turning them into combat zones! The advocates of Deleting or Redirecting are obviously partisan corporate liberals who favor continuing this costly policy making drug-related free-fire zones out of our inner cities. I wonder if they also advocate Deletion or Redirection of the Corporate Democrat and Republican candidates for U.S. Senator from Maryland?</li>
</ul>
<p>The claim that Kevin Zeese -- with his three-decades-plus career of public service on the national political scene, acting as an avocate of basic human rights and representing the majority position on national drug policy on network television shows like ABC Nightline and in numerous other national media -- does not deserve an article in Wikipedia is so far beyond reasonable that I would think the request would be thrown out immediately!</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. BlueValour - why didn't you mention the 217,000 hits when one does a google search on "Kevin Zeese"? This isn't just a <i>minor party senate candidate casting about for support</i> - that statement seriously mischaracterizes who Kevin Zeese is. Also, I have cleaned up the article by moving much of the campaign detail to the main article about the election, which still leaves a significant amount of text about him. I invite those who have voted against keeping this article to take a second look, and to keep in mind the google search results. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 21:59, 10 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Kevin Zeese's biography is easily verifiable, as he has been a public figure and political activist and has been participating in electoral politics for 30 years. There are many people, myself included, who have worked with Kevin Zeese on activist and electoral political issues [my personal issue being voting system integrity] and who can vouch for the details and the relevance of his work. I can see no reason to delete the Kevin Zeese article other than that someone here in Maryland, likely a Democratic Party official, might be trying to keep Kevin Zeese's activist light under the proverbial bushel because of his third-party U.S. Senate campaign. But if one looks at the whole of Kevin Zeese's resume, and tallies the number of activitst organizations he has founded, headed, or worked for, and tallies the broad array of political issues that he has been involved with in his 30 plus-year career, one should be able to recognize that the relevance of the Kevin Zeese article goes far beyond his current U.S. Senate campaign. However Kevin Zeese fares in the 2006 U.S. Senate Campaign, the relevance of the whole of his work should be recognized, and the Wikipedia article should be retained.</li>

<p>It would be nice to know who "BlueValour" is. A basic American core-value is to know the identity of the accusser! In this case, the slander against a nationally known leader of the movements for sane drug policies, varifiable voting, and peace should be ignored when it comes from one who hides behind a fake name!</p>

<p>Indeed, more of this article is about Mr. Zeese's prior career than about the Senate race. It is not substantially different from Michael Steele and Ben Cardin's pages; the major party candidates in the same race. The candidates and elections criteria state that there should be one page for each race. If you apply that criteria to one candidate in the race, you should apply it to all. Tim Willard<br />

<dd>Tim - in response to your first paragraph - Wikipedia has over a million articles in it. It's pointless to point to articles that are WORSE than the one under discussion and ask why they have not been deleted, UNLESS they were proposed for deletion and such proposals failed (THEN they ARE precedent). The existence of other articles that should be removed, but have not yet been, does nothing to prove whether the article under discussion (Kevin Zeese) should or should not be removed. Please focus on the criteria in wikipedia policy regarding whether the subject of THIS article is newsworthy or not. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 12:55, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>John - At this point it's not clear what criteria is being used to judge this article. The first criticism "notability" has been repeatedly refuted with no counter from the critics. The second, that this is a "Minor party senate candidate casting about for support" seems to imply that it is being judged under the candidates and elections criteria. But the article is primarily about the man and not the campaign. You need to be careful about deleting this article if that is the criteria used because there are undoubtably hundreds of other articles written in the same format that could be challanged on the same grounds. You are opening a can of worms. Could you specificly state under what criteria this article should be deleted? -Tim Willard

<dd>Tim - please check your scorecard - as you can see from above, I voted to keep the article. And may I suggest that it's about time for you to stop posting to the discussion, and to trust the process? All the relevant points have been made, I think. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Broughton_89d4.html" title="User:John Broughton">John Broughton</a> 12:03, 12 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
