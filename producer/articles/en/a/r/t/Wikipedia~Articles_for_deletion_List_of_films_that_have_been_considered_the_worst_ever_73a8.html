<p>Article has no NPOV whatsoever. I can find whatever sources I want to support whether <b>I</b> think a movie is good or not. Should not be in an encyclopedia <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianinthehouse_3206.html" title="User:Wikipedianinthehouse">Wikipedianinthehouse</a> 20:38, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - it's POV and the list is way too long. There's a perfectly acceptable (IMO) article dealing with infamously bad movies <a href="../../../r/a/z/Razzies.html" title="Razzies">here</a>. --<a href="../../../l/e/m/User%7ELemonAndLime_f195.html" title="User:LemonAndLime">LemonAndLime</a> 21:10, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Look at the entries: They're actually required by the regular contributors to have cites as to their badness, so that NPOV is preserved. <a href="../../../l/u/b/User%7ELubaf_0839.html" title="User:Lubaf">Thanks</a>,<br />
<a href="../../../l/u/b/User_talk%7ELubaf_7678.html" title="User talk:Lubaf">Luc "Somethingorother" French</a> 21:19, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, cite awards and anything else to support that they were considered to be horrible movies. Maybe rename to something that doesn't consider them all to be "worst" but just bad. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 21:21, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This has been up for deletion at least twice before and survived. It is regularly policed by a number of editors who enforce a minimum standard of requiring a citation so every drive-by anon can't stick their least favorite movie in. It requires a lot of work before it's as good an article as <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a> but we're working on it. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:29, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I could find "sources" about any movie that considered it good or bad. I'm sure I could find a source that said <i>Gone with the Wind</i> or <i>E.T.</i> were the worst movies ever made. It is all subjective. And, just because it has survived two votes before doesn't mean its any good---I know some'thing' else that has survived two votes and isn't any good. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianinthehouse_3206.html" title="User:Wikipedianinthehouse">Wikipedianinthehouse</a> 21:32, September 4, 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a> is mentioned above. <i>Titanic</i> is on both lists. How can that be possible if this list is encycolpedic? <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianinthehouse_3206.html" title="User:Wikipedianinthehouse">Wikipedianinthehouse</a> 21:35, September 4, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'd personally say "overrated" would be a more appropriate title, but Robert Altman and the viewers of the BBC said "worst", so there it is. <a href="../../../l/u/b/User%7ELubaf_0839.html" title="User:Lubaf">Thanks</a>,<br />
<a href="../../../l/u/b/User_talk%7ELubaf_7678.html" title="User talk:Lubaf">Luc "Somethingorother" French</a> 21:45, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>It is encyclopedic because, just as in <a href="../../../f/i/l/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">Films that have been considered the greatest ever</a>, it cites polls, published books, and the opinions of leading critics. <i>Titanic</i> appears on both lists because it was immensely popular with the public at the time and criticially unpopular. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 21:47, 4 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, <i>Titanic</i> was popular with critics, (86% Rotten Tomato rating), a fact that conveniently disappeared from the article after I had added it in. This is the problem: too many editors are dumping films onto the list just to push their own POV. <a href="../../../e/x/t/User%7EExtraordinary_Machine_f897.html" title="User:Extraordinary Machine">Extraordinary Machine</a> 23:48, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This list could quite easily be just POV but it's been extensively pruned so that only films seriously referred to as the worst ever are included. It's articles like this that make Wikipedia fun to read. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 23:51, 4 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> as NPOV and encyclopaedic. IIRC this article has been VFD'd once before and I believe I voted to keep then, too. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 00:17, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Citations are in order. I don't especially like the title, but the contents are fine. <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 01:17, 2005 September 5 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I enjoyed reading this, even if I didn't agree with some of the choices! Well referenced, as mentioned above. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 02:29, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I actually read this article with great interest over a month ago and it never occurred to me that it did not meet Wikipedia standards. It's been here for over two years now. -- <a href="../../../w/c/f/User%7EWCFrancis_461e.html" title="User:WCFrancis">WCFrancis</a> 02:45, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. LemonAndLime is off base. There is no rule determining whether the "worst films" list is too long or not. And the alternative "perfectly acceptable article dealing with infamously bad movies..." also known as the <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Raspberry_Awards_6b79.html" title="Golden Raspberry Awards">Golden Raspberry Awards</a> only covers the bad movies made from 1980 to present. <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansaltnpepper_2a0a.html" title="User:Alansaltnpepper">Alansaltnpepper</a> 18:21, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Interesting article and with some website references, it is not original research. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:53, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, one of the few good lists on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto">Proto</a><small>&#160;<a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto">t</a>&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Proto_c67f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Proto">c</a></small> 13:35, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, This list is actually informative and NPOV. However, as other people have stated, it needs a name change. May I suggest List of movies that have been unanimously panned by critics. <a href="../../../h/o/s/User%7EHossmann_7782.html" title="User:Hossmann">Hossmann</a> 15:59, September 5 2005</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — many of the entries are self-documented as to why they are on the list, so that would seem sufficient. Individual entries still need references. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 21:11, 5 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Superfluous <b>keep</b> vote, along with a note on proposals to change this article's name. This article's been through a series of back-and-forth name changes, including "List of movies that are famous for being widely considered extremely bad", which is probably one of the most tortuous titles in the history of Wikipedia. We'll probably never settle on a title that satisfies <i>everyone</i>, but I think the current title is OK. It's not really a POV problem; something like "List of bad films" would be. <font color="green"><a href="../../../s/z/y/User%7ESzyslak_7117.html" title="User:Szyslak"><font color="green"><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">sɪzlæk</span></font></a> [ <a href="../../../s/z/y/User_talk%7ESzyslak_c549.html" title="User talk:Szyslak">+t</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Szyslak_7616.html" title="Special:Contributions/Szyslak">+c</a>, <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Szyslak_1b31.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Szyslak">+m</a> ]</font> 10:15, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Though <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedianinthehouse_3206.html" title="User:Wikipedianinthehouse">User:Wikipedianinthehouse</a> has a good point. I do think that the policies should be tightened up to require a critical or popular <i>consensus,</i> rather than just a single citation. For example: having a movie like Titanic in there is somewhat ridiculous, considering how many awards it's won, how many critics loved it, and how outright popular it was--the people who consider it a bad movie are in the minority, yet the "single citation" policy lets the movie onto this list. - <a href="../../../l/i/f/User%7ELifefeed_b291.html" title="User:Lifefeed">Lifefeed</a> 13:03, September 6, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, and don't make querulous nominations like this - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 11:48, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The content is solid enough. <a href="../../../l/-/z/User%7EL-Zwei_cc56.html" title="User:L-Zwei">L-Zwei</a> 16:27, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> It's not subjective - it's movies CONSIDERED to be the worst ever. Whether something is good or bad is POV. Whether something is considered by many to be good or bad is fact. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFantom_6705.html" title="User:Fantom">Fantom</a> 17:24, September 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Entertaining &amp; educational.Raylene Jackson</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - It's funny, but is basically an opinion article, and should be deleted. Not encyclopedia worthy. I liked it though. Maybe we need a Wikicriticism site? <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoy_Brumback_e7cf.html" title="User:Roy Brumback">Roy Brumback</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Some people just get their knickers in a knot because movies they like end up here (or vice-versa). <a href="../../../a/t/l/User%7EAtlant_5157.html" title="User:Atlant">Atlant</a> 00:04, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - NPOV can be established by only accepting entries that have been nominated by well known media/sources. Note: this article deals with movies that <i>have been considered</i>, not <i>is</i>. --<a href="../../../h/u/r/User%7EHurricane111_4e5e.html" title="User:Hurricane111">Hurricane111</a> 05:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
