<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>merge</b>. I should first say that I have read the page, lest failure to have read the article should be ascribed to me by For great justice (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;curid=1003209&amp;diff=47846278&amp;oldid=47740576" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Articles_for_deletion&amp;curid=1003209&amp;diff=47846278&amp;oldid=47740576" rel="nofollow">here</a>). In its present form, the article needs a bit of cleanup but surely is sourced and neutral. Assuming arguendo that the list is maintainable, it is nevertheless unencyclopedic; a list may comprise only facts and be wholly cited and sourced nevertheless be inappropriate for inclusion (see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). Even as this list does not merit its own article, it surely presents information that one might merge into extant <a href="../../../v/i/d/Video_game_controversy.html" title="Video game controversy">Video game controversy</a> article, which presently addresses only concerns relative to game content but surely could be expanded to note that deaths have been attributed to individuals' video game-playing. The occurrence of deaths attributable to video game-playing is notable; the names of those to have died is not, except where such names are provided only as ancillary to a broader theme. Our article on <a href="../../../c/r/o/Crocodile_attacks.html" title="Crocodile attacks">Crocodile attacks</a> is instructive here and may be compared to the video game article to illustrate best what is wrong with the instant article; notably, the article contains a list of deaths by crocodile as a section, just as the "video game controversy" article could contain the list of deaths as a section. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:39, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> So you are arguing that it should be expanded and renamed so that the list forms part of a broader article? For great justice. 20:45, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Part of a broader article that already exists. In terms of expansion, I think surely there should be more information added as to scientific consensus apropos of the prospective harm of video games, but I think a recapitulation rather than recitation of this list is in order in the expanded section (the detail is exorbitant). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:54, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK - I'm not sure that I agree that a broader article already exists, I presume you mean the controversy page, but I don't really think these deaths are controversial. It's just a list of deaths. Also, do you mean, merge, or delete? You can't have both for copyright reasons to do with the GFDL. For great justice. 21:05, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, the controversy page probably should perhaps be renamed as a criticsm page; whatever the title, I do think this likely fits, inasmuch as the page really seems to be "why people don't think video games are good", where surely that they are thought to have caused deaths is appropriate. I do think one can suggest "merge" and "delete" here; we generally use that locution to mean that whatever information can be merged is inserted into another article, with the antecedent article then turned into a redirect to the new page, preserving the contribution history (although this is not done, per <a href="../../../m/m/_/WP%7EMM_1706.html" title="WP:MM">WP:MM</a>, exclusively for such preservation). <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 21:14, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Then that's merge and redirect, not delete, which destroys the history. For great justice. 21:19, 10 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Yes, but see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Merge_and_delete" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where "merge and delete" is eventually understood to mean "merge and redirect"; that is, as I said, the sense in which I use it, and, in view of its having been the dominant formulation prior to early 2005 (if I understand correctly), the sense in which others use it. The reason that I think merge is appropriate is that the "controversy" article, even as it details normative objections to video games (e.g., that they impart "bad values"--whatever that means), also details medical (psychological and physiological) harms ostensibly following from video game use. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> (Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information). The "verifications" which are taking place are news articles and distraught parents. The fact that a news editor slaps a headline on an article that something was a "Video Game Death" in an attempt to sensationalize a story and sell some more papers does not, to me, seem to be a credible attribution. If there were a peer-reviewed study about the connection between particular video games and heart attacks, that study would be appropriate for the encyclopedia. This, however, is a mere list of events that are at best only loosely connected and in my opinion are more likely to be found to be completely unconnected. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 21:16, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This, I think, fairly well encapsulates my thinking; the list should not be a dominant feature of an article or even of a subsection of the "video game controversy" article. However, given that there have been instances of video game-playing induced illness or death, the topic is perhaps one that the "video game controversy" article needs to address, but primarily with respect to general cases and supposed causes (as in the crocodile article), rather than with respect to enumerated individual cases). It doesn't make sense to have a list like this without context or broader information, and so the article must either be deleted or, as is my preference, merged and expanded, such that it's not predominantly a list. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 23:09, 10 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In a rare moment of actually agreeing with User:For great justice., I've actually found this article quite interesting and reasonably well sourced. I've heard about incidents like the Legend of Mir stabbing and the crazy Korean cybercafe death marathons, and it's kind of a nice place to have all those. I do however have worries over the maintainability of this list as voiced in the article talk page. Puritan on the Moon Jack Thompson attritbutes every crime and death at the foot of the evil computer game empire, listing all the deaths he's attributed to computer games would totally wreck the point of this list. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnch</a><a href="../../../e/v/i/Evil.html" title="Evil"><span title="WP:Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></span></a><a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">n</a> 09:47, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- I regret that the nomination seems to have gotten off to a disorganized start, but that doesn't affect the content of the page. Were these people killed <b>by</b> video games? No, of course not. Did they die in a manner connected to video games? Quite possibly; but then perhaps several thousands have died while or shortly after playing a game. The connections cited are tenuous; cause-and-effect is not shown. It's quite possible, say, to read today's newspaper, stand up, and keel over dead from a stroke. Sensational media might decide to label this as a "news-induced death". All kinds of things <i>might</i> kill you, to stretch the point: mothers-in-law, fluorescent lighting, <a href="../../../b/a/r/Barney_%26_Friends_bd26.html" title="Barney &amp; Friends">Barney</a>. My feeling is that any source making such claims automatically becomes unreliable. The weasel word "attributed" does nothing for the quality of the article; <i>anything</i> might be attributed by <i>somebody</i> to <i>something</i>. At best, these "news reports" might be bundled with other <a href="../../../w/e/e/Weekly_World_News_8c7a.html" title="Weekly World News">Weekly World News</a> articles and sold for bird cage liner. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohn_Reid_d143.html" title="User:John Reid">John Reid</a> 15:26, 11 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Looking at this link one of the criteria is that the person is NOTED, and that NOTED suggests well deserved public attention. Any death attributed to a video game is likely to get well deserved public attention. All entries should be noteworthy by being cited in the media. <a href="../../../l/u/m/User%7ELumos3_fc96.html" title="User:Lumos3">Lumos3</a> 09:35, 13 April 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>There seems to be a fair bit of bad feeling flying in multiple directions around this AfD, which is regrettable, and I hope people can come to terms with each other. I found the arguments presented here quite hard to follow. I did not, for example (after reading this page, the talk page, and Zero's talk page), fully understand precisely what Megaman Zero gave as deletion reasons, and some of the advocacies made by others I found hard to follow too. So I looked at the article and its sources and went back to first principles. I am not a fan of lists in general (if I had a tool to see how I've commented on various AfDs I think it would show mostly deletes for list related articles). However this seems more than <i>just</i> a list. I think the topic of <i>why</i> the media/people/relatives seem to hang stuff on video games is an important (and notable) one. But unless there is research out there already about <i>why</i>, writing an article on that topic would be original research, which we do not do. This list, though, shows that they do, and that's as close as we can get. With this article in existance, the encyclopedia is better than without it (that's the acid test, after all) because now interested readers can read and draw their own conclusions. <b>Keep</b> unless such an article on the phenomenon itself already exists (I could not find it in 20 seconds of trying), in which case merge to that article but in neither case is this a delete opinion. <font color="green">+</font>+<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 19:28, 12 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> This also seems more-or-less to recapitulate my view (viz., that this should exist as an article rather than as a list), except that I imagine there must some legitimately-published and generally accepted scientific research on the subject, which should compose the majority of a prospective new article or section in an existing article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 19:43, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b> Not a discriminate collection of information, most references have citations, new name is more apt. I see no reason not to keep (but if I'm missing something let me know). I don't believe the notability of the individual subjects has any bearing on this "compendium" article provided the information is verifiable. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 20:04, 12 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
