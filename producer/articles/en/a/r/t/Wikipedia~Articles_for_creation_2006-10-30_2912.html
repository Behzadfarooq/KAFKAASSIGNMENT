<p>01:54, 29 October 2006 (UTC)01:54, 29 October 2006 (UTC)~~ The columbian bowtie is a very violent way of torture. It was said that in the late 1900's the columbian bowtie was invented by a Columbian Drug Lord named "Pablo Escobar" a ruthless man who would stop at nothing to teach people a leason. The Columbian Bowtie is a way to show people tha he wasn't messing around, so one day Pablo found out of a man stealing from his fruit stand, the man was only doing it to feed his family, but Pablo didn't care.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-30_2912.html" title="Edit section: Winscape">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Winscape</span></h2>
<p>Winscape was created during the summer of 2006, when people under the alias of "cappy" and "orkee" combined efforts and set forth a new era of private servers.</p>
<p>It started with the administrators of thugsrus, looney, orkee, cappy, pug, and windy. Soon, only orkee, pug, and cappy were left. Cappy runs the server from his own computer, still vowing to never give his source out to anyone. Winscape is a very popular server because it has many features, such as advanced smithing, a great economy, many unique items other servers dont, training areas, and people say it has a great staff.</p>
<p>The server Winscape is a moparscape based server, made from the game of Runescape, with similar coding, but many differences. The game of Runescape and it's user-created private servers are made using Java technology <a href="http://www.sun.com" class="external text" title="http://www.sun.com" rel="nofollow">Sun Microsystems</a>. The creations of these private servers have surely made many people more aware of computer terms and technology. The statistics show that over a thousand people have created a private server, even sources where people can base their servers from. This means that there is a great chance that those people will go to college, get a degree in computer programming or software analysis, and live successfully in life. Most Moparscape private servers use <a href="http://www.hamachi.cc" class="external text" title="http://www.hamachi.cc" rel="nofollow">hamachi</a> or <a href="http://www.no-ip.com" class="external text" title="http://www.no-ip.com" rel="nofollow">no-ip</a> as means of connection.</p>
<p>The Winscape private server can hold a maximum of 46 players at any given time. At the 46 mark, it is supposed to block other incoming connections besides the current 46. Instead, the server "crashes," or kicks all current players and shuts down. The meaning behind this is unknown. Attempts have been made by the owner of Winscape, cappy, and various other adept Java programmers to stop these crashes, but to no avail.</p>
<p>On August 31, 2006, the official Winscape <a href="http://www.z9.invisionfree.com/winscape" class="external text" title="http://www.z9.invisionfree.com/winscape" rel="nofollow">forums</a> were created, and an online community never before seen so large was created. The official Winscape forums have over 500 members, Five thousand, seven-hundred posts, and a chat box for suggestions of ideas, economic issues, and reportings of illegal actions within the game. The owner of the Winscape forums is Alex, also as administrator in-game. Cappy, the owner of the server Winscape, also co-owns the forums alongside with Alex.</p>
<p>Winscape has some very unique features, compared to other private servers. Such features include a complete character-look interface, which indeed saves the data for the next login. Another feature includes many interesting training grounds, where characters can gain experience in their various skills, such as attack, magic, herblore, and crafting. These training areas could be attackable non-player characters (NPCs), a shopping stall for ingredients, or trees for chopping wood to gain woodcutting skill experience. All of these skills integrate with each to provide maximum simplicity and complexity at the same time.</p>
<p>Winscape's economy is very well put-together. The various rare items in the game include items received from a "crystal chest," where you use a key and get a random item, possibly common, sometimes very rare, such as a purple partyhat. Other rares include items given to players by the administrators, such as in a "drop-party," where the administrators drop rare items only they can obtain, via spawning codes. Rare items from the crystal chest are now removed, and administrators host drop parties less often, making many items increasingly difficult to obtain.</p>
<p><br />
The main thing about Winscape that keeps it intact, and out of chaos, are the fantastic staff of Winscape, and them doing their jobs quite decently. Moderators have a command to boot players from in-game, stopping people from swearing continuously, cheating, etc. Also, they are able to report abusers in-game to an administrator. Without the moderators and administrators, there would be no order in the realm of Winscape, or any other private server.</p>
<p><br />
The current staff of Winscape are as follows. Cappy is the owner of Winscape, and the head administrator. He handles most of the player bans, updates of Winscape, and controls basically everything in-game. Alex is me. I am an administrator as well, and virtually the co-owner. Orkee was the original co-owner of Winscape, as he helped create the server, and made a topic of Winscape on various forums sites. Pug is still an administrator of Winscape, although he comes on the game rarely, he is fairly active on the official forums. Windy still has administrator status, although he is not active in-game, or on forums, anymore. Marz is the third in command as far as everyone is concerned, and also administrator. He is the most active person on the Winscape forums.</p>
<p><br />
The moderators of Winscape include Say la v, sephyrthe1st, and honest truth. Say la v is a new addition to the Winscape staff. sephyrthe1st was one of the first moderators, and still is to this day. Honest truth is also a new addition to the Winscape staff, and active in forum affairs.</p>
<p><br />
Credits go to cappy (owner of Winscape), Alex (made this page), and the staff of Winscape.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-30_2912.html" title="Edit section: Spudd">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Spudd</span></h2>
<p><b>Spudd</b> is one of several informal "street" games that were popular among children during informal gatherings prior to the dawn of the Internet Era. It's exact origins are difficult to verify, but it seems to trace it's roots to Long Island in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>The game requires at least 3 players, an ample vertical space, such as a typical street block or basketball court, and a large, round, bouncy ball. A dodge ball, basketball or volleyball would be acceptable. Play begins with one of the players randomly declared to be "it". This player has no formal name, but for simplicity of explanation he or she will be referred to as the chooser. The chooser takes possession of the ball and selects a topic. Topics may be simplistic ("colors", "letters of the alphabet", "boys' names") or as complicated and personal as the group desires ("TV shows that Andrew wouldn't watch", "digit patterns of pi"). The remaining players then seperate from the chooser and each select a unit related to the topic.</p>
<p><i>Example: Andrew, Josh, Tony and Jerry are playing Spudd. Jerry is selected as the chooser, and he chooses the topic, "colors". Josh, Tony and Andrew move off to a corner and whisper their selections to each other - Andrew chooses "green", Tony chooses "yellow" and Josh chooses "white".</i></p>
<p>Once the players have made their choices, they return to the chooser and stand in a line in front of him. One of them calls out the choices, but does not do or say anything to indicate which choice belongs to which player. The chooser then performs a slight sing-song ritual, bouncing the ball and saying in rythym, "I declare war on the person who picked..." He finishes by yelling out one of the choices and throwing the ball high into the air. All participants then run away as quickly as they can, while the player whose choice was yelled out runs to catch the ball and yell out "SPUDD!" Once Spudd is yelled out, the running players stop and freeze in position.</p>
<p><i>Example: Andrew, Tony and Josh form a line in front of Jerry. Andrew tells Jerry, "The choices are green, yellow and white." Jerry takes a moment to decide which he is going to yell. He then bounces the ball between his hands, singing, "I declare war on the person who picked.... yellow!" When he says yellow, Jerry throws the ball into the air and starts running forward, towards where Tony, Andrew and Josh were standing. Josh and Andrew turn and also run in the same direction as Jerry. Tony, who had chosen yellow, runs forward and catches the ball. Once he has it, he yells, "SPUDD!" Jerry, Andrew and Josh all freeze in place.</i></p>
<p>Finally, the person who caught the ball will begin to approach the others. He is allowed 7 steps, each of which he will take while speaking the ritual words, "S-P-U-D-D Spells Spudd." He then gets two bunny hops, which he counts out as he jumps: "One, two." At this point, assuming he didn't have any problems catching the ball, he should be fairly close to one or more of the other players. At this point, his objective is to hit one of the other players with the ball. The player he is aiming for may attempt to dodge the ball, so long as one foot remains firmly planted in the spot where he was stopped. Alternatively, the player being aimed for may attempt to catch the ball. If the target player succeeds in dodging or catching the ball, or the throwing player misses the target completely, then the throwing player is penalized with a letter, and becomes the new chooser. If the throwing player succeeds in hitting his target, then the target player is penalized with a letter and becomes the new chooser. In either case, the new chooser selects a new topic, and the process is repeated from the beginning.</p>
<p><i>Example: Tony decides that Andrew is going to be his target, so he takes 7 steps towards Andrew and two bunny hops, repeating the mantra as he moves. "S." Step. "P." Step. "U." Step. "D." Step. "D." Step. "Spells." Step. "Spudd." Step. "One." Bunny hop. "Two." Bunny hop. This places him roughly three feet from Andrew, making it unlikely that Andrew will be able to dodge. Tony throws the ball at Andrew, and Andrew decides to try to catch it. However, Tony's throw is very hard and Andrew finds himself unable to hold on to the ball - it slips out of his hands and hits the ground. Andrew has been successfully hit, and retrieves the ball to become the next chooser. He now has a letter: S. He chooses a new topic, "Words that Begin with Q." The others form a huddle briefly, then return to Andrew and announce the choices: quick, quiet and quirk. Andrew throws up the ball while yelling quirk, which turns out to be Josh's word. Josh catches the ball, yells "Spudd", and then decides to approach Jerry. Jerry decides to dodge the ball, and succeeds in shifting his body to the side as the ball flies past him. Josh now has a letter S, and he becomes the chooser for the third round.</i></p>
<p>The letter penalties that each player gets from round to round spell out the name of the game - SPUDD. Once a player has acquired all 5 letters, he is either removed from the game or some alternative punishment is arranged (one of the more popular ones among the street children in the 80s was to put the player through the "paddywagon", where all of the other players would form a line and spread their legs wide apart, and the losing player would crawl through the tunnel and be slapped in the rear as he went through. Naturally, this form of physical punishment is unlikely to be condoned in a more formal setting). A player put through an alternative punishment usually has his letter penalties reset afterward, which allows the game to continue indefinitely or until the players tire of it. If the players are being removed from the game, then the game ends when there are only two players remaining and the player with the fewest letters is declared the winner.</p>
<p><i>Example: After 13 rounds of play, Andrew and Jerry both have SPUD, Tony has SPU, and Josh has S. On the fourteenth round, Andrew completely misses Tony with the ball, and winds up obtaining his final D. He is removed from play, randomly selecting Josh to replace him as the chooser (Josh is not penalized a letter for this). Josh picks the topic, "Animals", and Jerry and Tony huddle up. When they return to Josh, there are only two choices for him - "goat", selected by Jerry, and "Andrew", selected by Tony in order to make a playful joke at their friend's expense. Josh selects "Andrew" and throws up the ball, which Tony easily catches. Tony approaches Jerry and hits him with the ball, giving Jerry his final D. There are now only two players left, making it impossible to continue - the game ends, and Josh is the winner because he has the fewest letters.</i></p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-10-30_2912.html" title="Edit section: The people who play football at mallowdale park">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The people who play football at mallowdale park</span></h2>
<p>Mallowdale Park is merely a stretch of grass adjacent to Mallowdale itself. Many are instantly driven away by the undeniable stench of urine and the lurking paedophiles in the bushes parallel to the park. Despite its humble surroundings amongst the suburbs of Nunthorpe, Mallowdale Park is the place where dreams are weaved. Day upon day, youths flock to the area to contest the prestigious game of knockie outie.</p>
<p>High quality football is ensured by the presence of Thomas McAvoy, described by the most people in the world as Middlesbrough's twenty goal a season man described by one person as an overpayed drama queen. As well as McAvoy, Hertha Berlin centre half Elliot Crosby (described in some sections of the media as the new Josip Simunic, due to his almost, desire to foul, and the fact he owns a Croatia shirt), Steven 'Fabio' Jackson, capable of unleashing the 'Jackson/Rochemback bomb' and Robert 'Shearer ' Elwick (a player with the combativeness, aerial presence) known for his superhuman constitution having buried an injury time penalty with his right leg broken and his testicles sown onto his forhead. are regular players. Other regulars include Ross 'Shefki' Jackson who became an overnight sensation due to his partnership with Matthew Scott, John Webb who is an average sort of player no real talent and Thomas McGlynn who is capable of moments of genius. In recent weeks Santos' and Brazil youth player McGlynn has forged a formidable partnership with Middlesbrough centre forward McAvoy. The flair and skill of 'Glynny' in combination with McAvoy's technique and creativity lead to numerous recent victories. However, Mallowdale Park would simply not be Malowdale Park without the presence of Stuart Readman, goalkeeper who doubles up as knockie outie referee. Despite his moments of genius in goal, Readman has became more of a cult figure due to his constantly bewildering refereeing decisions. Among those whom Redman's decisions perplex is Ciaran Sopp. A tall individual, his physical presence and strength, allied by his ability to hold off challenges, is an awkward customer to deal with and he regularly makes it through to the final stages of Knockie Outie.</p>
<p>Hull City's own Matthew Scott enjoys his sesions in the park, however Scott's tendancy to handle the ball, giving away "penners all-round", means that he can be a risky choice, some have even proposed that some of the occasions have been purposeful which has lead to an investigation from the FA, no evidence to prosecute Scott has yet been found.Scott is more known as a cross-hybrid between Michael Bridges, The Beast and Jussi Jaaskelainen with the playing style of the first two and a striking resemblance to the latter, he is not the most successful player currently at Mallowdale by any stretch but achieved minor fame by helping to propell Ross Jackson to the stratospherical heights he enjoys today and getting to round 2 of knocky outy when competing on his own. He most probably would have made it to round 3 but unfortunately his habit of handballing struck as he was infront of an open goal and he was knocked out as everyone scored in the resulting round of penners all round. One of the sadder tales is the one of Adam Watts. He was a young player that promised so much but sadly his career was cut short when he was jailed for life for murdering Ms. Birtil his German teacher with a small plastic basketball. Another player who promised so much was Chris 'Pidgey' Goodrum, however his encounters with referee's, and tantrums at the thought of going out, have led to hatred among the national press, slating him as a Cristiano Ronaldo look-a-like. The 'Travis Shimmy' was also perfected in the park, many have likened the move to that of George Best. Another player of note is Richard 'Shola' Clegg, he is famed for having a venemous shot and a just as venemous tongue, often shouting multiple profanities for all to hear. He has enjoyed success with many different players over the years. A true legend of mallowdale park is Shaw, for many reasons: His love of a slide tackle on wet ground and for his 'Spiderman' ball which has sadly recently came to be no more after a vicious attack from Shaws dog prematurely ended its career which promised so much. AMichael Shaw became a figure of derision when news broke of his devotion to eating Lemon Meringue Pie upon the strike of midnight. This has led to numerous tabloid papers' dubbing him 'Mr Blobby'. Mallowdales resident Gangsta is Milan Desai-Barochia, he is reknowned for having incredible pace but lacking in technical ability, probably due to his insistance of wearing jeans everytime he plays. Occasional players include: Shakka, Jamie Bennet, Mike Allinson, Temple and Ketty. Kris Mason is another player, who is famed for both the "touch of mason" and the "shoot wildly". The resident emo is James 'love me' O'Connor, he is known for lightning pace and great strength and more so for his set of attacks on Matthew Scott, bafflingly none were given as penalties by Stu Redman. The favourite haunt of the players is without doubt, the Tesco Garage, where the holy grail of this park can be bought for a very generous price. Tesco rola-cola, at the cheap price of jus 41 pence, is seen as an essential item for every mallowdale player. Other favourites include pinapple juice (especially with ross), chocolate milk, a favourite of matthew scott and Doritos cool flavour, a favourite of Mallowdale's resident gangster, Milan. Another favourite refresment is Relentless, an energy drink which comes in a hilariously oversized can and makes the consumer feel like they are going to live forever without illness or feeling upset ever again after drinking it due to the sky high level of chemicals that can be found in it. Traditionally, Thomas McAvoy has been known to prefer the delights of chocolate chip cookies, acquired from the same store at a miserly forty seven pence. His tradition has been followed, amongst others, by John Webb.</p>
<p>The music of choice amongst the players differs, with Elliot Crosby preffering a more rock influenced choice. His love for Egyptian pop, however, cannot be denied. Thomas McAvoy is perceived to share a keen interest in UK garage thanks to his constant 'bigging up' the Mo' Fire Crew and Artful Dodger. However, his taste in trance music (in particular Tiesto) cannot be denied. Matthew Scott's favourite song is the Toys 'R' Us theme tune. A new song capturing the imagination of the boys at mallowdale is Robbie Williams new single 'Rubebox'. Kris Mason has expressed an interest in Bon Jovi, which often leads to kareoke style renderings of 'Shot Through The Heart" between himself and Crosby. Milan provides an outlook on the rap scene, often playing songs that haven't even been relesed yet. This has caused unrest amongst the group, leading to conspiricies of links with Tim Westwood.</p>
<p>Mason also shows an almost devotion towards pirates. There are many plans to try and introduce pirates onto the agenda, including a new group in politics at college. I am led to beleive that the drink of choice of this right-wing political group, is Mountain Dew. Scott and Crosby have also flirted with this particular notion as a group they are known as, Captain Jack Mason, Deckhand Scott and Sweaty Keith Gibbs (Crosby).Mason also dreams of reviving a old time battle ship and renaming it the Black pearl.His intentions are not yet clear what he will do with the vessle but he assures no waters will be safe as long as he has his boat.....I mean ship.</p>
<p>Mason's traditional celebration is waving the arms in a bird like fashion, whilst hooting, until reaching his partener where they jump into one another.Another of Masons trademarks is the Pelvic thrusts that grace the field rarly but are a site to behold,its skill and an art that he has perfected over the years. Other celebrations include John Webbs "Yaaaaaaaaaaaarrr" and Rob's traditional one arm in the air salute. On occasion, Glynny performs a Kaka style look to the heavens. Some have likened Jonno's celebration to that of Lomana Lua Lua whilst Crosby's celebration has been liked to that of the Stuart McCall on top of the car incident. On other occasions, he prefers the seagull impersanation</p>
<p>The hated figures amongst the group are Rob Shearer Elwick for his constant elbowing and Steven Fabio Jackson for his arrogance when advancing through the knockie outie stages. The 'boo-boy' of the lad's, tends to be John Webb, mainly due to the fact that he has a twig penis. The Usual time of games is usually 1 o'clock, however with upcoming college commitments, the boys will have to work out something new. At the time of 1 o'clock kick-off's, play tends to end at around 7, due to the fact everyone is usually knackered. Evening Kick-offs are likely to now become the norm until Winter when it gets too dark too quick which is when the play is likely to take a break for a while. Im sure the winter games of Fox 'n' Hounds will ensue</p>
<p>A recent cause of controversy was 'Mobile-gate' where the lads' mobiles were all going off left right and centre with the numbers being witheld. The biggest sufferer was Milan whos phone turned off due to low battery because of the constant ringing it had. The main culprit was found to be Matthew Scott who is now impending trial at Middlesbrough Crown Court over the matter.</p>
<p>Mason has his own academy of footballing excellents. Theres no funds at all and the training methods are abit ski wiff.One of Masons academeys greatest offsprings is not only Mason himself but also Steven Jackson who has also perfect the art of hitting the ball high and wide.The reason the funding of this poor attempt of an academey is none existant, is because Mason is stock piling all the funds to purchase a pirate ship he has longed but dream about. He is under investigation by the court for fraud.</p>

<p>'Parks of Nunthorpe' by Michael and Matthew Scott 82.5.182.247 13:57, 29 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Dopplereffekt play cold, dark Electro, slightly agressive at times. They do not belong to the "electro-goth" scene at all. Dopplereffekt are one of the strangest and most mysterious units of the contemporary electronic music scene. There are no interviews and hardly any live appearances. Nobody really knows who they are, their releases have so far only been available on limited vinyl on Dataphysix/Detroit. The composers hide behind strange German pseudonyms whereas the song titles and lyrics are in English and make up a strange mixture of scientific, sexually explicit and political allusions. Dopplereffekt's music is also highly eclectic and unusual. Even if at first sight the forefathers Kraftwerk seem to be more than present, Dopplereffekt have developed their very own and highly influential sound aesthetic, without which the current electro hype seems to be unthinkable. Dopplereffekt have also taken an unusual path with their stylish anti-style in cover artwork, which have always been surprisingly and provocatively plain. Their best known album is Dopplereffekt - Gesamtkunstwerk which appeared in 1999 under the "Gigolo Records" lable. With song titles like "Voice Activated", "Superior Race" and "Sterilization" combined with the cover make this is a Dopplereffekt production "pur sang".</p>

<p>Michael O'Briant is an artist living and working in Chicago, Illinois.</p>
<p>The paintings of Michael O’Briant reflect his desire to keep alive the tradition of the figurative narrative. His images are rooted in the timelessness of black and white photography. By combining figures from both found and original photographs, O’Briant is able to create his own unique compositions. These manufactured groupings reflect the solitude often encountered in crowds, while the individuals represent through their style and shape, the artist’s view of our times.</p>
<p>O’Briant uses a technique of combining acrylic paint with glue to obtain a thick medium which dries semi-transparent, allowing for an aggressive layered surface while maintaining the soft visual effect typically created with oil glazing. O’Briant paints on wood panels, as well as elaborate panels he constructs from smaller wooden blocks, as well as other materials like glass, plexiglass, and canvas.</p>
<p>A native of North Carolina, O’Briant received his B.F.A from East Carolina University and his M.F.A from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He has lived in Chicago since 1998 and is represented in many private collections in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>He has exhibited his work at: The <a href="../../../h/y/d/Hyde_Park_Art_Center_d45f.html" title="Hyde Park Art Center">Hyde Park Art Center</a>, Tojo Gallery, The Provincetown Art Association Museum, The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, The Randolph Arts Guild, April and George Gallery, Caro d'Offay Gallery, among other venues.</p>

<p>Herbert Ackroyd Stuart was a British engineer who took out a patent (No.7146) in 1890 for an oil fired engine which was the result of his development work on low-compression oil engines. To quote the patent:</p>
<p>"first of all compressing the necessary quantity of air for the charge, and then introducing into this quantity of compressed air the necessary supply of combustible liquid, vapour or gas, to produce the explosive mixture."</p>
<p>This engine was in production in 1892. Ruston &amp; Hornsby Ltd claimed, in a 1937 advertisement “Before Dr. Diesel took out his first oil engine patent, we were making successful oil engines at our Grantham Works.”</p>
<p>Controversy</p>
<p>It is thought by some technology historians that H.A. Stuart should be properly regarded as the inventor of the type of engine that hitherto borne Diesel's name. Rudolph Diesel is widely credited with developing the compression ignition (CI) engine. In 1892 - two years after Stuart's patent - he took out patent no.7241 on a CI engine <i>which ran on coal dust</i> this was built in 1893 but exploded when it was run. In 1894 Diesel filed a patent for a CI oil engine which he successfully ran in 1897. In 1900, at the world fair in Paris, a small diesel engine was demonstrated running on peanut oil. The Otto Company provided this demonstration at the request of the French Government which wanted to use peanut oil as an energy source in its African colonies.</p>
<p>Stuart, a Yorkshireman, and one Charles Richard Binney took out patents in 1890 for a compression-ignition engine. The manufacturing rights for this engine were taken over in 1891 by Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons Ltd of Grantham and they produced the "Hornsby-Akroyd Patent Oil Engine" to the inventor's original design. These engines were actually on sale before Diesel took out his first (impractical) patent. Diesel's first practical engine was not constructed (by Adolphus Busch of St Louis) until 1897.</p>

<p>Captain David Bell (1652-1720) was a fearsome yet rather unknown Pirate in the carribean sea's although he had notorious connections to Edward Teach (Blackbeard). He was arguably more succesful a pirate than blackbeard but his mundane stratagies of battle and plunder dont favour the remembrance of this pirate. His flag ship was a captured british naval ship that he renamed "The Meredith" but he also had two other ships under his control but the details of these slip. The Meredith was even a rival to the Queen Annes Revenge and met it in combat on more that 2 occasions. Captain David Bell's exploits are relatively forgotten but what we do know is that he raided many gold ships during his career and unlike many pirates rather than freeing african slaves he retained them and sold them himself. David Bell died when he went overboard during a cellebration of rescuing three prominent crew members.</p>

<p>It all takes place in Ellion the country surrounded by an endless ocean and its center, wich is supported by Anselloan an invisible tree. To one side of the tree is Westmile 'continent of fire' and on the other side of Anselloan is Eastmile 'continent of water'. All of the branches support Heaven Sphere 'continent of light' and the roots of the tree hang Hell Road 'continent of darkness'. These continents form the world they live in. Heaven Sphere and Hell Road, the continents of light and darkness, are destined to fight against each other from the very beginning of the world. They had a great war that almost collapsed the world long time ago and have not recovered from the damages yet. However, their destiny did not let them be peaceful...</p>

<p>Heaven Sphere strictly lives by orders and rules and never allows flexibility. Hell Road is based on power and everything in it is in complete disorder and chaos. Both of them want their ideology to rule the world and confront each other in an indirect way: extending their powers by spreading the ideologies to the humans in 'West Mile.' The humans in West Mile moved just as they had intended, and constantly fought against one another to have more power.</p>
<p>However, the humans in West Mile who used to make Heaven Sphere and Hell Road happy for a long time gradually opened up their eyes and began to question why they had to fight. Then, the humans quickly established a new form of society and stopped having meaningless fights. Heaven Sphere and Hell Road lost their precious game board and quickly looked for a replacement.</p>

<p>'East Mile' was never more attractive than 'West Mile.' It is because East Mile is the only continent that has no leading species and is only a random mixture of countless species. As Heaven Sphere and Hell Road needed a replacement, however, they attempted to rule East Mile by devoting much time and effort. In result, each of them succeeded in ruling 'High Elf' and 'Demon.' Nevertheless, it was nothing compared to what they had in 'West Mile.' Just as they had anticipated, it was impossible to unify different species in 'East Mile' under one ideology.</p>
<p>Concluding that they need a new method, they slowly overlooked East Mile for a long time and eventually developed an interesting method.</p>

<p>"How will the species of East Mile react to the inevitable crisis of all?" Hell Road was certain that conflicts between species would quickly spread in the crisis and Heaven Sphere thought that the enormous crisis would motivate the species to depart independence and unify.</p>
<p>Once they established the goals, they immediately started pursuing the goals. They scattered Time Stones throughout East Mile and had destructive fiends and spirits come out of the stones. They also fed the Seeds of Chaos to animals to transform animals into wild and aggressive beasts. Not only that, they organized secret unions to follow their orders and ordered them to wake up vicious ancient organisms that are sleeping in East Mile.</p>
<p>Just to be fair, however, they provided a key to solve all the chaos. The key - the Tablet of Reality - tells how to solve existing problems. They broke the tablet into pieces and hid each piece at Time Stones. If courageous and wise people would gather these pieces, they would have important information about the chaos. The future lies on how people use the information.</p>

<p>Not knowing anything about the intention of Heaven Sphere and Hell Road, East Mile suddenly falls into a chaos. Courageous people soon started using the Pieces of Reality to handle the chaos, but this was also what Heaven Sphere and Hell Road had intended. The two powers were very satisfied by what was going on. The chaos of countless species and the entangled conflicts were far more diverse and interesting than what they had seen in 'West Mile.' However, they failed to realize the potential energy of East Mile. They did not know that what they had started would impact that enormous energy and would return to them in a bigger wave.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they had no idea that the wave will begin in a small village called Milano in Elston, a small, native village in East Mile.</p>

<p><b>Swordsmen</b> Physically trained to fight in close combats. Very courageous and adventurous. They always take leads in battles and aggressively attack enemies.</p>
<p>Swordsmen specialize in using swords, but can also use archery for remote attacks when they cannot use swords.</p>
<p><b>Archers</b> Trained to be speedy and perform well in remote battles. Seem to be cold-hearted, but are actually very nature-loving and warm deep inside their hearts. They have profound knowledge in venoms and know how to use natural energy.</p>

<p>The endless incoming of adventurers makes Milano Village crowded.</p>
<p>The calm and boring village is energized but with many problems. The sudden strike of hard-working miners, the Cobolts, the unknown Cobolts from the north, and the terrible danger that has been buried underground for a long time threaten the village……</p>
<p>Could novice adventurers safely handle all troubles?</p>
<p><b>Main Characters</b></p>
<p><b>Akuku Kennel</b> One of the leaders of the Koaren Family. Kru Koaren's faithful servant.</p>
<p><b>Kru Koaren</b> Grandson of the Koaren Family in the Krem Mountains</p>
<p><b>Huru Kenko</b> A Cobolt who lives with the Demons in north. The founder of the Kenko Family.</p>
<p><b>Rain</b> A young villager from Milano who volunteered to protect the village</p>
<p><b>Kevin</b> A member of Ropello's Loyal Army. Very cynical</p>
<p><b>Kung</b> A bodyguard of the Koaren Family. Very smart</p>
<p><b>Places</b></p>
<p><b>Milano Village</b></p>
<p>Milano is a functional village that is built in front of Ropello's Mansion.</p>
<p>Villagers actually live inside the grand mansion and what are open to others are miners' rest area and a few shops for visitors. The town seems to be very desolate.</p>
<p>Because of many abnormal phenomena around the village, Sir Ropello established an Adventurers' Association by his mansion and invited many adventurers to the small town.</p>
<p><b>Northern Prairies of Milano Village</b></p>
<p>It used to be a very warm and peaceful place, but has become a dangerous place because of fierce animals and plants.</p>
<p>Many wild animals and plants are scattered across the praries. It leads to the mines and the Pernon's Temple.</p>
<p><b>The Mines</b></p>
<p>Mines are owned by Sir Ropello and are the source of Gillion Stone. Sir Ropello gained enormous wealth by Gillion Stone monopoly, but mining has recently stopped since the Cobolt miners started a strike.</p>
<p>As a large amount of Gillion Stone has been taken from the closed mines, Gillion Stone has become a very ordinary item that is easy to find.</p>
<p><b>Pernon's Temple</b></p>
<p>Pernon's Temple is located at a long valley that passes between Milano and the Krem Mountains and connects the two regions.</p>
<p>It has become an important strategic base, and used to be protected by the humans since the strike of the Cobolts.</p>
<p>However, the Koaren Family and the Kenko Family from north drived the humans out of the temple, and it is currently dominated by the soldiers of the Kenko Family.</p>
<p><b>Secret Zone</b></p>
<p>Pernon's Tree gained vicious energy from the greed of elves that used to live in the Krem Mountains long, long ago.</p>
<p>The humans sealed Pernon's Tree and blocked its entrance.</p>
<p>Secret Zone leads to the root of Pernon's Tree and where the sealing spell was casted...</p>
<p><b>Root of Pernon's Tree</b></p>
<p>The lowest level of the temple where the root of Pernon's Tree is located.</p>
<p>Destructive Ranetan and dreary Driards live here.</p>

<p>Everyone is concentrating on Elston because of the Pernon's Tree. The Pernon's Tree incident ended fast, but there are still many problems to solve.</p>
<p>Huru Kenko and his supporters seem to have other plans and the Catsy seems to have secrets and actions of their own.</p>
<p>The Krem Mountains used to be an ordinary stone mountain. Its enormous secrets will reveal in Act 2.</p>
<p><b>Main Characters</b></p>
<p>Princess Charlotte Princess of the Catsy. Very elegant.</p>
<p>Princess Patrisha Princess Charlotte's younger sister. Princess of the Darksy.</p>
<p>Cenille Catsy's White Witch. Came to the Krem Mountains with Princess Charlotte</p>
<p><b>Places</b></p>
<p><b>Koaren Village</b> Where the Cobolts of the Koaren Family live. This is a very liberal place.</p>
<p>The shinbones in the center of the village are holy items to the Cobolts. The Cobolts throw the shinbones to a stone stand and pray for their wishes.</p>
<p><b>Krem Mountains</b> In the ancient times, the Krem Mountains were covered by luxurious forests and was inhabited by the elves.</p>
<p>However, all plants were dried or petrified by the curse of the Pernon's Tree and nothing has grown back in its infertilized soils</p>
<p><b>Shinbone Peak</b> The peak at which the great shinbone of the Cobolts is located.</p>
<p>The Cobolts perform a ritual here when they get a new Head to rule the village</p>
<p><b>Flat Peak</b> A weird ritual is being carried on here.</p>
<p>Its magic circle is identital to the seal of the Pernon's Tree.</p>
<p><b>Mountain Caves</b> Caves are located at many other locations in the mountains. The Cobolts that enjoy stone crafts beautifully decorated every entrance.</p>
<p>However, inside the caves is full of dreary spiders.</p>
<p><b>Shunela Dungeon</b> Where elves (currently dark elves) and the Cobolts made when they were living in the Krem Mountains together.</p>
<p>Deep inside the dungeon is a hidden altar</p>

<p>The poo rating index(PRI), is an index to measure the liquidicty of poo. The PRI is based on a number scale from 1.1-2.0, with 1.1 being more liquid and 2.0 being more solid. It has fast become popular with college students around the USA and canada, frequently talked about among friends and others to try and "gross out" the other person. The numbers from 1.3-1.6 describe common diarhea, while 1.1-1.2 are a little mor severe, and 1.7-1.9 are not as bad. The system uses the number two in reference to poo being referred to as number 2, or deuce(ie dropping a deuce.) Many people have different theories on which smell the worst, no theories are proven to this date and many believe that the liquidicty of the poo does not effect smell. It was created by college students so they could describe the texture and nastiest of their poo with one another without having to talk in vulgar phrases in public(IE student a and student b are at a restaurant. student a goes to the bathroom and tells student b he just had a 1.4).The number system is based as follows</p>
<p>1.1- very liquidy (much like rotten milk), liquid, with a few light lumps or bumps in it</p>
<p>1.2- much like 1.1, but a few more lumps and bumps</p>
<p>1.3- still very liquidy, but instead of lumps and bumps you have miniscule chunks (similar to oatmeal)</p>
<p>1.4- still more liquid than solid, but the chunks are bigger, much like</p>
<p>1.5- basically one decent sized chunk mostly solid but not very sturdy</p>
<p>1.6- little liquid comes out, chunk is a little bit more sturdy and dense the 1.5</p>
<p>1.7- loaf comes out, texture is soft and crumbly but usually stays in a solid form unless touched or breaks into two when contact with ground is made depending on size and height from which it is dropped</p>
<p>1.8- loaf comes out, a little more sturdy than 1.7(somewhat like a banana)</p>
<p>1.9- loaf comes out, very solid, yet still not quite a normal crap</p>
<p>2.0- normal, regular, crap. this Is solid as a rock and can be handled easily and without breakage. can float or sink, but stays very sturdy either way.</p>
