<li><b>keep</b> Certainly being a faculty member at a small college is not enough by itself for notability. But it does not actually <i>prevent</i> a person from being notable, and the publications listed are probably sufficient to show his stature, though not all of them are major law reviews. There is also his legal work; although it is not adequately documented in the article, it might be notable in its own right.

<li>the expected number depends on the field. Every subject and every specialty is different. There is no numerical formula, but I find that numbers help guide the discussion. Faculty at law schools tend to publish a lot, but as mentioned he isn't at one. Some but not all of the articles are in good journals. On balance, I think he's N as a lawyer who also makes contributions to the journal literature in his special field. And I am not happy with the argument, hesnotasgoodasmeandimnotinWP.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not sure if we're reading the same google news search. Your link shows that Alan W. Clarke was part of a team of attorneys for a handful of medical malpractice lawsuits and one representing an appeal for a man who burned down a seafood restaurant - of the ten cases listed none appear to be relevant to the death penalty and none appear to be notable (as in argued before the Supreme Court). In the past two decades he has argued less than a dozen cases before appeals, circuit, and federal courts. And he wrote a single guest commentary for the Salt Lake Tribune in 2005 - he is not a staff writer. Are you willing to find more suitable notability criteria because your comments don't match your references? <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:16, 10 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I took a look at some of the Willie LeRoy Jones stuff - interesting case. But the writeup in the NYT is 250 words on page 18 - not exactly a high profile article. If anything Alan W.

<li><b>Summary</b> Here's a summary of the facts that have been discovered about Alan W. Clarke<s>what we've agreed on so far</s>:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>He is a lawyer by profession who has a non-law faculty position at a non-selective four-year college</li>
<li>In the past two decades he has published about twenty papers, some in prestigious journals. None appear to be seminal works.</li>
<li><s>He has been involved in unknown capacity</s> Alan W. Clarke was one of three attorneys whose firms filed an unsuccessful stay of execution on behalf of Willie LeRoy Jones<s>with a death penalty case for Willie LeRoy Jones</s>. Mr. Jones' execution was covered with a 255 word article in the 1992 New York Times. Alan W. Clarke was not mentioned in the NYT article.</li>
<li>One of his papers was mentioned as "further reading" in a Ninth Circuit Court Handbook.</li>
<li>In 2005 he wrote an op-ed piece for the Salt Lake Tribune</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>As far as I can tell, no one other than Alan W. Clarke has written even a short summary of Alan W. Clarke's work. He has not been referenced as an "expert" in even local media articles (other than his op-ed piece) and he hasn't even yet published a book. In terms of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a> this still appears to be a no-brainer for <b>delete</b>. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 02:16, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>What do you mean that <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Valley_State_College_4029.html" title="Utah Valley State College">Utah Valley State College</a> is "non-selective"?

<dd>I'm simply saying that UVSC is not a "prestigious" university on the order of <a href="../../../i/v/y/Ivy_League_87c1.html" title="Ivy League">Ivy League</a> schools or CalTech. In other words, one cannot argue notability on the basis of institutional association alone.</dd>
<dd>And I am not trying to give the impression that we are "voting". I am trying to sum up what we know so far to keep discussion on track. Our last thread devolved into a discussion of Willie LeRoy Jones and some NYT article that doesn't even mention Alan W. Clarke. None of this proves notability. What I am looking for is someone to provide positive affirmation that this guy is notable. From the facts that folks have dredged up on the internet he clearly is not notable in terms of any wikipedia policy, guideline or criteria. I am not interested in opinion or voting. I am interested in someone digging up an independent fact or article that this guy is more than a junior faculty member at a "pretty good" college, of which there are thousands in this country, few of whom are notable by wikipedia criteria. If someone can prove me wrong I'm happy to let him stay. <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 08:11, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I missed the part of <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROFTEST_d942.html" title="WP:PROFTEST">WP:PROFTEST</a> that states a professor must teach at an ivy league and a college like <a href="../../../u/t/a/Utah_Valley_State_College_4029.html" title="Utah Valley State College">Utah Valley State College</a> is of marginal academic value. --<a href="../../../o/a/k/User%7EOakshade_5338.html" title="User:Oakshade">Oakshade</a> 09:29, 11 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not saying it does. There are some discussions on the talk page that propose that any Harvard professor, for example, is automatically notable, an argument with which I personally do not agree). I am trying to dissuade any argument of this fashion by explaining that UVSC doesn't quite fit in this category. Have you uncovered any further evidence of his notability? <a href="../../../i/r/e/User%7EIrene_Ringworm_a72d.html" title="User:Irene Ringworm">Irene Ringworm</a> 09:42, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><i>About different universities'</i>: it is really simple: a full professor at a major research university (or any major law school) is presumed to be encyclopedia-worthy, because nobody gets to such a position without having publish a major body of work. Associate professors at such universities might or might not be notable, because they almost by definition have published a smaller amount of important work, and Assistant Professors there analogously a only sometimes notable for the amount of work they have yet done.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>At other universities and colleges, the standards for a full professor are somewhat lower, and that is why they are not considered major research universities. Individual faculty there often do major work, and then they are notable; but since not everyone has done so, we must also check the notability of the work. (but remember that he is an Associate Professor. and an associate professor at Harvard Law School might still not yet be notable). We use the ranks and the nature of the schools in order to avoid having to do OR ourselves to determine what the academic world thinks of them.</dd>
<dd>So being from UVSC is not a negative factor. There are excellent reasons why absolutely first rate people might choose to teach there, or at smaller colleges as well. It's just that we have to see something distinctive in its own right. I am not saying he isn't. I said "keep" at the start, and I continue to do so, because I regard his specialized legal writing as notable, especially the reliance made of it in the handbook for his Circuit. He is, in my opinion, a notable figure in the struggle against the death penalty, a very honorable choice of career. If it should happen the consensus doesn't think he's important enough yet, still he will probably do much more in the next year or two, and there's no prejudice against an article at that time.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 01:29, 12 March 2007 (UTC)
