<li>Because Tony has already indicated that VfU is not incumbent upon him and he will do whatever he feels like doing regardless of what anybody else thinks. <b>Speedy delete</b>, nn writer.

<li>Just count the keep votes, Zoe. If I'm on my own in this, where did those keep votes come from? And don't say it's because I added a bibliography. The original article already enumerated her published works. At the very least it should have been listed on VfD, not speedied. RC patrollers are good, they get rid of a lot of nonsense, but sometimes a good article gets caught in the crossfire, and that's where I come in. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:17, 1 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Mistakenly speedied by somebody, and then correctly undeleted by Tony. I don't see why Aaron and Zoe are wasting time contesting this. <i>"She has written several Poetry books in Farsi and has also translated the famous Shahnameh (the Epic of Kings) into French"</i> (in addition to being a Ph.D. from a French elite institution) may or may not make her notable (depending on the quality and reception of the publications), but is, at the very least, an assertion of notability. BTW, the article doesn't currently list her Persian production.

<li>Then I take it you agree we can skip the unnecessary <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/instruction_creep" class="extiw" title="m:instruction_creep">instruction creep</a> since I almost invariably only rescue and improve articles that are capable of surviving a VfD. I refuse to get involved in VFU because (1) Wikipedia undeletion policy says I don't have to and (2) it would be asking people to vote on the status of an article few of them could see and none of them could edit. It would be silly to engage in editing an encyclopedia with one hand tied behind one's back. Arbcom can make arbitrary decisions, we grant it that right. I won't grant <a href="../../../v/f/u/WP%7EVFU_e156.html" title="WP:VFU">WP:VFU</a> the right to make arbitrary and unaccountable decisions, permitting it to rubber stamp a deletion by one sysop, without the right of general scrutiny by all editors.

<li>It appears to be about the fact that I am able to perform actions of which he, personally, disapproves.

<li>Clearly, it's all three. By his admission, he's keeping score, so this restoration was in violation of <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>. What is so wrong with Tony doing what has been suggested to him by numerous editors and administrators in good standing: Use VfU.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Guys, I'm lucky enough not to know much about either Tony or Aaron or any of the others involved in the above discussion. What I <i>can</i> see is this:
<ul>
<li>The page was created with enough content for a stub and two assertions about notability ((1) the subject having published poetry and (2) her having translated the Epic of Kings). Note that <i>assertion <b>not</b> proof</i> of notability is required.</li>
<li>The page was speedy deleted per criterion A7, although it does not fulfill that criterion (because there <i>are</i> assertions). <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> explicitly states: <i>"If the assertion is disputed or controversial, it should be taken to VFD instead."</i></li>
<li>The page was directly undeleted by Tony Sidaway. Given that the deletion was out of process (as shown above), this action is acceptable. The <a href="../../../u/n/d/Wikipedia%7EUndeletion_policy_6fe1.html" title="Wikipedia:Undeletion policy">undeletion policy</a> explicitly states: <i>"If the page was obviously deleted "out of process" (i.e. not in accordance with current deletion policy), then a sysop may choose to undelete immediately. In such a case, the sysop who deleted the page should be informed of the undeletion and the reason for it. If deletion policy dictates that the undeleted page is a VfD candidate, please list it there."</i> From his contribution list though, Tony seems to have failed to inform the deleting sysop of the undeletion; also, he didn't immediately list the page here.</li>
<li>The page was deleted again (this time by another admin) with the rationale "Undeleted out of process", which is not a speedy deletion criterion. Tony restored it again, which is therefore again acceptable; but he did not inform the deleting sysop, which is again a mistake. This time, he listed the page here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So, the three sysops involved all made mistakes. But I think those mistakes alone haven't caused much harm to Wikipedia (we are here discussing the article, a consensus is going to emerge, and that's that). I think the most harm is caused by the above <i>violations of <a href="../../../f/a/i/WP%7EFAITH_32f0.html" title="WP:FAITH">WP:FAITH</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> by <b>sysops</b></i>. Please. This kind of discussion would have belonged to your user talk pages, or nowhere. I'm amazed that a plain editor like myself has to say this. <a href="../../../k/i/s/User%7EKissl_4f16.html" title="User:Kissl">Kiss</a><a href="../../../k/i/s/User_talk%7EKissl_a765.html" title="User talk:Kissl">L</a> 09:50, 2 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>You're right. I shouldn't let myself be provoked into responding. On the idea of listing the page the first time I undeleted, I don't think that would be in order. Since the article was obviously a good one and the precedents strongly suggested notability, there was no reason at that time to consider a VfD listing. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 11:03, 2 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You could try to play well with others. User:Lucky 6.9 deleted two articles which I thought should be kept, and I wrote him a note asking him if he would mind if I undeleted them, giving my reasoning. He agreed and thanked me for asking beforehand. If you had just communicated with the other admin involved beforehand, giving your reasoning, none of this kerfuffle would have occured. But you prefer, as you indicated above, to score points against others instead of working as a community. You are on record as having nothing but scorn for the VfU process, which others feel works just fine, and prefer to cowboy it alone instead of trying to garner consensus. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">Zoe</a> 19:49, September 3, 2005 (UTC)</li>
