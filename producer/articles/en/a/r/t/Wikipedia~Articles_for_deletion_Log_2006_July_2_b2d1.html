<li>These are true facts. They are in fact extremely tough and each bomb does damage an enemy building severly. They don't tell the reader advice, they only give them true facts. "Only one kirov is needed to destroy an entire enemy base" is a true fact. I once destroyed several bases with one kirov. This sentence does not tell the reader how to use one kirov to destroy an enemy base, only the fact that a kirov is capable of destroying an enemy base.--<a href="../../../t/a/i/User%7ETaidawang_ed93.html" title="User:Taidawang">Taida</a> 00:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

An AfD is to DECIDE over whether or not it should be deleted, and many a time it gets kept - these articles are only being CONSIDERED for deletion.

<li>There have been ample precedents that state-numbered highways are "notable". Thus the issue here is verifiability.

Unfortunately, Hawaii DOT does not seem to have any maps online. However, <b>my 1993 AAA road atlas shows this route</b>. That should at least minimally satisfy verifiability, and further sources can be gotten from DOT maps (which are often distributed to local libraries).

<li><b>Keep.</b> Per precedent, state highways are inherently notable and are kept, and as SPUI mentioned above, this one is verifiable.

<dd>Addendum – Just to clarify so that you don't think I'm just blindly supporting him, yes, I recognize he has made plenty of controversial edits, but the vast majority of these have (at least initally) been made in what I see as good faith and very few are out-and-out vandalism as you imply.

<li>Again, what verifiable evidence does the nom have for his assertion that the road no longer exists? Given that his extensive google searching failed to find any information (and missed the source I provided before SPUI), I would question how he now has this information. Furthermore, contrary to the assertion of nom's reversion of {{Hawaii State Highways}}, 4-digit HI route codes do exist.

By deleting this article, Wikipedia would be taking an implicit POV position that there is no such thing as the scientific study of race, and that anything that purports to be race science is actually "scientific racism": as that article describes it, "a publication or propaganda with the veneer of science which was fabricated to support a racist paradigm".

<li>"the concept of "race science" surely exists", maybe so, but if that exact term is not widely used (one relatively obscure book with the two words in that order isn't "widely used" IMHO) then it's a neologism, and this page has no reason to exist when the material is already covered (several times) elsewhere. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPete.Hurd_10f1.html" title="User:Pete.Hurd">Pete.Hurd</a> 15:31, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>OK, just give me a few minutes and I'll paste all of the <i>x-where-x-is-a-large-number</i> number of links that refer to race science. This is where semantics kills me. I should shut up now, as I have nothing more to say that won't make me look bad - other than that being afraid of words in a certain order certainly won't help clarify <s>truths</s> what notable sources have called truth. I still contend the most valid place to talk about race science is under <i>Race science</i>.

<li>I'm totally willing to be swayed by the evidence, you may well be right. Just show me the data.

<li>Well, subject keywords are always going to have "Race" and "Science" separately, but below is a small sampling of abstracts. As I get further into this I am amazed by the number of "race and..." articles on WP, which does mitigate my original concern to some extent. However, "Scientific racism", for example, is not much more "canonical" than "Race science" and "Racial science" combined, in a Google search. I still think the subject deserves a treatment that doesn't put the cart (scientific racism) before the horse (race science) so to speak, and a treatment that is not hidden within other articles, nor euphemized into oblivion. At this point, I would be content if "racial science" and "race science" redirected somewhere relevant.

<li>Basu, Kunal, <i>Searching blindly for the truth in black and white.</i> Times Higher Education Supplement; 1/6/2006 Issue 1724, p12-12, 2/3p. Abstract: "The author looks at <b>race science</b>. The philosophy of race science has not changed over time which centers on determining the cause of differences in human beings. The author conducted a fictional experiment in his novel titled "Racists" about a black and a white child who grew together in an isolated area. It is said that people are seekers of difference and sameness."</li>

"The category of "caste" has had a long history both in and out of the Indian subcontinent, one that is frequently intertwined with that of "race." From H. H. Risley's use of late-nineteenth century European <b>race science</b> in anthropometric research, to Max Müeller's articulation of the Aryan theory of race and pan-Africanist expressions of racial solidarity with the lower castes of India, caste has frequently been redefined and politicized by being drawn into wider discourses about race."</li>

<p>Non-notable biography, probably a vanity page. (One anon. user has been constantly updating it with new information about what is probably herself.) Note that the external link to her work (which has no page on wikipedia), the long details about her private hobbies and family life, plans for the future, politicans she likes, what major she has changed to during college, etc. It seems like she only has an entry because she supports "our next President, Mitt Romney".

<p><b>Delete</b>, with some reservations. Upon reviewing <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Bee_0854.html" title="National Geographic Bee">National Geographic Bee</a>, it appears that we currently have no articles about any of the winners; I just deleted the article about Felix Peng (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Felix_Peng_e479.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Felix Peng">AfD</a>). From the comments in this AfD and the other one, the general perception among Wikipedia editors is that the National Geographic Bee is not (yet) notable enough for winners to be get their own Wikipedia articles. Indeed, <a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzel_dc42.html" title="User:Orzel">Orzel</a> cites a New York Times article below which makes this very point: that the National Geographic Bee deserves more attention (which implies that it currently does not have it). Wikipedia is not in a position to push cultural trends, it merely reflects them.</p>
<p>Regarding <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, while Kyle Haddad-Fonda has been mentioned in some notable publications for his victory, the deletion hinges on the definition of "newsworthy event". As per the discussion below, and about Felix Peng, the National Geographic Bee is not currently seen by the Wikipedia community as a newsworthy event. If the perception of the NGB changes, or if Kyle makes other notable achievements, a recreation is a definite possibility.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:16, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

I have to disagree with <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMike_Halterman_044d.html" title="User:Mike Halterman">Mike H.</a> that the winners of major national geography and spelling bees (i.e. the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Geographic_Bee_0854.html" title="National Geographic Bee">National Geographic Bee</a> and the <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee_d757.html" title="Scripps National Spelling Bee">Scripps National Spelling Bee</a>) do not merit articles. I see that <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katharine_Close_47e6.html" title="Katharine Close">Katharine Close</a>, the 2006 winner of the Scripps National Spelling Bee, has her own article, as do <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Guey_a0a9.html" title="Wendy Guey">Wendy Guey</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/b/Rebecca_Sealfon_be23.html" title="Rebecca Sealfon">Rebecca Sealfon</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/d/Jody-Anne_Maxwell_8095.html" title="Jody-Anne Maxwell">Jody-Anne Maxwell</a>, and <a href="../../../n/u/p/Nupur_Lala_6743.html" title="Nupur Lala">Nupur Lala</a>, the 1996-1999 SNSB champions.

No one seems to be clamoring for any of these articles to be deleted (although maybe someone will, now that I've pointed this out), and yet I don't see which <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability criterion</a> they satisfy but Kyle does not. For the sake of consistency, either every (reasonably recent) winner of both of these competitions should have his or her own article, or else none of them should. I support the former option - after all, both of these competitions are aired annually on national television, so they aren't insignificant. Furthermore, if you view academic competitions as equivalent to sports, then both Kyle and Katharine Close clearly qualify under the "competitor at the highest level in amateur sports" criterion. Equating academic competitions with sports is a debatable convention, I concede, but Wikipedia should at least give national champions the benefit of the doubt. (As a final note, I also take issue with Mike H.'s contention that people who "go on to lead pretty ordinary lives" should be barred from Wikipedia. Wikipedia - and, indeed, any encyclopedia - has hundreds of articles about people who "go on to lead pretty ordinary lives" after some major event which makes them noteworthy.) <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDiplomacy_Guy_1757.html" title="User:Diplomacy Guy">Diplomacy Guy</a> 14:17, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I understand your point but on the other hand the existence of articles of dubious importance cannot really support keeping another one. I think that it is also important to understand that the "competitor at the highest level" implicitly refers to some sort of notability of the competition. I don't think many would support the creation of multiple pages for the winner of the world horseshoes championship or the winner of the most delicious pie contest in Slovakia. Also, the spelling bee competition is much more well-known than the corresponding geography contest even if the latter is now on TV since it is organized by the National Geography network. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 17:23, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I share your unwillingness to invite the creation of dozens of frivolous pages about insignificant competitions, but I would argue that the Geographic Bee passes the notability test. National Geographic says that the Geographic Bee "involves nearly 5 million students annually" <a href="http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=factSheets_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1052839802576" class="external autonumber" title="http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=factSheets_detail&amp;siteID=1&amp;cid=1052839802576" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>; I couldn't find a comparable figure for the Spelling Bee, but that seems like a lot. Also, while the Spelling Bee is more than sixty years older than the Geographic Bee, the two have been televised for about the same amount of time: the Spelling Bee since 1994, the Geographic Bee since 1998 (and on PBS, not just National Geographic's network). <a href="../../../d/i/p/User%7EDiplomacy_Guy_1757.html" title="User:Diplomacy Guy">Diplomacy Guy</a> 22:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

For all the attention that continues to be accorded to the National Spelling Bee, from a feature film (<i>Akeelah and the Bee</i>) to a prize-winning documentary (<i>Spellbound</i>) to a Broadway musical (<i>The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</i>), the less-heralded Geography Bee is more relevant. After all, we live in a global age, when events in far-flung countries have as much impact as those close to home. It stands to reason that knowing where these places are would be an invaluable skill.”</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But back to Mr. Haddad-Fonda, I do not think that Mr. Haddad-Fonda has “lead pretty ordinary” life as stated by Mike H (It should also be pointed out that Mr. Halterman LOST to Mr. Haddad-Fonda.) Besides being a Geo Bee champion he: was Captain of the US team in the International Geography Olympiad, was a Phone-a-Friend, was a Presidential Scholar, lead his High School Knowledge Bowl to the finals of National High School Quiz Bowl, wrote an article for the Concord Review, and raised money to promote geography. Of course none of these things are as newsworthy as wining the National Geo Bee (expect the International Geography Olympiad. The Seattle Post Intelligencer sent a reporter to cover the event, because Mr. Haddad-Fonda was involved.), but they do prove that Mr. Haddad-Fonda is not ordinary, especially for the 19 year old. Which brings me to my last point. Who would be interested in knowing who this person is anyway? Simple answer: The same type of people that would be interested in who won the National Spelling Bee. What type of person is this? The type of person that wants to know what it takes to win a competition like the Geo Bee or the Spelling Bee. There are over 5 million kids involved with the Geo Bee plus their parents, who would love to know what it takes to be champion. Therefore the Geo Bee is relevant and important, making Kyle Q. Haddad-Fonda no mere ordinary person. --<a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzel_dc42.html" title="User:Orzel">Orzel</a> 02:30, 5 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Orzel: The amount you know about Kyle Haddad-Fonda is quite astounding. I simply must disagree with you. Millions of people watch the spelling bee every year, and consequently the contestants are brought into the public spotlight. The national geography bee is not nearly as well known as the Spelling Bee. Even if kids and there parents do in fact visit Kyle Haddad-Fonda's wikipedia page, they don't find "what it takes to win" they find two sentences about Kyle Haddad- Fonda.</dd>
<dd>I am really frightened by what you know about Kyle. Much of it was not in the article or in the links. For example, I couldn't substantiate what you said about his participation in high school Quiz Bowl, and I only found reference to Concord Review when I specifically searched for that with Kyle's name. Which makes me wonder who are you? Perhaps you are justified in not identifying yourself, after the criticism of Mike H. However, it seems that you either a stalker, a close friend, or family member of Kyle or even Kyle himself, which explains your impassioned plea to keep the article. It is important that the decision to delete a biographical article not be based on how many of the subject's friends vote, but based on the actual content of the article. In the case that you are Kyle Haddad-Fonda, a person as smart as you should realize that Wikipedia has certain standards, and that there are many fine people without articles.--<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkrnsk_54b8.html" title="User:Akrnsk">Akrnsk</a> 17:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry to tell you this but I have never met Kyle and we are not related. How do I know so much? Its because I am a very good researcher. Which was what I was doing, when I found this discussion. On a quite July 4th morning, I was doing research on the Civil War in Troy, NY. I decide to google information on James Robert Fonda, who was involved in a pre-Civil War dispute (if you want more information on this I would be happy to tell you). Which, lead me to the Fonda Genealogy Website. I noticed that one of his descendants was Kyle Haddad-Fonda, and believe it or not I actually recognized the name, but I was not sure why. So, I googled Haddad-Fonda’s name, which lead me to Wikipedia. And then everything click together. I remembered that I actual watched that particular Geo Bee, and about a year later I heard his name in relationship to a now defunct website called Worldwise Worldwide (which came to my attention when I was working for State Education Dept. It was a really impressive website, but I digress.)</dd>

<dd>I noticed that Haddad-Fonda entry was up for deletion. I truly feel that the champion of the Geo Bee should be given as much status as the National Spelling Bee champion, so I decided to put my two cents in. I believe that any argument should be based on the facts. So, I first took it upon myself to review all of the websites attached to his entry. (Which I found out later, by looking at the history, was placed there by the guy runs the Fonda Genealogy Website. Who attempted to expand the entry, but his information was deleted since it was not his own.) Then I did research on Google, Lexis Nexus, and the New York Times. This only took a couple of hours, and I have to admitted that the more I read about him the more I was impressed. At some point, I will expand the entry, <b>if everyone agrees to keep it.</b></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I apologize for the attack. The tone was getting a little bit aggressive with the attack on the respected Wikipedian Mr. Halterman, and I followed suit - I should not have. Now, I will try again to address the points that you raised. First, I do not disagree with you that Kyle Haddad-Fonda has some amazing accomplishments. It isn't easy to win the Geography Bee. You say that "the champion of the Geo Bee should be given as much status as the National Spelling Bee champion." First, Wikipedia is not about status. Biography articles are intended provide information to people who are intersted about the subject - not to confer status upon the subject. The argument about Spelling Bee versus Geography Bee is not a subjective question of the merits of spelling and geography, it is a more objective question of interest. The Spelling Bee is broadcast on primetime television and has millions more viewers than the Geography Bee. Thus there is much more interest in the winners than the Spelling Bee.</dd>
<dd>Even if the Geography Bee generated enough interest as the Spelling Bee, it would be difficult to justify a Wikipedia entry for Kyle. The vast majority of past winners of the Spelling Bee do not have entries, and those that do have gone on to do something that would generate additional interest in them. For example <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacques_Bailly_70d4.html" title="Jacques Bailly">Jacques Bailly</a> the winner of the 1980 bee is now the official pronouncer for the bee. His article is certainly worthwhile; people who watch the bee hear that his name, look him up on Wikipedia and find out that he actually won the bee in 1980. A few are less notable - <a href="../../../w/e/n/Wendy_Guey_a0a9.html" title="Wendy Guey">Wendy Guey</a> for example, but I must agree with Tesson: "existence of articles of dubious importance cannot really support keeping another one." In fact, if the final decission is to delete the page about Kyle, I will propose the delition of Guey's page.</dd>
<dd>One last thing, it is customary to only vote once on a proposed deletion. Perhaps you can change the heading on your second vote to "Comment" rather than "Keep"--<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkrnsk_54b8.html" title="User:Akrnsk">Akrnsk</a> 20:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Orzel makes an excellent point. Wikipedia is great, not only because it serves as some sort of showcase for famous people, but because it teaches the public about these people. While some might dismiss the Geo Bee as irrelevant, that is a very subjective judgment, and also rather shortsighted. Who knows how much popularity Geo Bee will gain in the future. But besides, more importantly, we must recognize that what Wikipedia needs is not less info but more. So Pascal.Tesson doesn't feel we need information on Mr. Haddad-Fonda. So what? Even if there were a million Pascal.Tesson's around, if there is one person who wants information on Mr. Haddad-Fonda, there should be that information. If Mike H. feels uncomfortable reading about Mr. Haddad-Fonda for personal reasons, that should not limit the ability of others who might feel inspired by Mr. Haddad-Fonda's story. First Sea Lord 8:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> It seems as if the high-minded self-styled "guardians" of Wikipedia simply cannot behold the fact that Mr. Haddad-Fonda has accomplished more in 17 years than most people will accomplish in their entire lives. In any event, despite all of his achievements to date, Mr. Haddad-Fonda continues to spend his time improving his abilities and relentlessly fine-tuning his mind, while others merely waste away their hours trolling Wikipedia in search of articles to delete as a way of brushing their own egos and inflating their sense of self-importance. Furthermore, those who wish to delete this entry are doing little more than delaying the inevitable, as an expanded entry of Mr. Haddad-Fonda -- who has always, not by luck or fortune but by dint of hard work and determination, pushed himself to levels of the mind that few can comprehend -- an expanded entry will necessarily be created in the future, rendering your current work meaningless. Down in North Carolina, some basketball coach's claim to fame -- his epitaph -- is that he cut Michael Jordan from his high school basketball team. Numerous publishers rejected the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series -- over 100, in fact -- before little-known Health Communications saw its potential, and the result has been tens of millions of dollars in revenue, as well as embarrassment for the rest of those publishers who trusted their egos so much that they blinded themselves from a series that connected with the values that have always made us human. All of you who wish to "Delete," I'm sure, care about Wikipedia, and perhaps, in some far-off way, care about Kyle and believe in his future and the contributions that he can make to this country and our world. So think before you act. Reflect not just on Mr. Haddad-Fonda's life, and all the potential therein, but on your own life, and what sort of legacy you wish to leave. Most of us are, in fact, "ordinary beings," which is perfectly all right. But let there be no doubt that all of us, if just in some small way, are remembered, and that as our story fades into the stream of history, it leaves its own small -- and indelible -- imprint. After you live a good long life, and they publish your obituary fifty years from now, let me implore you -- You do not want the first sentence of your obituary to say that you were an instrumental part of the movement to deny one of the great men of the 21st Century, Mr. Haddad-Fonda, a wikipedia entry. - The Reaganite</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I think you and First Sea Lord are right. Wikipedia is valuable because it teaches the public about famous people, not because it is a showcase for famous people. Kyle Haddad-Fonda's page as it stands now is a little more than a <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_page.html" title="Vanity page">Vanity page</a>. Please note that I said "a little more." It is a little bit more than the vanity page described in the article. The question of noteworthiness is what we are debating now. Wikipedia strives to have articles that are useful and relevant today. If it tried to document every individual who showed some potential - if it tried to follow every up and coming youth, Wikipedia would not only be faced with an insurmountable task, it would be a mess of nearly worthless autobiographies. Wikipedia is not a book publisher. Book publishers speculate as to the success of the works and make a decision based on what they believe the future of a book holds. Wikipedia articles document what has happened, it <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">is not a crystal ball</a>. It is possible that Kyle Haddad-Fonda will become a "one of the great men of the 21st Century," and when that day comes, I will fully support the creation of his Wikipedia page, however until that day comes, his Wikipedia page will remain frivolous.--<a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkrnsk_54b8.html" title="User:Akrnsk">Akrnsk</a> 17:39, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I feel it that is strange that <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkrnsk_54b8.html" title="User:Akrnsk">Akrnsk</a> never refuted my main argument, but attack my intentions. If anyone wants to know my intentions can see my comments responding to <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkrnsk_54b8.html" title="User:Akrnsk">Akrnsk</a>. But, my main points still stand. The Geo Bee is an important competition that involves millions of students each year. Furthermore, as Mr. Haddad-Fonda has shown, its champions are interviewed by many prominent news outlets. It would be a disservice to Geo Bee to “downgrade” its champions, while showcasing the champions of the Spelling Bee. Honestly, I can see millions of participants of Geo Bee, who would interested in knowing the backgrounds of the past champions, which is reason effort to kept this entry. --<a href="../../../o/r/z/User%7EOrzel_dc42.html" title="User:Orzel">Orzel</a> 20:07, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I've removed all the unsourced content... which is to say all of it... and placed it on the talk page. I personally have no objection to this topic whatsoever, believe most of the content is probably valid, but all of it, like all of WIkipedia, is subject to the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> policy. If people wish to find sources for the items and move them back into the article as sources are found, I think it would be a perfectly acceptable article. I'm not going to vote yet; I want to see whether there's any evidence that the editors of the page are willing to do the minimal research work needed to make this a legitimate article. When there are at least a dozen sourced entries in the article, and no unsourced entries, I'll suggest "strong keep" and lobby everyone who's suggestion deletion to change their suggestion. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:21, 2 July 2006 (UTC) P.

<li>Comment: I wouldn't call it a <i>vandal</i> magnet, but if you take a look at the history over the last few days you will see that it is certainly an <i>original research</i> magnet. A couple of dozen entries have been made, all by non-logged-in-users, all of unsourced material, often without even a definition. I tried to contact one of these editors on <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User_talk%7E71.146.144.130.html" title="User talk:71.146.144.130">their Talk page</a>, with no luck.

These articles (along with a number of others) were nominated for deletion in March 2006.

<li><b>Comment</b> This seems very contradictory to me (the nominator). If this school has so much notability, then why isn't it spoken of on the page, and why aren't any external references spoken of. Should a High School the size of Columbine be listed? Should <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_85e4.html" title="Columbine High School">Columbine</a> be listed? Those are two different questions. My own High School isn't listed on Wikipedia, and I doubt it should be, but it services an area of over 60,000 people sharing that with only one other school. It's huge. So what? I have nothing against schools and this isn't personal. I base my nominations strictly on the quality of the article at hand. Two of the references were broken, and all three were to the same primary source. Is there anything else in the world that points out that this school is somehow notable above other schools? I see many say yes, but, the article disagrees. Ste4k 17:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just took another look. There is one reliable secondary source that says the school is "very good". Aren't there any sort of notable publicity ads, or articles, or newspaper refs, or did anyone die there, ghosts, visits from the Queen, any kind of "Hey this school was THAT one!" sort of thing? I don't mean to sound unfair or against schools, but there are literally hundreds of thousands of schools in the world. I think that this article is safe from being deleted from the looks of things. About the comment below about templates, though, they're a joke that start edit wars, get reverted and ignored. They haven't any policies written on their enforcement, they perform a good job when an editor is applying the tag to their own article to attract help from the general environment, but that's about it.

<li><b>Delete</b> Nothing in the article even hints at notability. Existence isn't notable. Having tennis courts and a lot of Jewish students isn't notable. It's poorly referenced and not even useful to anyone looking for information about the school, since most of the content comes directly from the website anyway. <a href="../../../o/p/a/User%7EOpabinia_regalis_4201.html" title="User:Opabinia regalis">Opabinia regalis</a> 17:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> — Obviously I disagree with the usual arguments for deletion. But notability is a relative term anyway. I find nothing abhorent in the idea of Wikipedia including encyclopedic articles on High Schools. For a substantial portion of the population it is their last formal education, and high schools often form perhaps the most notable institution in many smaller towns. There are many pages on wikipedia I find profoundly trivial, so I have no difficulty in continuing to support the existence of articles on valid high schools. They are substantial institutions with character and histories that influence a significant number of people over the course of their existence.</li>
<li>As for the original premise for the deletion, these sort of issues should be handled through appropriate templates first. I don't see by the history that any such attempt has been made. The <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> section titled "problem articles with alternatives to deletion" should have been utilized in preference to a deletion attempt. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="../../../r/j/h/User_talk%7ERJHall_bed4.html" title="User talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 19:31, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Finally, it's been around for almost 2 years and seen over 50 edits by multiple editors, including over a dozen with named accounts (note: I'm not including vandalistic edits and reversions in these numbers). I just don't even see why this article has gone to AfD when Wikipedia has 1000s of much worthier potential candidates.

<dd>I don't see any of these other articles referenced. From the perspective of this article alone, it is unsourced. If indeed what you say is correct, then how is that verified in this article? Per the notability of the topic of this article, there are literally thousands of people in the U.S.A. that can be considered wealthy and/or businessmen. There doesn't appear to be any historic significance to this particular man, compared to, for example, J.P. Morgan whom the article identifies itself with. J.P.Morgan associated with several thousand wealthy individuals in the course of his life. What makes this person any more significant than anyone else? If you feel that the article should be merged, then perhaps you should make that clear. Thanks. Ste4k 08:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I still don't see how it's original research nor unverifi<i>able</i>. There are claims of notability and also by association but you haven't evaluated them except to say he is less notable than J. P. Morgan.

I think that's more notable than bloggers who have Wikipedia articles. I'm sure there was plenty of media coverage in his time, but it was just before the time of the Internet so we don't see it on Google news. <span class="user-sig user-Quarl"><i>—<a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuarl_316b.html" title="User:Quarl">Quarl</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../q/u/a/User_talk%7EQuarl_d4ef.html" title="User talk:Quarl">talk</a>)</sup> <small><a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>-<a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2.html" title="July 2">07-02</a> 09:33Z</small></i></span>

<li>It is your job as someone nominating for deletion to make sure the article warrants deletion. When using google result for deletion, it might be a good idea to actually look through the results. When a google search contains common words, you can expect millions of hits. When it doesn't - in the case of this name - you can't expect as many, so you are required to actually look at them to see wether the article actually lacks notability. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 11:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The article does not mention this award, if they are notable they should be asserted and proved. If its true I believe my objection would be nullified. However, nothing in the source suggests that any of the performances of his works were or are part of a tour or of any significance, and nothing in that source indicates that he has even gone on a national tour. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247"><font style="background:maroon" color="gold"><big><i><b>SM247</b></i></big></font></a><sup><a href="../../../s/m/2/User_talk%7ESM247_f99f.html" title="User talk:SM247"><font color="darkblue"><b>My Talk</b></font></a></sup> 06:40, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So you're saying that doesn't prove it was a tour, but it could be a series of single dates. That's possible too.

The problem is that the anti-Bush sites imply that it was written by the sitting Congress in opposition of the war on terror. --<a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKainaw_88a4.html" title="User:Kainaw">Kainaw</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../k/a/i/User_talk%7EKainaw_1209.html" title="User talk:Kainaw">(talk)</a></sup></small> 15:06, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I think this report was real ... but the "93" prefix in the number refers to the 93rd Congress, which means the report dates from 1973 or 1974. That would also mean that the report would not have been able to take into consideration 50 U.S.C. sec. 1601, which states, "All powers and authorities possessed by the President, any other officer or employee of the Federal Government, or any executive agency, as defined in section 105 of title 5, as a result of the existence of any declaration of national emergency in effect on September 14, 1976, are terminated two years from September 14, 1976." The article should be deleted if it remains in current form, but kept if it becomes more accurate before the AfD ends, so <b>no vote</b> from me yet. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 18:38, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>If the document was real, a government source would be very easy to come up with.

<li><b>Delete</b> I think the comments above show the verifiability of such an article. The external source was <i>down</i> by the way.

<p><s>*<b>Delete</b> - this sounds like one of those things that usually ends with "if you value your freedom, SEND THIS EMAIL to 10 friends RIGHT NOW.

Unfortunately, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/" class="external free" title="http://thomas.loc.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://thomas.loc.gov/</a> doesn't go back prior to the 101st congress ... so it isn't easy to verify that the resolution really exists.

<p>This article has no context, little content, and no suggestion of why it is important. I have provided all the English language results of Vertissage art I could find on Google to provide context. Even these links do not seem to explain why this is a significant project. One artist seems to be practicing Vertissage (Rainer Schulz) and no one seems to have thought he deserved inclusion in Wikipedia thus far. It is possible that a German speaker could enlighten me as to why this is significant since the original language of the project seems to be German.

<p>Contested <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a>. The reason given was: <i>There is no widely recognized fach called "piccolo." This appears to be something invented by fans to describe singers who have high voices and are particularly proficient in the flageolot register. It is covered quite adequately by the various sorts of "coloratura," all of which terminology is widely used</i>. I concur with this. According to <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifamilymang_ce87.html" title="User:Antifamilymang">George</a>, who added the original tag, this does not appear in any of the standard music references, e.g., Grove's Dictionary, Harvard Dictionary, a google of the phrase "piccolo coloratura" returns only 14 hits, and a google of "piccolo soprano" returns 652, most of which are instrumentation lists, e.g., "bassoon, flute, piccolo, soprano." At least one of the names originally listed was removed, as being incorrectly attributed (not a surprise given that there appears to be no provable currency for the term in the first place). I call neologism. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 12:00, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Link 1 is a Geocities website which is now mostly non-functional. There's no way of knowing what expertise the anonymous owner has on the topic of vocal classification. Link 2 is just a copy of link 1. Link 3 doesn't actually use "piccolo coloratura soprano," it merely lists certain instruments that it considers similar: "The piccolo, coloratura voice, French horn, harp and dulcimer represent the highest mode, that of winter." Link 4 is your best bet, as it has actual singers using the term. --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntifamilymang_ce87.html" title="User:Antifamilymang">George</a> 21:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. As in many fields, there is plenty of neologism in musical vocal fach (often for the best of reasons, for instance regarding countertenors/falsettists/male sopranos/haute-contre/male alto etc)). The above rationales say this term does not appear in standard references. My personal offline query to two professional classical singers (one of whom is a professional teacher in a top North American conservatory) generated blank stares. The links provided are not currently notable enough. Maybe we'll add this in a few years if it gains currency, but right now not appropriate for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 03:10, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I had added it under the trivia section that she was dubbed the "piccolo coloratura" for her efforts in instrumentation, but as of now (until my grandmother mails me that old copy of a Jet magazine article on her), I had no reliable source.

<p>The result of the debate was</p>
<p><b>Deleted.</b> While the article describes a notable conspiracy theory, its narrative was that of the conspiracy theorists, and no reliable sources were cited. If an article on this topic is to be written, it needs to be based on <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">reliable sources</a>, such as books or papers by notable historians, and rewritten from scratch. To anyone who wants to work on an encyclopedic narrative about this topic, I'd be happy to provide a copy of the most recent revision; it might also be a good idea to do this in a consolidated article about Nazi conspiracy theories (or a similar title). See also: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Haunebu_9580.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Haunebu">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Haunebu</a>.</p>
<p>Should an article again be created under this title without the use of reliable sources, I would advise admins to speedy-delete it as a recreation. Topics like this need to be dealt with care and diligence, in a serious scholarly manner.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:11, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Hitler comic book, 2000 by Alexey Lipatov</i> as a source and <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> as a see also.</p>
<p>The reason for deletion depends on how to read this mess:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is seen as a article on WWII history, it should immediately annihilated for not having and never will have reliable sources.</li>
<li>If this is seen as an article about the beliefs of a small group of neo-nazis, free energy freaks, and UFO-adherents, the current version of the article is severely misleading, and an actual article about the subject may better start from a blank page (or from a translation of <a href="../../../../de/index.html" class="extiw" title="de:">de:</a> articles). Questions of relevance and self-promotion of book publisher like "Ice-Reich" also appear.</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I agree with the nominator that the best approach to this article would be to start again from scratch, but I also think that it's a reasonably encyclopaedic topic (either as a common fictional device or an element of UFO theory).

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This is intentionally misleading information and should not be kept in Wikipedia. These Nazi UFO names thought up by ice reich publishing aren't even worth mentioning. In German wikipedia they either don't exist or lead to a "Reichsflugscheibe" page that begins with the following words:</li>
</ul>
<p>"Unter dem Begriff Reichsflugscheiben wird ein Mythos behandelt, wonach untertassenförmige Flug- und Raumfahrzeuge im Dritten Reich gebaut und getestet worden sein sollen. Historisch und technisch gibt es keine Belege, jedoch taucht das Thema in der pseudowissenschaftlichen Literatur gelegentlich auf." Under the term "Reichflugscheiben" a mythos is meant, following to which saucerformed Aero- and Spaceflight machine in third Reich are supposed to have been built and tested. Historically and technically there are no proofs, but this topic appears sometimes in pseudoscientific literature.</p>
<p>The whole article is quite good and acceptable and could be taken to a page for esoretic hitlerism or ufology in the english wikipedia, but there is really no need in tons of bulldung on that topic currently avaible in the english wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>, sure it's probably not factual, although being a student of Nazi Mysticism I do know that their scientific divisions did explore into every area - and I wouldn't doubt they would attempt creating such aircraft seeing as it was Nazi scientists who were later taken by both the U.S. and U.S.S.R. governments alike to help and work on their space programs and were the scientists who took us to the Moon, space and built stealth to name but a few things. In any case whether it's factual or not this topic has been heavily discussed by conspiracy theorists and UFO nuts and it's well known - I have cleaned up the article to remove the vandalism that others have added and believe with a good rewrite and notice that this is purely based on unfactual records and legends that this article would prove itself to be worthy of WP. Not everything on WP is factual, it just needs to be stated so. This is by no means part of "military history", I would go further into categorizing it under pseudoscience, Nazi mysticism or Nazi conspiracies (an article which has yet to be put together). <a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPiecraft_05e4.html" title="User:Piecraft">Piecraft</a> 10:13, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article's history only shows that "A Man in Black" has nominated the article for deletion. Numerous anon editors wrote the article. I think that Black should remove all the unsourced information that he/she added to the article, then renominate the article. Much of the article was written in April and May, when citing sources was not viewed as critical as it is now. Maybe that's just my perspective. Some of the information might be verified by just visiting the website. I don't think that there needs to be an independent source to verify that "the sky is blue" when anyone can look at the sky to know its blue. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil">Royalbroil</a> 12:53, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Just a comment - Nathan certainly is a real person, whether he is notable is entirely up to you! The death part is mainly a mockery of what is basically a very silly page - look at the comedic work names - not posted by myself I hasten to add!. Alspittle 21:26, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes Nathan certainly is a real person. I am a realtive of his and have been for quite some time! His 'comedic works' are silly indeed, and it was the sillyness that made them comedic works. Whether or not Nathan plans to release any of his work for download on the internet is debatable. May I suggest you contact his agent? I am a little troubled by the so called 'death' of Nathan. I can assure you that he is well and truly alive and still performing on the festival circuit. This page was brought to my attention by my long term companion.</li>

This was due to the fact that the nominator had removed the AfD tag, most of the delete comments were made prior to the articles clean up and a review of the article lead me to believe that there was enough of a claim of notability. Therefore, I am listing all three articles with no opinion to keep or delete. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 14:26, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I am aware that djedamrazuk (a 22 yr old kid - a close relative to me, who wanted to help me get my pages up and kinda screwed it all) did some bad things here. However, I have tried to clean the mess up, DarkAudit was of big help and I thought it was all settled. I really don't see the reason to remove the pages now. They are not violating wikipedia rules &amp; regulations and everybody can communicate to me directly, as the real author of all the artwork posted. But, if you decide to remove my pages - I guess there's nothing i can do about it really. --Hariscizmic 15:07, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>In the light of everything that happened, i sincerely apologize but I don't think there was any sockpuppetry on AXA (band) page or Adisa Cizmic page. All the discussion mentioned was directly connected to Haris Cizmic profile page- which, in case of punishment, shoud be the only one removed. I do believe my young relative, that he deleted those AfD tags not knowing "what's that for". For everything else, I have already apologized. --Hariscizmic 15:36, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> A good-faith effort was made to fix the Haris Cizmic page. The pages should stand on their merit alone, not because of the behavior of a few. Once the hubbub died down, the process went fairly smoothly (pretty much after I commented 'stop the sockpuppetry and put that effort into fixing the page.'). All three are notable. I nominated the band for AfD as NN, but quickly rescinded after further research. The articles as they stand now meet Wikipedia standards. If the editors do not, sanction them instead. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 15:40, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../h/a/r/Haris_Cizmic_0038.html" title="Haris Cizmic">Haris Cizmic</a> for non-notability.

<li><b>Comment</b> from the comments on the talk pages regarding the renominations, it would appear that this is at the edge of being a bad-faith nomination in retribution for the sockpuppetry involved in the Haris Cizmic discussion. I originally nominated the page, and withdrew it on the merits of the effort to fix the page. Editors other than the sockpuppets worked on getting the page up to standards. Why should they be punished? Is it Wikipedia policy to delete pages merely on the basis of sockpuppets, in spite of the merits of the page on it's own or the efforts of other editors on that page? --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 16:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I was about to list this for speedy as a non-notable professor but then I saw the "Interim President" line. Smith College is a notable college, but I wonder if an interim president (one who was jsut there until they could finish their candidate search) is notable enough to have an article.

<li><b>Comment</b> Then pull it off, I am convinced that there are various groups that can disregard policy for whatever reasons. I read the previous AfD Striver, but there isn't any evidence in that article about anything that answers my nomination reasons. This is not about the content of this particular web site. This is about the lack of content about this web site anywhere else. The article needs to address and establish a reasonable atmosphere of trust with the reader that it isn't just some sort of hoax, or group of people in a basement making things up. Are there any articles in newspapers? Any awards given? Any mention by other established publishers, etc? The content itself has not been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself. The website or content has not won a well known and independent award, either from a publication or <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">organisation</a>. The content is not distributed via a site which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster. Those are the criteria to meet. And there isn't anything in that article that suggests that it meets those. Why not? Ste4k 23:51, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In regard to mainstream then, I guess it's okay if I have an article about my own small buisness' and web sites? They certainly aren't going to get any mainstream coverage, and they also don't report what the mainstream reports. Have you considered that <i>The Rolling Stone</i> was one time considered anti-establishment? I think it's a rather <b>hypocritical</b> argument that a <b>dissident</b> newsletter should be <b>established</b> in an encyclopedia that regards <b>consensus</b> paramount. Don't you? Regarding the inappropriate use, your comment is incorrect regarding my gender, and neither my gender nor comments regarding me personally have anything to do with discussing this article.

Well, that is not correct, we dont include article on the merit that everyone likes them, rather, that they are notable. And i view a site that has been linked to by <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.dissidentvoice.org%2F&amp;url=www.dissidentvoice.org%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.dissidentvoice.org%2F&amp;url=www.dissidentvoice.org%2F" rel="nofollow">1,078 other sites</a> as a notable site. If you create a article about your garage, and you manage to have 1,078 other sites link to you, then i would considering voting keep to your site as well. Consired <a href="../../../g/o/a/Goatse.cx.html" title="Goatse.cx">Goatse.cx</a>, it will be impossible to get a afd through for it, but it has only been linked to by <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.goatse.cx&amp;url=www.goatse.cx" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=www.goatse.cx&amp;url=www.goatse.cx" rel="nofollow">394</a> sites. As for "bro", you could just ask me to say "sis". As for "comments regarding me personally have anything to do with discussing this article"... sure, as you say.

<dd>Correction, you've misinterpreted my statment. Your words: "<i>you just stated that wikipedia uses consensus as a measure to include articles</i>". My words: "<i>an encyclopedia that regards <b>consensus</b> paramount.</i>". Given Alexa's <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alexa_Internet_43d9.html" title="Alexa Internet">limitations</a>, the use of Alexa as a factor to determine the notability or traffic patterns of an internet newsletter is not subjective of all Internet users. (Traffic logs of the site's servers, on the other hand, would be a far more accurate tool, but the use of traffic logs would constitute <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>.) It should also be pointed out here that the Alexa traffic rank for dissidentvoice.org is <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.dissidentvoice.org" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.dissidentvoice.org" rel="nofollow">113,783</a> which is far less than <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.nextdoornikki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?url=www.nextdoornikki.com" rel="nofollow">a teenage actress</a> who scores <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.nextdoornikki.com" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?q=&amp;url=www.nextdoornikki.com" rel="nofollow">3043</a> and it was <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Next_Door_Nikki_63bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Next Door Nikki">recently determined in AfD</a> that she wasn't notable either.

<li><b>Comment</b> Candidates on their own, even from a major party, does not in itself confer notability. The race could be in a tiny district that means little to the outside world, or the candidate could merely be a sacrificial lamb in a race where the only result in doubt is how much the margin of victory (as in most WV Senate races in the last 40-odd years). Just the act of running for congress isn't enough. There has to be something extra to command attention, such as a very heated campaign, outrageous views out of step with the rest of one's party, something like that. --<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkAudit_2f40.html" title="User:DarkAudit">DarkAudit</a> 03:43, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> - This is a very strict standard. Wikipedia isn't short of space, and any candidate in a statewide or larger race with even minimal publicity is likely to attract potential Wikipedia users who might want to find out something about their background. And as above, determining notability by electibility has, at least in the U.S., the very troubling implication that only Democrats and Republicans (plus maybe "spoilers" like Nader) can ever be notable - in our winner-takes-all system, in the foreseeable future third-party candidates will only win local elections, which is apparently not notable by this standard either... I don't think we want to reduce <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> to Wikipedia:Bipartisan point of view.<a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 18:37, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> You're missing my point. I'm saying that just because one may be the Democratic or Republican candidate for a Congressional district does not make one notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> - No, you're missing mine.&#160;:p Some Dem/GOP candidates would be excluded by your "electability" notability standard - but pretty much all third party candidates would be. That's one of the bigger problems with narrowing it that much, because it's not just a reduction in information it's a distinctly non-neutral one. <a href="../../../d/k/a/User%7EDKalkin_b2e5.html" title="User:DKalkin">Kalkin</a> 23:39, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep for References</b> The way I see it, it is obviously fanmade, but it might be smart to keep it around for future reference so up and coming Star Wars fans realize that there once was an idea of Grey Jedi. It also says at the bottom of the article, and becuase I played the game, in Star Wars Knights of the Old republic 2, there is an euippable item called a Grey Jedi Robe. So it must have something to do with the universe one way or another.</li>

<dd><b>Comment following up a vote below:</b> In terms of Star Wars creatures not contributing to the fame of their subject, I disagree: the tauntaun sliced open was not only a key plot point, but it gave viewers an interest in one of the creatures. The Banthas are often used in all Star Wars Tatooine settings. A major plot device of The Phantom Menace was swimming through the core and encountering numerous sea monsters and creatures, some of which were replicated with, say, legos. Creatures' sounds are also key to the sound/music feel of a scene. Clearly, a wide variety, no, a whole list Star Wars creatures played a major role in the films and the books, and so on. An option would be a <b>rewrite to an encyclopedic article</b> describing the <b>significance of creatures in relation to the Star Wars universe</b>; a rewrite that could begin soona nd be finished in a matter of days. Clearly, the topic of creatures in star wars has plenty of significance; it's the cruft safeguard that I'm most worried about. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 01:45, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> originally, I merged these into a list to get someone else to nominate it for deletion. However, we need to make sure that these <b>do not get their own articles in the future</b>. If someone can create an eneyclopedic article on star wars technology (or devices, in this case), then I would support that. Think of it this way; having one semi-guideline violation beats having 150 major guideline violations. The lesser of two evils is that this list remain as a "cruft dam" to provide potential for an encyclopedic shift and also to save on process, time, and lost ambition by new users with potential. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 18:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Those are some good points; and Wikibooks would be a solid place for this information. However, I still stand by my idea — we have seen a significant reduction in mini star wars articles in, for example, the creatures section. Additionally, it is still possible to provide citations, enhanced prose, and other things while still serving as a dam. Also, it (when done correctly) prevents any conflicts by providing a compromise. Containing it into a list may not work, but deleting this list and having fans create minor articles without knowing any better will, in essense, force us to deal with 80+ other AfDs. For example, one day I merged about 30 minor topics into a list. From that day on, users added their cruft to the list; not in their own articles. It saved on work, time, and it left the information grouped together for the possible chance of a encyclopedic turn. Look at <a href="../../../s/p/i/Spira_%28Final_Fantasy_X%29_c903.html" title="Spira (Final Fantasy X)">Spira (Final Fantasy X)</a>, which was originally a collection of about 20 articles. It is now a good article. <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_magic_c05e.html" title="Final Fantasy magic">Final Fantasy magic</a> used to be a list of magic spells. Or, heck, most of the other Final Fantasy pages for that matter. It can be done.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>At the same time, I would also like to address that Wikipedia is not paper, which means that having a cruft magnet (that, as a collective body, can actually be easily referenced and enhanced to try to adhere to <i>more</i> policies in order to bring it to a closer encyclopedic standard) won't divert attention away from our featured articles. As a matter of fact, if we have to deal with many minor stubs, it may have more of a chance of turning people off when they hit "random article".</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is a no win situation. I try to look at the side that has the chance of being the less damaging to the encyclopedia as a whole (and not just one policy or guideline). We keep the article, it's still keeping minor stuff on it. We don't keep the article, the cruft will spill out and alienate many users with potential (don't worry, I'm not one of them — I didn't contribute to this article outside of merges and janitorial work. the only thing I have to lose is edit count.). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 21:42, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Winning and losing appear to be biased means of judging. I prefer policy. At least I know that it was based on a consensus of those who came before me. If you think that policy is incorrect, then there are other places to discuss those. Ste4k 22:20, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>. Well, for Wikipedia, winning would be reaching the goal of having an online encyclopedia with encyclopedic information. Losing would be failing to attain that goal (and as I previously mentioned, deleting this list may cause more breaches in policy than this list (if it even has any), which means more disputes and the other points I mentioned above)). Policies help guide something to the goal, or help maintain that goal once it's attained. They serve as central rules that all articles strive to attain by constant editing and discussions on what meets them and what does not. On this specific level (in my interpretation), winning would be having no creaturecruft; losing would be having some sort of creaturecruft present. Wikipedia policy is known for being interpreted several ways; this is the main reason why it is often debated during AfDs. And yes, some of those are "fanboys", but unfortunately for the encyclopedia, fanboys often count toward consensus. Please note that I am not a fanboy, nor do I have any interest in this list; I am merely speaking on behalf of those who feel that this can and does meet policy, and serves other uses beneficial to the integrity of the encyclopedia.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>For example, when we talk about an indiscriminate collection of information, this is often held by a case by case basis because of the numerous other policies and guidelines, personal interpretations, and so on. In short; I may see something as meeting policy that you do not. On the topic of policy, creatures are common in every branch of Star Wars, which makes up hundreds of books, six featured movies, dozens of video games, hundreds of comics, and so on. If something is noticed from, say, six different sources, it will obviously be more notable than some of the stuff that already meets policy because the human mind makes connections. If I remember correctly, that line about "it is famous in association with the topic of the list" was put in as a safeguard to keep lists that have some sort of notability, but still serve as "lists of information".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While I personally think that most of these creatures should only be mentioned in a synopsis (at most), the policy as I see it seems to overrule my own opinion in terms of this list's usage for enhancing the encyclopedia's content (and not its structure — that's the "cruft dam" idea). star wars creatures are "famous" as the policy states (and the topic of star wars creatures), and many of these creatures are commonly dicsussed because they appear as creatures in Star Wars. So, while some fo these creatures are part of a famous branch of a large fictional universe, many are, of course, not famous because they did not appear in numerous media sources. That is why the list is a split between policy and non-policy; some are notable enough in a list, others are not. That is where the cruft magnet concept really leaned me toward support in this case. So yes, while this isn't a place to change policy, it is a place to enforce an arguement with rationale based on interpretations of the policy and in relation with common sense. My "cruft magnet" idea was to provide a neutral way of compromise between deletionism and inclusionism while displaying the potential benefits for the encyclopedia.</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The above makes me think of an alternative: if a creature is referenced in many sources (making it well-known), then perhaps it deserves inclusion in the list. On the other hand, if it's a creature from one book, then it should be taken out of the list. The list would still remain, but it could be sifted to adhere to a more agreed interpretation of the WP:NOT policy. If other, fixable policy breeches are taken care of, then this list would be all set. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 23:12, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe that's true, but it doesn't change my vote for the integrity of the policies they violate. All they do is set a precident for other new editors like myself to become confused, misdirected, and shown that the policies simply don't matter.

I don't agree with Mike's canned nominations much as it might be appropriate to some of the articles subject to his AFD-spree, as it is not a list of links to other articles, but the articles themselves. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarudubshinki_b9b7.html" title="User:Marudubshinki">maru</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarudubshinki_ad9c.html" title="User talk:Marudubshinki">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Marudubshinki_980c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Marudubshinki">contribs</a> 23:07, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment.</b> A lot of the content of this article could probably be moved into other articles. For example, the gravity well projector stuff could easily be put into the <a href="../../../i/n/t/Interdictor_cruiser.html" title="Interdictor cruiser">Interdictor cruiser</a> article; stuff about hyperspace-related technologies could be merged into the <i>Star Wars</i> section of <a href="../../../h/y/p/Hyperspace_%28science_fiction%29.html" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">Hyperspace (science fiction)</a>. Tiny little pieces of information, such as datapad, could just be put inline where relevant (example: "…a datapad (the <i>Star Wars</i> equivalent of a portable computer)…". – <a href="../../../m/i/p/User%7EMipadi_1585.html" title="User:Mipadi">Mipadi</a> 16:54, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>That is always a very good idea; I was talking to Jedi6 about doing that for the minor creatures. We can create a general encyclopedic article about "devices" and "creatures" in the future (turning the lists into an article), and bring details into the context. More on this idea on the WikiProject page in the near future. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 17:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per A Man in Black. Mike, I agree with many of your Star Wars AfDs, but I feel that this is going too far.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I believe that this "list" article merits deletion due to Wikipedia's policy that it is not an indiscriminate collection of information; specifically, that it is not for "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." The policy seems to indicate that if the list itself (not the entries <i>comprising</i> the list, but the actual list itself) is famous on its own standing, or contributed to the fame of the subject, it is acceptable to keep; I do not believe this list satisfies that corollary. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 17:13, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> originally, I merged these into a list to get someone else to nominate it for deletion. However, we need to make sure that these <b>do not get their own articles in the future</b>. If someone can create an eneyclopedic article on star wars technology (or devices, in this case), then I would support that. Think of it this way; having one semi-guideline violation beats having 150 major guideline violations. The lesser of two evils is that this list remain as a "cruft dam" to provide potential for an encyclopedic shift and also to save on process, time, and lost ambition by new users with potential. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 18:39, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>!!! This list is very contributive to the Star Wars legacy; Mike, this thing is <i>so</i> famous. Have you ever even SEEN star wars? the ships are the most crucial part. This should NOT be on Wookiepedia, because there are HUNDREDS MORE STAR WARS ARTICLES ON WIKIPEDIA. Are you going to go around and delete every page that is involved with Star Wars, Star Trek, StarCraft, and Harry Potter? just checking, because that's what you'd need to do if you delete this page because it should be on wookiepedia. Tell them to put "lightsaber" on wookiepedia. Whats more, this is a list, and it contains items that contributed to the fame of Star Wars, namely, the <i>Millenium Falcon</i>, the X-wings, the TIE Fighters, the Star Destroyers. Are you denying that Star Wars wouldn't be what it is without them? Think about it. You're wrong in the end.<a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtheomnipotent_28bb.html" title="User:Craigtheomnipotent">Craigtheomnipotent</a>
<ul>
<li>First, as pointed out in the initial nomination, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>'s policy indicates it's the notability of the <i><b>list</b></i> itself that comprises whether it stays on Wikipedia — not the individual <i>items</i> that make up the list. The example the policy itself cites is <a href="../../../n/i/x/Nixon%27s_Enemies_List_21b8.html" title="Nixon's Enemies List">Nixon's list of enemies</a> — in this example, the list itself is famous, and thus the article is kept on the notability of the list itself, not necessarily on the notability of those individuals comprising the list. Second, the rest of your argument seems predicated on an argument that I'm going to nominate all articles relating to Star Wars, Star Trek, StarCraft and Harry Potter for deletion, which I do not intend to do. Third, an article must conform to Wikipedia's content guidelines even if it relates to a popular subject. Fourth, note that the <i><a href="../../../m/i/l/Millennium_Falcon_baaa.html" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, the <a href="../../../x/-/w/X-Wing_3d05.html" title="X-Wing">X-Wing</a>, multiple <a href="../../../t/i/e/TIE_fighter_2fb7.html" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighter</a> models (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?domains=en.wikipedia.org&amp;num=50&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org&amp;q=TIE%20fighter" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?domains=en.wikipedia.org&amp;num=50&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sitesearch=en.wikipedia.org&amp;q=TIE%20fighter" rel="nofollow">[39]</a>), and <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Destroyer_09b7.html" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyers</a> each have their own Wikipedia articles, and so are very well covered on Wikipedia.

<li>I'm afraid, Mike, that you have already stated your intent to put this article on Wookiepedia. If you think it belongs there, that indicates that Wookiepedia would take it without question, and since their rules are the same as Wikipedia, it could stay right here without problems. Moreover, in your indication that you would like to move the article to Wookiepedia, it can only be assumed that you want to move it there because it is Star Wars based. Is there not a Star Wars portal for Wikipedia? If that is your opinion, you can't just move one of hundreds of Star Wars articles, you must move them all. You can't move one science fiction/fantasy article to a different site and not move the rest, can you? So, 1) If it can go on Wookiepedia it can go here, and 2) if you want to move it to Wookipedia, you'll have to do the rest. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtheomnipotent_28bb.html" title="User:Craigtheomnipotent">Craigtheomnipotent</a>
<ul>
<li>Craig, I believe you're confusing me with KWH, as I've not indicated any interest in moving this to Wookiepedia. Please feel free to redraft your response if you wish, but note that you should not outright remove the above text -- you can simply strike it through by enclosing the text in &lt;s&gt; at the beginning and &lt;/s&gt; at the end. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;<span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 14:50, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the cross-wiki links to Wookieepedia within the article show that it belongs there, at the very least. Moreover, I believe that much of the fancruft and fictioncruft on Wikipedia runs into a significant legal problem. It is a copy of a significant amount of copyrighted information, ostensibly under fair use, but with little to no critical commentary to justify the fair use. And yes - there may be a dozen and one other webpages out there who do it too but that doesn't make it more legal for Wikipedia. At the least, articles about fiction should source their information to a third-party secondary source. Lists which apparently are sourced to the fiction work itself (themselves) with no commentary or other transformative addition need to be removed for reasons of legal risk. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 16:02, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well-said, and that's obviously why a lot of us are stressing and starting the process to attain an "out of universe" perspective; a synopsis should take its references from the work itself (or a published summary), but that leaves development, significance, critical response, and so on for sources outside of summary. Ship names are cool, but an article like the Chimaera star destroyer should have a section devoted to the name origin and why that name was picked, preferably citing an interview with the author, Zahn (and not just an entry in a "trivia" section). — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 17:06, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I believe, KWH, that 1) there are no links to wookiepedia, only within wikipedia, and 2) while you may have a point regarding the legality of Star Wars and other fictional items on Wikipedia, since the items posted on Wikipedia only consist of information, as long as we don't have Lucasarts copyrighted material in the articles, ie pictures and video clips, we should be fine. Also, nobody from Lucasarts has popped up to annoy Wikipedia, and, correct me if i'm wrong, Wikipedia has never run into a copyright problem before, so I see no reason why Lucasarts would be the first. Beyond that, i see your point about commentary, as far as needing to justify using it, there really is no need. The basis of this article is a collected assortment of ships in the Star Wars universe, with links to the main articles. It's like the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_races_2041.html" title="List of Star Wars races">List of Star Wars races</a>; the only reason it doesn't have an entry for each is that the authors either haven't gotten around to it, or believe that a link to the main article is sufficient. This is a relatively new article, and as such I think you should tell Relentless what needs to be done, and then give him a limited amount of time to do it. If you really think it should be completely deleted, i suppose he can take it to Wookiepedia. But I have a question. In my reply to mike's reply, i have indicated that if Wookiepedia takes this article, it must be viable to use on Wikipedia, seeing as they use the same rules for editing articles, although Wookie didn't just copy and paste. This being, perhaps if nobody on Wookie puts the article up for deletion for, say, a month, you could let Relentless move it back here without problems. Honestly, I can't see too much wrong with this page. It's just a database. Let it go, please, or use one of my suggestions. Thanks. <a href="../../../c/r/a/User%7ECraigtheomnipotent_28bb.html" title="User:Craigtheomnipotent">Craigtheomnipotent</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FYI:
<ul>
<li>The links to Wookieepedia are at "Venator-class Star Destroyer".</li>
<li>I don't know if you understand what is copyrighted material. Unless you made up the names and designs of the ships, they are copyrighted - by Lucas or the other Expanded Universe authors.</li>
<li>Anytime a copyrighted work or works are discussed or quoted on Wikipedia, we invoke fair use. A lot of things, like cited quotes, are common sense and would never be challenged.</li>
<li>The primary concerns which need to be addressed here are:
<ul>
<li>Much is written from an "in universe" perspective, as well as not NPOV ("the most powerful vessels of the whole galaxy")</li>
<li>Most is not cited to even a primary source. What movie, book, comic, etc. was it described as such in?</li>
<li>Even if it were cited to a source, we've got to add value to mere quoted material. If some SW RPG sourcebook says that it's "12.8 kilometers long … with 250 heavy turbolaser batteries, 250 turbolaser batteries, 250 concussion missile tubes …" etc., what's that mean, other than that you copied it out of the book? I think it would be possible and/or interesting to talk about how certain fictional ships might have been based on certain real-life capital ships, as example - of course that would need to be sourced to someone else's commentary to avoid being Original Research.</li>
<li>Going to non-fictive secondary sources, such as critical commentary, shows both verifiability and encyclopedic interest. For example, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Power_of_Myth_b229.html" title="The Power of Myth">The Power of Myth</a> is an excellent source. However, I don't know if anyone has written such commentary about the ships.</li>
<li>The importance of each of these things is that they make the difference between a transformative "fair use" and a simple unlicensed derivative work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wookieepedia (and other wikia sites) have much more liberal standards on fair use, and of course encyclopedic nature. To tell the truth, I don't know if this would be any more acceptable from copyright or other perspective on Wookiee, just that it would be marginally more acceptable than on Wiki. <i><a href="../../../k/w/h/User_talk%7EKwh_7c75.html" title="User talk:Kwh">KWH</a></i> 14:01, 7 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the nomination was <b>delete</b>. The position of most keep voters is that this list will prevent the creation of fancruft articles.

Furthermore, unlike <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Star_Wars_capital_ships_c536.html" title="List of Star Wars capital ships">List of Star Wars capital ships</a>, this article is simply a collection of links.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I believe that this "list" article merits deletion due to Wikipedia's policy that it is not an indiscriminate collection of information; specifically, that it is not for "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." The policy seems to indicate that if the list itself (not the entries <i>comprising</i> the list, but the actual list itself) is famous on its own standing, or contributed to the fame of the subject, it is acceptable to keep; I do not believe this list satisfies that corollary. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 17:15, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don't think A3 should apply to lists, or about 90% of them would have to go. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 19:18, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So A3 shouldn't apply to lists when the very guideline specificaly states it applies to "[a]ny article consisting only of links elsewhere (including hyperlinks, category tags and "see also" sections), a rephrasing of the title, and/or attempts to correspond with the person or group named by its title"? —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;<span class="plainlinks">(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a></span>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 19:32, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's not that it <i>shouldn't</i> apply - it <i>doesn't</i> apply, or we wouldn't even be here. There is content - however minor - aside from the links (in this particular case, where it says what each vehicle code stands for). <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:38, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Moreover, CSD A3 was designed for cases where an article was just an external link to another website, or a link to another article (without using the redirect function). Not only does it not apply to this case, but it violates what CSD actually <i>stands for</i>. Now, I can understand a stretch of the CSD to cover this article's justification for deletion, but there is cleraly evidence of orgnaization, prose, and potential for prose. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 19:39, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>So, it seems the true matter is determining whether this navigation list serves enough purpose on Wikipedia in terms of organization and cruft-protection. — <b><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_96c6.html" title="User:Deckiller">Deckill</a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User%7EDeckiller_EA_05eb.html" title="User:Deckiller/EA"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/c/User_talk%7EDeckiller_aecd.html" title="User talk:Deckiller">r</a></b> 19:47, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Right, I didn't mean it shouldn't apply to <i>lists of links with no content</i>, that's what it's for. I meant it shouldn't apply to Lists (capital L, or something like that), as in "List of...", because those are generally considered to be their own designation (like going to Featured Lists instead of Featured Articles). A "List of" something, with organization and whatnot does not fall under A3, and that is what I was trying to say, though above user said it better than me. -<a href="../../../g/o/l/User%7EGoldom_560d.html" title="User:Goldom">Goldom</a> <a href="../../../g/o/l/User_talk%7EGoldom_553a.html" title="User talk:Goldom">‽‽‽</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Goldom_034e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Goldom">⁂</a> 03:41, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why would this page be marked for deletion, but something like <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> is not - this page was actually a copy/paste of the <a href="../../../w/o/w/WoWWiki_90d8.html" title="WoWWiki">WoWWiki</a> page. FFXIclopedia contains more articles than WoWWiki does and probably has a much larger user base. FFXIclopedia has nearly 100,000 unique visits a month and should be recognized for that. I do believe that FFXIclopedia meets the first criteria specified on <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, at least as well as WoWWiki does. This is not an advertisement. Wikipedia is probably the last place an FFXI gamer would go to find how to complete quests/missions or find other factual information about Final Fantasy XI. FFXIclopedia is already referenced in numerous places on Wikipedia - see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_XI_4c8e.html" title="Final Fantasy XI">Final Fantasy XI</a> for example. Wikipedia has borrowed information from FFXIclopedia in numerous cases - see <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Fantasy_XI_character_classes_243d.html" title="Final Fantasy XI character classes">Final_Fantasy_XI_character_classes</a> and <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vana%27diel.html" title="Vana'diel">Vana'diel</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> Seeing as <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> is a guideline and not a policy, there is no need for it to pass notability.

What I would like to see from the <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deletionist" class="extiw" title="m:Deletionist">Deletionists</a> is a reason why this does not merrit it's own article when it has so many articles, and has that many hits on Google?

<li><b>Comment</b> I want to address three points: First, in response to claims that the wiki is not a web directory, I give you this page: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html" title="List of wikis">List of wikis</a>. If the wiki is so strict as to have a page exclusion based upon the "non-web-directory" criteria, then what is the point of that page. That page is intended to list notable wikis. FFXIclopedia.org is a noteable wiki. The inclusion in the wiki is not to just add another directory listing, but to give recognition to a notable wiki. Second, to those using Alexa as a basis for comparison between WoWwiki and FFXIclopedia, your premise is inherently flawed. The user base of WoW is almost 100x that of FFXI. Thus any traffic for a database used for WoW will outstrip any traffic for a database for FFXI. It's like comparing the population of New York with the population of Rhode Island and saying that Rhode Island doesn't deserve recognition as a state because it doesn't have enough people. The fact is that FFXIclopedia has more data about its game, then WoWwiki has about WoW. FFXIclopedia is a more notable website for FFXI, than WoWwiki is for WoW. Finally, for the FFXI game, FFXIclopedia is one of the premier websites. The fact that it is wiki based makes it even more noteable. It is the only user-driven database for the FFXI game out there. It is the most dynamic and the most up to date. In comparison to traffic of other FFXI websites, FFXIclopedia ranks near the top. Thus, in summary, it is notable because it is one of the largest FFXI sites on the web, it is wiki based, and it is the only user driven website for FFXI. - Mierin (FFXIclopedia administrator) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rolks (<a href="../../../r/o/l/User_talk%7ERolks_5082.html" title="User talk:Rolks">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rolks_0631.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rolks">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<dd>That being said, as a gamer of FFXI, this Wiki is indeed one of the best and most reliable sources on FFXI. Due to it being a wiki it integreates better than every other page for FFXI all the different games aspects. Depending upon what is needed and usefull it serves as a mere database with lost of different information and is logical connected to each other, but it also serves as a consie game guide or walkthrough for quests.</dd>
<dd>Other pages for FFXI have their strength either in Walkthroughs or in mere Databases, the FFXIclopedia has both strengths and others. It isn't perfect, but it is indeed a very important tool for FFXI gamers, used by many.</dd>
<dd>I do play FFXI, I do use the FFXIclopedia as my primary source of information on various things. Do do not play WoW and before this discussion I had heard of various WoW pages, but never of WoWWiki. --84.184.85.201 06:53, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

If I can demonstrate other, high traffic FFXI-related sites linking to the wiki and referring to it's content - is that enough&#160;? If another site or author makes certain statements about the wiki, does that meet the criteria&#160;? Will that satisfy the Verification criteria&#160;? There is quite a bit of work to be done to clean up the article, and I want to know what it will take before I take the time to do it. --Eue 21:22, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> Okay, after taking a closer look at the pages in question, I think I know what the problem was. I have removed the part of the article referring to the history of the web site. I am still prepared to hunt down external references to FFXIclopedia - the issue with a totally third party source is, that our site is considered authoritative amongst people who actually play the game - meaning almost any links thru search engines will be circular (i.e., they will link right back to us, as someone has already pointed out). Please keep discussing, and let me know what else needs to be done. --Eue 22:06, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

The age of the FFXIclopedia is verified via the history of the site and oldest pages and the number of articles is verified via the statistics page on that site. The facts are verifiable from the FFXIclopedia itself - so maybe the question is whether that site of a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable source</a> as to these facts.

<b>Keep</b> Okay, I have been able to find Alexa ranking for the site&#160;: as it relates to Final Fantasy XI-related websites, FFXIclopedia is 4th most popular. The only three sites that are more popular are ffxi.allakhazam.com (which is a general-purpose MMORPG database/forum), ffxi.somepage.com (another general-purpose MMORPG database/forum), and www.playonline.com (the official website for Final Fantasy XI). Generic Alexa ratings or Google searches are not very clear, because of the requirement WP:WEB and WP:NOT seem to need more than just a raw statistic. This particular reference, however, is a categorised search&#160;: It is a top five site, when people are searching Alexa specifically for Final Fantasy XI. I have added this source to the article, and now can state that the article now meets WP:NOT. Also, I have read into the standards for pop-culture sites and propose that people bear that guideline in mind as well&#160;: insofar as many pop-culture sites will not have the formal press acknowledgments..... in either case, I am more than willing to keep trying, but the Alexa ranking <b>within the subject matter at hand</b> clearly shows the web site is notable. The article has been edited to show the correct citation, as requested. Please keep this article.--Eue 05:30, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I'm done arguing this. You seem bound and determined to delete this regardless of what we say regarding notability of the site. Within the FFXI community, FFXIclopedia is notable. I have no clue where this verifiability requirement, or Kunzite's requirements for awards and recognition came from. You all seem to want to place real high standards for this site to meet, and no matter what standards we meet, you all seem to raise the requirements higher. So just delete it.</p>
<p>Our main contention was that if WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are included, then FFXIclopedia should be included as well. Using Alexa, FFXIclopedia is 4 out of 55 sites. However, WoWWiki is 5 out of 45 sites and the Guild Wars Wiki isn't even in the top 10. Yet, both WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are somehow considered notable enough for a Wikipedia entry, but FFXIclopedia is not. Ironically, I called FFXIclopedia a premier site, and AbsoluteDan shot down this statement saying Square Enix doesn't list it as a premier site. But looking at the Alexa rankings, two of the sites listed as premier by Square Enix do not even make the top ten, and FFXIclopedia is listed higher than two other "premier" sites. I don't know how much more proof of notability and suitability for Wikipedia entry you want.</p>
<p>As a minor note, it should be noted that we are only having this discussion because the Wikipedia itself has a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_wikis.html" title="List of wikis">List of wikis</a> in which notable wikis are listed. FFXIclopedia is also notable because it is a wiki.</p>
<p>FFXIclopedia, within the FFXI universe, is more notable than WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki are within their own universe. That is my arguement; Eue, Gahoo, and Havok have provided my support. If that is not good enough for you, nothing more we say will be. Just delete it. It's what you realy want to do, so just delete it. But you should also delete the WoWWiki and Guild Wars Wiki too. --Rolks 17:20, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Comment</b> I'd like to add one more note before this page meets it's doom. We've put up more of a fight to keep this page than WoWWiki and GuildWiki have combined. Both of those pages have been stubs and remain stubs. They were not challanged nearly as much as FFXIclopedia has been, yet pages like <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlfriend.html" title="Girlfriend">Girlfriend</a> are allowed to exist. (Seriously, take a look at that page; Wikipedia is not supposed to be a dictionary right? All I see there is definitions of the word and there is nothing notable about it - that crap belongs in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia). Seriously, what is one more page in Wikipedia? So much crap and misinformation is allowed to live here, and people with the most page edits or whatever are allowed to be self-proclaimed Wikipedia police and do what they feel based on the mood they happen to be in that day. As I've said, the entire process is laughable, and I'm starting to believe the editors at FFXIclopedia make better arguments and more sound decisions than the editors at Wikipedia. Delete this page, it's what you want, and no matter what we say, for whatever unknown reason, Dan is going to win, but at least be fair and be thorough and search wikipedia for even more bogus articles and mark them for deletion. --<a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGaniman_fb34.html" title="User:Ganiman">Ganiman</a> 18:03, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comment</b> I agree this is all pretty absurd. One of two things should happen. 1) The more complete history of the FFXIclopedia is added back in with pretty charts and pictures so that it is not a stub-ish entry and actually provides some interesting background on what is without question a notable site in the FFXI community. There would more than likely be no way to verify the facts in the article, but it could have the unverified stub. Or 2) The stub-ish entry is left without the unverified stub. Since the facts the article in that form are self-verifying. I would think that something that seeks to be an encyclopedia would rather have an interesting article with a historical account than the stub-ish article, but I will defer to the larger contributors as to what is preferred. --Gahoo 19:33, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br />
@AbsolutDan&#160;: The Pop-culture note I referred to was the final part of WP:RS - which states that while the site must have a verifiable source, it is understood that "due to the subject matter, many may not be discussed in the same academic contexts as science, law, philosophy and so on. Therefore, the most reliable material available is expected, but sources for these topics should not be held to as strict a standard." I propose that the site be regarded as a pop-culture site for these purposes.</p>
<p>Also, regarding you dispute of the Alexa source&#160;: the content of the other sites in the category are tangent to the fact that Alexa categorized the site in the first place. It is not, therefore, the reliability of the other sites in the category, but the reliablity of Alexa that grants the criteria needed to verify that FFXIclopedia is notable.</p>
<p>As far as people being very concerned about the high number of forum posts and blogs related to the subject&#160;: that is the nature of a pop-culture subject. Particularly with Final Fantasy XI, which is a Japanese game with international participation&#160;: there are only three English-language publications that are specific to the game, and the only regular press coverage for the game are press releases for the actual game itself (and its expansions). All English-language information or references to Final Fantasy XI <b>in general</b> derives from forum posts and blog entries. That is, until FFXIclopedia was started. But the community of people who play the game have traditionally used forums to spread information. Also, the wider press coverage in English is not very broad, since Sqaure Enix relies on word of mouth and the Final Fantasy name to sell the game; the "hard news" or third party review of the site that the deletionists have been demanding simply will not be there for any web site dealing with this subject matter.</p>
<p>Again, where it concerns the <b>subject at hand</b>, Alexa demonstrates that the site is the 4th most popular site. That meets WP:NOT. I propose that other concerns be relegated to the pop-culture provision of WP:RS - that very accurately describes the kind of site/reference/article we are dealing with here.</p>
<p>@ Havok - I believe someone may have added the stub back to the article to try to save it.... I have removed a large section of material that did not focus on the factual presentation/description of what the site is and why it is important (or, more to the point, why it is importnat enough to be in Wikipedia). --Eue 20:04, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> does provide some flexibility when it comes to reliable sources, but note that it still requires a source: "Therefore, the most reliable material available is expected..."

<dd>The fact that the site is outdated is because the TV show that it's based on ended a while ago and there has been little new information to update it with. A site being updated on a daily basis still makes no difference. It's still the most popular site on the alexa list and has a rather popular forum that is posed in on a daily basis.

<li><b>Delete.</b> I believe that this "list" article merits deletion due to Wikipedia's policy that it is not an indiscriminate collection of information; specifically, that it is not for "lists or repositories of loosely associated topics." The policy seems to indicate that if the list itself (not the entries <i>comprising</i> the list, but the actual list itself) is famous on its own standing, or contributed to the fame of the subject, it is acceptable to keep; I do not believe this list satisfies that corollary. —&#160;<a href="../../../w/c/i/User%7EWCityMike_1665.html" title="User:WCityMike"><b>Mike</b></a>&#160;(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WCityMike&amp;action=edit&amp;section=new" rel="nofollow">talk</a>&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_WCityMike_e8da.html" title="Special:Contributions/WCityMike">contribs</a>) 17:27, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Very true. We went through this recently with <a href="../../../l/i/g/Lightsaber_combat.html" title="Lightsaber combat">Lightsaber combat</a>, which had generated an article for each "style" of lightsaber combat. And then we went through it for minor characters mentioned in licensed comic books.

We still have an individual article for each Star Wars comic book, but we've had editors trying to create an individual article for <i>each story</i> in each Star Wars comic book.

<p>I just don’t think the argument that the site tilts at windmills is fair or accurate. Jews sans frontieres criticises and exposes the arguments of prominent political, media and academic figures&#160;: E.g. Prof Dershowitz, The Jewish Chronicle, Nick Cohen, Jonathan Freedland and David Aaronovitch. Some of the posts are extremely well argued and not found elsewhere. The post on David Aaronvitch’s column on Galloway's libel trial for example identifies what can generously be described as a series of mistakes, distortions and omissions. I think the site is polemical and sometimes hits hard and could be more charitable to some of its targets, but I think the Guardian columnist seemed to be practising a bit of dishonesty. Personally I think generosity to opponents is important, but not everyone shares this view. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Patrickmurphy (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Patrickmurphy_4940.html" title="Special:Contributions/Patrickmurphy">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Clearly there are some people who wish to see the Jewsansfrontiere blog deleted, not it isn't newsworthy, interesting, provocative etc. but because a Jewish anti-Zionist perspective is unacceptable to them. What they are seeking is censorship of views unpalatable to themselves. Hence the reference to libel, designed to scare the children but a nonsense nonetheless. If the site was libellous it would already have been sued.</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Wikipaedia site is going the same way as most media in the United States or affected by the latter. That is why Noam Chomsky can't get a hearing in US papers but is feted in Britain or why the NYT praises veritable forgeries, Dershowitz (Case 4 Israel), Lynn Peters (From Time Immemorial) and then refuses any response, so these forgeries are exposed in Britain and, yes, Israel. The deletion of this page, which is acknowledged as a place where healthy debate takes place, will be at the urging of those to whom censorship is second nature. In Israel they'll lock you up for it, on Wikipaedia they'll only delete what you say. The principle remains the same.</p>
<p>And yes, if Wikipaedia is going to fulfill its function it has to take on board different perspectives including an anti-Zionist Jewish perspective, which Jewssansfrontiere does very well.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm the author of the In the news and In the tabloids section, though admittedly I haven't had time to look over the whole article and for all I know it could contain original research and crystal ballism. Note the In the news section has a link to <a href="../../../c/b/c/CBC_d905.html" title="CBC">CBC</a> and thus hardly qualifies as original research; the In the tabloid section does link to a tabloid, but a notable tabloid and the section does not report the information as fact. (It would be hard to, since according to the tabloid we'd already be in the middle of the Depression right now). At any rate, many articles have an "In pop culture" section. I worked on, but did not start, the article because I think it deals with a notable concept, like several others in the fictional disaster and fictional wars category.

<p>Keep! I have seen the musical skates in action, and they are truly amazing. My son is a competitive ice dancer, and I and his coach believe that this instrument would be a fantastic training tool (helping ensure that the skaters are on the correct edge, and in unison) and that it has the potential to to revolutionize ice dance by having the skaters create their own music as they skate.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> (by the author)If a newly discovered plant species can warrant an article in Wikipedia just because it fits in the grand scheme of botanical classification even though it might never become widely noted except by a handful of botanists, why shouldn't a truly new musical instrument (which definitely has the potential of bridging ice dance and musical expression in a way that has never previously been suggested), which has not had time to become popularized, be given the same chance in Wikipedia. Yes, Wikipedia is not a crystal ball but why not support a truly innovative tool which, if or when it becomes well-known, could change the world of figure skating? --Vnenov 05:14, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>That's complete speculation. You don't know if it will be successful. Wikipedia is purposely designed to function slowly since it is supposed to keep record really of what is notable and has happened in the past. We can't pretend to be Ms. Cleo and just put what we think will be big. That is letting opinions seep through articles and just not good. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 05:16, 4 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The device is a physical reality and therefore "has happened in the past". It has been noted by more than a handfull of skaters at several ice rinks in the US and Canada. Even though it is not "big" or will never be "big" it is definitely unique. It is probably the most unique gadget to be attached to skates ever since skates were first snapped onto boots centuries ago (this is not just the personal oppinion of the author) --Vnenov 05:38, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Do you have a cite for that? Actually, I think this does deserve an article, but a critical one, not the "how-to" article we have now. This isn't a method for composing essays.

This isn't a defense of the silly lists - just the useful ones.

<li><b>Delete</b> I have spent some effort keeping this audio player list linkspam free so it is with mixed feelings that I vote for deletion. Categories just work better for lists IMO and they are maintenance free. Unfortunately there are many other wiki lists out there that are much worse link spam offenders than this one.

<p>This one is a little tougher than the nominations I've recently made, so I will rely on the AfD process to make the right call.

<p>IN an attempt to avoid Vaniy issues, I have left out information about this: This includes major publishers of magazines such as Blues Review who have been asking us about printing an article pertaining to his relief efforst for victims of Hurricane Katrina &amp; then Rita in Pearlington, MS who were being cut-off from government support by surrounding larger cities. Music Magazines that are working on follow-up articles are located in Canada &amp; in Scottland. --- these articles are slated for a Katrina/Rita a year later type of stories to address the major issues and the major efforts and all the work still to be done even a year later..... I am afraid if I include this information... especially about the involvement with Pearlington, MS will look like Vanity until after the articles are made public &amp; then can be referenced as press/media information. Any suggestions? 24.175.143.111 05:18, 3 July 2006 (UTC)bama.brat24.175.143.111 05:18, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

</ul>
<p>Make sure I am clear on this... I should mention he has been interviewed by Music Industry magazines in America, Scottland, and Canada pertaining to efforts to bring attention to the problems experienced in Pearlington, MS... that began due to destruction from Katrina/Rita... or that another fundraiser is plannded or show the date of the first one... that was on WBHM/NPR or exactly what??? I am confused..... I suppose it is dificult for me to see those highly politically charged issues from an objective rather then a subjective view..... he is a musician... he uses his music to make the world a better place thru his fundraising efforts... he donates his talent at least as often as he gets paid because he believes these things are important to endorse and to bring attention.... How can I put this into words without it appearing to be Vanity?</p>

<b>Keep</b> Ooh, my first foray into Wikipedian philosophy. <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" class="external text" title="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Eventualism" rel="nofollow">Eventualism</a> has been working in RS articles. When I first arrived, the oldest RuneScape articles were large and shoddily thrown together. Editors recently 'exploded' the big articles into smaller ones. This is partly why there are so many Rs articles. These smaller articles are dealt with, and eventually possibly can be reintroduced into their parent article. Examine RuneScape runes, for example. It first existed as a hunk of information on the overlarge RuneScape items page. RuneScape runes was created in order to: <i>a)</i> shrink the RuneScape items page, which worked and led to that page's deletion, and <i>b)</i> put the information into a smaller, easier to work with page. Eventually, editors pruned the article to shorten it, and it was merged into Magic (RuneScape).<br />
What I'm saying is that these articles are here in order to compile information about the skill, then slowly we can extract the information and reintroduce it into the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_skills_dd18.html" title="RuneScape skills">RuneScape skills</a> page, or any other page that will be available at that time. Eventually, yes, these articles may be small enough to be merged back into the skills article, but right now, they are too large, too specific, and too detailed to be simply tossed back onto the <a href="../../../r/u/n/RuneScape_skills_dd18.html" title="RuneScape skills">RuneScape skills</a> page. If all the information from all these pages is put back now, the page will become what it started with, a large compilation of rubbish. <a href="../../../h/y/e/User%7EHyenaste_70a2.html" title="User:Hyenaste">Hyenaste</a>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../h/y/e/User_talk%7EHyenaste_720f.html" title="User talk:Hyenaste">(tell)</a></sup> 02:55, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep or Merge</b> - Per all the Keep reasons above. The <i>RuneScape</i> article is too large. We move parts of it out to other articles, which then all get nominated for deletion. So we put it all back in the <i>RuneScape</i> article. Then that article is too large. So then are we going to move it all back out to smaller articles again? Where does the cycle stop? <i>RuneScape</i> is a very large game and any article that gives it its due is going to be large or set up as a large series of articles. <a href="../../../x/e/l/User%7EXela_Yrag_73eb.html" title="User:Xela Yrag">Xela Yrag</a> 17:48, 5 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>- If you haven't noticed... most RPG articles have info on skills, characters, etc. Why should RuneScape be different? Sure, there aren't as many players as Everquest, but does that mean all articles relating to it should be deleted? I think not!

<li>Looking at this film festival in detail I can see that it is actually a notable festival. My vote for deletion was a gut reaction to the article itself, which was wrong. The festival itself attracts many pieces of coverage in diverse media judging by the site names in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;q=%22Duke+City+Shootout%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&amp;q=%22Duke+City+Shootout%22" rel="nofollow">Ghits</a> and appears to be notable as a (probable) pioneer in film festivals and a place for aspiring film-makers to work under substantial pressure in a competitive environment. So I have changed my opinion. I have also drawn the creator's attention to the state of the article both on the talk page and on his talk page, working on "don't bite the newbies" as a principle (only very few contributions). The article sucks, though, as it is now. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 06:54, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Update: My most recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Photon_induced_electric_field_poling&amp;oldid=62133259" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Photon_induced_electric_field_poling&amp;oldid=62133259" rel="nofollow">rewrite</a> was checked against the references and should be accurate. I work in an optics lab; as far as I can tell from the reference content, I have sufficient expertise to confirm my rewrite's accuracy. Several of User:Holoman's statements, especially in his original version, were just plain incorrect. His rewritten version of my first rewrite was better, but not much.

<li>Oooh. I just read the above. FWIW, I support Christopher Thomas'es re-write. The original posted by User:Holoman was gibberish, and used incorrect terminology juxtaposed in non-sensical ways.

<li>I'd certainly hope it works, given that it's been published about&#160;:). This actually turns out to be a phenomenon I'd been meaning to track down for a while (read a popular press article about some form of electro-optic effect being used to "freeze" holographic fringe patterns into a storage medium for later interrogation, but had long-since forgotten the details when I needed to look it up again). --<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Thomas_925e.html" title="User:Christopher Thomas">Christopher Thomas</a> 02:32, 8 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, there is no notablity asserted for this school... and yet again we see repeated misinformation being spread regarding schools on Wikipedia.

Neither is there any Wikipedia schools policy. In short, each AFD case should be considered on its own merits and blanket statements abouts all schools are mere hand-waving. In this particular case: my last house was built in 1862, earlier than this school. My house is not notable either. There's actually more information about the local politician who laid the foundation than the school itself. It's just not notable enough for its own article. - <a href="../../../m/o/t/User%7EMotor_c62e.html" title="User:Motor">Motor</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/t/User_talk%7EMotor_bbe9.html" title="User talk:Motor">talk)</a> 13:52, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — As always, notability is in the eye of the beholder.

<p>This article went <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Stuart_Millson_7a6b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Stuart Millson">through an AfD vote</a> last month but I believe it was wrongly decided. There is a very clear pattern of sock/meatpuppeting in the vote. Of the 17 "keep" votes, all but four were recorded from anonymous IP address and new user accounts; another was recorded from <a href="../../../s/u/s/User%7ESussexman_47c3.html" title="User:Sussexman">User:Sussexman</a> who has since been indefinitely banned. Of the seven "delete" votes, only one was recorded from an anonymous IP address. In view of the apparent attempt at vote stacking, I believe the anonymous/new votes should have been discarded. This would have resulted in the vote being 6-4 in favour of deletion. I have re-listed this article for deletion in the light of the clear abuse of process. Votes from anonymous IPs and new user accounts will NOT be counted given the previous, externally-directed attempt to stuff the ballot. I will not be voting, but I will be keeping an eye on proceedings. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:33, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>The reason given for deletion in the original AfD stated:</p>
<p>Vanity article about a marginal figure whose main contribution seems to be writing letters. Replete with original reserach. Homey 02:58, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. In my judgment his political campaigning activities make him clearly notable. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 23:34, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>his letters have appeared in The Times, The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph</i> does not establish notability. Neither does a list of self-authored sources. If others (<a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">reputable sources</a>) have written about him he's notable. As of now, <b><i>Weak</i> Delete</b>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 23:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>A Lexis-Nexis Euro search retrieves 17 hits over the last ten years, most of which are his letters, but there are some scraps of minor notability ca. 1997-2001. Modify to weak delete. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 00:21, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I observed that the process was deeply flawed last time around, but I still think he's notable enough for an article. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:46, 2 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't agree with his politics, but I don't think that's any reason to remove articles. He is, in his own way, reasonably significant. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobinCarmody_3768.html" title="User:RobinCarmody">RobinCarmody</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see what he's done that is of any notability. Homey 04:17, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - a political nobody who's career seems to consist of letters to the papers and what appear to be self-published newletters. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 12:15, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete:</b> I count three letters written by Milson on The Times website <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=stuart+millson+site%3Awww.timesonline.co.uk&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=stuart+millson+site%3Awww.timesonline.co.uk&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[64]</a>, but no articles actually written about him. Not very notable for a British political activist. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 12:59, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Millson was mentioned in an article by Dominic Kennedy entitled "Griffin's views 'are shared by many Tories'" which appeared on page 10 of <i>The Times</i> of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_25.html" title="August 25">August 25</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a>, and in a correction to that article published on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_27.html" title="August 27">August 27</a>. He was also mentioned in a <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Aaronovitch_456d.html" title="David Aaronovitch">David Aaronovitch</a> column of <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_2.html" title="August 2">August 2</a>, <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a> which appeared on page 14. I can get a comprehensive list of press articles in which he has appeared in recent years (separating from letters written by him) if it would be useful. <a href="../../../d/b/i/User%7EDbiv_ae10.html" title="User:Dbiv">David</a> | <a href="../../../d/b/i/User_talk%7EDbiv_6398.html" title="User talk:Dbiv">Talk</a> 13:25, 3 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But has anyone in the British mainstream press actually profiled him? Or are they always snippets and/or a single quote from him each time? Also: 0 mentions of him on bbc.co.uk. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 18:46, 3 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>No. As per the Lexis-Nexis search, we're talking about scraps. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 18:51, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Writing letters to the papers and self-publishing a few pamphlets doesn't constitute notability. "Vanity article" sums it up, I think. --<a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStephen_Burnett_2542.html" title="User:Stephen Burnett">Stephen Burnett</a> 23:17, 3 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> He appears to be only a very minor figure. Endomorph</li>
<li><b>Delete.</b> I'm sorry it didn't go first time. Back on 2006-06-04 I said that this article was NN and POV, but entertaining. Now it is a shambling mess, STILL without citations. I'm guessing that, after a month of discussion, the lack of citations points strongly towards a case for NN deletion. --<a href="../../../b/a/u/User%7EBaumfabrik_141d.html" title="User:Baumfabrik">die Baumfabrik</a> 00:49, 4 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
