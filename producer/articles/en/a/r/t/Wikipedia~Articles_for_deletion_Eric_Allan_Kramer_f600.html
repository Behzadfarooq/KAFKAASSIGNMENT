<li><b>Keep</b> Per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>: <i>"Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films"</i>. That's a funny rule when the word "notable" is used in the definition of "notability." So he is halfway there by being in several notable films. Well how prominent does he have to be in the films? I think that is less clear. WP standards ask that a topic be noticed, not be important or famous. I'm basing my vote on playing a memborable/noticed charachter, Little John" in Robin Hood MIT, with the rest of his resume fleshing out the notablility. Now all we lack is verifiability. I'm sure that there si something in the over 13,000 g-hits. Good Luck! --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 23:25, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> goes on to say that "Notability can be determined by: Multiple features in popular culture publications such as Vogue, GQ, Elle, FHM or national newspapers; A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following; An independent biography; Name recognition; Commercial endorsements." He does not appear to meet any of these criteria. "I saw him in a movie" strikes me as a flavor of <a href="../../../i/l/i/WP%7EILIKEIT_2518.html" title="WP:ILIKEIT">WP:ILIKEIT</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:45, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Re: ILIKEIT, I've never seen the movie nor heard of the man. But I've heard of the movie and I'm familiar with Little John as a central character in the Robin Hood legend. You seem pretty anxious to get rid of this. What's the harm here? --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 01:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I could turn around and say you seem overly anxious to keep it. It's not a question of harm, and I don't get why people pose that question like it means something. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:04, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To me making the statement: "doesn't appear to pass..." is using a weasle term. It means you aren't sure so you'll throw it to AfD anyway. Were you too much in hurry to make the nomination, to do you due dillignece? I think that you owe the community the effort to look to see whether it does or doesn't pass BIO and have some certainty in your conviction before you spend our time. This is a very borderline case which should have been left alone. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 04:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh dear god, you're upset because I said "doesn't apeear to pass" instead of "doesn't pass"? I said "doesn't appear to" because I googled the man and checked several dozen of the results and none of them were beyond cast lists or his name in a review of a film. As sure as God made little green apples, if I'd said "does not pass" then someone would've been in here criticising me for that. I found the guy's article while cleaning out a category where he was listed but didn't belong. Looking at his unrefernced article I decided to see if there were any references that could be incorporated. Finding none, I put him up for AfD. Sorry if that offends you in some way, that I used AfD to try to remove an article that doesn't belong here. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 13:22, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Otto, I'm not offended, but I'm increasingly concerned about poorly thought out AfD nominations. However, I'm impressed with the amount of thought that you put in here. Thanks. I still don't agree with your conclusion, but we are all entitled to variance in opinion. I know that it is extra work to explain the nomination, but it certainly helps those of us who are evaluating your choice when you tell us why. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>I would temper the use of throwing out "ILIKEIT" as a defence for an AfD, as I think that can be a bit condesending toward the reviewer's opinion, and far more applicable to a Brittany knock-off than a mature character actor with a diverse but not famous career.--<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 17:05, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, although as written the article multiply exaggerates "appearances" into "guest starring". Fie on that.
