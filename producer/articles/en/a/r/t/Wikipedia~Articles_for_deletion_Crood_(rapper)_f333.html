<p>Response From Sizzerb Management:</p>
<p>I'm afraid that is false. Look up "Crood Sizzerb" on Google:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>If you look up Crood, the first 3 sites that come up are directly related to the artist:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>If you look up Sizzerb he comes up and is also included on the Sizzerb/Sizzerb International websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>Crood is also a respected artist in the Serbian hip-hop community and the Sizzerb mixtape series has sold over 30 thousand units worldwide. Look up Sizzerb Vol. 1 for example and multiple sites including ebay will show up, which carry the product. Crood is featured on all the tapes, this is obsurd. He is also referenced in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin_%28rapper%29.html" title="Sin (rapper)">Sin's</a> Wikipedia biography. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.110.167.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.110.167.195_77a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.110.167.195">contribs</a>).</small> (see also Sizzerbiatch (<a href="../../../s/i/z/User_talk%7ESizzerbiatch_3f0c.html" title="User talk:Sizzerbiatch">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sizzerbiatch_41e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sizzerbiatch">contribs</a>))</p>
<p>And the 3 sites are: MySpace, record label, and "coming soon". As soon as management feel the need to plead a case my spam radar kicks in. <b>Delete</b> per nom unless convincing evidence of notability is produced. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 22:32, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is rediculous... Anybody in the music industry knows anyone can get their music on Amazon with about $50 and you use that as guideline to see if pages are authentic? It seems like you have more knowledge of spamming then you do of the music information your trying to delete off here!</p>
<p>How about these sites, they all sell Sizzerb mixtapes, and Crood is featured on everyone of them (see track listing):</p>

<p>That's just some, there's way more...</p>
<p>Sizzerb Vol. 1 featured on MTV Mixtape Mondays:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/</a></p>
<p>You really need to check into the information your providing, how could Sizzerb tapes be sold on all these different sites and featured on MTV if they weren't factual? Crood (rapper) is on every one, just read the track listing.</p>
<p>Here are some other reviews i found with Crood mentioned in them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_11_gypsyradio.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_11_gypsyradio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2003_11_gypsyradio.html</a></p>
<p>"The production by Crood, where he samples choirs and Indian classical music, only adds depth to the search for inner peace, a slight spiritual touch dropped in one's personal plea to get out of hell. "</p>

<p>"The melodic and haunting vibes of “Burn” ends up as the albums finest cut, thanks to a spectacular production effort by Crood."</p>

<p>Milk Crate consists of DJ Flatline/KendeR/Red Eye Jedi/Crood/Keith Burst and are an up and coming crew from Toronto. They specialise in creating some of the freshest underground hip-hop music and their music features a collection of remixes created to illustrate the skill, talent and dedication to true hip hop in all of its forms.</p>
<p>I can keep going, but the fact is you need to provide proof, not speculation that this is not factual. What your basically saying is, this may be spam so lets delete it. Where as, i am giving you concrete examples to prove this is NOT spam, it is impossible to make this stuff up or duplicate a talent such as Crood's.</p>

</ul>
<p>Since when does an artists visibility on the internet reflect their legitimate contributions to MUSIC??? I could name you 10 artists from Yugoslavia (where Crood is from) who are superstars there, but barely visibly online. What your saying doesn't make sense. I've listed respectible publications covering Sizzerb AND Crood with direct quotes about Crood, his music and tracklistings with CROOD songs on them on websites which sell CD's ie. Mixunit (top mixtape site in the world) or rapreviews.com - top hip-hop review site online www.hiphopcanada.com www.allhiphop.com and other respectable urban websites. Just because your nerd search engine isn't picking it up is irrelevant when i am showing you DIRECT LINKS of pages which feature Crood, on known websites/publications!</p>
<p>If Crood had enough power to forge himself into all those websites i listed, his online presence would be as big as his music which is not the case yet. This is discrimination against a new/foreign artist the way i see it... You can't base someone accomplishments off 1 search engine when i am giving you DIRECT LINKS of respectable publications/sellers.</p>
<p>Not to mention that every mixtape Sizzerb has done (all of which Crood is on) are hosted by a-list level hip-hop DJ's. Look up any of them from DJ Vlad to Big Mike to Nu Jerzy Devil to Team Invasion. This is undesputable success especially from a artist based in Canada/from a foreign country. I have faith Wikipedia will review the information i gave them accordingly.</p>
<p>For direct reference to Crood on here, also see Sin (rapper)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. In cases where notability is established, a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutrally-written article</a> is sufficient, but in cases where it's dodgy and there is a clear <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>, I vote 'em down.

</ul>
<p>I agree with that but all the info was used with the artists permission and we can provide any documentation necessary to prove that. The biography was taken with permission from the artists website. There is no conflict of interest we are just making sure the artist is being represented properly becuase a third party could do the same thing and change the story/manipulate details, especially our enemies/competitors. We are not speculating but stating facts, and documenting a growing artist/movement early on. If there is anything you feel needs to be changed please state it specifically, i believe all the links i've provided is more then specific proof of Crood's role in hip-hop and Sizzerb, he is also documented in Sin's biography on here. I can also provide links to stores that sell all the mixtapes in the discography with the acception of Sizzerb INternational Vol. 1 which was a free download. Any other information you need including medical/police reports which prove what was said in the biography is true are available to you upon request. We'd be happy to accomondate anything to fit your standards, and understand the information on this page is definitelly something which will be used as a long-term reference to the artist. There is no denying everything stated is factual and relevant to Crood's role in hip-hop and who he is as an artist.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>, borderline <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy A7</a>. The article does not satisfy the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">notability guidelines for music artists</a>, nor does it provide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> non-trivial, third-party coverage to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> any of the claims being made.

If the person is as famous as claimed, it should be no hardship to dig up reliable sources (news and/or magazine coverage for example), even if these are foreign language. <b><a href="../../../z/u/n/User%7EZunaid_d3d3.html" title="User:Zunaid"><font color="red">Zun</font></a><a href="../../../z/u/n/User_talk%7EZunaid_e4f9.html" title="User talk:Zunaid"><font color="green">aid</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Zunaid_cf3a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Zunaid"><font color="blue">©</font></a><a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Zunaid_7c6f.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Zunaid"><font color="orange"><sup>Review me!</sup></font></a></b> 12:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have no problem providing reviews or interviews, in fact i already noted some. I wasn't claiming the person was famous, just outlining achievement. If you need direct links to works/reviews/interviews be specific and i can provide what you ask for. But is that supposed to be included in the article? I stayed away from putting too many links in the actual article because i figure u don't want linking done unless manditory. I'm willing to do whats neccessary to fix the issue. I tried to make it more like it would look if you read about an artist in a physical book encyclopedia, they usually don't provide such links (to websites/articles etc.) if you prefer a different better referenced format i can do that but this way its focusing on the individual more then the coverage which i think is key for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I added many more references in the article. I hope that helps. Let me know.</p>
<p>Here is a article i scanned from Huper Magazine (Serbia). It reviews a compilation Crood executive produced and is featured on. If you look under "preporuka" where they list reccomended songs after the review, you will see a song featuring Crood as well.</p>

<p>I'm going out of my way here guys. I already listed 3 reviews and 10 stores/coverage sites in and above source. This is scanned directly out of the magazine.</p>
