<li><b>Keep</b> It is the most influential and and controversial film of 2005. Anything that can be added is great, especially something like this which can clear up people's minds on the movie and so on. 67.120.168.41 23:24, 12 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Incredibly fascinating and found no where else. Answers so many unanswered questions that were on Annie Proulx's forum (that no longer exists). Explains the symbolism and literary devices of the story and film. Very thorough, and a definite KEEP. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShamir1_b434.html" title="User:Shamir1">Shamir1</a> 23:20, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Re-Keep</b> (recommendation from the author) since total censorship would be a double standard compared to <i><a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticisms_of_The_Da_Vinci_Code_91ad.html" title="Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code">Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code</a></i> (DVC) et. al. It is very telling that the most honored film of 2005, some say <u>of all time</u>, cannot be described in detail within today's Wikipedia community: very interesting. Meanwhile, <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> has entire articles devoted to opinions criticizing the book, while opinions about <i>Brokeback</i> symbolism are considered beyond Wikipedia??? No, you clowns need to get your biases in sync and re-think your motives for censoring details about <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>. The cinematic article should be converted from "Delete~" to "Clean-up" status, as is typical with other Wikipedia articles: the hypocrisy against <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> must stop. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 11:27, 11 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> as a roll-out from main article, due to size/editing issues about the most honored film of 2005 (i.e., VERY large <i>non-trivial, worldwide topic</i>). Mark sections needing citations, then remove undocumented statements. Preserve "stub" status until more solid. I have added 50 citations within a few minutes; actually, this article had over 40 references to published reviews/interviews (the hysteria about "message board posts" was hyperbole). Keep, since it is a new <i>original article</i> (not <i>original research</i>): there is no need to survey viewers or re-interview the cast/crew; vast amounts of external information are already available as sources from prior research behind this article. No one who worked on the film has even posted in Talk yet. Much more detail needs to be added to this article. ("<i>You thought you knew, but you have no idea.</i>") -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 05:57, 9 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Believe it or not, some of you don't know as much as you think about this film.</li>
<li><b>Archived</b> for recovery. This secondary article might be deleted due to bizarre opinions, after being tagged for deletion within 10 days of creation, skipping the civilized process of potential cleanup. I have created an offline archive copy to recreate the article in another form, in case of deletion; feel free to create personal archives of the information, as well. A major point of misunderstanding is about removing a collection of opinions from Internet-forum participants, stated as such; as though forums contain no information, even as opinions, rather than citing a forum as a source of documented facts. The concept of a forum as a source of opinions, rather than a source of researched facts, seems to be over the head, beyond <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comprehension.html" title="Comprehension">comprehension</a> of several people. The <a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a> of Wikipedia is quite primitive this year, and perhaps a revelation (or hard-fought <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epiphany_%28feeling%29.html" title="Epiphany (feeling)">epiphany</a>) might occur in future months. It might be a cosmic joke that Wikipedia contains little knowledge about some major topics: <i>Weakopedia</i>. As of today, Wikipedia still had no <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Riddle_fa1a.html" title="World Riddle">World Riddle</a> (German "<i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Weltr%C3%A4tsel.html" title="Welträtsel">Welträtsel</a></i>"). Meanwhile, be prepared for the worst. <a href="../../../w/i/n/Winston_Groom_07ce.html" title="Winston Groom">Who</a> said: <i>Stupid is as stupid does</i>? -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 02:32, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Consider</b> article "<a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_Ernies_6bad.html" title="Club Ernies">Club Ernies</a>" as a questionable entry for the <i>Wackopedia</i>; it has been unchallenged for over <b>THREE MONTHS</b> while the indepth description of <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was slated for deletion within 7 days of being linked to the parent article. <i>Can you say Sickipedia? I-think-you-can.</i> Obviously any moderately intelligent person can see, after observing for just a few days, that the Wikipedia processes and guidelines are currently pathetic in the task of collecting and maintaining valuable information. Sorry, but institutionalized incompetence aggravates me.

<li>Thank you for pointing out the questionable <a href="../../../c/l/u/Club_Ernies_6bad.html" title="Club Ernies">Club Ernies</a> article. I agree. I've merged the content of that article into The Catcher in the Rye, and prod'd the article.</li>
<li>The question isn't whether the statments of opinion attributed to the forum participants are accurate reportings of their opinions, it's whether these opinions are encyclopedic enough to be included in Wikipedia. If I picked up the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>, I wouldn't expect to see a movie article backed up by postings on USENET. This seems like a similar case. Forum postings are just not considered acceptable secondary sources, per the criteria at <a href="../../../r/e/l/WP%7EReliable_sources_20af.html" title="WP:Reliable sources">WP:Reliable sources</a>.</li>
<li>The very title of the article is Brokeback Mountain cinematic <i>analysis</i>, which suggests this article is intended to be a new systhesis of analytical material, which would make it original research.</li>
<li>I went looking for other critically-acclaimed films that have had similar treatment in Wikipedia, and could find none. Admittedly, my search was hardly exhaustive, but I looked at: <a href="../../../i/t/_/It_Happened_One_Night_2fdf.html" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a>, <a href="../../../o/n/e/One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo%27s_Nest_%28film%29_3833.html" title="One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)</a>, <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29_6d15.html" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind (film)</a>, and a couple of others. None have this sort of subjective discussion of their content.</li>
<li>I agree with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/user:Yanksox" class="extiw" title="w:user:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> above; this is a good review and analysis, but it's just not currently not Wikipedia material.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> per eaolson's search on similar well-known and analyzed movies. None of them have this sort of article in the Wikipedia. I fear that the construction of this sort of article is too much of a walk down the path of synthesis of information and original research. Or else, it is critical analysis, and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not</a> the place for that. —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 17:26, 10 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: (recommendation from the author) to end senseless debate. I will submit details about <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> to other venues. [<i>No, <b>Re-Keep</b> (see "Re-Keep" above)</i>.] Of course, the Wikipedia contains vast amounts of subjective information on other topics: the very act of including, or rejecting, an article is a subjective opinion, no matter how well rationalized as being an "objective" choice. I don't see the Wikipedia community evolving beyond this point, any time soon. Perhaps the related policy in the 20th Century, for <i><a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica_ecd4.html" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a></i> to not describe films at all, was based partly on avoiding such debates about motion-picture details. I prefer that Wikipedia continue to describe films in some detail, since storage space is no longer an issue as it had been with hard-copy <i>Britannica</i>; however, the Wikipedia <i><a href="../../../z/e/i/Zeitgeist.html" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a></i> is not yet ready to describe films in terms of musical composition, symbolism, film editing, cinematography, sound editing, etc. A motion-picture encyclopedia would be a more receptive and sophisticated venue for those details. It is very telling that the most honored film of 2005, some say of all time, cannot be described in detail within today's Wikipedia community: very interesting. -<a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikid77_2576.html" title="User:Wikid77">Wikid77</a> 19:36, 10 June 2006 (UTC)
