<p>This school isn't notable, its only claim to fame is seemingly two ex-pupils, neither of whom have an article. The article reads almost exactly like a prospectus, down to the details of the uniform and how it is enforced.

<li>The point of a "notability" is to exclude things that are of interest to very few encyclopedia users, things like ordinary people, shops, and amateur bands with no audience. High schools are virtually all large, influential and different enough from each other to be interesting to anyone who wants to know about their local (or catchment) area. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 15:25, 27 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I see your point, but what would you do about a high school that is small, non-influential and very similar to several other high schools? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 19:57, Mar 27, 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Actually, most high school articles I've read on WikiPedia do not in any way demonstrate that said school is influential or different from other schools. So personally, I would be in favor of merging the lot of them (by city or district or something) into an annotated list. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:22, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Wikipedia policy, as determined by <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia_talk%7EDeletion_policy_schools_6cb7.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Deletion policy/schools">a poll</a>, is that articles on high schools should not be deleted. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 01:19, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)

<li>That poll was concluded in <a href="../../../n/o/v/November.html" title="November">November</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a> and acknowledged as out of date by <a href="../../../o/c/t/October.html" title="October">October</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 02:17, 28 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't see anyone ever saying it was out of date, just that it might need to be reviewed. Moreover no later poll, or even a consistent series of VfD votes, has overturned the 2003 decision. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 03:26, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is no decision or policy, it is just a poll. Also, it is broken down into levels of notability, and for the more obscure kinds of school, there is a clear majority to <i>delete</i> them. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 08:15, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Polls are perhaps the most widely recognized method for creating official policy. Note that the page states "rather than discuss this repeatedly on VfD every time a school article appears, it would be more sensible to gain a consensus which could be applied to all of them. That's what this page is for." Moreover the only types of schools that have conseunsus for deletion were those with under thirty studetns, preschools, and bulk automated entries. The poll is old, perhaps it would be a good idea to re-run it or a similar poll to show where the current consensus lies. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 13:34, Mar 28, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>According to <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicy_66bd.html" title="Wikipedia:Policy">Wikipedia:Policy</a>, <i>policy is created by consensus</i>. This poll does show majority votes in a couple of cases, but it does not show any kind of consensus. Therefore it's <i>not</i> policy. Also, it has a total of only 31 voters, which is unacceptably low for the size of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!"></a><a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!">Radiant</a><a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/mergist" class="extiw" title="meta:mergist">_*</a> 09:25, Mar 29, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is no evidence to support your impolite insinuations. Let me quote back to you what you said just a few lines up: "<i>As for you, "Gene", perhaps you should straighten out just exactly which userid is "Centauri", and which is "Gene Poole"</i>". If you have evidence which supports this insulting suggestion, by all means, please present it now. --"GRider"\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 17:05, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Did you happen to note the two links I provided following that comment, in which "Centauri" replies to a comment addressed to "Gene Poole" as if he were indeed "Gene Poole", then deletes the comment, realizing his revealing error? <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 19:11, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, but I found it to be inconclusive at best.

<dd>Hmm, yes.

<dd>GRider, while I agree that Jayjg could have phrased what he said more gently, your response is also sailing rather close to the wind. Jayjg, if you beleive that Centauri and/or Gene Poole are abusing sockpuppets and/or behaving otherwise improperly, then I suggest you open an RfC (if you do let me know as I'd be interested in knowing the answer to this). Alternatively, perhaps mediation between the different sides in this debate would be more apropriate? (I admit to not knowing a huge amount about the mediation process). Any further discussion on this matter would probably be best on the talk page. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 23:30, 29 Mar 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it is rather unfortunate that people feel they must make personal attacks just because they don't share the same viewpoint as someone else. --"GRider"\<sup><a href="../../../g/r/i/User_talk%7EGRider_a2d7.html" title="User talk:GRider">talk</a></sup> 00:45, 30 Mar 2005 (UTC)
