<li><b>Keep</b>. Major regional shopping centre within northwestern Sydney (I know of it despite living at the other side of Australia and having never been there) - was the subject of a major corporate tug-of-war in the 1990s that made the news. I'm not close enough to find sources (Australian sources prior to 1995 tend to be located in real libraries near their source) but am happy to vouch for its notability - it's not simply a corner store. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 13:21, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per Rebecca; if not <b>Strong keep</b> per Orderinchaos78 - the article is a large well-known shopping centre in Sydney, and a Factiva search brings up 413 articles in newspapers, including a major issue with the owners (or former owners) GEM Property Trust back in the late 1990s, when they tried to put "Venture" Stores in the shopping centre, which all failed, and they overvalued the place - they had to write $12 million dollars off the shopping centre's price - OIC78 seems to be right; the article is also referenced, more than can be said of most articles of this type too. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 22:39, 6 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good suggestion for improvement. The hard bit is turning local knowledge into reliably sourced content. I would guess that's why OrderInChaos hasn't put it in yet (maybe that's what <i>not sure of exact details</i> means).</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per Rebecca. Could some other method be attempted to encourage the article to be improved such as a comment on the talk page or dropping by a wikiproject that supports the article - it seems to have worked for other similar articles which were proposed for deletion (articles relating to shopping centres in Sydney area).<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGarrieIrons_a500.html" title="User:GarrieIrons">Ga</a><a href="../../../g/a/r/User_talk%7EGarrieIrons_ba7c.html" title="User talk:GarrieIrons">rr</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_GarrieIrons_2eb8.html" title="Special:Contributions/GarrieIrons">ie</a> 09:53, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Voting or making comments on editors who have made votes that you don't agree with them to try and discredit their comments/vote is not on. I've had to edit various other pages in the last three months, and I don't have the page on my watchlist, which means I haven't had much to do with it. I have already shown why this article should be kept, and that is to do with the financial worries of GEM in the late 1990s. If you want to vote delete, you can do so, but don't try to attack or discredit those who disagree with you. The fact I may have once provided an edit on the page in question is nothing more than an aside. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 02:38, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Same - I'd note I only edited the article *after* it came here - I saw the AfD, tried my best to improve it, left it for others once done. The idea of stub articles is to establish a framework that will jog those who know something about the subject or have more time and/or resources to fill it out. I've been filling out stubs in the Perth geographical area which prior to my contribution were simply one line stubs that did not express notability. It may well have been that the creator did not have the means of research at hand, or worked a 40 hour week and couldn't get into the State Library or whatever - it is a volunteer effort, after all. I have not changed my opinion and still believe Carlingford Court is notable both in terms of its magnitude and also in terms of its history. I also believe AfD is overused as a "cleanup" tool. Holding a gun to one's head is not the way to encourage article growth, as has been discussed elsewhere. As it is, there's nothing wrong with the article remaining as a stub, and until Wikipedia policy changes and says "no stubs" (which I doubt will ever happen), that will always be the way. <a href="../../../o/r/d/User_talk%7EOrderinchaos78_c342.html" title="User talk:Orderinchaos78">Orderinchaos78</a> 05:11, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> People have raised good reasons why it might be notable, but none of these are in the article itself. Wikipedia being voluntary and not a job, some leeway should be given to delays in adding additional content as per comments by <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a>. But if there actually is some notable copy to be added, let's add it and we can bring the great Shopping Centre Debate to a close (and if there's not, then we can also bring the Debate to a close the other way).<a href="../../../j/e/e/User%7EJeendan_30c0.html" title="User:Jeendan">Jeendan</a> 02:57, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have reviewed the new version of the article<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlingford_Court&amp;oldid=106535477" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carlingford_Court&amp;oldid=106535477" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> but in my opinion there's still not enough there to justify the article's existence. Two references to street directories, and one article in a local business magazine talking about a building expansion. That's still not "multiple non-trivial reliable published sources" per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>. I stand by my original opinion that this article should be deleted, and/or have any genuinely notable information merged into a parent article about the local community. --<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EElonka_d4b2.html" title="User:Elonka">El</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User_talk%7EElonka_f038.html" title="User talk:Elonka">on</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elonka_1320.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elonka">ka</a> 04:06, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agreed with Elonka, and stand by my earlier assessment. An industry-insider rag and two street directories are not non-trivial mention. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> 04:09, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Orderinchaos78 and JROBBO and Rebecca. The reasons being given to delete this article would cover 4 in every 5 articles on Wikipedia and just about every stub there is, it should be kept and improved. If you think it needs sources then put a sources tag on it!! Is the writing NPOV? Yes. Is the subject notable/would Wikipedia be a better place if this article was completed? Yes. Does it fail any of the speedy deletion criteria? No. Can it be improved? Clearly yes if you read the submissions above mine. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielT5_5528.html" title="User:DanielT5">DanielT5</a> 13:43, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
