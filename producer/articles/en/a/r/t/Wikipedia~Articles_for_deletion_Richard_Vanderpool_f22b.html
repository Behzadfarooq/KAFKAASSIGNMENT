<p><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. Google returns zero results for "Richard Vanderpool" + "Lake County Captains". This article was started by a user that has written several articles recently VfD'd for non-notable vanity, and the recent Wikipedia Authoritarianism article which has received several votes for speedy deletion. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 19:40, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><s><b>Keep</b>, a minor league baseball player is historic (and therefore encyclopedic). Personally, it needs strong clean-up, but not to be harpooned. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntares33712_1845.html" title="User:Antares33712">Antares33712</a> 20:25, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)</s></p>

<li>OK, since the vandalism's been cleared up (Thank you, Carnildo!), I still vote <b>Delete</b> for non-notability. Someone who plays A-level ball for a year or two is not for that reason notable. He was probably a darn good college ball-player, and might well become a darn good GM somewhere; but he just hasn't done it yet. Potential isn't encyclopaedic. <a href="../../../f/r/j/User%7EFrjwoolley_64f8.html" title="User:Frjwoolley">Frjwoolley</a> 00:05, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think accountants are all that notable by default, but that doesn't matter at all, because this is actually a hoax: <i>"He became intensely interested in baseball following a curious event marking his sixth birthday. [...] When Richard's father returned home from his cashier's job at Seven Grains Market in Tallmadge Ohio he was struck in the head by a rouge [sic] black bird that had been pirched above the family's front door. The bird was reported to be in such a rage that it desisted only after consuming Vander's left eye and puncturing his right. By the time Richard reached his father, Vander had died from loss of blood. Richard and his mother buried Vander in their backyard garden and celebrated young Richard's birthday at his graveside. From that point foward, Vanderpool's love of baseball would not diminish."</i> I'm sorry, what? Someone died from loss of blood from two wounds to the eyes? And because of this incident, young Richard loved baseball? Makes sense! Furthermore, his book about the incident, named <i>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</i>, was was pulled from stores when Nietzsche's great great nephew Mark sued him (never mind that the book's copyright expired ages ago), and when the book was retitled to <i>Being and Nothingness: A Phenomenological Essay on Ontology</i>, he was again sued by Sartre's "friends and publishers" and then had to give up on the whole thing because he'd exhausted every possibility for a name? Okay, I laughed at this stuff, sure, but it's a hoax. Away with it, I say. Should probably see what else the author of the article has been up to... -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 21:55, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> And yes, I realize that the parts that I quoted above may appear to be vandalism instead of a hoax, but I would like to point out that after the page was vandalized by <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunner06_506f.html" title="User:Runner06">User:Runner06</a>, the article's original author, <a href="../../../1/9/8/User%7E198.234.224.6.html" title="User:198.234.224.6">User:198.234.224.6</a> took the time to fix various typos and whatnot in the vandalized text. I suppose it's possible that he was simply gullible and thought that the other guy knew more about the topic... but I doubt that. Looking at his user contributions, I see that he has vandalized other pages before, including (to pick a couple of random samples) <a href="../../../j/u/g/Juggalo.html" title="Juggalo">Juggalo</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/p/Rap.html" title="Rap">Rap</a>, <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battle_of_Gettysburg_849f.html" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/p/Napoleon_Dynamite_8c84.html" title="Napoleon Dynamite">Napoleon Dynamite</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Columbine_High_School_Massacre_1fb4.html" title="Columbine High School Massacre">Columbine High School Massacre</a>, where he apparently pulled the classy move of creating imaginary victims, and <a href="../../../s/k/a/Skateboarding.html" title="Skateboarding">Skateboarding</a>, in which he posed the following conundrum to his fellow Wikipedians: <i>"haha ypur gay u fag why are you reading this u poseR!"</i> Truly, who can say? Now, I dunno if Runner06 is his friend, a sockpuppet or a completely unrelated guy, but the point is, the original author is not a particularly credible contributor... and, more importantly, even if he were, a perfectly ordinary accountant still isn't notable enough for inclusion in Wikipedia. Of course, if he turns out to be a real person and a thoroughly extraordinary and notable accountant, I'm happy to change my vote. I very much doubt that I'll have any reason to. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 01:37, 7 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: A few more points about this article. I looked on <a href="http://www.thebaseballcube.com" class="external text" title="http://www.thebaseballcube.com" rel="nofollow">The Baseball Cube</a>, and they didn't know of any players named Vanderpool, and they showed that the Cleveland Indians' 11th-round pick in the 1998 draft was actually Jake Reynolds, who went to Southern Utah University. Also look at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.thebaseballcube.com+Vanderpool" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=site%3Awww.thebaseballcube.com+Vanderpool" rel="nofollow">this Google query</a>, which I just ran. Also noteworthy is that the Lake County Captains did not even exist until 2003 (Richard's "playing career ending" injury was in 2000). Also look at the <a href="http://www.sports-wired.com/teams/team.asp?Name=BAGIC&amp;N=A" class="external text" title="http://www.sports-wired.com/teams/team.asp?Name=BAGIC&amp;N=A" rel="nofollow">Lake County Captains' all-time roster</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>, if the guy weren't a hoax, I would have voted keep. I mean not everybody makes the minor leagues or is even a good college ball player. Certain careers lend themselves to publicity and notoriety and thus notability.

<p>are clearly irrelevant and should be ignored.

<li>How is it irrelevant? I was testing to see if what was in the article was correct. The Baseball Cube has a list of <i>every</i> player ever drafted by a major league team. The article claims that he was drafted; he certainly wasn't, if the Baseball Cube doesn't have him. And of course, if the article was saying that he was playing for a team that didn't exist until three years after he stopped playing, that can't possibly be correct either. Clearly this article isn't factual. Minor league baseball teams are generally not stupid. An all-time roster is a pretty definitive resource if you want to know if somebody has ever played for that team. And this guy hasn't. And according to <a href="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/clubs/index.jsp?cid=t437&amp;mc=info" class="external text" title="http://www.minorleaguebaseball.com/app/clubs/index.jsp?cid=t437&amp;mc=info" rel="nofollow">the official site of Minor League Baseball</a>, he's not even the accountant for this team. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 19:21, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
