<h2><span class="mw-headline">Confused</span></h2>
<p>I'm really confused by the purpose of this page. Why would someone not post on Requested Articles or just make the article themselves instead of posting a blurb here? It just seems, based on some of the content here already, that this page will be a magnet for (1) a lot of work keeping it formatted and (2) (cynically) a 10 or 20 to 1 ratio of subsubstub items destined for speedy deletion to something expandable.</p>
<p>I bring this up because I almost speedied this page as nonsense before you put the formatting at the top.&#160;:( --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 23:05, 5 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>While there are tons of great anon article contributors, there are just as many (if not more) people that simply litter the encyclopedia with vandalism. If we block an anon that creates junk, we also block his or her innocent neighbours. If they have to be registered to create junk, then blocks only affect them.

<p>What exactly is the objection to reminding admins that they are not specially imbued with editorial authority?

<dd>I agree with Grm_wnr, I don't see what the relevance is to this page - any registered user can create a page, even if it is their first edit. The rejected requests on this page would have ended up beeing speedy-deleted or AfDed anyway so it is not about censorship at all. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 19:04, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I've been thinking about trying to split off a subpage with guidelines and suggestions for users filling requests. Given that this is such a widely-visited page, and that it's being visited by new users, I think we should try to minimize the material at the top. I've been trying to assume good faith with my article creations; if I believe an article has some chance of surviving an AfD discussion, I post it, even if I would consider it "borderline". This is essentially the same view I've taken when I've newpage-patrolled in the past. Assuming that others agree, we could certainly state that on an instruction page. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 19:11, 6 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Hopefully, there's little need to lay instructions around this. It seems to be working, and I presume the editors looking at this page know what they're doing. There's already too much instruction at the top, and I think adding subpages and the like would risk unbalancing the simplicity. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 19:13, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It belongs here because some admins have forgotten it, or never bothered to read it in the first place. The text of the change talks about both admins and other page creators. But page creators who do not have admin privileges and thus do not have special power to abuse (like deleting a page another admin created though the first admin did not want it created<small><sup>†</sup></small>). So admins do need an extra helping of reminder.</p>
<p>There is clearly need to lay instructions around it, because the problem occurred as predicted. It's evident that editors looking at this page do not always know what they're doing. There is not too much instruction at the top, because this instruction is needed. I agree that subpages would unbalance the simplicity.</p>
<p>† - this is a special problem. There is an ethic among admins that once one of them has made a decision, another can not reverse it without an argument. This means that one admin, simply by being there first, can cause lengthy turmoil with a wrong decision. And nobody can pretend that admins are infallible. The basing of decisions on subjective opinion rather than objective rules is especially troublesome in such a model. Thus it is doubly important that admins be reminded that their role is that of an intelligent program, not an opinionated editor. <a href="../../../2/1/6/User%7E216.237.179.238.html" title="User:216.237.179.238">216.237.179.238</a> 20:21, 6 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>In retrospect I'm not sure that the Archives are really necessary (I originally added the link). This page is going to get a lot of traffic. I think that we should have a list of articles that were created at the top, so that people who come back can find them, and I'd like to keep refused requests around for a day or two, so we can post replies. But I think that longterm archives are unnecessary. I'm open to suggestions otherwise. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 02:08, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>How about this: when a user creates an article as per here, they put a [[link]] in the edit history when they delete the section. Then a note at top of this page can say, <i>if your article isn't here, check the <a href="../../../_/_/_/.html" title="">history</a> to see if it has been created.</i> The history might provide enough archiving, unless of course (should I say it) the history is deleted for some reason. <a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrl_00fb.html" title="User:Srl">Srl</a> 04:17, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>You are likely to be dealing with new users (you can see this from the difficulties they are having with the page already). Asking them to look at the history is too much to expect them to learn.</dd>
<dd>Also, I note that entries have been archived before the requestor has had a chance to see any responses, e.g. I created an article, with a different capitalisation from that requested and with some guidance (quote sources, too technical, etc.). That got archived overnight. I suspect the requestor will come back later today and wonder what happened to it and fail to find the new article, because of the capitalisation difference, and not notice the archive link.</dd>

Or be used to combine multiple AfC creation requests that individually lack content but together form something more worthwhile. <a href="../../../1/3/2/User%7E132.205.45.148.html" title="User:132.205.45.148">132.205.45.148</a> 21:08, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion for page revamp</span></h2>
<p>It seems like this page is getting a bit unwieldy. I originally left an "archive" link at the top, and was envisioning that pages would be left on AFC for a few days. But AFC is receiving very high traffic, and it has become difficult to tell which results still need attention. So, I'd like to suggest some changes. I'll be perfectly happy to do the necessary rearrangement of the page, if people seem to agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on responding on users' talk pages and removing posts from AFC as soon as possible. I've created some samples of response templates at <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_AFC_Templates_95b3.html" title="User:Creidieki/AFC Templates">User:Creidieki/AFC_Templates</a>, please feel free to give comments.</li>
<li>Get rid of the archives; there's already a Page History, and manually moving things into an archive is difficult with the current software. Most of the other "noncontentious" maintenance tasks (<a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">Wikipedia:Cleanup</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Wikipedia%7EHelp_desk_5342.html" title="Wikipedia:Help desk">Wikipedia:Help desk</a>) do not seem to have archives, and I don't think we need the permanent records that AfD or RFA does.</li>
</ul>
<p>For myself, it seems like these changes would make the page a lot easier to deal with, but I've been doing graduate school applications for the last few days, and others might be more involved in the current page. If there are no disagreements, I'll probably change things in the next day or two.</p>

<dd>This page is for use by anonymous users. Most anonymous users have dynamic addresses and some ISPs actually mis-operate DHCP so as to prevent home user accounts having stable addresses. The only safe communicatioin channel is the page itself (which iw also why I don't believe it is safe to archive even creations until one working day after the last comment/creation. It is also arguable (although given user psychology, there may not be a strong case) that seeing what gets rejected or modified may discourage the submission of unsuitable material. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 11:02, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>|Do most users have IP addresses that change within a day? I disagree that this page is a "safe communication channel" -- we've designed this page so that a clueless user can get here and submit an article request *without knowing the name of this page*. There isn't any safe or guaranteed-to-work channel. I think that the users we most strongly need to impress/help are the ones who are the least likely to come back here. Perhaps we could use the following compromise:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Leave a note on user's talk page in any case.</li>
<li>When article has been created and note has been left, delete the entry without archiving. List the article in the "Recently created articles" list at the top of the page for a few days.</li>
<li>If article is not created, leave an entry here for 1-2 days.</li>
<li>Separate the page by days, like Help Desk or something. -- <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECreidieki_9302.html" title="User:Creidieki">Creidieki</a> 22:22, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Most dialup users will have a different address every time (I'm on dialup but am unusual because it has static addresses). Anyone in AOL will be likely to come out of different port on the AOL proxy for every web request. One of the main European consumer ISPs deliberately breaks DHCP (this causes problems for people using the Network Time Protocol on that ISP and the speculation is that it is done to stop people running servers on consumer tarriffed products - discussion in relation to NTP suggests this practice is quite widespread). I believe that any user in Saudi Arabia will come from a very limited number of proxy addresses, and these may well behave like AOL's. (This is one of the big problems with vandals - it applies to upto about half of vandals, so they don't get the test templates accumulated properly.) --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 00:53, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>All right, I hadn't realized the problem was that widespread. What do you think of the current page setup? I've started the "list of recently-created articles" at the top, and I've been removing those requests from the page proper. I've also separated the requests by day. I understand that Talk Page messages aren't reliable; do you still think they're a good idea?

I got several reasons NOT to work with an account (I do have an account, but don't use it anymore since february - intentionally!) One main reason is that I don't like all the personal discussions with people flooding user talk pages, instead of concentrating questions or criticism on a specific article. I mean Wikipedia ia an awesome project.

<dd>Hi Peter, You'd only need to use your account to create the new page. Or use AFC to create the page. Everything else could be done from an anon account. Is that a big obstacle?

<dd>Yes, it is, because I'm used to write non-stubs. I usually prepare texts before creating an article on the wiki and I often edit an article never again afterwards. And articles would be related to a clear account again than - what I don't want. The way round AFC appears as an unreasonable demand to me. It is quite uncomfortable, too (think about categories, inter wiki links, tables). The alternative, that I always and first have to ask someone else to create a silly 3-word-page (e.g. <i>"Pulsatilla vulgaris is a plant"</i>) before I can edit or add my text, is also pointless. I don't want to imagine how long I have to wait for such a wished <a href="../../../l/e/m/Lemma_%28linguistics%29.html" title="Lemma (linguistics)">lemma</a>. We will definitely lose good authors, who don't want to reveal a <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_privacy.html" title="Data privacy">daily profile</a> of their activity or their interests over months/years with such an account, or who don't like personal discussions. You may want to tell me, that I could create a new account for every new article. Of course, I could, but that is no serious solution (think about account maintenance in the future).

<li>It would appear that the user wishing to create articles has several possible tactics to do so while remaining anonymous. The easiest of which is to create a userID. The various objections here all have simple workarounds, even if they are not considered "serious". But perhaps it's worth discussing ways to "opt out" of some of the ID tracking features (contributions, talk page, etc.) that exist. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 05:10, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Allowing editors to "opt out" of talk pages and/or having their contributions examined would only lead to more problems. This is an open-content project; communication and accountability are key. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 14:42, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I only said it would be worth discussing. If there is, as you say, such a high value on accountability, then why do we allow anonymous edits in the first place? <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:11, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Accountability is very important for <i>registered</i> users. It'd be hard to, say, become an administrator if no one were able to trudge through your edit history. Anonymous users are less accountable for their edits; some may see that as a benefit, others not. They are accorded fewer rights (no adminship, can't vote on adminship, to name a few) and are taken less seriously by some as a result. Adding the ability to hide one's contribution history would open up a very large can of worms and lead to all sorts of abuses. Imagine being able to POV-war or linkspam with impunity.</li>
<li>All Wikipedia users are effectively as anonymous (or pseudonymous, but the difference is not important) as they choose to be. If I logged out and edited, you could easily determine where I am editing from and my ISP from my IP; since I'm logged in, the only reason anyone knows where I'm from is because I choose to share that information on my user page, and I could lie about it if I wanted to. That's why I don't quite understand the high importance some people place on being able to edit from IP. You get <i>more</i> privacy out of a username, not less, and more accountability. On an open project like this, that's a <i>good</i> thing for the project, but a <i>bad</i> thing for the editor with an agenda and a rapidly-changing IP address. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 00:40, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This may seem like lots more work, and for a one-line stub it certainly may be, but compared to the time it takes to write an article like <a href="../../../../de/f/r/%C3%BC/Fr%C3%BChlings-Kuhschelle_da6e.html" class="extiw" title="de:Frühlings-Kuhschelle">Pulsatilla vernalis</a>(mentioned above as an example similar to Peter's work), it is utterly negligible.

<p>There is no way that the people making the requests will have had time to see the reasons for the rejection and challenge them. They are probably going to assume that they were removed for vandals, or think that people are exercising vicarious power.</p>
<p>I've noticed this user deleting or archiving prematurely on several previous occasions. He's also deleted caveated creates (e.g. naming convention changes and warnings about POV and verifiability).</p>
<p>Generally the sort of person who makes use of this page won't understand how to use the history, and even if they do, the articles are being deleted in blocks without an adequate edit summary, so they will have to trawl through the whole history to find out what happened.</p>
<p>There is a secondary benefit in leaving up rejects, in that some requestors may realise that their requests will be rejected.</p>

<li>What if we leave "improper" suggestions in place for about two days, with "proper" suggestions moved to a short list at the top of the page (for about two days), and really obvious vandalism removed? That solution isn't optimal, because it involves an additional edit on the part of the person handling successful requests (putting a link at the top of the page).

<li>I've been waiting a day or two before removing unfulfilled and good-faith-but-unfulfillable (i.e., copyvio, obvious vanity) requests – generally the improper requests have been commented on to indicate why they are improper requests. I'm not sure of the utility of leaving copyvio requests up for all to see – if a user doesn't bother to read the notice at the top of the page, they're not likely to "get it" or care anyway. As for bad requests of other sorts, I may be expecting too much of our anonymous users, but laying out a clear, simple set of guidelines at the top might be sufficient in lieu of leaving bad requests up for a long period of time. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 17:44, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One of the most important things we've learned from <a href="../../../u/s/a/Usability.html" title="Usability">usability</a> studies is that people don't read instructions. People tend to make choices as soon as they think they have enough information to choose the correct option.

I don't believe that it's possible for us to make a custom "creation" page, rather than the standard "create a new section" page -- that's very unfortunate.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Ideas for templates</span></h2>
<p>I've got ideas for two sets of templates. The first would be for noting "bad" requests made on the project page: "Please provide more sources", "That's a nn-bio", "You're logged in! You don't need AfC", etc., only phrased much more nicely with a informative-but-concise explanation of why the request can't (or won't) be fulfilled. The second set would be counterparts to the first set to be placed on the requestor's talk page. Would these see enough use to make their creation worthwhile? <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 14:14, 15 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, I've made a couple, and will do some more later. <i>n</i> stands for a note on the AFC project page; <i>t</i> stands for a message to be left on the user's talk page. Suggestions for a better naming scheme are always welcome.

<li>{{afcn-copyvio}}, {{afct-copyvio}}, for copyvio'd proposals</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I get the impression that a significant proportion of logged in cases are really attempts to launder the true creator (a prime example is the Sleep Therapy article, where the requestor has had all his changes to a related page reverted).</dd>
<dd>A significant recent special case of nn-bio's have been election posters (my understanding is that you are not notable as the result of an election until elected).</dd>
<dd>There are also quite a few attempts to promote companies and products (e.g. the current singing one which has four or five related proposed articles).</dd>
<dd>A fairly common characteristic of all of these, and of most copyvios, is the use of marketing hype language, which probably justifies a standard response in itself.</dd>
<dd>There are two sub-cases of copyvios: clear cut copy violations, and cases where there is some possibility that the request is being made by the copyright owner's agent, e.g. I've left the election posters in on the basis that they are probably an attempt to use whatever media is available (they should get rejected for other reasons).</dd>
<dd>Another popular problem is trying to create articles for minor components of elements of popular culture (band members, game characters, games swords, film rubbish compacters, etc.); they should create the content in the parent, then try for a redirect. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Woolley_c02a.html" title="User:David Woolley">David Woolley</a> 18:52, 17 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Although some users may be trying it on to try and get copyright violations laundered into Wikipedia, I think most are from people who just don't understand the concept.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Strong sourcing requirements</span></h2>
<p>Wikinews had a scheme just like this for quite a while. The experience of Wikinews was that a strong sourcing policy is a good idea, and works well. <i>No</i> article was created at Wikinews unless the submission cited at least one source. Editors would request sources for submissions that didn't have them, but if no sources were presented within a reasonable amount of time, submissions would be discarded. (Of course, editors processing submissions could go and find sources themselves, too.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:06, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent idea. If no source is cited, there definately shouldn't be an article created, and the submission should be discarded (in a way the contributors can see the reason for it). A nice side-effect would also be we'ld be able to tell quickly if something was based on an external source, or just copy/psated from a source. This approach also gives a fair and objective way of reducing the clutter, so more valuable contributions aren't lost in the mix. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 08:30, 18 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Agreed. It should be an absolute enforced requirement. Perhaps we should even speedily move such totally unsourced new articles out of article space (till sources are given). Put them in a project page similiar to this (though not this specific page). Simple rule: "no source, no article". Also, in the shorter term, I would suggest a standard approach should be for everyone finding an unsourced article to always contact the author, and tell them a source is required according to <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">425K?!? for the AFC page is unusable</span></h2>
<p>Trying to type takes a second or two per letter to appear on the screen--somehow the AFC page needs to be kept smaller.

<li>I had tried to keep it managable by archiving good requests and deleting the bad ones, but apparently no one has picked that up in my absense. I'll have a go at chopping down the size later tonight. We need more editors watching this page. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><span style="color: green">android</span></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><span style="color: purple">79</span></a> 02:44, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>It's a fun page. Much more rewarding to participate here than on AfD. I was, unfortunately, unavailable for a week or so to help with the workload. --<a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 17:43, 3 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Policy explanation links no longer work</span></h2>
<p>This page (and probably many other places) has at least two links to <a href="../../../v/i/l/Wikipedia%7EVillage_pump_%28technical%29_e812.html#Anon_page_creation_restriction" title="Wikipedia:Village pump (technical)">Wikipedia:Village_pump_(technical)#Anon_page_creation_restriction</a> saying that will explain why this page is necessary, but that link no longer works since that Pump discussion has been archived. Seems like that info needs to be posted to a more permanent location that can be linked to going forward (unless, of course, the "experiment" actually ends soon). 65.35.49.186 02:36, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is becoming un-manegable so I am attempting to start a new system. I copied it here <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2005-12-16_4228.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2005-12-16">Wikipedia:Articles for creation/2005-12-16</a>.

<h2><span class="mw-headline">Cleaning</span></h2>
<p>I closed a request with links to the new article and the original request text - which I immediately moved to the archive. Any issues / problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_creation&amp;diff=33145800&amp;oldid=33144511" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_creation&amp;diff=33145800&amp;oldid=33144511" rel="nofollow">this</a> procedure? If not then I'm going to start so handling various already 'answered' requests which are cluttering up the page. If we follow this as standard practice then each 'day' on the page should be quickly filled just with links like this and we can delete whole 'day' sections when they pass two weeks old or something like that. Let me know what you think. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 18:32, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Seems good. Please leave any relevent comments, such as "might need attention from other editors", in case the "other editors" want check up. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 06:47, 1 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
