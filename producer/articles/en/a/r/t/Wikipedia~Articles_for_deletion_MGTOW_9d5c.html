However, I personally have been involved in the Men's Movement for 2 years, and have made contributions at www.standyourground.com/forum and www.laboratorymike.com/patriarchy, among other places, and can vouch for the significance of MGTOW as a subset of the Marr iage strike or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antifeminism.html" title="Antifeminism">antifeminism</a>. Editing is a better alternative to deletion.

<dd><b>Comment</b> A quick informal poll of over 100 marines sitting around here at the barracks, and none of them have heard of your "donkey punch".

<li><b>SAVE</b> There are many other movements of similar size with Wikipedia entries.

<li><b>SAVE</b> This is a new and fast growing movement and is a valid reaction against feminism, socialism and globalism. therefore, in the name of freedom of speech, it should be kept as it is.Ragnar 08:55, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>SAVE</b> The MGTOW movement is against sexism and anti-male hatred. It promotes a equal society for all, without privileges based on gender. It has the right to exist and spread awareness about these problematic, ignored issues. Artanisen 11:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Just to be clear, there are websites on the net about MGTOW. The fact they where not included in the article means that an edit is required so that it is on-par with the rest of Wikipeida's articles, not deletion. For instance the following is a link about the movement <a href="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" class="external free" title="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" rel="nofollow">http://menforjustice.net/cms/</a> which should have been included in the article. --Thorsson 16:18, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> As I said, you need to go back and READ the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion policy</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability</a> before you clamor for something to be deleted! From the article:</dd>
</dl>
<p>It has been argued that lack of "notability" is not a criterion for deletion, because (among other things) this isn't specifically stated in the deletion policy; and since Wikipedia is not paper with (in theory) no size limits, there's no reason why Wikipedia shouldn't include "everything" that fits in with our other criteria, such as verifiability and no original research.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>SAVE</b> Edit rather than Deletion. The articles subject is part of the masculine, anti-feminist movement so I would consider it notable. Neutrality is a matter that can easily be rectified by an edit. As for citations there are websites out there about the movement, as I noted above, and an edit would once again rectify that problem. --Thorsson 16:34, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That is fine, it is not up to you to decide when to censor everyone because you do not agree with what they have to say.

<p>This debate is a clear example of the wonders and pitfalls inherent to modern communication. Claims of ballet stuffing, on the surface, appear valid. Indeed, as defined in Wiki <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policies_and_guidelines.html" title="Policies and guidelines">policies and guidelines</a>, that is exactly what is happening.</p>
<p>The problem is simply this. How can any organization, born of digital communications prove its existence outside of a traditional media outlet? What options are there, other than a ‘head count’, and the understandable allegations of ballet stuffing that comes with it?</p>
<p>I put forward a simple question, what would it take, in the eyes of editors and admin, to validate the existence of MGTOW(as it seems to be the issue). And what sort of time frame is available to do so? As the answers to these questions would raise others, I politely invite a response ( osmod@hotmail.com) .Thank you. <a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmod_7f73.html" title="User:Osmod">Osmod</a> 19:19, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><i>Warning</i>, gentlemen... it may be amusing for you to organize a <i>"Take-over-the-Wiki"</i> movement at your forum, but it is completely unacceptable to blatantly insult people and ridicule them. Regardless of this debate, I encourage you to keep this conversation within the limits of respect and good taste. I also insist that personal pictures of Wikipedia editors are <i>"not"</i> meant to be posted anywhere but on Wiki itself, unless you are given proper permission - it's a simple question of good faith.

<p>Funny you want to bring up what members of Niceguys forums are saying when you get together and say things such as calling us <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Phaedriel</a>]Pathetic MGTOW morons Nice hypocrisy. Don't complain what is being down on a seperate forum and website when you are doing the same name calling. Another thing. I like how you call the whole forum and its members "MGTOW Morons" as if that forum is the only place where MGTOW is talked about, Discussed and followed as if its Just little ol' us. We are just the ones here at the moment. Shall we go spread it around to the rest of the sites and blog spheres and bring more people here? You see, Mgtow has already been at multiple anti-feminist websites and forums for the past year. ALl you need to do is take a look. Its been at Cooltools4men,Stand your ground, Mens news daily. mens-rights and a whole host of anti-feminism blogs out in the blogsphere and even has a comprehensive site at <a href="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" class="external free" title="http://menforjustice.net/cms/" rel="nofollow">http://menforjustice.net/cms/</a>&gt;Men for justice There is a book already far along being created at this very moment. It wouldn't be hard at all to edit in that "Notability" You say the article needs. All we'd need to do is go out and spread out the word and no doubt we could get those external links up. There would be the book out for sale. The language used could be changed to make it sound less preachy and "Soapbox" like. This could be done very easy yet you all would rather refuse to have it happen. Because you know we could make it meet the notability requierments. I don't see why this can not be done. As it would stop the need for such a debate and bashing one another. How?, Because then it would show that you really are just Following your own rules or that this really is just admins that want to silence dissenting opinions that differ from thier own.<a href="../../../r/h/y/User%7ERhythmic01_1528.html" title="User:Rhythmic01">Rhythmic01</a> 22:23, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Maybe some media coverage.</b> There is no need for traditional mainstream media coverage by the very way the movement is setup. Give it a read. Or better yet. You should have already seen this on our forum since you are spying on us. Allow me to quote what I said on our forums. Something that you should already have read no? <b>I have seen multiple blogs that in spirit, Go by the basics of MGTOW they don't actually come out and say this or are vocal about calling and/or identifing themselves as such.</b></p>
<p>Thats the thing with a movement set up in the way we have it. There are many men who have thier own sites and blogs that are indeed. About them going thier own way.

<dd>(editconflict)*<b>Comment</b> Let me just ask you a simple question, and there's nothing vicious behind it, I'm just curious and you don't have to answer it: What is the appeal of having an article on MGTOW on Wikipedia? I'm just asking and wondering what the answer is. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> 22:33, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Yanksox, That is a fairly complex question.</p>
<p>The first and foremost reason is the countless subtypes of feminism listed on wiki. If there is room for 101 types of feminism (exact numbers unimportant), then there should be room for a men’s philosophy, all be it a minor one.</p>
<p>Pardon my humor here, but I can only laugh when we were told to find independent supporting web sites as a minimum. The problem with that is this. Either you don’t care about what MGTOW is, or you have a political view on it. And sites that agree with MGTOW wouldn’t count for independent support. The issue is very polarized. Given that the MGTOW community has failed in creating bonds/friends in the feminist community ( can’t at all see why ), it makes it close to impossible to display a ‘independent’ source online.</p>
<p>Secondly, being listed, or more correctly, not de-listed, is a validation and a general step forward for the philosophy as a whole. A self-serving reason, granted. But human beings have been known to be somewhat self-centered. <a href="../../../o/s/m/User%7EOsmod_7f73.html" title="User:Osmod">Osmod</a> 23:53, 4 June 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>As I've stated above, you haven't been able to provide links from fair sources</b> I put down the names of a few sites. Go ahead and take it from there. I refuse to sit down for the next 4 hours saving, linking and cataloging multiple anti-feminist sites and blogs so you can outright deem them as not being fair sources and delete anyway. From my point of view you already made up your mind. Now if we are givin the chance to edit out the page and make it so it can stay without it being deleted outright. I wouldn't be against doing the work. But it has already sounded like you have already made up your mind. First by saying <b>Well, we shouldn't go that far. Most of the new registered users voting to keep the article will never be heard from again once it's truly gone for good</b> You've already made up your mind. You claimed I haven't named any sites when I already did name a few. Meaning either you didn't bothering reading my post in full or you did and just skimed past it because you don't care. Thus no matter what sites I put up that show that its more than just the niceguy forum community you will still say. Its just one forum delete anyway because you personally want to see it deleted. I have seen nothing that shows an open mind. I gave you enough to jump start yourself. If you don't want to then nothing will convice you otherwise and typing here is a waste of time.

<p>You refused to notice my mention mens news daily? Angry Harry? Why not say what you mean 100 percent. "actual media attention" you mean just mainstream traditional media outlets. Nothing is allowed on Wikipedia unless its mentioned on cnn? What if I told you there was a book that is already out for amazon.com that served as the basis of MGTOW and damn near every basic and tenet of MGTOW thoughout all of his life expeirences. If anything, There would be no MGTOW if it wasn't for this book. Even more to the point. His current revision actually has an entry to a site that list the core idea of MGTOW.

<p><b>His current revision actually has an entry to a site that list the core idea of MGTOW</b> Part of the latest version of the book makes changes to the second to last chapter. Page numbers from my own outdated book are 254-255 listing Anti-feminist pro-male sites he[the author] visits. depending on if pages were added or taken out it should be in or around there.My own copy is an older one thus I can't give you an exact reference or exact statement.Feel free to buy his current version. Changes should include updated urls to referrals to anti-feminist sites and adding in some more one of which is about MGTOW. Him, Being active around the anti-feminist scene has said this to us[us as in anti-feminist...]. You would have the answer to this and indeed it should have been fairly easy to find this book for yourself if you actually poked around. Funny, You ask a question that was answered just 2 lines above yours. Even better I just type a paragraph restating what was said in one line. You know what. That is enough. I won't bother putting anything else here as you have shown this is a waste of time when you can't even be bother to read something that is.

<p><br />
Rhytmic, could you please calm down? Take a deep breath? K? Ok, let's get to the issue here, and stay as focused and concise as possible. I see you've taken our pictures off your forum; that's a good start, and I commend it, seriously. Regarding the article, it's not whether or not we want it deleted due to ideological matters. I think none of us (not even me, being female) have taken a position based in our sympathy to your cause or not. Most of us tend to think as Wikipedians; that means, there are a few basic rules <i>any</i> article must comply in order to deserve space here. For further information, there are several guidelines I would suggest you to read thoroughly, like <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENOT_aef6.html" title="Wikipedia:NOT">What Wikipedia is not</a> and <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVerifiability_beed.html" title="WP:Verifiability">Verifiability</a>. What we're trying to determine is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the object of this article notable, as in, widely known and recognized outside certain particular forums and blogs?</li>
<li>Can this notability be endorsed with independent sources of any kind?</li>
<li>Can these sources be listed and, if possible, doublechecked?</li>
</ul>
<p>We're open to discussion here; and rest assured that we are perfectly able to weight in a positive and objective manner <i>every</i> element you bring to our attention. You mention that you're not willing to <i>"spend four hours saving, linking and cataloging multiple anti-feminist sites and blogs..."</i> Did you know that writing a good article takes way longer than that? Trust me, all the effort you're willing to put in this article will only be for better, as it may assure its permanence here... that, if you're interested in going through that effort. A second positive step would be to rewrite it in an objective and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral</a> way. Take all the time you need; nobody's rushing you, and this debate will stay open for, at least, a few days. Just make sure that you're working with <i>our</i> guidelines here, not yours; it is <i>you</i> who wants to post here, not us at your forum.</p>
<p>We've had tons of articles that, <i>prima facie</i>, were unworthy of being included at Wikipedia, only to find out later and after further work from some editors interested in the subjects they covered that they were perfectly suitable here. Nobody's saying that cannot be the case with your article as well; on the contrary, I encourage you and other members of your forum to take the endeavor of making this a great article, one that we'll be happy to show around. And if you do, I swear right here that I'll be the first to congratulate you... even despite the fact that I'm a woman.

<dd>You still have failed to answer my question. I am just curious. You don't have to take such a deffensive tone because you are threatened by the notion of a "vandalbot". Oh, and you are wrong, Angus, that is a proxy I am using in KY. I don't even live in the U.S. Sorry. Also, you need to pick up a book on logic. You posit that life must be boring because I am making these casual comments on wikipedia. Applying the same logic, life must be REALLY boring where you live as you are a wikipedia EDITOR.

Nothing prevents a non-notable thing from becoming notable one day and then having an article on wikipedia.

<dd>I found an answer to my question (the SQUIDWARD vandal used this method, and you were powerless to stop him). Also, I have read Wikipedia.info and now understand the true nature of Wikipedia. Look, if you guys just act in an uncontrolled childish fashion, you are going to inspire more true vandalism like SQUIDWARD. Then, you will just have to lock down editing ability. So, the trend will continue untill Wikipedia is totally locked down except by editorial staff, and at that point it will have lost all of its advantage to traditional media. I understand now why nobody in academia takes wikipedia seriously.</dd>
