<p>Oh my. Although these articles do not violate any written policy of Wikipedia per se, common sense tells us that these articles are incredibly unnecessary, unwieldy and overwhelmingly useless; in short, unsalvageable cruft. There is already an article on this topic <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress_e560.html" title="Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress">here</a>, which is also very crufty but is salvageable.</p>

<li><b>Delete all</b> - The subject is covered more than adequately in Ellison's article. We do not need articles on every individual pundit's reaction to the so-called "controversy" that Ellison didn't want to swear on a Bible. I'm tempted to label all of these articles bad faith efforts to slam Ellison. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:07, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - actually, upon reading the article, it seems to be pro-Ellison, anti-Goode (who raised the furor). At least according to this article, the controversy seems to stem from Goode's complaint, not so much Ellison's use of the Quaran / Koran) --Action Jackson IV 07:42, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Keith Ellison should have an article, the original controversy merits an article, but not all these granddaughter articles from Keith Ellison. There is a line between Wikipedia being comprehensive and an editor not being able to write concisely to the point where it becomes a weakness and hindrance.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I wrote most of these pages when I was a newbie and thought the goal of Wikipedia would be to contain the greatest depth of information possible. Like a library of all human knowledge, where you could find any details you could possibly want. I had thought that it would just be a matter of time before anyone seeking information would be best served coming to Wikipedia before going anywhere else.

<li>The problem is, someone would have to wade through a ton of extraneous information just to get some substance. It's not about how much you can write, it's about how concisefully you can write it, and these articles are so overwhelmingly massive that conciseness is impossible, especially when you're dealing with extraneous stuff to begin with. Seriously, do we need individual articles for each of these responses to the incident? No, we don't. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 22:44, 13 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> for the moment, but by all means have a discussion on the main talkpage (which is a better venue for merge discussions than AFD) on whether to merge these articles. My impression is that the articles are well-sourced and on a notable topic and controversy in U.S. politics history, and I am not altogether against detailed coverage of it, but several of the articles nominated bear resemblance to newspaper articles rather than encyclopedia articles. On the other hand, the main article is pretty long already, so some splitting off into side articles may well be appropriate. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:24, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per the nomination: <i>"these articles do not violate any written policy of Wikipedia per se"</i>. Although I find the articles unwieldy, I disagree with the nominator that they are unnecessary (especially not incredibly so) or useless (especially not overwhelmingly so). At least <i>some</i> of the people who created these articles surely possessed some common sense. That said, a merge of one or more of these articles to <a href="../../../q/u/r/Qur%27an_oath_controversy_of_the_110th_United_States_Congress_e560.html" title="Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress">Qur'an oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress</a> may be appropriate, but that is not a matter for AFD. This is an issue about the appropriate organisation of content and, as such, should be confined to the articles' talk pages. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:19, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not suggesting that the writer lacked common sense, I just <a href="../../../i/_/k/I_know_it_when_I_see_it_05b8.html" title="I know it when I see it">don't feel that these articles are appropriate for Wikipedia</a>. That's why I nominated these articles for deletion. --<a href="../../../h/e/m/User%7EHemlock_Martinis_534d.html" title="User:Hemlock Martinis">Hemlock Martinis</a> 04:25, 15 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I realise that and didn't mean to suggest that your nomination was intended to insult the editors of the articles. However, I don't feel that "common sense" alone (i.e., without discussion on the talk page) can dictate what ought to be done in this case, and the disagreement above seems to support that view. You raise a valid point that these articles may not need to exist separately, but (again) I feel that's an editorial issue suited for a talk page rather than AFD. I am not opposed to content being merged from one into another and subsequently trimmed (or vice versa), but I do not believe simple deletion is an appropriate course of action in this case. I hope this clarifies my position and the argument I'd intended to convey.
