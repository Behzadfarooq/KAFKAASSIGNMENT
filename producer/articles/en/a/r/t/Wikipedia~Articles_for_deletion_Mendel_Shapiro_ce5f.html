<li><b>Keep</b>. The relevant guideline is <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, whose central notability criteria is publication in multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Rabbi Shapiro easily meets this criterion. As to scholarly coverage within his field, the <a href="../../../r/a/b/Rabbinical_Council_of_America_a156.html" title="Rabbinical Council of America">Rabbinical Council of America</a>, North America's largest Orthodox Rabbinical association, devoted a considerable part of an issue of its scholarly journal <i>Tradition</i> to comments on Rabbi Shapiro, see e.g. <a href="http://traditiononline.org/news/article.cfm?id=100780" class="external autonumber" title="http://traditiononline.org/news/article.cfm?id=100780" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, which specifically identifies R.

<li>Shira we all know how to use Google, but let's try using our brains as well. While Mendel Shapiro may be a fine man, he is just one of tens of millions of lawyers and hundreds of thousands of minor rabbis over the ages in the world with nice articles about them and with books they may have had published here and there, BUT that would in no way qualify them to become icons or guides for new ways of re-inventing Judaism. What you are saying Shira, is that this pesron, because he is a lawyer with a "semichah" yet and has had his words printed can now come forth and change Judaism and as you argue in the article that that is his "claim to fame" -- nowhere in Jewish history have lawyers had ANY standing in the world of <a href="../../../t/o/r/Torah_study.html" title="Torah study">Torah study</a> and they have zero significance as innovators of Jewish customs and certainly their opinions mean nothing in Jewish law. So in that regard he is totally <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">not notable</a>. By way of example: The <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jews_for_Jesus_eb46.html" title="Jews for Jesus">Jews for Jesus</a> can also claim to have <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> but that still gives them less than ZERO credibility in the world of Judaism. Wikipedia cannot teach lies it has a responsibilty to <a href="../../../f/a/c/Fact.html" title="Fact">facts</a> as well. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 09:48, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - while not agreeing with much of the above, the article does not assert notability. The only reference is a paper by the subject and all of the references listed above either mention shapiro in passing or refer only to the paper that is the sole reference for the article. No evidence that Shapiro has been the subject of multiple, independant, non-trivial published works - <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPeripitus_dfdd.html" title="User:Peripitus">Peripitus</a> <a href="../../../p/e/r/User_talk%7EPeripitus_05d5.html" title="User talk:Peripitus">(Talk)</a> 11:39, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> - my first instinct was to say "See my comments at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Daniel_Sperber_54c6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Sperber">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Daniel Sperber</a>", but I think, on reading the article, that I agree with Peripitus. The external links show only two independent sources, both fairly obscure outside the world of Jewish study, and this person doesn't have the same claim to notability as Sperber. However, I would like to reprimand the nominator again for clearly promoting a POV, and would like to clarify that whether or not something has "credibility in the world of Judaism" is not a criterion for deletion on Wikipedia. Wikipedia does not judge articles relating to religious figures based purely on what their co-religionists think of them; we apply the same neutral <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability standards</a> to all biographies.</s> <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 12:23, 20 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b> <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requires only notability due to major contribution within ones field, notabilitiy outside it is not required.

<li><b>Keep</b> - fair enough, the sources now appearing in the article are sufficient to establish notability. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 10:32, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> keep</b> if we would have gone just by <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> in the nomination I probably would have had less of a problem with voting delete, but it is very hard to do that if the basis of the nomination is the fact that somebody does not like the content of it. On the other hand, all the pains certain people go through to get the Jewish Feminism out of Wikipedia in itself shows that the theme is noted and therefore notable <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 13:43, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
