<li><b>Keep</b>, as BrainBread is a considerably notable <i>Half-Life</i> mod. The mod is continuously in the top 20-25 ranking of all Steam multiplayer games and mods being played at any time (<a href="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=stats" rel="nofollow">Official Steam Stats</a>); it was picked by Valve to be listed in Steam's store, both on the official Steampowered site and through the program itself, as a free mod to download (See its listing at the <a href="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=90006&amp;" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com/v/index.php?area=game&amp;AppId=90006&amp;" rel="nofollow">Steam store</a>, also note that <i>only</i> 24 mods, out of the hundreds and hundreds available, are listed); and it is one of the more popular <i>Half-Life</i> mods today. For example, Brainbread is, even to this day, consistently in the top 20 downloads of the week at <a href="http://halflife2.filefront.com/" class="external text" title="http://halflife2.filefront.com/" rel="nofollow">HL2Files.com</a>, which is, quite interestingly, a major site in the FileFront network dedicated to <i>Half-Life 2</i>, not <i>Half-Life</i>. It has currently amasssed over <a href="http://halflife2.filefront.com/file/HalfLife_BrainBread_V12_Full_Install;36091" class="external text" title="http://halflife2.filefront.com/file/HalfLife_BrainBread_V12_Full_Install;36091" rel="nofollow">115,000 downloads</a> on this site as well. As it was hand picked by Valve Software themselves to be listed in Steam, and it is one of the most popular <i>Half-Life</i> mods around, I believe that Brainbread is notable enough to keep. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 21:17, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>You did not address any of my concerns regarding failing WP:V and WP:RS. Being listed at some mod sites does not make it meet WP's policies for verifiability.<a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 22:15, 1 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><a href="http://steampowered.com" class="external text" title="http://steampowered.com" rel="nofollow">Steampowered</a> is not just some mod site. It's <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valve_Corporation_3e43.html" title="Valve Corporation">Valve Software</a>'s official homepage for their <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28content_delivery%29.html" title="Steam (content delivery)">Steam</a> program. They made the site and they made the program. And they are also the ones that made <i>Half-Life</i> and <i>Half-Life 2</i>. If someone is playing <i>Half-Life 2</i>, <i>Counter-Strike: Source</i>, <i>Day of Defeat: Source</i>, etc, then they have Steam. Wouldn't the developers of the game that the mod is made for be considered reliable? It's not as if Valve is arbitrarily deciding that any mod made for one of their games is worthy enough to be officially listed through their own content distribution program. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 01:26, 2 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - OF COURSE this mod exists, it's listed by Valve Software itself along with only a handful of other Half Life Mods, and steampowered.com is about as reliable and verifiable a source for the existence and notability of a half life mod as you're ever going to get. --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 01:41, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>This fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#Burden_of_evidence" title="WP:V">WP:V#Burden_of_evidence</a> which directly states "If an article topic has no reputable, reliable, third-party sources, Wikipedia should not have an article on that topic." This does not have any reputable, reliable, third-party sources, thus, there should not be an article. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 14:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>Erm, you're wilfully ignoring what we've been saying about <a href="../../../v/a/l/Valve_Corporation_3e43.html" title="Valve Corporation">Valve Corporation</a> and <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steam_%28content_delivery%29.html" title="Steam (content delivery)">steampowered.com</a>. Do a whois on steampowered.com, go to the damn website and knock yourself out, verification-wise. If you were half-smart you might have a go at challenging the notability of the mod, but the verifiability is a no-brainer. --<a href="../../../a/i/m/User%7EAim_Here_37ff.html" title="User:Aim Here">Aim Here</a> 17:45, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would like to mention that the listings on Steampowered contain little more than a couple sentence summary and links to the mod's website. While clearly it shows <i>existence</i>, almost all information in the article remains unverifiable without original research. But, yes, you are quite correct in stating that the notability of the mod has certainly not been proven. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 18:26, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>You talk as if being officially recognized by Valve, quite possibly the most authoritative source around on the subject of <i>Half-Life</i> mods (they made the game, after all), is merely something to scoff at. Anyway, I think that you fail to grasp the concept at hand here. Valve is not simply just listing the mod on their site (although this in of itself is an exceptionally high honor), but they're actively helping to distribute the mod by directly advertising it through Steam. The same can only be said of about 20 or so other <i>Half-Life</i> mods.</li>
<li>If you want more "reputable, reliable, third-party sources", Brainbread was also <a href="http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLMotw.Detail&amp;id=28&amp;game=4" class="external text" title="http://planethalflife.gamespy.com/View.php?view=HLMotw.Detail&amp;id=28&amp;game=4" rel="nofollow">Mod of the Week</a> (Or month, depending on how you look at it) at <a href="../../../p/l/a/Planet_Half-Life_42cf.html" title="Planet Half-Life">Planet Half-Life</a>, a very notable, insanely well-known, and nearly definitive <i>Half-Life</i> news site run on the <a href="../../../g/a/m/GameSpy_a6b5.html" title="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> network. If for some reason you wish to question PHL's notability, check Google's first result for a search of "Half-Life". <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarphyBlack_8ec2.html" title="User:MarphyBlack">MarphyBlack</a> 22:18, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
