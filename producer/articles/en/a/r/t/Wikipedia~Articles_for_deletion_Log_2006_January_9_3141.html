<p>This article purports to be about the book <i>Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health</i> but a look at it shows that it isn't about the book but about the belief system first advanced in that work -- in other words, it's a POV fork of <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a>, which ends in highly unencyclopedic rambling about supposed supression of the book ("Fascist Germany had its propaganda machines, Communist Russia had its propaganda machines and one could assume any tyranny invented by man would defend itself by any of the means it uses. Dianetics has attracted its share Controversy <sup class="noprint">[<i><a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]</sup> from 1938 onward... this book ... sent a message to all that might attempt to enslave mankind.") Such ranting would never have passed consensus at <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> and the author should not have created this POV fork to house it.</p>

<li>I am not familiar with this deletion procedure, but I seek a petition. The <a href="../../../d/i/a/Dianetics.html" title="Dianetics">Dianetics</a> article was completely rewritten in my view from a negative point of view. The revision essentially ignored the Discussion process. It deleted facts from an article by a student represented as a scientific study for example. The facts presented in Discussion there for some time represent the negative tone of the article. Many editors familiar with Dianetics say it is unrecognisable. As a part of that rewrite my book article on Dianetics was replaced without discussion with a new version, and this deletion scheduled also without discussion. Anteaus Feldspar is a part of a group on Wike representing themselves as WP:SCN that has a membership where nearly everyone represents the negative on this issue. I think we need an unbiased Administrator to arbitrate a solution that is best for all. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpirit_of_Man_1688.html" title="User:Spirit of Man">Spirit of Man</a> 02:21, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The new version is a hasty put together without publisher, without ISBN, and make these erroneous statements: He then developed counseling (auditing) techniques for getting rid of engrams. This is still the technique used by Dianetics-trained counselors today. "auditing" is linked to an accounting defintion that nothing to do with the subject. The auditing techiques of that book are not the techniques since 1957 when training routines were developed to greatly improve the communications skill of auditors. Likewise the E-meter, session procedures and Golden Age of Tech training is the modern training for professional auditors. Book One auditing is completely workable and is still used in public areas but the statement here is hasty and not correct. Please look it over from an unbiased viewpoint. <a href="../../../s/p/i/User%7ESpirit_of_Man_1688.html" title="User:Spirit of Man">Spirit of Man</a> 02:36, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, did not know the soft policy against writing on stuff related to author's work --thought that one of the very virtues of Wikipedia was its ability to tap each contributor to write about what he/she knows best --as is always done in academic circles. A short descriptive and historic entry on each of the world's corporations seems to me appropriate content that is useful to the public at large, as long as information is kept factual and verifiable, but feel free to delete the entry if Wikipedia usage deems it inappropriate --no hurt feelings.

<p>Update: I can see there are many supporters of this page, but I would like to clarify my position. I nominated this for deletion because it is an incomplete and selective list of lists. Categories are useful because they are in a sense 'list of lists,' and they are also more than that. I believe there is no point in trying to revise this page.</p>
<p>In response to recent discussion, I would like to point out that there are zero redpages on this page. -- <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipedical_7c58.html" title="User:Wikipedical">Wikipedical</a> 20:39, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> — categories are often useless for multi-variate data. Some of the sub-lists include multiple parameters per game, so they can't be converted to lists without destroying information.

While most editors strive for expanding "human knowledge", but the creators of "The Opening Credits of America's Funniest Home Videos", "List of Scams of Ed, Edd n Eddy", and the above Rockbusters article (no offense intended against them) appear to be leaning heavily towards the "sum total" aspect of the equation. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 06:55, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't know if this is the right place to place this, so please forgive me. I am a DJ on habbohut radio. The original number of 500 forum users was a typo by the original poster. We currently have over 5000 users registered on the forum alone. Average listener number per show is 100-200 and for certain events the number is in the thousands. We've had celebrities grace are airwaves including Ashlee Simpson, VJ Sarah Tyler, The Gorillaz, Sons Of Butcher, and Skye Sweetnam among others. The purpose of our Wikipedia article is not self promotion as Arviragus claims, but a single portal for users to view the history of our radio station, a list of DJ's, information about habbohotel (the video game that we are an official fansite of), and information regarding how and when they can have their chance at becoming DJs themselves. If this is against Wiki policy, please delete our wiki, but the wiki policies that I have researched say nothing about posting a Wiki regarding the history and information of a growing online community, which is what we like to refer to habbohut as. Thank you, DJ-Omega

<ul>
<li>I understand what you are saying. Since the focus of the site is the radio, there really isn't a spot to post the history of habbohut. Ideally, our wiki would eventually include the dates that various celebrities were interviewed and provide links to where those interviews could be heard. Wikipedia was an indeal medium to branch habbohut out to the web. A way for people who search <a href="../../../h/a/b/Habbo.html" title="Habbo">habbo</a> on wiki (which you can classify as online media, something wiki policy prohibits) they can easily find another related website. Again, if we're in the wrong, delete our wiki. I don't believe we are, however.
<ul>
<li>OK the fact that you have celebrity guest convinces me that you are a legitimate radio station and of interest to wikipedia users. However you still can't use wikipedia as a web host, this has to be an encylopedia article about the station not a "portal". I advise you to list your celebrity guests at the top of the article, with links to prove the claims. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 00:13, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Thank you, But a quick question, why was our DJ list deleted? I thought it was a valid piece of information.
<ul>
<li>Come on, now, is there really any point in duplicating the DJ list in Wikipedia? Think about it, would you record this in stone forever? A little proof: <a href="http://www.skyesweetnam.com/news.aspx?newsid=6138|Skye" class="external text" title="http://www.skyesweetnam.com/news.aspx?newsid=6138|Skye" rel="nofollow">Sweetnam interview</a> (listed as Habbo Radio for some reason), <a href="http://www.habbohotel.ca/habbo/en/community/newsletter/article/?id=242|Article" class="external text" title="http://www.habbohotel.ca/habbo/en/community/newsletter/article/?id=242|Article" rel="nofollow">on Hotel CA</a>, unfortunately I can't find proof that Gorillaz broadcasted on the Hut but there are lots of pages on the web with news about their tour of the Habbo Hotels. On their final visit to the UK site they popped on air with dileas and Dubya. - worMatty 2256 GMT 2006.01.10</li>

<dd>n.b. There is now also Douche (disambiguation), which is not needed if this page goes, so I am adding it to this nomination.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, as per nom. "Douche" has got to be one of the lamest insults ever. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 05:56, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. Douche is a commonly used insult and the information contained on this page is merely transfered from other pages that already contained this information on the Wikipedia.{{unsigned|Madrake}
<ul>
<li>But Wikipedia is not a dictionary of slang terms, and "douche" does not seem to have gained enough use as others, such as <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a>. --<a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerovingian_a210.html" title="User:Merovingian">King of All the Franks</a> 06:08, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. I helped write this page, and I've been noticing the word crop up more and more in comedy. There is certainly a difference between someone looking for a general definition for the feminine product and someone looking for a general definition on the slang term. Also, Merovingian, your personal feelings on whether the insult is lame is not germane. Finally, Wikipedia might not be a dictionary of slang terms, but includes pages on "<a href="../../../b/a/t/Batty_boy.html" title="Batty boy">batty boy</a>", "<a href="../../../b/r/e/Breeder.html" title="Breeder">breeder</a>", "<a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimp.html" title="Gimp">gimp</a>", all of which are used less often in a public setting than douche. If you feel strongly on that, please also ask for deletion for those pages too. -- User: NYYW
<ul>
<li>And also, I looked at the douche page on wiktionary, and all it has for slang is: "slang an insulting term used to mean "stupid" generally, but also sometimes it is used in reference to an ugly person." It is far outside the realm of the wiktionary to include the myriad links and useful information we did on the douche (Slang Term) page.
<ul>
<li>Useful information like <i>"People who try to use the word portmanteau on Wikipedia pages are lame douches."</i>? hmmmm. <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">bikeable</a> <a href="../../../b/i/k/User_talk%7EBikeable_218a.html" title="User talk:Bikeable">(talk)</a> 06:47, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's because the Wiktionary article <i>is not finished yet</i>. It is nowhere near featured article status. It needs proper quotations for each meaning, etymologies, pronunciations in all relevant dialects, spoken pronunciations, any necessary usage notes, an inflection line for the noun, and (yes) links to related terms like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/douchebag" class="extiw" title="wikt:douchebag">douchebag</a>.

<li><a href="../../../b/r/e/Breeder.html" title="Breeder">breeder</a> is about an occupation and <a href="../../../g/i/m/Gimp.html" title="Gimp">gimp</a> is a disambiguation article, by the way.

<li>This is a dictionary article written in the wrong project, and as <a href="../../../b/i/k/User%7EBikeable_9029.html" title="User:Bikeable">Bikeable</a> point out, it's a bad dictionary article, at that. The meanings section is multiply redundant, the article having been padded out in an attempt to make it look like an encyclopaedia article, and whilst the "common uses" would do as examples at Wiktionary, Wiktionary aims for proper dated and attributed quotations from published works (to show the history of a word in actual use) rather than contrived examples where possible (although contrived examples will do until proper quotations come along). <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 07:24, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> The article goes beyond the dictionary definition of "douche." <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">Fuck</a> is also a word in the dictionary, yet it merits its own wikipedia article because of its extensive content. The content in <a href="../../../d/o/u/Douche.html" title="Douche">douche</a> is not quite as extensive as <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> but it's enough to distinguish itself from a dictionary entry. <a href="../../../d/r/i/User%7EDrIdiot_cdb1.html" title="User:DrIdiot">DrIdiot</a> 21:30, 9 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it does <i>not</i> go "beyond the dictionary definition of" the word. It contains <i>nothing</i> that a dictionary article wouldn't also contain. You have a misguided notion of what dictionary articles contain, that is apparently that they contain a few sentences or sentence fragments and nothing more. <i>Dictionary articles are not short</i>, and <i>Wiktionary is not paper, either.</i> There are dictionary articles on Wiktionary that bring up the article length warning. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:48, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>No, xe hasn't. Xe's simply added a quotation showing the word in use in a well-known work of literature and a short usage note. That's exactly the sort of thing that the dictionary needs, and that is exactly the sort of lexicography in the wrong project that I mentioned to in the nomination. Xe hasn't done <i>anything</i> to make an encyclopaedia article. Xe has simply expanded the dictionary article in the wrong project.

<li>No, it isn't "more than a dicdef". You have an erroneous notion of what dictionary articles may contain.

<li>One has only to read two sentences into <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_unusual_personal_names_033b.html" title="Talk:List of unusual personal names">Talk:List of unusual personal names</a> ("<i>Apple</i> isn't that unusual. Lots of Chinese are named <i>Apple</i>.") to see what the problem here is. What constitutes "unusual" to one culture is often run-of-the-mill to another, and thus for Wikipedia to describe some of these names as "unusual" is for Wikipedia to adopt one particular culture's point of view. There's been some refactoring discussed on the talk page, but the basic question "What is the point of this page?" has not been answered (in a way that adheres to the NPOV) yet. Perhaps refactoring this as a list of personal names that are unique to one person and intentionally chosen to be unusual in the view of the person choosing the name (e.g. people formally changing their name to make a point) might save the article. Of course, that's an exceedingly unwieldy title. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 08:11, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. There really doesn't seem to be a way to define what is unusual. The list would be inherently POV and centric to one culture.

How do you footnote the fact that Britney is normal in the US and unusual in Sri Lanka? And moreover, doesn't that simply transfer the onus of 'unusual' from one place (this article) to another? And what kind of references do you envision detailing culturaly unusual names denominated by culture, nuanced over time?

<li><b>Keep</b>. Let's not stretch the POV argument too far here - almost everything on Wikipedia could be argued as POV in some respect, but unusual names can at least be verified. In truth, the article is really "List of personal names that have been widely considered unusual", but that is a bit of a mouthful. Cleanup and verify, if you must, but do not delete. I think some of the examples on the page are pretty objectively unusual: "Depressed Cupboard Cheesecake", "Eagle-Eye Cherry", "Moon Unit Zappa", "Tee Vee", etc. If they are common in one culture, that's irrelevant to the criteria, as long as most people find it unusual. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 15:40, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Almost all of our lists involve some editorial judgement requiring inclusion. Indeed, all Wikipedia articles, even if consisting entirely of verified, sourced material, involve judgement in how the information is integrated, synthesized, and presented. NPOV does not mean mechanical objectivity. This list is borderline. But I come down on the side of "keep" because it is amusing; because it is not as much of an idiosyncratic non-topic as List of songs with titles that do not appear in the lyrics; because although the article is poorly sourced with respect to showing that the names are actually consider unusual, it is <i>fairly</i> well sourced with respect to showing the existence of the people bearing the names; <s>and because I added an entry or two to this article myself.</s> (Ooops, I didn't mean to mention that. Closing sysop, weight my opinion accordingly). <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 17:34, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The term "unusual" is not itself a call for opinions, it is defined as things out of the ordinary and not expected. It may be that the first name "apple" as translated in Chinese is not unusual in China; but it sure is unusual in the English speaking world. I would agree that there would be a POV issue if this were a list of "weird" or "stupid" names since that is a value judgment. Unusual is simply a numbers game. I think there's enough space for this. <a href="../../../j/t/m/User%7EJtmichcock_d337.html" title="User:Jtmichcock">Jtmichcock</a> 22:09, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The term "unusual" in this context is inherently POV. Also, the list seems limited to famous people and celebrity off-spring, so it really should be called "Famous people who named their children names that we thought we odd." And that, of course, is very POV. So, again, delete. <a href="../../../c/r/u/User%7ECrunch_5092.html" title="User:Crunch">Crunch</a> 00:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This list is simply unmaintainable. A few people may be choosing such names to make a point but many on this list would be offended that their name is somehow considered "unusual". To consider <a href="../../../c/o/t/Cotton_Mather_190c.html" title="Cotton Mather">Cotton Mather</a>, for example, unusual is to demonstrate either ignorance or willful bias about the conventions of the time. I do not believe that it is possible to craft a functional definition for "unusual" in a cross-cultural encyclopedia. The very definition of "usual" is too culture-specific. Furthermore, even if we did craft such a definition, I see little value to this list in our goal of making an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 03:20, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> In this case, a fetish is an attraction to a non-sexual object. The foreskin is a normal part of the male sex organ and, thus, is a normal part of sexual arousal.

<li>Hmm, I don't agree. I think you're right in most cases, but in this case there is a small but visible community of people who fetishize the foreskin, and this community itself uses the term "foreskin fetish."

<li><b>Keep</b> In Formula 1, planning for the 2007 season has been ongoing for a while. Some drivers has contracts. For example: Fernando Alonso is driving Renault in 2006, but has already for 2007 signed for McLaren-Mercedes, a team that will recieve Vodafone as title sponsor in 2007. It's also interesting for us who follows Formula 1 to see what rule changes, team constallations and other things that can be expected to appear in 2007. --<a href="../../../b/o/i/User%7EBoivie_a4b0.html" title="User:Boivie">Boivie</a> 09:35, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As said, many driver have contracts already, including Alonso, Rosberg, R Schumacher, Trulli, Heidfeld. The season's only a year away, and by this time last year, there was quite a lot known about the 2006 season. As regards the speculation. Speculation is speculation. It's not confirmed yet. It's the nature of sport. How do we know if a certain driver (Or player in other sports) will be around in the year's time. We don't, hence speculation. Manipe 13:27, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> and <b>cleanup</b>, per precedent of other scheduled future major sporting events. This isn't just made-up stuff, it's widely discussed in a number of publications, and it concerns the most expensive and most prestigious series in motorsports. But it'll be a changing page over the course of this year before becoming a genuinely encyclopedic (by traditional standards) article when the 2007 F1 season actually happens. Every "speculation" should be sourced (or removed). Frankly, any article that's substantially unproven speculation makes WP feel like a movie-star fansite to me. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:53, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> and <b>Cleanup</b> I believe that a table for the F1 teams and drivers shouldn't be used for this page quite yet, but the teams/drivers/manufacturers news at the bottom should be kept since it is recent news and other contract signings. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe359_891e.html" title="User:The359">The359</a> 10:09, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>.As said in other comments, an article on the 2007 Formula One World Championship is vital. Throughout this year, certain aspects of the 2007 season will be confirmed. The group need to have somewhere to put this information. When 2007 comes round, the page can then be used in the same way as 2005 etc... with results and links. I agree that pure speculation should not be added, but where can this information be shared/discussed? We need to strongly define what level of "speculation" is permitted. The teams and driver table needs to be modified as the order will be established by the 2006 finishing positions which is as yet unknown. I agree with JJay comment in that this can be handled in the same way as other future sporting events. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonkeyMumford_7bca.html" title="User:MonkeyMumford">MonkeyMumford</a> 13:46, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak Keep</s></b> - a Google search for Citadel/UX shows that the software is well-known in some circles. However, having read <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> I am unclear if this product meets the standards there, but I would lean toward keeping the article. Note that WP:CORP suggests putting the product information on the page for the company that makes the product -- but as this is an open source project, I am not sure how that applies here. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 09:59, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>The FAQ [<a href="http://www.citadel.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=38" class="external text" title="http://www.citadel.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=38" rel="nofollow">What is the difference between Citadel and Citadel/UX?</a>] says "Since ours is the only remaining active Citadel project at this time, however, we now refer to it simply as Citadel." A Google search for "citadel" supports this claim. The reason I'm interested is that the IMAP page references a Citadel page which has been moved now, but apparently meant the software that used to be called Citadel/UX. I'd just like to see the confusion removed. If this page is removed, then this version should be featured more prominently on the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_%28software%29.html" title="Citadel (software)">Citadel (software)</a> page, and then the IMAP page could refer to that page. --JamesStansell, 09:15, 9 January 2006 (CST)</p>
<dl>
<dd>There is some confusion here. The Citadel page was never moved -- the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_%28software%29.html" title="Citadel (software)">Citadel (software)</a> page was the original page on Wikipedia. The <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_UX_f73b.html" title="Citadel/UX">Citadel/UX</a> page, which is the one that refers to the product on citadel.org, appeared more recently. Citadel/UX is only one variant (and a clone, at that) of a software program that has a long history as BBS software. The developers of Cit/UX are mistaken when they claim that they are the only active Citadel project, as there are others. It is actually kind of controversial in the Cit community that they have taken it upon themselves to take over the name; not only are there other Citadels still being developed (though not publicised as strongly -- most are individual projects, not open-source or commercial work), there is even another WebCit that predates theirs (part of their Citadel project is called Webcit) and still has development as well (according to the developer). So, anyway, the Citadel page <i>never</i> meant "the software that used to be called Citadel/UX" -- it meant the Citadel BBS software, out of which eventually came Citadel/UX. The current link on the IMAP page points to the Citadel/UX page but calls it Citadel, which seems OK at this point. Making the Citadel/UX info more prominent on the Citadel (software) page would misrepresent Citadel/UX's role in Citadel history, I think. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 01:02, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>As if the virtue of existence before the internet automatically made something "notable". At best, this is a merge and redirect to the main Citadel article. Anything major computer-related, especially if it's been in existence until now, has had plenty of time to rack up references to it online. The dearth of them indicates this particular brand of the software is not in itself notable. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 08:04, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>Notice that this article on <a href="../../../n/e/t/Network_Control_Program_289e.html" title="Network Control Program">Network Control Program</a>, which ran the Internet before TCP/IP existed, isn't anything more than a stub.

<li>NCP has fallen into misuse, however. The article implies Citadel/UX remains in use until now, which means it has long ago entered the age of the Internet, and even Google. There's really no excuse for something computer-related and still in use in the present not to score a few thousand Google hits (at least) to prove notability. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 11:16, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<li>As I mentioned above, searching for "Citadel/UX" provides an artificially low number of hits, as the software is called "Citadel" now. Perhaps the page should be renamed "Citadel (Citadel/UX)" or something; Citadel/UX is its historic name and it separates it from the larger concept of "citadel-type software", but it probably isn't the best current name for the page. -- <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a> | <a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EManekiNeko_2e50.html" title="User talk:ManekiNeko">Talk</a> 00:02, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_%28software%29.html" title="Citadel (software)">Citadel (software)</a> page is focused on the history of the many Citadel variants as a BBS platform, while the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_UX_f73b.html" title="Citadel/UX">Citadel/UX</a> page focuses on the one Citadel variant that has been refocused for modern Internet applications such as Groupware. If this article were to be deleted, then it would imply that all of the other entries in the "See also" section should also be deleted, because they, too, point to articles which describe open source software in this category. If the Wikipedia editors are unhappy with the way the pages are labelled, then perhaps renaming them might be appropriate instead. As a third option, the pages could perhaps be merged, although it would result in one very large article that covers a number of different topics. I believe that this topic matter is relevant enough to keep the article. -- User:Art_Cancro
<ul>
<li>The article has now been toned down, and is now comparable with the articles about other software in its category (namely, the articles listed in the "See Also" section). Please consider that a few of us who were involved in the original article's creation are new to Wikipedia and are just getting used to the style of writing that the editors prefer. The article is now more of an informative than promotional piece. Please consider retaining the updated (and significantly shortened) article as an alternative to deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> While earlier versions of this page read like an advert to me, recent edits read along a more informative line. It would seem peculiar to remove this page (particularly with the recent edits), when the <a href="../../../c/i/t/Citadel_%28software%29.html" title="Citadel (software)">Citadel (software)</a> page obviously seems prepared for individual links for Citadel+, Citadel-86, and DragCit (although these have not yet been written). As mentioned by <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManekiNeko_cc64.html" title="User:ManekiNeko">ManekiNeko</a>, since Citadel/UX has turned to calling itself simply 'Citadel' (regardless of how controversial the claim), searches for 'Citadel/UX' will likely bear less fruit than 'Groupware Citadel', which gives me 10 pages of results on Google, the first page of which (at least) directly address this Citadel variant. It seems to me, with this many results, Citadel/UX bears a little more than a mere nod for Wikipedia. Although this probably isn't the place to ask this, I wonder if someone couldn't expand a little more on the 'controversial' nature of Citadel/UX's preference to calling itself 'Citadel'... this strikes me as keenly interesting to Citadelians (I'm one of them, and know something of the politics that occured back in the late 80s with the various varients, but not to enough of a degree to credibly record them for Wikipedia). Specifically, I would love to find other active Citadel projects, especially any that might be derived from the original source. There was also a rumor, long ago, that CrT intended to create an updated version of his Citadel software completely rewritten in C++ or something, but I never heard anything more than that.--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyVanRiper_bafb.html" title="User:TreyVanRiper">TreyVanRiper</a> 15:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Are you suggesting that the simplest explanation for a large number of Google hits is that a topic is notable? Leaving aside disagreements concerning the definition of notability, it seems to me to be equally easy to assume that the large number of hits is due to a web-master 'cooking the books' with link spam etc. Nomatter; However I put it to Google, the smallest number of hits I get is 11,400 (with 'hula novell groupware'). If the article were a blatent ad, I'd vote for its deletion.

And while one cannot immediately infer from many Google hits that a topic is notable, one can certainly infer that a topic is probably non-notable ("probably" because of Google's systemic bias in favour of English, computer-related and internet-age stuff, ignoring non-English content, etc.) from a lack of Google hits. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 06:22, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I believe that they are somehow related because Backbase currently redirects to BXML.

<li><b>Keep</b> and rename to Backbase. I've heard enough references to Backbase while discussing AJAX Framewoeks to assume that it's reasonably noteable, and I don't see why the company or the product shouldn't have an entry. Possibly the bar for notebaleness has been set a little high here because of it's connection with contentious subjects (AJAX etc). --<a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtw_80b7.html" title="User:Artw">Artw</a> 01:57, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>DELETE</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I think this is a viable entry, and should be KEPT.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Reason For Nomination: Per <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a>: Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information. The definition of what constitutes a disaster is so unspecific as to encompass any event that someone personally feels is a disaster. Notable disasters will already have articles. KWinYO 23:16, 8 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> A lot of hard work, thats good, perhaps a little more is needed to make this list into something viable. What do you call a disaster? Because I'll bet hard cash that someone else does not find your "disaster" to be one. and just how many deaths equals a disaster? 25, 50, 100, 1,000? Is the multi-car crash on the freeway that killed 7 people a disaster? and if so why not list it? Until such time as the author can get everyone to agree on what the conponents of a disaster are this list should be removed. Repost it later if things get hammered out. But as is this article is not only unmanagable due to several items that do not belong there, it is also un-necessary. A quick search will bring up the relevant articles and I'm sure they will have the date it occured on and the death toll, which is about all the list provides. Not only that but if the article is a good one, it would let the reader decide for themselves if what took place is a disaster or not. It is a nice gesture to defend someone's "hard work" but I don't recall "hard work" being the only criteria for keeping an article. KWinYO 04:15, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Interesting, I like how you attack something that makes complete sense as a "bad faith nomination" instead of discussing the actual issue. Fact is, This is basically a list of links to so called "disasters." It does little, except show up in the results field when a search is done. Where is the content? Not one of the listings contains any info beyond how many people died and when it happened. How about we try to discuss the issues before we start attacking other peoples opinion as wrong? (Oh and for future reference, it is possible for more that one person to use my Wi-FI connection, hence my IP address, ie. "friends" I had over during the weekend, so next time you accuse me of being many users, know the facts.)KWinYO 22:31, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>KEEP</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current article is not an indiscriminate collection of information, and in fact quite a lot of work has gone into ensuring it is not an indiscriminate collection. No doubt the criteria for inclusion could do with some tightening, but that is no argument for indiscriminate deletion of the entire article. A case can be made for splitting up the article, but the proposal to delete it seems both frivolous and insulting to those who have invested the time and energy to keeping it on track. <a href="../../../p/e/a/User%7EPeak_ed3e.html" title="User:Peak">Peak</a> 03:25, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Speedy Keep</b>. I suspect WP:POINT, and a <b>bad faith nomination</b>.

I suspect (and I may be wrong) that the newly-created user who nominated this article for deletion is the same as the anon user who is the primary contributor to the 'accidents' article.

Who decided that one was a "disaster" one was not? Also I have noticed the no one has presented any ideas as a compromise. I am willing to be reasonable.

<li><b>Comment/Potential Solution</b> OK, since no one has come up with ANY solutions that we all can live with, I will extend an olive branch. I have used a considerable amount of my time to reformat the List of Disasters. I put just about everything in order of most recent item last while putting the date first. I also added more sub-catagories to further break down the list by date. I also narrowed the defination of the word disaster a bit, even going as far to write a letter explaining the decision to eliminate calling every single thing a disaster. I DID NOT take anything out if something is missing it is purely an editing error, I did alot of cut and paste so something is bound to be missing. I believe that this modification Makes the list easier to navigate and enhances its appearance. In order to maintain its neatness I put a little note as to standardize the listing format. I am willing to post it but will only do so at your encouragement. I will overlook my previous objections in order to keep some sort of list of this nature. If anyone has any negitive comments, keep in mind, that I put forth an effort to work towards a common solution. What did you do? Thank You for you patienceKWinYO 09:28, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even I, who am well-known to hate <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">listcruft</a> and prefer categories in almost every instance, am not voting to delete this list because it contains encyclopaedic content.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Ok, so I agree with the fact that the criteria to get onto this page are a bit iffy.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found it interesting as well, that Pearl Harbor was not on the list, yet the atomic bombs attacks were.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I'm not one to scream indiscrimination, and such. But not one incident involving Israel or anything Israel-related is on the list. Not even El Al's plane crash in Amsterdam which killed more than 50 Dutch, sadly enough. A bit strange, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I can think of many other examples, not including terrorist attacks that should be put on the "list", if the idea is just a large number of people killed in an unnatural way. I find it interesting that the Angola, Russian and Sudanese Air Force disasters were mentioned – where the maximum number of deaths were 50 - when the Israeli Air Force disaster of 1997 of larger proportions – 73 deaths - was completely overlooked (and proportionately speaking 73 soldiers in a country as small as Israel is equivalent to thousands of soldiers in the United States), as well as, the Dakar and Eilat sinking in 1967 and 1968 (killing 69 and 47 respectfully), went completely unmentioned. Or what is considered the largest-ever civil disaster in Israel, in 2001, a building collapsed which killed 23 and injured 300. Yet "disasters" that tolled one death or four from far reaches of the globe are noted.</p>
<p>Not even the Columbia Space Shuttle explosion in 2003 was mentioned, whilst the Challenger was, and the same amount of astronauts perished. However, I guess I should point out the obvious – the only difference is that Israel's first astronaut was aboard the Columbia.</p>
<p>Things that make you go hmmmm. I can't deny that I'm a bit skeptical about the objectivity of this article, and credibility of the writer.</p>

<li>Allow me to quote myself since you obviously didn't read it..." A quick search will bring up the relevant articles and I'm sure they will have the date it occured on and the death toll, which is about all the list provides." Now tell me, how is this "encyclopaedic"? Once again I have yet to see anything here proving my points incorrect. If actually cared about this post other than to use it as a battle ground I would see here before me, an adequate list of reasons to keep this post.KWinYO 11:41, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I read the entire article, and even caught the grammatical error in the second sentence. I don't think your "quote" is relevant, since one can not know to look up something that is not included in a self-proclaimed comprehensive list. I'm not creating a battleground, and not choosing to fight with anyone, I was just speculating on the comprehensive, academic, and "encyclpaedic" value of an article with evident gaps in research (ommisions that I am aware of from my own store of knowledge - as opposed to others I am <i>not</i> aware of). It is a very useful article, and it is apparent that an inordinate amount of effort went into it, and that is certainly commendable. I just feel that it is important to <b>not</b> have such a blatant oversight (even if it is simply a faux pas) in an article you wish to be considered a consistent and reliable source of information.</li>

<p><b>Because the events regarding the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ongoing_List_of_Accidents_04de.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ongoing List of Accidents">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ongoing List of Accidents</a> and <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_disasters_e7bb.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of disasters">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of disasters</a> deletion debates are seriously looking to be intertwined. I will be depositing this serious chunk of text in <i>both</i> deletion debates.</b></p>
<p>I have struck all my previous comments and opinions from both debates, and have attempted to reconsider the two nominations (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a> - referred to as <i><b>Disasters</b></i>, and Ongoing List of Accidents - referred to as <i><b>Accidents</b></i>) and my reasons for deletion, in as unbiased a way as possible. Having attempted to do so, I have come to the following conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ongoing List of Accidents is an almost complete duplicate of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a>, and as such, warrants either a merger or deletion per the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia Deletion Policy</a>.
<ul>
<li>However, while the two articles have very similar content, the definitions for inclusion are different. The Disasters article gives its definition (and inclusion criteria) as <i>"a natural or man-made event that negatively affects life, property, livelihood or industry, often resulting in permanent changes to human societies, ecosystems and environment."</i> Therfore, in my personal opinion, you need a lot of bang to get your disaster-rated buck.</li>
<li>The Accidents article gives it's definition (and inclusion criteria) as <i>"is a mishap that happens unexpectedly, that results in damage or injury, up to and including death."</i> I believe the point made by <a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">User:Atrian</a> in the Accidents debate applies here - <i>"I stubbed my toe this morning, can I get listed here too?"</i>. While defining an event as a disaster is 'structured' by the scope necessary to be considered by the media and public opinion as a <i>disaster</i>, any "undesirable or unfortunate happening" (the definition of accident I pulled from my hardcopy dictionary) could technically be included on this list; billions of entries per calender day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, looking at detail at the two lists, I would like to offer the following recommendations.</p>
<ol>
<li>The list of aviation disasters/accidents doesn't belong in either article. These should be split off into a List of aviation accidents, where the criteria for inclusion is set at a certain amount of fatalities, per the introduction for the sublist in the Disasters
<ul>
<li>As a subset of this suggestion , the lists of "accidents/disasters involving <b>foo</b>-vehicle" should also be split out into "Lists of <b>foo</b>-vehicle accidents", again, with a set fatality criteria, or at least some kind of inclusion criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mining accidents/disasters, now thats a section in serious need of overhaul. Mining is a dangerous industry, and while every fatality may not be a 'disaster', there would be too many events to comprehensively list in an 'accidents' list/article. A criteria for remaining within the Disasters article would have to be developed and enforced - my personal suggestion would be to set a casualty limit, but also include those that caused significant rethinks in the mining industry.</li>
<li>Fire accidents/disasters appears to be better served by the already-existing <i><b><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_historic_fires.html" title="List of historic fires">List of historic fires</a></b></i>. Some merging to this article from these two articles would be appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everything else in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_disasters.html" title="List of disasters">List of disasters</a> article is suitable (in my personal opinion), and as such should be <b>kept</b>.</p>
<p>However, if my suggested changes go ahead or don't, it appears to me that the Accidents article is always going to be the poor little brother to the Disasters article. Points to the creator for his/her effort, and if there is consensus towards my suggestions, I believe the user could best assist Wikipedia by helping to implement those. Unfortunately, the Accidents article should still be <b>deleted</b>, as there is no way (in my personal opinion) to produce a meaningful list/article under the current article name and definition of inclusion, without it spiralling out of control.</p>
<p>Here's hoping this makes sense, and that people read the whole thing. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> 12:43, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree in many respects. For example, it seems that every single air <i>crash</i> in human history appears to be categorised as an air <i>disaster</i>, simply because when an airliner crashes it is often packed full and has a 100% fatality record, which skews it somewhat. Actually a category for air crashes would also fit the bill here since they all have articles. - <a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_75dc.html" title="User:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JzG_1e67.html" title="Special:Contributions/JzG">[C]</a></sub> <a href="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/shared/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/25px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png" alt="" width="25" height="13" longdesc="../../../f/l/a/Image%7EFlag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg_b083.html" /></a> <i><a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_adminship_JzG_2989.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/JzG">RfA!</a></i> 13:11, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hmmm, Compromise.... I thought compromise was only necessary when there is a division....- Good idea. I believe that there are something like 360 or so air accidents listed all called a disaster. Reguardless of that, I offer the listings I put into a standard format (date - incident - deaths) as a start for the person who is doing the new list. I am pleased to see that some one else agrees that there need to be a few changes, rather then become standoffish and instist the article is fine as it is.KWinYO 15:01, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oh for the love of ... Some one seems to have a chip on their shoulder. Remember that I am the one who put the aritcle here in the first place. Had it not been for that, your "progress" whould have not occured. But seeing as I can tell you feel you need to declare victory, go ahead, go nuts. Also it is worth mentioning is the fact that you changed you tune rather quickly when higher powers intervened, because until then you were singing the praises of this article. Now it needs changes. In addition, it seems you have this obsessive need to try and one-up me. So with that in mind, I await your pearls of wisdom that are, most difinitely, sure to follow as soon as you read this. So again have some fun, go nuts. - As for everyone else I don't know where this sense of ill-will is coming from, but let me once again state that I am willing to help in the seperation and merging of this article by submitting some organized entries. It doesn't really bother me either way if you want my help or not, but I thought it was at least a nice gesture.KWinYO 08:19, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't appreciate what seems to be a clear attempt at censorship. Just when this subject begins to gain more attention, you want to delete the article from your site. That makes no sense at all except in the context of censorship.

<li>This is not censorship at all. There are myriads of places where you may worship/Study/criticise John Titor. But Wikipedia is just not one of them.

It may be that most of these people are nn, but it will difficult for us to tell. There are lots of people who do needlepoint, most of whom are not in a demographic that includes a lot of wikipedians. Selling needlepoint designs is a pretty sizeable industry, and I would think has its share of "star" designers. Since this list is new, and the one name on it that has generated an article is clearly notable, we should wait and see what comes of this. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a> 02:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> or seriously clean up. <a href="../../../d/s/m/User%7EDsmdgold_7663.html" title="User:Dsmdgold">Dsmdgold</a>'s point is well taken. However, while I don't do a lot of needlepoint, I have a passing familiarity with some of the "famous names," though not, I admit those of the British designers. As you note, the problem with a list like this is assessing notability. (I also suspect that the original entry on the page, Nathalie Forster, was added by her personally.) Rather than having a list of red links (save one), I suggest removing all red links and adding links to a few embroidery designers that are in Wikipedia. The creator of the page would be encouraged to instead create a few articles about these folks. In the meantime, I'm adding links to a few needlework designers that are in Wikipedia already or who really are notable. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 05:03, 10 January 2006 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It is notable in Singapore, but I think as for an encyclopedia, it is not notable enough. The problem is that Chinese dramas from Singapore are around 20 episodes usually, and they are not significant. I don't see a need to create an article of every <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaCorp_TV_Channel_8_2766.html" title="MediaCorp TV Channel 8">Channel 8</a> drama to be on Wikipedia. I do not really follow up with most dramas, and they do not have no plot. Those that are not notable enough for an encyclopedia should be deleted.

<li><b>Keep</b> IsraelBeach 21:58, 9 January 2006 (UTC)The same bias and hate which caused vandalism to Ariel Sharon's Wikipedia page is now attempting to censor an Israeli government accredited news organization.

<dd>Rasmus - I am kindly calling you out. What is your nationality? Where are you from? Are you a professional journalist or editor?

<dd>To compare the <i>Israel News Agency</i> to Iran Broadcasting in any manner is grossly unfair and biased. The <i>Israel News Agency</i> is not directed by government officials employed within a totalitarian regime. Basic and democratic principles of free speech are applied at the INA. You will never find the <i>Israel News Agency</i> promoting the idea of "wiping a country off the map". What you will find at the INA from time to time is open criticism of governmental action and policies. That is the true responsibility of the Third Estate - where journalists maintain checks and balances of both the executive and judicial branches of government.

If it is nontrivial, it should satisfy <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> #3, and I will happily change my vote to keep. If not, I will point out that almost all the articles on Israel news agency are written by Joel Leyden or "Israel News Agency Staff". Judging from that I would guess it has no regular employees, so as a news agency it is several orders of magnitude smaller (and hence probably less notable) than Iran Broadcasting. <a href="../../../r/a/s/User%7ERasmus_Faber_cecb.html" title="User:Rasmus Faber">Rasmus</a> <a href="../../../r/a/s/User_talk%7ERasmus_Faber_a0f5.html" title="User talk:Rasmus Faber">(talk)</a> 08:37, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Google News gathers stories from more than 4,500 English-language news sources worldwide, and automatically arranges them to present the most relevant news first. Topics are updated every 15 minutes, so you're likely to see new stories each time you check the page. Pick the item that interests you and you'll go directly to the site which published that story.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google News is a highly unusual news service in that our results are compiled solely by computer algorithms, without human intervention. As a result, news sources are selected without regard to political viewpoint or ideology, enabling you to see how different organizations are reporting the same story. This variety of perspectives and approaches is unique among online news sites, and we consider it essential in helping you stay informed about the issues that matter most to you." - Google News</p>
<p>Google News recognized that the Israel News Agency was the first on-line source of Israeli Government Press Office accredited news to come out of Israel back in 1995 as the Israel Internet News Agency. The INA enjoys excellent relations with Google News and has been in direct contact with Google News over the years.</p>
<p>Lastly, if one looks well enough, you will discover a variety of professional writers who contribute to the INA. Please see my user talk for more on this issue.

<p><b>Delete</b> I find this whole concept of merging the A-side of a single with the B-side of a single completely unnecessary and inconsistent with the rest of Wikipedia's articles. For example, why not merge Bohemian Rhapsody and I'm In Love With My Car into "Bohemian Rhapsody/I'm In Love With My Car"? I propose that the individual articles for You're My Best Friend and '39 be restored with both include the information that YMBF was the A-side to the single whilst '39 was the B-side.

<li><b>Userfy</b>. This seems to follow almost the same principles as Rodney Chang; but there seems to be a bit more external support for Chang than for Kamerbeek.

<p>The above (read: below) comment was meant for the Rodney Chang Deletion Discussion page but it was closed quickly. So I put it here because this is true for my entry too:</p>
<p>Here is a note which I wanted to post at the Deletion Discussion Page but found out it was closed in rush. Find out why:</p>
<p>1st of all for admin Jossi - Wikipedia Newcomer policy: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers" rel="nofollow">[15]</a> Please read.</p>
<p>On January 4th, 2006 it was the 1st time I looked up Wikipedia. I set up the article "Rodney Chang" in good faith. Dr. Chang is a well-known artist with good reputation and he has nothing to proof. 10 degrees including 2 doctorates. That alone is more than the usual human achieves in a lifetime. Out of the blue I found myself in court. This court calls itself Wikipedia. And claims to be an open-source. Nobody tried to assist me as newbie, vice versa.</p>
<p>Moreover I found out that the admin is a digital artist himself like Dr. Rodney Chang (Pygoya). Dr. Chang is worldwide known as digital artist and cyberart pioneer. Jossi Fresco, the admin, is not. Jossi Fresco has set up the below announced articles at Wikipedia. Jossi Fresco is not in the Wikipedia encyclopedia.</p>
<p>But he puts himself there by self-promoting his images along with texts about digital art. This is a clear conflict of interest. He cannot act from a neutral point of view. Could it be here is an admin who tries to hinder a worldwide known digital artist with good reputation and proven third-party achievements to get the place he clearly deserves?</p>
<p>Could it be he wants to keep his power position as an admin with special powers at Wikipedia to keep his reign over the digital artist area online at Wikipedia?</p>
<p>Some facts which speak for themselves. The admin Jossi is editor of the following Wikipedia entries:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_art" rel="nofollow">Digital Art</a></p>
<p>He himself uploaded 2 of his own images to represent the theme. Is this a neutral point of view? He promotes his artwork in an article uploaded by himself using his art to demonstrates what digital art is. Is he so well-known to do so? Is his art accepted worldwide? Dr. Chang's is.</p>
<p>Search Google for Jossi Fresco. Search Google for Pygoya</p>
<p><br />
Here's a third party view:</p>
<p>On the discussion page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Digital_art" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Digital_art" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> Jhocking says:</p>
<p>Along the same lines, however, I just realized yesterday that the example images further up the page are both by a single artist, and he added them himself. *cough* self-promotion *cough* Jhocking</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_painting" rel="nofollow">Digital Painting</a></p>
<p>Again Jossi shows one of his images as self-promotion.</p>
<p>Moreover watch the weblinks from this site. And note the images of whom to find there! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtingrid_4530.html" title="User:Artingrid">Artingrid</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArtingrid_6243.html" title="User talk:Artingrid">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Artingrid_18be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Artingrid">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Because you now also mention Webism! So you know what is going on at Wikipedia. Dr. Chang and I didn't know about Wikipedia behavior till January 4th, 2006. But we found out! Of course the admin doesn't stand for Wikipedia. But he represents Wikipedia.</p>
<p>The article Webism was put to Wikipedia End of 2004. Neither Dr. Chang nor myself did know this. We were not informed. We as the founders of Webism Movement never had the chance to give facts. Everybody interest should read the Webism deletion debate. It speaks for itself.</p>

<li>Well, this does appear to exist. I suppose copies my be found in somewhere that they keep books. It may even sit on a shelf next to a notable journal. But that's not the hurdle for inclusion. I see <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+journal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+journal&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">less than ten thousand hits.</a> In the first ten pages I could not find it cited, or referenced, or reviewed. Simply statements that is exists, and that it sits on the shelves. Looking at <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+&amp;btnG=Search+News" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Democracy+%26+Nature%22+&amp;btnG=Search+News" rel="nofollow">Google news</a> I see no hits. This is a very bad sign for something that is claiming to be an <i>"international theoretical journal"</i> of any note. On the desk next to me I have a copy of the <i>Journal of Modern Physics</i>. It's a real journal, too, but not a terribly notable one. Except it gets <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=nw" rel="nofollow">186,000 Google hits</a> (almost 100,000 with <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22+references&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22+references&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">references</a>) and a pleasant suprise with <a href="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com.au/news?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;tab=wn&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22Journal+of+Modern+Physics%22" rel="nofollow">a news hit as well.</a> Not an impressive one, but trumps zero by a considerable margin.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I'm TheVel, Karmafist has blocked my address for a long time now and I don't know if he is ever going to stop, so I write without signing in (maybe he forgot to unblock me or something). I want to remind to brenneman that D&amp;N have stopped publishing for some time, and its successor, "International Journal of Inclusive Democracy", is an on-line magazine. He cannot compare D&amp;N with journals that are still publishing issues, especially with journals about physical siences, which of course concern far more people in contrast with journals of social sciences (especially if the latter are radical)! I want again to stress that if our criteria depends solely on popularity and google search (instead of qualitative criteria, like the contributors, the members of the international advisory board, the length of the publication etc) then we are just adopting to the standards of our massive society that promotes explicitly the popular (no matter what it might be, right or not) and not knowledge. Do I dare to vote here? Yes, I vote <b>Keep</b>, since I'm a member for a few months and I've done some editing here. Respect my vote. New users should be allowed to vote if they support with reasonable arguments their votes. TheVel, 10 Janyary 2006, 12:55
<ul>
<li>Well, no one should be "voting" really, but anyone who tries to tell you that you can't provide evidence and support it with a persuasive argument is doing both you and Wikipedia a disservice. The whole "new user" this is complicated, but thank you for pointing that out to me regarding being out of print. I was aware of it, but I will consider further how the metric should scale.

<li><b>Comment</b>:I have been a reader of Wikipedia entries for some time and as was surfing it yesterday I saw the entry on Democracy &amp; Nature, the site of which I have used several times in the past for research. I was surprised to see the deletion nomination and I wrote a comment to this effect. To my surprise, I saw today that some administrators called me and many others (presumably because they do not belong to their closed club) as 'sockpuppets'. I am not a sockpuppet of anybody and I do not accept to be insulted as such by any so-called 'administrators' clearly abusing their power. I don't know whether you have the right to rule out any comments by new users that you do not like but certainly you do not have the right to insult users. OK?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Two nominations failed? Also I have to say its extremly irritating to keep seeing (user's first edit) after comments.

<ul>
<li>So you're not saying keep because it's encyclopedic, or because it contributes to the sum of human knowledge, or because it's notable and people may want to look it up. You're voting keep because you're petulant about the edit count notices?

<li>Frankly I'm bored with people who want an article deleted demanding an explanation as to why people voted <b>Keep</b>. You can see very well my reasoning in my previous post.

And, "frankly", I could not find reasoning in what you had provided, so I asked. You've now made yourself more clear: POV is not a reason to delete.

<li>I'm sure no one will begrudge your right to privacy with your mates. However, given the user's experience, I am also certain that he could produce oodles of text to justify his vote. I therefore assume good faith and believe his opinion should count. What is more troubling is your propensity to only question votes that do not adhere to your line of thinking.

<li><b>Very weak delete</b>. An adult model, whose own website and its teaser pages recently have become commonly seen on lists of such things. Not yet especially notable compared to dozens of others on the Internet. I don't think she's gone into movies (beyond self-produced solo) where notability would be easier to establish. Consensus (but not unanimity) on these pages has been that Internet nude models get higher number of hits than other public figures, partially due to search-engine optimization by porn webmasters; and that therefore they should have to reach a higher bar of notability as measured by online data such as the "Google test". <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 01:21, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Well, I was thinking of works like J. McCarthy, <i>Death and Exile</i> - I'm aware people may consider this a fringe position, but at least it's by a more-or-less respected (?) professional, academic author outside Turkey itself. I'm not sure how his international standing in the field is. <a href="../../../l/u/k/User%7ELukasPietsch_8bf5.html" title="User:LukasPietsch">Lukas</a> 15:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Irving_2e5a.html" title="David Irving">David Irving</a> is a more "respected" scholar than this guy. At least Irving is not financed or rewarded by revisionists. It's not that McCarthy's wife is Turkish that makes his motives biased it's the fact that he is actually paid by the Turkish government to publish his books. He was also awarded the Order of Merit of the Turkish Republic by the President of Turkey in 1998 and he got his Honorary Doctorate at Sûleyman Demirel University in Turkey. Not to mention that the book in question deals with ALL muslim deaths within the vast Empire during the war. That includes Druzes of Lebanon or the Shi'a Arabs of Iraq, Alevis of Anatolia and Syria etc. Many of those deaths were actually caused by the Ottoman Army. McCarthy is just a hired gun for Turkish interests within the U.S. Saying the Nazis were the victims of WWII falls under the category of Holocaust denial/revisionism right? Create an article for Genocide denial where this can be discussed, an article about a non-existent term and event is useless and illogical.--<a href="../../../e/u/p/User%7EEupator_a3d1.html" title="User:Eupator">Eupator</a> 20:27, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>First, let me say that this article is not about notable artist Beverly Myers. This artist claims many releases, but I can't find verifiable information about any record label. According to the article she has indeed been self-publishing at least the last ten years.</p>
<p>A search for <i>"Beverly Meyers"</i> together with any album name returns 0 hits! For the record a Google search for <i>"Beverly Meyers"</i> returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Beverly+Meyers%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Beverly+Meyers%22" rel="nofollow">251 hits</a>, which all seem unrelated. And a search for her full name <i>"Beverly Natalie Meyers"</i> returns <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Beverly+Natalie+Meyers%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Beverly+Natalie+Meyers%22" rel="nofollow">0 hits</a> as well. <a href="../../../p/u/n/User%7EPunkmorten_c486.html" title="User:Punkmorten">Punkmorten</a> 22:53, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The comments below are unfounded attempts to discredit a small jurisdiction. All 8 parishes and 2 monasteries have valid physical addresses and phone numbers if anybody would like to verify their existence. The article is about the Western-Rite jurisdiction and is 100% true. The comment about one of the parishes being "vaporware" is an out right lie. The main website shows pictures of the Synod and several of the clergy. Perhaps it could have been written better, but the information is true and valid. If you don't believe, then just try to call any of them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 155.201.35.53 (<a href="../../../1/5/5/User_talk%7E155.201.35.53.html" title="User talk:155.201.35.53">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_155.201.35.53_4e50.html" title="Special:Contributions/155.201.35.53">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd>For my vaporware claim, see <a href="http://www.saintkatherineorthodoxchurch.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.saintkatherineorthodoxchurch.org/" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. This is counted as one of their 8 parishes despite the fact it has yet to hold a meeting of any kind pending "legal work", but hopes to do so sometime this year. This is patently nonsensical. I know of no other church in the world that counts parishes that have not yet been formed, and no legal work whatsoever is required to gather, talk, and pray. One must admit that such a state of affairs might lead a reasonable person to suspect a purely virtual existence. In any event, this group comes nowhere near Wikipedia's standard of notability, an issue quite distinct from whether or not it's true. <i><a href="../../../c/s/e/User%7ECsernica_0047.html" title="User:Csernica">TCC</a></i> <small><a href="../../../c/s/e/User_talk%7ECsernica_eca6.html" title="User talk:Csernica">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Csernica_7ef8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Csernica">(contribs)</a></small> 23:04, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Saint Katherine of Alexandria Orthodox Church is in the infancy stages of establishing a parish. The "legal work" is what is necessary to operate as an official legal parish. To your point though, we have about four families who "gather, talk, and pray". In the summer, we plan to have our "official legal" start once we complete the "legal work" which every church in the United States of America must complete. Regardless of what you think about Saint Katherine's, the other Parishes are already established with their own individual communities and the article is still true and valid about "The Holy Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church of America". Call the Archdiocese Rectory if you like, or drop by and see if that's what you need to believe. If the article was about Saint Katherine being a Parish, you'd have ground to stand on. But the article is about the Archdiocese. The fact that they "count" Saint Katherine as a Parish is nothing more than getting a little ahead of themselves with updating their website. The article still holds true and is notable and is verifiable. Tbryant001 23:20, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The comment to which I was replying called me a liar; I was merely defending myself. But notability is a matter for the Wikipedia community to decide.

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the clergy member who posted the orginal article, and am disappointed by the comments requesting deletion. I don't know what "vaporware" is, but if anybody has any doubts about the fact that this is a valid canonical Western-Rite Orthodox jurisdiction then feel free to contact me or His Emminence, Archbishop Anthony Bondi. The contact information is on the website for those who are interested in discovering the false claims posted below. We may be part of a small Western Rite Orthodox jurisidction, but just how big do you really think ROCOR or the Antiochian Western Rite Orthodox groups are? Not much bigger at all. If you want to debate canonical status, it should be done elsewhere. This article is true, and represents and valid organization and legal entity. Even if you don't believe it is "canonical" (which is your participation in a modern day heresy), it is at the very least legal and represents a group that practices and keeps the pre-schism Western Rite Orthodox faith and traditions.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Whether it is "true" or not is really not the issue. It is true that I have a yellow chair in my office, but that doesn't warrant a Wikipedia article. The question is whether this group is <b>notable</b> enough to warrant an encyclopedia article, whether the article was created as a <b>vanity article</b> (that is, it was written by a person or group about themselves), and whether it is <b>verifiable</b> for encyclopedic purposes (that is, whether anyone else has cared to write about it in third-party sources). Nothing of what's been said here or added to the article answers any of these objections. It should also be noted that the "supporting" article written alongside this one (Former Exarchate of Alexandria) also suffers from much the same problems and clearly has a severe POV slant. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<li><b>Comment:</b> My comments related to truth address the comments that said the jurisdiction may only exist on the internet and/or it was "vaperware". I am in the process of editing the articles to remove some of the POV slant and point to verifiable documentation, but all of the articles about any Orthodox jurisdiction have a clear level of vanity and POV slants as you describe them. My purpose in writing the articles is to show people that there is another side of the history of Orthodoxy in America that has not been explored on this website yet. So far, what is on this website is very one sided and only refers to other Orthodox jurisdictions as groups of people who don't practice the same Orthodox faith or follow the same Orthodox traditions. The fact is that there are many Orthodox people who follow the same faith and traditions, but choose to not be in communion with the larger organizations for administrative reasons. Again, this has not even been explored yet. If the goal of Wikipedia is to tell the truth, then I think it should allow people to tell the whole truth and not allow larger groups to spread incomplete or untruthful information about smaller groups. I agree with your comments about severe POV slant, but at least allow me time to edit it and don't be so quick to say "delete". As it relates to "third parties"...you must understand that such a thing doesn't truly exist in matters of religion. If it does, then I can assure you that a lot of what is written about Orthodoxy on this website was not done by a third party. A great deal of what is written about Orthodoxy, especially in America, is filled with comments that degrade smaller Orthodox groups and call them "not true" or "not canonical" or claim that they "ordain women". At the very least, given us some time to put our articles out there that show the rest of the story. As a smaller group, it will take time. Any advice on improving the POV slant and making it sound less like an advertisement are welcome. I do not want to advertise on these pages...only to complete the picture of Orthodoxy in America. It may not be a picture that the larger groups want people to see, but it isn't any less true or verifiable. Tbryant001 18:26, 13 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> <b>Verifiable</b> refers to citing third-party sources. Without that, then <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> is not satisfied, which it quite manifestly needs to be. Otherwise, then it doesn't satisfy Wikipedia standards and probably qualifies as <b><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a></b>, which is also expressly against Wikipedia policy. What you say here indicates that there is a clear POV you're trying to push, as well, which is also a problem. Wikipedia is not the place to show the world what they've been missing. It's the place to summarize <b>other people's research</b> into encyclopedic articles. The reason why there's a rule against vanity articles (that is, articles created or edited by the people they're about) is to help ensure <b>notability</b>. In this case, while there's clearly a set of webpages which your organization has set up about themselves and we have you here writing articles about your group, there's precious little evidence that any scholars or media have found your group notable enough to address in their own writing. The article as it stands still doesn't address any of these problems, and given the nature of the group in question, I don't think it can. Hit it big first, then let someone else write about the your group. —<a href="../../../a/s/d/User%7EASDamick_bcf2.html" title="User:ASDamick"><font color="blue"><b><i>A.S.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This page has already been put up for deletion and voted to be kept. That vote should be recognised.I am a goth, and I've heard many of these terms. Apart from that, its an important resource for those studying subcultures...and wether its tidied up or not, is valid information to users of the internet. Why people would destroy information is beyond me...it goes against the whole ethos of Wikipedia!!!

<li><b>Keep</b>... I was wavering towards deletion as the article had not improved much since its first AfD nom. <a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathlibrarian_5404.html" title="User:Deathlibrarian">Deathlibrarian</a> <i>has</i> done a lot of work on the article, in particularly recently noting sources. I find the article quite interesting, but I think it still needs work to make it encyclopedic, NPOV, spelling, etc., something I'd be willing to help on if it makes it through AfD2. I think it does need serious pruning to remove some of the more obscure, regional and unsourced terms.

<li>I would add that the information concerning the subculture doesn't need to be deleted. The major terms, and the accompanying trends and patterns, can be recorded in the article <a href="../../../g/o/t/Goth.html" title="Goth">goth</a>. There is no need for a page that will tell you 'Dev: A goth pub in London' in an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Comment</b> - You wrote "Wouldn't be deleted if it was in the US or UK so this shouldn't be either. It is probably a much more notable than average prison and the nominator has provided no evidence or arguments to the contrary."
<ul>
<li>1) I have already provided evidence why these articles were not notable in the first place, they generate no hits when searched for, in fact one of them generated a grand total of 6 hits! These are not notable articles by any means. I noticed you wrote <i><b>probably</b></i> meaning you yourself do not know if these articles in fact notable or non-notable. Perhaps you should check it out yourself before jumping to conclusions and making statements such as "...It is probably a much more notable ..." Please search for them and tell me what you can find on them.</li>
<li>2)If it is ok to write up meaningless articles about non notable prisons in China, then would it be ok for me to write up meaningless stubs on every prison in my state? In fact if <i>I</i> were to do so, every last one of my articles would be nominated for deletion.

<li>If there is a larger problem with an editor beyond just these articles, that sounds like less of an issue for AfD and more of an issue for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> (begining, of course, with discussing the issue with the other editor). As far as the "prison enterprises" and "so-and-so coal mine" go, the January 3, 1981 New York Times article "Hundreds of Thousands Toil in Chinese Labor Camps" by Fox Butterfield seems to describe the topic of the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heiliushui_Reeducation_through_labor_7fc4.html" title="Heiliushui Reeducation through labor">Heiliushui Reeducation through labor</a> article: "A few months ago, a white-haired 70-year-old former Protestant minister was released from a labor camp near the city of Datong in Shanxi Province in northern China. He had worked there in a coal mine, along with 10,000 other prisoners, scraping up chunks of black rock with his bare hands for 23 years. He had been sentenced to laodong gaizao, or 'reform through labor.'" I find the topic of the Chinese prison system to be appropriate for Wikipedia. If the problem is that these articles on single prisons are unexpandable stubs, then any user can merge them together and redirect them to Chinese prison system without going through AfD. If the problem is verifiability, then slap a cleanup-verify tag on the article while you work on verifying it. And again, if the problem is a dispute with another user, try to resolve it. I'd also suggest everyone avoid the over-the-top "What's wrong with you people can't you read" stuff. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There, you proved my point. Either the article you read or the Wikipedia entry is bogus. In this case, I'd trust the Wikipedia entry even less. "Reeducation through labour" is NOT Laogai or Laodong Gaizao, which is "Reform through labour". "Reeducation through labour" is actually Laojiao, or Laodong Jiaoyang.

<li>The "Laogai Handbook" is published by a Falungong organisation, which the last time I checked was a religious group and not exactly a forerunner in research into Chinese criminology. Unless the said handbook can be construed as a verifiable and trustable source, it's not. It also is quite puzzling how the <i>Laogai</i> handbook suddenly is talking about <i>Laojiao</i>... which are two separate matters altogether.

Shouldn't the article be under Fanyu Prison? It continues as <i>Shaoguan Prison was established in 1995</i>. What do these prisons have to do with each other?
