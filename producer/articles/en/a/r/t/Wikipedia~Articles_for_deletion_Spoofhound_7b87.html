<dd><b>comment</b> - Is the article List of unique high school mascots sorted by state also not notable? Unique high school mascots have quirky, offbeat names that that tell a lot about the local culture. There are at least two websites that attempt to catalog he unique names that are often funny if you have a sense of humor. Spoofhound was highlighted on an ESPN segment. Little stub articles like this will tell the stories of these quirky names. It's pretty clear from the comments thus far that the article is going to disappear. Too bad. There's a category for unique high school mascots. <a href="../../../a/m/e/User%7EAmericasroof_3ff1.html" title="User:Americasroof">Americasroof</a> 02:54, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>IMO, no, that list is not particularaly notable either. However, that is irrelevent to the discussion. This debate is not about the validity of that list, and linking a topic to another article does not make the original topic notable. Also, given how the discussion has gone, the information on Spoofhound will not be going, it will be merged into the school's article. In fact, it already has, so this article can either be deleted, or turned into a redirect to <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryville_High_School_e429.html" title="Maryville High School">Maryville High School</a>. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 03:59, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> - A unique mascot to an American high school with an interesting origin is more than enough reason for keeping the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't understand why this is even being debated, it's an incredibly clear example of non-notability. A particular mascot for a <b>high school</b>. Are we going to accept mascots for every high school in the country? Who is going to lookup a high school mascot? This is non-encyclopedic and Wikipedia is not a source for random bits of information. If their high school has an article it'll mention it (and I'll probably nominate the High School for AfD after looking at the article).

<dd>Blue? "Go, Color Blue!" The thing about the wave was that it raised the question of what an individual from the school was.

<li><b>Delete</b> to me, there are 2 things to look at here. First, is the concept of the "Spoof Hound" Carnival Toy and the stated origin of the team name notable and verifiable. I think the answer to that is clearly no. All sources for this definition and explanation of a spoof hound are from <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascoths3.html" class="external text" title="http://www.halcyon.com/marcs/mascoths3.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a> (which apparently is based on submissions from the general public and is not in any way vetted or verified), the school website, and Wikipedia mirrors. I just don't see enough <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to consider the supposed carnival toy and name origin to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements. That said, the second thing to consider is if a high school mascot is notable enough to have a standalone article. I think the answer to that is no as well and it appears to be pretty common practice that mascots are only mentioned in the school article. I'd say merge, but the information has already been integrated into the <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maryville_High_School_e429.html" title="Maryville High School">Maryville High School</a> article. I don't see much of a compelling reason to keep this as a redirect unless there is a licensing reason to do so.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 18:33, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I think that the article should be kept in that the Spoofhound mascot is notable beyond Maryville High School. I'm an alumnus, and when we participated in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1989, every interview conducted with the band focused on the mascot above everything else. I've met strangers who have heard of Maryville High School only because of the Spoofhound. I'm always surprised at how often it is mentioned in national media. Personally, to me, its just a mascot, but it certainly gets a lot of attention. If I wasn't aware of the Spoofhound and heard about it, I might turn to Wikipedia to find out more about it.<a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelixstrange_9f57.html" title="User:Felixstrange">Felixstrange</a> 21:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Answering that deleting this article benefits the encyclopedia because it is unencyclopedic is tautological. The real issue is why the article is unencyclopedic. You are asserting that it is because it is not "notable" or "important". This seems to me a very arbitrary and subjective criteria for removing someone's work from Wikipedia. There are many, many articles on Wikipedia that most people would find neither notable or important (trivia for a particular Babylon 5 epsiode, for example), but they are significant enough to enough people that they warrant inclusion under the prevailing standards of Wikipedia. If this work is to be removed, it should be for a specific (and compelling) reason. I don't feel that such a reason has been outlined. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelixstrange_9f57.html" title="User:Felixstrange">Felixstrange</a> 02:39, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> In regards to Felixstrange's response to IrishGuy: Saying 'deleting this article benefits the encyclopedia because it is unencyclopedic' is actually not a tautology, one being a noun and the other being an adjective which descripes specific attributes that make something acceptable for inclusion within that particular noun. Aside from that, Wikipedia has pretty good and clear guidelines as to what qualifies something as being notable enough for inclusion and it seems many people here agree that this article does not meet those standards. Sometimes these standards aren't always the best, but they work quite well and without them AfD couldn't function. If you disagree with notability standards I believe it is appropriate to go to the pages outlining them and making a case for change on their talk pages. Finally, in regards to your statement that other things, such as Babylon 5 trivia, are kept: these are articles that have so far slipped through the cracks. AfD is run by average editors and they nominate things when found, things can last awhile before someone who knows about AfD and cares finds them. There is a lot of inappropriate articles out there that do need to be removed and that's what we're here for. An article on Babylon 5 trivia certainly would warrant an AfD nomination. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 03:48, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, that is a textbook example of tautology. By definition something which is "unencyclopedic" is bad for an encyclopedia. My only point here is that the notability/non-notability of the subject of this article is not as clear as its being made out to be. I've certainly read about it in newspapers and heard about it on TV (some one has mentioned an ESPN feature). The main thrust of the notability guidelines Ptkfgs posted is preventing Wikipedia from becoming a directory, which is certainly not a danger in this case (the MHS article is another story). I mentioned the Babylon 5 example to point out that while in writing guidlines may seem very specific, in practice they can be very subjective. To be too literal and severe with the application of standards would result in deletion of a substantial portion of Wikipedia (as well as a lot of angry Babylon 5 fans). I just don't think the case is clear for this article. <a href="../../../f/e/l/User%7EFelixstrange_9f57.html" title="User:Felixstrange">Felixstrange</a> 04:22, 27 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd>As a B5 fan, and as a Wikipedian, I would prefer without hesitation to see many of our unnecessary B5 articles removed. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 13:17, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think you mean <a href="../../../b/e/g/Begging_the_question.html" title="Begging the question">begging the question</a> rather than <a href="../../../t/a/u/Tautology.html" title="Tautology">tautology</a>. The odd mascots around the world (not just US) and their stories are always interesting, but they're curiosities. All curiosities get <i>some</i> slight discussion in the wider world, but usually in the context of "Hey, didja know?" segments. ESPN <i>had had</i> a mascot challenge, but it was devoted to college mascots (which are peopled by male cheerleaders and gymnasts, generally). Even with them, it was a "hey, this is cute" bit. What needs to be present for us to avoid either a Rippley's Believe-It-Or-Not or Guiness Book of Records museum of raree shows is for the mascot to be significant in its own right by something it does/has done. Did Spoofhound bite a player? Did a player bite Spoofhound? Other than some attribute to the story, we need something that needs to be explained about the mascot. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 13:11, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Spoofhound is a cute little dog, and the very short story about the adoption of Spoofhound as a high school mascot is an amusing anecdote, but it just isn't ever going to rise above the level of loveable local trivia, based upon the evidence. Any useful information is already included in the article on the high school itself.<a href="../../../o/f/f/User%7EOfficeGirl_7947.html" title="User:OfficeGirl">OfficeGirl</a> 00:52, 27 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> No independent reliable sources, no realistic claim to notability. Also ( but that's of course not grounds for deletion) leads like "the only ... in the country" irk me big time, since of course there is only <a href="../../../u/s/a/USA_f75d.html" title="USA">one country</a> in the world. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstein_7344.html" title="User:Sandstein">Sandstein</a> 06:16, 30 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
