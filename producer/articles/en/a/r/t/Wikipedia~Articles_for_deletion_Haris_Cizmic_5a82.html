<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>KEEP</b> There have been multiple requests to keep by editors who have made no edits other than to this AfD or the Haris Cizmic article. However after ignoring those I looked at the fact that most of the delete comments came before the changes to the article were made and the nominator withdrew the AfD. Plus a review of the article and the references lead me to believe that it should be kept. <a href="../../../c/a/m/User%7ECambridgeBayWeather_aa30.html" title="User:CambridgeBayWeather">CambridgeBayWeather</a> <a href="../../../c/a/m/User_talk%7ECambridgeBayWeather_e92a.html" title="User talk:CambridgeBayWeather">(Talk)</a> 15:45, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE THIS ARTICLE</b> - It visually and conceptually activates the essentially transitional quality. I understand it's difficult to enter into this topic because of how the figurative-narrative matrix spatially undermines the substructure of critical thinking. With regard to the issue of content, the disjunctive perturbation of the spatial relationships contextualize a participation in the critical dialogue, however...I think that the reductive quality of the purity of content makes resonant the distinctive formal juxtapositions. But, to keep it short, I say <b>DON'T DELETE!</b> --Onomatopeja tica 13:55, 28 June 2006 (UTC),</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The temp page is indeed much better. But the complete lack of sources (newspaper reports about the awards or the design jobs (especially for <a href="../../../b/m/w/BMW_bcb4.html" title="BMW">BMW</a>), for example) is still a problem. IMHO the greatest claim of notability would be his <a href="../../../a/x/a/AXA_%28band%29_4538.html" title="AXA (band)">musical career</a>, which is barely mentioned at all. The copyvio tag seems strange to me, since the user who added it didn't state whose copyright was supposed to be violated. The page isn't listed at <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:Copyright problems</a>, either. <a href="../../../h/u/o/User%7EHuon_18c0.html" title="User:Huon">Huon</a> 20:34, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>the problem is that no one lists awards online after 5-6 years. (There is no award for the BMW, just a magazine ad designed for them, available for preview on www.theaxart.com I did not post that ad, because of their logo on it). I am not sure about Memorex, if they still keep old awards listed, but i can provide some scanns and screenshots. Musical awards are just some big paper things with hard cover. I could probably provide around 60 magazine and newspaper articles, but majority of them is not in english and they are just old scans. To post them - it would probably look ridiculous and funny. Shouldn't be enough to swear on the bible or something...&#160;:)&#160;? --<a href="../../../d/j/e/User%7EDjedamrazuk_5c10.html" title="User:Djedamrazuk">Djedamrazuk</a> 20:47, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>just crossed my mind - if the author was an art director of few magazines, (and they are available for public view on his website), shouldn't that be a printed representation of his design work? also, could this help - <a href="http://cosmeticsurgerytimes.com/cosmeticsurgerytimes/classified/classifiedDetail.jsp?id=308191" class="external free" title="http://cosmeticsurgerytimes.com/cosmeticsurgerytimes/classified/classifiedDetail.jsp?id=308191" rel="nofollow">http://cosmeticsurgerytimes.com/cosmeticsurgerytimes/classified/classifiedDetail.jsp?id=308191</a></li>

<dd>Usually, an AfD is open for five days. In the end, an admin takes a look and decides wether the arguments for deletion outweight those for keeping the article. (The quality of "votes" is taken into account, not just the quantity.) I assume that DarkAudit's retraction of the AfD will count heavily in the article's favor, but it might happen that Cizmic's notability is still considered insufficient (see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a> for notability guidelines).
