<p>The result of the debate was <b>speedy keep</b>. The nomination was clearly disruption of Wikipedia to make a point on the mailing list. The point is adequately made, and this article has no chance of actually being deleted.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Keep</b>, per consensus. I count at this point 31 keep/strong keep/speedy keep vs either 1 or 2 to delete , or a 94-97%. Further debate would be thoroughly pointless, though I suppose techinically it could go to DRV if anyone really feels differently. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 20:08, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A couple of people wanted to transwiki or merge, and a couple thought that such a numerical comparison was undeserving of proof, but the clear consensus was to keep.

<li>It is agreed that the existence of other similar articles is not a valid ground to oppose deletion. For example, the existence of non-notable articles is not a ground to oppose the deletion of non-notable articles. <a href="../../../l/o/o/User%7ELoom91_0629.html" title="User:Loom91">Loom91</a> 12:58, 5 May 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course not; that's why I explicitly endorsed other voters. But your claim that Wikipedia does not contain proof articles was wrong, and I felt it required disproof. There is no point in nitpicking everyone's imprecise logic on this AfD if you're not going to address the underlying consensus that the topic is notable and the article is encyclopedic. That it is also popular and educational is icing on the cake. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 13:14, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is also possible that the sun might rise shortly after I have my supper this evening, but I won't be holding my breath: given that this AfD was raised shortly after <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Cyde-should-not-have-violated-Deletion-policy-%28-t1554965.html#a4229347" class="external text" title="http://www.nabble.com/Re%3A-Cyde-should-not-have-violated-Deletion-policy-%28-t1554965.html#a4229347" rel="nofollow">you yourself mentioned that very article</a> the connection is reasonably clear.

<li><b>comment</b> It could be made more encyopedia by adding some reference to why the proof is significant and any particaly noteable arguments it has caused (Eg when was this first deabted on usernet or something).<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 15:09, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Transwiki and delete, then expand other articles</b>. Our coverage of this issue is upside-down. The "Generalizations" section contains the truly important fact (used in <a href="../../../c/a/n/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument.html" title="Cantor's diagonal argument">Cantor's diagonal argument</a> among other things). We should cover the fact that some real numbers have two decimal representations, and that all real numbers have exactly one infinite decimal representation that does not end in repeating 0 digits - and that this is true for all bases, not just base 10. (we already cover this to some degree in <a href="../../../d/e/c/Decimal_representation.html" title="Decimal representation">Decimal representation</a>) I wouldn't be opposed to an article proving the more general statement. However, the specific example in this article, that in base 10, the number 1.000... can also be represented as 0.999..., is not encyclopedic. This is indeed a good article which should be kept on another Wikimedia project, but not here. We have an article on <a href="../../../l/o/n/Long_division.html" title="Long division">Long division</a>, not on 192 divided by 4 equals 48. Same principle applies here. <a href="../../../f/l/o/User%7EFlowersofnight_dd24.html" title="User:Flowersofnight">flowersofnight</a> <a href="../../../f/l/o/User_talk%7EFlowersofnight_468d.html" title="User talk:Flowersofnight">(talk)</a> 15:39, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

<li>This topic is not just any specific example; it is infamous. I am confident that even after this AfD is archived as a keep, if 192/4=48 shows up on AfD it will not receive the same defense. <a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMelchoir_2750.html" title="User:Melchoir">Melchoir</a> 20:00, 5 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> as there are several other proof articles on Wikipedia. Article could stand to be renamed though. Is also badly in need of rewrite; about halfway through the article I found myself wondering why I should care whether or not 0.999 = 1.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 15:44, 5 May 2006 (UTC)..</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: was one of the first articles I saw on WP and it's what got me hooked, that cool articles that explain obscure things that some people are very interested in, can be written and accecible by and to anyone. This article is encyclopedic, and does not fall under indiscriminate collection of facts, but rather explains the concept of 0.999~~ going equaling 1, just as <a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_law.html" title="Godwin's law">Godwin's law</a> states the concept that the probability of hitler being mentioned in a debate over time equals one.
