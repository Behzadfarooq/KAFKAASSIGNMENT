However, there is an even split among those who want this kept and those who want this deleted.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b> No more or less significant than the other 1999 who have died. Isotope's point above is eloquently made.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> I understand that notability should not be established simply on the basis of numbers, however I am convinced the article should be retained. A baby being born is a regular occurence, sure, but Nevic sure got a lot of attention becuase she was the 6,000,000,000th by the UN <a href="http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/Oct99/jun.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.dialogueworks.co.uk/newswise/months/Oct99/jun.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. Furthermore, Alexander should stand, in a sense, is a representative for the several hundreds of men who have lost their lives in Iraq. As the 2,000th soldier to die, he will, in my opinion, serve as a reprensentative for the 1,999 who died before him. It would be cordial to make an article about each of the brave men who died in the War in Iraq, but such is not plausible for an encyclopedia. Thus, a brief mention of Alexander - in my opinion - would give some type of recognition besides that found in the <a href="../../../w/a/r/War_on_Terrorism_c7b1.html" title="War on Terrorism">War on Terrorism</a> articles, etc. I think that this article should be kept. <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User%7EV._Molotov_fc5c.html" title="User:V. Molotov">Molotov</a> <a href="../../../v/2E/_/User_talk%7EV._Molotov_7080.html" title="User talk:V.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This was a difficult decision to make. On the one hand, <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a memorial, and having the misfortune of being the Nth person to die divisible by 1000 does not automatically make one notable. So while I do not disagree with many of the reasons provided by those who wish to delete this article, I must dissent; this death has been widely covered by the media, <a href="http://news.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://news.google.com/" rel="nofollow">news.google.com</a> returns over 1,000 articles which mention this specific person by name. If the media decides to make this person a poster child for all of the other fallen soldiers in Iraq, then this person does become significantly notable, or notable enough that people may look to Wikipedia for additional information about this person. I would liken this to the <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> disappearance case; from a distance Natalee Holloway is one of 800,000 children who are reported missing each year, yet she is notable due to the mass news coverage she received. It is too soon to tell if George Alexander will receive the same type of media attention that Holloway did, but nonetheless they are both notable because of the attention they received, thus my vote of support to include this article. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 17:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If Mr. Alexander's death becomes the flashpoint for an increased anti-war movement in the United States or receives a massive amount of news coverage for a prolonged period of time ala <a href="../../../n/a/t/Natalee_Holloway_a742.html" title="Natalee Holloway">Natalee Holloway</a> I would be inclined to agree with you <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a>. Mr. Alexander would indeed be notable then, but at this point that is a crystal ball scenario and there is no credible evidence that either of those things will happen.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 20:09, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The crystal ball argument is a double edged sword. Time will tell if this person will become a flashpoint or not, but right now this person is receiving a considerable amount of media attention. I have reasonable doubt that this article should or should not be deleted, and as per <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>: "If in doubt, don't delete!"

<li>Actually A7 doesn't talk about whether a person <i>is</i> notable or not, it covers articles that don't <i>claim</i> notability. "An article about a real person that does not assert that person's importance or significance". So you can't use A7 because you do or do not think someone is notable, only if the article does or does not claim notability.

<li>My problem with this nomination is that the nominator provided absolutely no basis on which to justify the claim that he's not notable. Why should we delete something when no reason's been provided to do so? Having reviewed my vote, as I promised elsewhere, I'm sticking with "keep".

<p>STRONG KEEP: George Alexander was not notable for his life in any particular regard, but his death is very notable in that his death set the milestone of the 2,000th KIA in this war and is receiving a great deal of media attention which is a matter of permanent record and future interest. You can be sure that the 3,000th KIA will ignite the same kind of contentions that are being presented here. In any event, his sacrifice stands as a rallying point for opposition to this war and as such is a matter of historical importance.</p>
