<li><b>Delete</b> after research implying the best sellers bit is mistaken, and her candidacy is quite low profile.

The latter also says: "She has not filed any campaign finance reports with the Federal Election Commission, signaling that she has not reached the $5,000 reporting threshold. By comparison, incumbent Doris Matsui has raised more than half a million dollars as of June 30." <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 16:48, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Her site came up, which explains the bestsellers thing. She writes that she <b>edited</b> books that became NYT bestsellers.<a href="http://www.claireforcongress.com/cc_about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.claireforcongress.com/cc_about.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Ahem. Humbly don't think that meets WP:BIO. I added the references to the article, and otherwise wikified the thing. Still think she's not notable enough, though. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 19:16, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Dollar amounts raised in a campaign do not make notability, but this article seems notable enough independent of the author status. <a href="../../../c/d/c/User%7ECdcdoc_acfe.html" title="User:Cdcdoc">Cdcdoc</a> 18:56, 17 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Cdcdoc, do you have any reliable citations that show she is notable, or is that just your opinion? <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 19:05, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> She's the nominee of a major party in a Congressional race - that should be notability enough. The people who will be seeing her name on the ballot should be able to look her up on wikipedia and get some information. The page regarding notability of candidates indicates that if an article on a candidate is big enough not to be a stub, it should be kept. Rather than advocating deletion, why not add something to the page? <a href="../../../h/u/n/User%7EHunterAmor_01d1.html" title="User:HunterAmor">HunterAmor</a> 15:28, 18 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That proposed guideline also says that information on a candidate should be so big as to not fit on the page for the race itself. Since the race page does not (yet) exist, it's a bit disingenuous to say that this information wouldn't fit. That same page also suggests that the main page for a candidate should be created "Only if and when there is enough independent, verifiable information to write a non-stub article", and you conveniently ignored the part about the information boing independent and verifiable, which it's not here. Cheers, <a href="../../../v/e/c/User%7EVectro_bf83.html" title="User:Vectro">Vectro</a> 16:00, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, this isn't just any district she's running in. The 5th California district means it is high profile even if she doesn't have much of a chance. People will be looking her up for specific information. Which leads me to my second point, she is more than just a 'candidate,' but a well known columnist and researcher from the Pacific Research Institute on her own. Finally, I have seen many candidate stubs worthy of deletion, and this one doesn't even come close to what the policy was probably intended to keep us from. In my view, there's plenty of doubt here which, in line with the Policy for Deletion, means we should abide by the presumption of keeping the article. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralwaugh_3837.html" title="User:Admiralwaugh">Admiral</a> 16:12, 18 October 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralwaugh_3837.html" title="User:Admiralwaugh">User:Admiralwaugh</a> (Admiral) has 2 <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Admiralwaugh_8ecd.html" title="Special:Contributions/Admiralwaugh">contributions</a>, the other one being making his user page link blue, just before commenting here. <a href="../../../a/n/o/User%7EAnonEMouse_a537.html" title="User:AnonEMouse">AnonEMouse</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/n/o/User_talk%7EAnonEMouse_d7a1.html" title="User talk:AnonEMouse">(squeak)</a></sup> 17:08, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> As sophisticated and relevant a comment as I have ever seen, AnonEMouse, considering that it only means I have edited those pages *while logged in*. In any case, we're not competing for who has edited the most articles, we are discussing whether or not an article should be deleted from Wikipedia or grouped with another article. Although grouping seems like a decent option, I want to reiterate that the presumption for keeping articles ought to control in this case. <a href="../../../a/d/m/User%7EAdmiralwaugh_3837.html" title="User:Admiralwaugh">Admiral</a> 05:46, 19 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I don't see how the 5th California Congressional district is more high profile than any others. I've been looking at the New York Times congressional political map <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/2006ELECTIONGUIDE.html?currentDataSet=senANALYSIS" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/2006ELECTIONGUIDE.html?currentDataSet=senANALYSIS" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> and see only 3 districts that are slightly competitive (neither are the 5th). The only other "high profile" CA race is the district that <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tan_Nguyen_df83.html" title="Tan Nguyen">Tan Nguyen</a> is running in due to that stunt his campaign pulled. --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarriedtofilm_4bc3.html" title="User:Marriedtofilm">Marriedtofilm</a> 03:58, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Notability...she does not meet it. Even under the proposed compromise regarding candidates she does not qualify (basically, article about the race THEN the candidates). Re: 'nominee of a major party in a Congressional race'...this does not bestow notability, especially in a district where the losing candidate is more of a ballot place holder than a candidate with a chance. As an example, look at a similarly Democratic stronghold district in Minnesota (MN-5)...please locate the article about the Republican candiate Frank Taylor or Daniel Mathias...the incumbent's victims since 1998. The discovery about her 'best selling' publishing...well, just further emphasizes the lack of notability.--<a href="../../../m/n/y/User%7EMnyakko_2c09.html" title="User:Mnyakko">Tony</a> 01:00, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Mnyakko. Fails <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> and has only edited some books and it isn't even clear what books. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 02:18, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> She's not competitive against <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doris_Matsui_073a.html" title="Doris Matsui">Doris Matsui</a> – can't find a poll because it's so one-sided, but several political sites say Matsui's going to win easily on November 7. <a href="../../../k/r/a/User%7EKrakatoaKatie_d1a7.html" title="User:KrakatoaKatie"><font color="salmon"><b>Krakatoa</b></font></a><a href="../../../k/r/a/User_talk%7EKrakatoaKatie_7f28.html" title="User talk:KrakatoaKatie"><font color="teal">Katie</font></a> 12:08, 24 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
