<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Improve</b>. I agree with CSTAR that the title is POV, as is most of the article. However, I believe that with an overhaul, it could be a valuable article. I suggest the moving of this to <b>Wikiquote</b> and the construction of an article dealing specifically between spiritual beliefs of mathematicians and ideas relating math and religion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheSwami_2fc9.html" title="User:TheSwami">The Swami</a> 09:44, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but <b>Improve</b>. There is a long history of mathematicians speculating on the nature of god - speculation is their job - and the idea of god is entangled with the idea of infinity which mathematicians can be said to have a particular viewpoint on. Care needs to be taken with deciding whether the quoted mathematicians are truly talking about a deity which they believe in or whether they are using the term 'god' as a shorthand for a non-religious concept. -- <a href="../../../s/p/o/User%7ESpondoolicks_64fc.html" title="User:Spondoolicks">Spondoolicks</a> 10:09, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> What I seem to be seeing generally here is delete votes because the article is just a collection of quotes and is POV, and keep votes because the history of mathematics in relation to religion is a valid history subject. What I propose is move this article to something like <i>Mathematics and Religion</i> or <i>Mathematics and Spirituality</i> and turn it into an article on the historical relation between the two. Or just start a new article at one of these places and remove this one.

<dd>Could someone explain exactly why they believe that the title "Mathematics and God" is POV? Would it be better if we put quotes around the word "God"? The title "Mathematics and deities" sounds wrong to me. It is not clear to me that the article is talking about several gods. I would guess that with the possible exception of Plato, all the quotes here are talking about a monotheistic notion of "God". "Mathematics and religion" also sounds wrong to me, it is not about religion (or spirituality) <i>per se</i>. It seems to me that this article is about an <i>idea</i>. An idea, as expressed by several famous mathematics, about the relationship between mathematics and the notion of a supreme being they called "God" — perhaps seriously, perhaps metaphorically, perhaps jokingly. And in so doing, I would guess, they were also trying to say something important, about mathematics and its relationship to the world we live in. I think, the fact that these mathematicians thought this idea was important, means it <i>is</i> important, if only for the reason that they thought so. Their idea is certainly POV, our writing about their idea is not. <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaul_August_2fe5.html" title="User:Paul August">Paul August</a> <a href="../../../p/a/u/User_talk%7EPaul_August_590c.html" title="User talk:Paul August">☎</a> 19:53, August 16, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>It's not the title by itself that causes the problem. The POV is caused more by title plus current first paragraph:
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of famous mathematicians have made connections between <b>mathematics and God</b>, often likening God to a mathematician.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Taken together, these could be read to imply a POV that a God exists. Now, I don't actually read it this way, rather I see this use of the word "God" as a literary device to denote a concept that the average reader will be familiar with, regardless of the beliefs about God that the reader holds. Nevertheless, I think the first reading is quite plausible for many of our readers, and the paragraph is therefore unacceptable as it stands. I would support keeping the current title if the first paragraph was changed so that the overall POV effect was eliminated. <a href="../../../d/m/h/User%7EDmharvey_69fb.html" title="User:Dmharvey">Dmharvey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" class="image" title="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png"><img src="../../../upload/1/13/User_dmharvey_sig.png" alt="Image:User_dmharvey_sig.png" width="18" height="21" longdesc="../../../u/s/e/Image%7EUser_dmharvey_sig.png_96c3.html" /></a> <a href="../../../d/m/h/User_talk%7EDmharvey_4b37.html" title="User talk:Dmharvey">Talk</a> 20:21, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, it would certainly be POV for Wikipedia to be asserting the existence of "God". And I can see given what Dmharvey has said above that the article and title could be read as doing that. David, has now changed the first paragraph to read:
<dl>
<dd><i>A number of famous mathematicians have made connections between mathematics and various notions of God.</i></dd>

<dd>If this is about Mathematics, not mathematicians, where is the formal definition of God? What is the status of the "proofs" mentioned?
