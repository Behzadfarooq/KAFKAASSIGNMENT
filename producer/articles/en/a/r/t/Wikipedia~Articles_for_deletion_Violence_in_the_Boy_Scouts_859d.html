<p>This article is a fork from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America_fc82.html" title="Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America">Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America</a>, has no references, is very POV, and only cites a couple of cases from the entire world. It does not deserve its own article. It should be merged back into the controversies article. It also talks about story telling, which is not violenece. <a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:32, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> The attempt to delete this article strikes strongly of article ownership issues and censorship. When this material was listed on <a href="../../../c/o/n/Controversies_about_the_Boy_Scouts_of_America_fc82.html" title="Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America">Controversies about the Boy Scouts of America</a>, it was blasted from all sides as being "inappropriate" for the text of that article. Therefore, the material was moved to its own article. Reading the nomination, the user states that the material does not "deserve to be on Wikipedia". This is against everything Wikipedia stands for. The nomination, itself, appears to be over content dispute and lack of references, both of which are highly invalid reasons to delete an article. As far as the size of the article, there is no stipulation that articles have to start big. Plenty of articles start as stubs with little or no information. POV is also not an issue...since the article states several occurences and doesn't give private opinions like "the Boy Scouts encourages violence". Last but not least, this article should be given a chance instead of atatcked and voted for deletion by those who don't like what it has to say. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 16:48, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I didn't say it didn't deserve to be on Wiki, but rather that it didn't warrant its own article. Your assumptions about my motivations are SORELY WRONG, but discussing it with you would likely be pointless. Your scope on this article is too focused and narrow (one main incident and an allusion to the HJ and German Scouts)...<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 16:59, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My allusion to that opinion was the statement: "It does not deserve its own article" As far as the article being narrow with two incidents, those are the only one's I know about. As stated on the article talk page, I did not intend to write a lengthy article off the bat, but rather start one and let others contribute. My entire annoyance with this nomination, was that the article was not even given a <i>chance</i>, but nominated for deletion less than 24 hours after creation. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 17:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Forks from main article that don't have enough material to be other than a stub are highly frowned upon. There is far more violence in the military and yet is there an article on that? Also, how are ghost stories violence? THis is what prompted my proposal for a name change, but I haven't thought of a good one yet. You do really need references for all this. You may want to save the text, work it offline, come up with a better title, reference it, and then start an article in this area. It that is doable, but I don't see this one going far. If you want to go that route, I'll even help you.<a href="../../../r/l/e/User%7ERlevse_2b5d.html" title="User:Rlevse">Rlevse</a> 17:19, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep and verify.</b> Violence has taken place in the scouts and Husnock speaks the truth. Even if outright violence did not occur in the scouts, hazing does, and this is one of the lesser known issues of scouting.

<dd>It looks like that the mass of people will win here, and this promising article will get deleted. In any event, to answer those three points above, the article verifibility is already being discussed on the talk page. A police report or other offical document would be all that would be needed. Original research is very questionable, since at least two users have claimed knowledge of one of the events in the article and, again, talk page discussions have been made ot get offical sources. POV Fork is the most questionable of all, since the definition is an article created about the same subject as another due to content dispute. There is no other article about violence in the Boy Scouts and the material was removed over and over again from controversies about the Boy Scout with users claiming it didn't belong there. Deleted the article may be, but deleted it should not. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 18:08, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

Nobody's saying that this is undoubtedly false or doesn't belong in Wikipedia's articles about the Boy Scouts of America. With controversial topics, though, things must be sourced. Information on Wikipedia, no matter how controversial, is kept — given that it is notable and verifiable. It is up to the writer of the information to provide legitimate sources. "Two users have claimed knowledge of one of the events in the article." That is not a verifable, legitimate source for our purposes here. If you can provide a police report, that's great; a police report will certainly back up the fact that it happened and no one will have any right to delete it. However, you must find more sources to verify that events like these are what led to Youth Protection, back up the quotes from adult leaders, prove the explusions, and the like. We can't have Wikipedia editors drawing their own conclusions from the facts or personal research and experience, however ugly it may be. If the material was deleted in the past, it is likely that it was written without any way to back it up. — <b><a href="../../../r/e/b/User%7ERebelguys2_63db.html" title="User:Rebelguys2">Rebelguys2</a></b> <sup><a href="../../../r/e/b/User_talk%7ERebelguys2_747e.html" title="User talk:Rebelguys2"><font color="#CC5500">talk</font></a></sup> 18:38, 8 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
