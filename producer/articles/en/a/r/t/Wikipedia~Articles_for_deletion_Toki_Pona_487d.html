<p>This page is an archive of the discussion about the proposed deletion of the article below. <b>This page is no longer live.</b> Further comments should be made on the article's talk page rather than here so that this page is preserved as an historic record.<br />
The result of the debate was keep.</p>

Constructed languages don't have to be popular to be notable. They are often interesting and unique examples of what languages can be.

<li><b>Keep!</b> I honestly don't know how many people use the language, although the estimation of 12 seems far too low to me. But, does it matter? Most constructed languages, Toki Pona included, were <b>not</b> created with the purpose of acquiring a community of speakers; instead, they were created as works of art. Establishing the significance of such a language by the number of people who actually use it is the same thing as establishing the significance of a symphony by the size of the orchestra that performs it. If you really want to know how wikifiable a constructed language is, you'll need to find out how complete it is, which degree of esteem it has received inside and outside the conlang community, and how verifiable all this is. Well, Toki Pona scores well on all these fronts. A simple google for "Toki Pona" generates no less than 26,400 hits; seventeen wikipedias feature an article about it, while numerous other wikis refer to it in other articles. As an insider I can assure you that Toki Pona enjoys a high reputation; in fact, it is one of the most successful artistic languages ever created, especially if you consider the fact that it lacks a book or a movie as a vehicle. The article definitely deserves to stay! <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 06:34, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li>Hum! According to <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVanity_page_2e5e.html" title="Wikipedia:Vanity page">Wikipedia:Vanity page</a>, a "vanity page" is a page created by a person about himself or someone close to him. This is <i>obviously</i> not the case here. If you don't know a person, that's fine, but <i>please</i> don't make it personal by calling it vanity! Likewise, do not automatically call an article about a work of art "promo for a personal project", because works of art are personal by definition! <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 07:19, 3 Jan 2005 (UTC).

<li>I know the content of both pages ("What the W. is not" and "No original research"). I completely fail to see the connection to Toki Pona. As far as I am concerned, this whole thing has nothing to do with research. All I can tell you is that Toki Pona is among the more significant constructed languages, and for that simple reason it deserves a place here. Otherwise you might as well throw away the articles about any constructed language other than <a href="../../../e/s/p/Esperanto.html" title="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> or <a href="../../../q/u/e/Quenya.html" title="Quenya">Quenya</a>, and I don't think anyone is waiting for that. <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 06:11, 4 Jan 2005 (UTC).</li>

<li>Notability is not a criterion for deletion, nor is being a created language. Encyclopaedic is defined in our policy as "what you would expect to find under this title".

<li><b>Keep</b> The google hits, even after filtering out wikipedia-mirrored content, are very impressive for a constructed language.

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. There are 'much' more users then twelve and WikiPedia in TokiPona is a very good place to learn the language and increase that number. --Earwin Burrfoot</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. As Toki Pona is currently in what could be considered an initial period of growth, and as the language already has a large number of followers (who stem from several different base languages), it definitely merits inclusion in Wikipedia.</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. Toki Pona is the most perfect conlang around. It has the best insa/nimi (meaning/words) value. It's getting more and more popular (slowly, but anyway). It's surely a product of Great Linguist's mind. It is not vanity NO way. Toki Pona is a genious language. Its Wikipedia was one of the best resources for me, beause it was not <b>about</b> toki pona, but it was about whatever <b>usign</b> toki pona. So it was a way to explore things and toki pona simultaneously. Those idiots writing "vanity" just have no idea what they are talking about. Keep it, it IS worth. Thank you.</li>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s>. WikiPedia on TokiPona is really one of the best places to learn the language and one of the most amasing things on the whole WikiPedia.

<dd>Obviously you did not read the comments above before adding to it, founder <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimbo_Wales_1525.html" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> deleted the Toki Pona wiki and moved it over to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">Wikicities</a>, If you exclude Wikipedia from that google search you get a mere 7000 not 26,300. Seems rather interesting that 2/3rds of the links for it (according to google) are from Wiki.

<dd>There's no need to be snarky or unwelcoming, even if it is something you feel passionate about. I did read the comments, but I felt that the number of Google results was notable even if the majority are from Wikipedia, and since I had just finished viewing <a href="http://tokipona.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal" class="external text" title="http://tokipona.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal" rel="nofollow">an article in Toki Pona</a>, I thought perhaps the above statement was an inaccuracy.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A very well-known conlang. That there are only about a dozen speakers is hard to believe. Long before I came to the Wikipedia, I myself had not only come across it but memorized the entire list of words and grammar.

<li>Keep. Seems notable, is an interesting project and has a well-written article. I wouldn't want to see an explosion of articles by everyone out there who thinks they can create their own language, but I doubt most would come close to this one as a concept. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMattley_a310.html" title="User:Mattley">Mattley</a> 09:02, 7 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It seems to be a common misconception that Toki Pona is only known because of its presence on wikipedia, but that is simply false. I and others learned of it well before noticing it on wikipedia. Extensive websites about it exist, created by people in various countries (I've seen English, German, Russian and Esperanto webpages about Toki Pona). Translations and original works and comics exist. It is simply wrong to assert that it's known only because of wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/u/User%7EGoulo_62ba.html" title="User:Goulo">Goulo</a> 08:37, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That is absolutely true. Thing is, each wiki entry is mirrored and mirrored ad infinitum. Same with DMOZ entries. That's something inherent to the Wikipedias, and you definitely cannot blame Sonja for that, especially if you take into consideration that she can't even be held responsible for the page! Besides, you are right: even if you omit all the wiki pages and their mirrors, there remain a substantial amount of other web pages. [On a personal note: I am also the author of a language with a wiki entry; let me tell you that it is really annoying to have to dig your way through all those wiki mirrors if you want to check if something new has been written about it]. <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 15:28, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC).
<dl>
<dd>Hm? I'm not sure if IJzeren is replying to me or to Megan1967. The indentation suggests me, but I wasn't talking at all about the issue of wiki mirroring or whether Sonja wrote about Toki Pona in wikipedia or its mirrors, and I'm not sure what that has to do with the question whether Toki Pona should be deleted from wikipedia. In case it was unclear, I'm saying that Toki Pona has presence and significance independent of wikipedia and its mirrors, and that indeed many people learn of it via sources other than wikipedia and its mirrors. Given that variety of Toki Pona activity that is utterly unrelated to wiki, it is therefore false to assert that Toki Pona is only notable because of wikipedia. <a href="../../../g/o/u/User%7EGoulo_62ba.html" title="User:Goulo">Goulo</a> 17:21, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No worries Goulo, it was indeed thee I had in mind. My point was this: even if 80 % of the Google hits are wiki and mirrors (which essentially happens because wiki pages have a strange way of multiplying themselves and is not Sonja's fault) that still leaves lots of remaining pages. In other words: I fully agree with thee! <a href="../../../i/j/z/User%7EIJzeren_Jan_c9aa.html" title="User:IJzeren Jan">IJzeren Jan</a> 18:29, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC).</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. First of all, a vote for deletion was held on this article fairly recently, and it failed. Second, if Toki Pona gets deleted, then it would be fair to delete Klingon, leet, pig latin, and any other similar language. --<a href="../../../j/u/l/User%7EJulieADriver_785d.html" title="User:JulieADriver">Julie-Anne Driver</a> 22:21, 8 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a typically encyclopedic article, with a topic which has risen remarkably quickly to fame outside the Wikipedia community, and now (it would seem) here, too. It is one the Wikipedia can be proud of â€” personally, I would not think twice about voting for it as the Wikipedia's Featured Article. --<a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVerdlanco_1c73.html" title="User:Verdlanco">Verdlanco</a> <a href="../../../v/e/r/User_talk%7EVerdlanco_2f1e.html" title="User talk:Verdlanco">(talk)</a> 19:52, 10 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. We have articles on minor races of beings in videogames. Why not Toki Pona? I heard of Toki Pona <i>before</i> I heard of Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If not notable as a 'language', TP is at least notable is an 'internet fenomenon' (as noted above, l33t-speak has a page), the page has already been made conciderably shorter and less informative than before. If to be deleted, it should then get a page noting "TokiPona - a minimalistic constructed language, created in 2001, created alot of fuss and 'flame wars' in WP mailing lists circa 2004. The language was concidered unnotable by the WP concensus and thereby shan't be described". Now, wouldn't that be just grand? (and oh yeah, cross over my <b>keep</b> for anonymusIPishness.</li>

So even if this wiki has moved to <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikicities.html" title="Wikicities">wikicities</a>, I was still interested in finding out <i>what</i> Toki Pona is, <i>who</i> invented it, etc, etc. So, even if it is from a purly historical point of view, there is still some need to keep this page up.</li>
