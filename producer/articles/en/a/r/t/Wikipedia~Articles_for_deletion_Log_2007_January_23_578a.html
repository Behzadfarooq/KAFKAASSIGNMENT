<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Full disclosure, I wrote the article. The article is about a nationally-ranked college athlete who went on to become an acknowledged (albeit admittedly not particularly successful) professional, who has been/is part of the cast of two different reality television series. The nominator acknowledges on the talk page that there are already two sources noted in the article (The <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calgary_Sun_f34a.html" title="Calgary Sun">Calgary Sun</a> article and the <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_Guide_969f.html" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a> article), along with several other references which he dismisses for various questionable reasons, but then goes on to claim that the two <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> are somehow "not notable" enough to sustain the article. Nominator hangs the AfD on his contention that someone would have to finish 4th on Survivor to be notable (a contention which as far as I can tell is unsupported in policy or guidelines) and on his dismissal of two reliable sources as "non-notable" which makes no sense. Scorpion redirected the article without comment and, when I restored it, redirected it again with the rationale that there are other Survivor contestants who are more notable but who don't have articles. This is an invalid rationale. A subject's notability is independent of another subject's notability. If the hundred other Survivor conestants are as or more notable than Calderon, then Scorpion or whoever else is free to write articles about them. Their absence is not an excuse to delete this article. There has been nothing offered in terms of either Wiki-policy or Wiki-guidelines under which this article is not acceptable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>'<b>Merge and redirect.</b> I read the debate, which seems to center around the question of whether 2 sources automatically qualifies as "multiple." For this issue I came down on the side of delete (really M&amp;R) because of a different consideration. I consider this person as unlikely to do anything notable in the future <s>(i.e. his "career" ended with the show)</s>. If he had gotten a movie deal or something similar that would keep him on the radar, then I would have voted "keep." 2 sources is on the fence -- it could go one way or the other -- but since this person seems unlikely to ever get more attention I say merge. (Before anyone flames me, I'd like to note that this isn't policy, or a guideline, or anything. I know this. The problem is that the guidelines are few in number, and in this case don't clearly tell us what to do. And since they are just that -- guidelines -- it doesn't make sense to interpret them literally. How many sources constitutes "multiple," for example, varies depending on the nature of the article.) --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:32, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Jeff Varner become a noted reporter, as did Hunter. I have no problems with them having pages. Sundra was in several TV shows before Survivor, again no problem. There are far more notable Survivors whose pages have been deleted because they weren't considered notable, thus taking his time on Survivor out. Apart from that, all he has is some minor reality TV show and once again, there is precedent because few raialty contestants outside Survivor, The Apprentice, American Idol or The Amazing Race have pages. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 16:55, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Sourcing looks fine. Given that independent coverage is avaiable, and that some of the people who "placed" don't seem any more likely to "do anything notable in the future", it seems a bit arbitrary to draw a line at "final 4". It also seems a bit unwieldy to merge all these contestants into the parent article.

<li>Yeah, that was basically my point when I said that even though those two are technically "multiple" that I didn't interpret them as being sufficient in notability, because as you say they're just standard interviews that everybody does. Even the very first person voted off, that's only on the show for 1 episode (as one of ~20 people there for that hour) gets his TV guide interview published, and gets to appear on a talk show the next morning and the whole thing. But by the next week you've already forgotten who he is, and by the time they do the reunion show nobody even recognizes him. His 15 seconds of fame is over, and he's already an unfamiliar face. Basically, he's non-notable, in spite of a couple interviews he gave during that 15 seconds. --<a href="../../../m/a/e/User%7EMaelwys_a686.html" title="User:Maelwys">Maelwys</a> 20:49, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comments</b> How so? Here is the entertainment related criteria at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, and it's already been established that being on Survivor alone isn't enough for a page.
<ul>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - <a href="../../../h/o/l/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_b01f.html" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>) - <i>Nope</i></li>
<li>The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person - <i>All of the interviews were mandatory Survivor interviews conducted because of his Survivor involvement, not because of his self notability</i></li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. Notability can be determined by:
<ul>
<li>Multiple features in popular culture publications such as <a href="../../../v/o/g/Vogue_%28magazine%29.html" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a>, <a href="../../../g/q/_/GQ_8d36.html" title="GQ">GQ</a>, <a href="../../../e/l/l/ELLE_7ea6.html" title="ELLE">Elle</a>, <a href="../../../f/h/m/FHM_6b72.html" title="FHM">FHM</a> or national newspapers. - <i>The only articles cited are mandatory interviews that come automatically after elimination. Meaning that none of the interviews were conducted because of his notability</i>
<ul>
<li>I think he clearly passes this criterion. Why does it matter if they are "mandatory"? In addition, as Otto has shown, he may meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> for his involvement in college and professional sports. I am not a survivor fan at all, by the way. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 15:19, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>A large fan base, fan listing or "cult" following - <i>No indication of that</i></li>

<li>You know, I recently argued for the inclusion of Calderon on his talk page believing that he satisfies WP:BIO and WP:NOTE and someone dismissed them, saying "It's just a guideline, not a policy." I'm trying to remember who it was who was so dismissive...oh right, it was <a href="../../../j/2E/p/Talk%7EJ.P._Calderon_f5c3.html" title="Talk:J.P. Calderon">you</a>. Kind of odd that you're arguing for WP:BIO to be the measure today when you dismissed it yesterday...</li>
<li>Note that WP:BIO also has guidelines for athletes: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States." Calderon competed for <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_State_University%2C_Long_Beach_67aa.html" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a> in men's volleyball and coaches women's volleyball. CSULB's article notes that its men's and women's volleyball teams are both highly nationally ranked. He is also a ranked player by the <a href="../../../a/s/s/Association_of_Volleyball_Professionals_a59d.html" title="Association of Volleyball Professionals">Association of Volleyball Professionals</a>, which its article notes is the premiere professional beach volleyball league in the United States. I have already acknowledged that his pro volleyball career has not been stellar but that doesn't mean that his volleyball career should not be considered in addition to his appearances on Survivor and JDMA. I happen to think his reality TV career is by itself sufficient to establish notability but his TV cast appearances plus his sporting career are definitely enough to qualify him as notable. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:46, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

I looked at that Volleyball article, and very few of them have pages, not even the two players who the article claims were the top ranked in 2005. Precedent has already been established for Survivor articles, and if not even the top ranked AVP players have pages, then the main reason for his page is JDMA, which he hasn't done anything of note in, and by the way, none of the contestants from that article have individual pages, not even JDs page is linked from there. -- <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpion0422_af95.html" title="User:Scorpion0422">Scorpion</a> 03:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The only reference this article gives is to a blog post by one Aza Raskin, son of <a href="../../../j/e/f/Jef_Raskin_3baa.html" title="Jef Raskin">Jef Raskin</a>, which describes "bracket notation" but states that it was an idea of his father's and previously did not have a name. Later, in the Comments section, the blog's author admits to also being the original author of the Wikipedia article, implicitly identifying himself as the author of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bracket_notation&amp;diff=62359804&amp;oldid=16923288" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bracket_notation&amp;diff=62359804&amp;oldid=16923288" rel="nofollow">this revision</a>. Given that this was only about seven months ago, and that other sources for the method of notation are lacking, it looks to me very much like original research and an attempt at self-promotion. Note that if the page is deleted, the redirect to <a href="../../../b/r/a/Bra-ket_notation.html" title="Bra-ket notation">Bra-ket notation</a> which previously existed there should be restored. – <a href="../../../q/x/z/User%7EQxz_3066.html" title="User:Qxz">Qxz</a> 01:10, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>This one is kind of hard to explain but it's pretty funny. In any case, I see no hope of this article ever developing to anything more than the current sub-stub: this political party was in fact not a party but a clever way to advertise the Mongolian Barbecus, whatever that is.

<li><b>Delete</b> What we have here is a person who is good at promoting them self (thats why he created his own Wikipedia page).

The Washington post article comes close but it to has a hint of self promotion, who does he know at the Washington Post (which for some reason seems to be a source in a lot of AFD debates). The YouTube video is an interview and in my mind should not be used as a biographical source as it may violate <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a>.

<li><b>Not a vote,</b> just full disclosure - I had forgotten about this article, which I wrote when I first started editing Wikipedia and didn't know the rules. Yes, it's about my own dad, which I now know is against Wikipolicy. I hope that doesn't mean it will be automatically deleted, but of course I understand if it does. Just as a plug for keeping the article in <i>some</i> form, he <i>is</i> quite notable in the furniture world, particularly in the U.S. where he is one of a handful of marqueteurs and has developed some innovative stylistic approaches to the art. Along with what's in the article, his work is on display in places like the Yale Art Museum, and he was featured on the end page of the NYT Magazine some years ago (long before it went online, making it hard to find). For what it's worth, he's also in the process of publishing a book on the history of marquetry. On the other hand, I'm obviously biased, so you can take whatever I say with a grain of salt! Anyway, everything in the article can be sourced, but I didn't think it would be appropriate for me to edit it anymore. If someone else would like to source and edit to give it a shot at passing AfD, that would be lovely, but this should probably be my last work on the subject. Anyway, carry on! - <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasha_Kopf_f687.html" title="User:Sasha Kopf">Sasha Kopf</a> 00:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Silas Kopf's your dad? I can't WAIT to read his book on marquetry, a seriously under-rated and undervalued furniture art in the modern era, where people believe "solid wood" furniture is the mark of quality!

We are going to rewrite the entry with correct citation and referencing - of various outside sources. If none of you object, would you allow us to use some of the above quotes as references in the new article? Ladma is not a movement as such but more a small comedy collective.

<p>What appears to be an online community. None of their claims seem especially notable; 5,000 members is certainly not enough to justify inclusion on its own.

<p>I may again do this wrong, but here is a response to the above:</p>
<p>I did not intentionally remove anything. As I said, this is my first attempt at making a Wiki page and I really do not know what I can and cannot do. I made no attempt to justify my mistake in this talk page.</p>
<p>If I were trying to justify this page, I would not bother with the membership numbers.</p>
<p>Registered Members: 5,830 Total Threads: 33,175 | Total Posts: 463,980</p>
<p>The significant number is the number of posts, not registered members. More than 12 thousand people have registered over the 8 years the site has been there, but folks who register and don't come back get deleted. The membership number above is the number of active users.</p>
<p>What is at the ZRXOA of significant value is the technical information. The OA has thousands of posts of technical merit. These include every detail of the Kawasaki ZRX as delivered, and every modification that can be purchased, made or installed.</p>
<p>A comment was made about the camaraderie. Say what you will, be we take care of our own. We have have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the families of fallen members.</p>
<p>A similar page that already exists on this Wiki is here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley-Davidson" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.</p>
<p>The ZRXOA page fits this exact category. If that page is acceptable, so should this one. I can see that page has more development than one I started last night, but this one will develop as well, if allowed to.Unreasnbl 23:49, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Do not worry, you were well within your rights to remove the PROD notice (see <a href="../../../p/r/o/Wikipedia%7EProposed_deletion_cb76.html" title="Wikipedia:Proposed deletion">Wikipedia:Proposed deletion</a>). In fact, it was the proper course of action since you clearly believe the article should be kept on Wikipedia. Anyway, the difference between Zrxoa and Harley-Davidson is that Harley-Davidson has <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> within Wikipedia's accepted definitions. <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> lists the specific criteria web sites generally have to meet to be considered "notable;" this one does not appear to meet them.

<li>Myspace presents a problem of those <i>with</i> accounts promoting their personal "myspace". Clearly a different situation here regarding this spam problem. This long term spamming of cardomain resulted into this example of article spam, i.e.<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.254.9.2_aebd.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.254.9.2">216.254.9.2's contribs</a> (Seattle). Shortly after creation, CarDomain.com was prodded (note: this is the 3rd time others have expressed it being inapropriate), this prod was removed by another Seattle based anon (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.18.188.16_6265.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.18.188.16">24.18.188.16</a>) who's history of promoting the domain is evident. Wikipedia should <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> be used for promotion or advertising. I believe it difficult to conceive that someone without a direct interest in this article would act in that manner. The spamming anon IP's are all from Seattle, which is the same location of CarDomain.com <a href="http://www.epinions.com/webs-Web_Services-All-Merchants-SoundDomain_com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.epinions.com/webs-Web_Services-All-Merchants-SoundDomain_com" rel="nofollow">[15]</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but merge into a single article. The album appears to have been announced on Hamasaki's web site (I'm assuming this is what's linked, as I can't read their crazy <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moon_language.html" title="Moon language">moon language</a>), so this isn't speculative. However, there's no reason to create two separate articles for the two disks which make up the album. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 09:25, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Best_2_5b91.html" title="A Best 2">A Best 2</a>, merge the contents of <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Best_2_-Black-_1d45.html" title="A Best 2 -Black-">A Best 2 -Black-</a> and <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Best_2_-White-_e63c.html" title="A Best 2 -White-">A Best 2 -White-</a>, then turn the latter two into redirects to <a href="../../../a/_/b/A_Best_2_5b91.html" title="A Best 2">A Best 2</a>. While Wikipedia is not a Crystal ball, I don't think it applies here. We have articles for the third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean as well as Final Fantasy XIII, so precident states that this should get the same treatment. My opinion would be different if this were a relatively unknown singer, of course, but these are almost certain to be released. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Cheers, Lankybugger</a> 14:34, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Most of the arguments brought up here are not true, as they are instead relevant to his relatives. Such as the claim that he is one of the 150th richest men, that he was the publisher of the Examiner, etcetera. The VH1 thingy is true, although I strongly doubt an article would be included on any person for that reason - how many lawsuits are filed in the United States every day? He happens to be related to famous rich people, that's it.

<p>It appears that Red Croatia <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Red+Croatia%22+-wikipedia+-wikimedia+-wiki&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22Red+Croatia%22+-wikipedia+-wikimedia+-wiki&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">fails</a> <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>, giving a total of around 170 Google search results, when excluding Wiki-references. A large number of the search results are Forums and simple meaningful mentions, some of them like [Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Red Croatia 2 this], where some yell "Heil Hitler" and salutes to the <a href="../../../u/s/t/Usta%C5%A1a.html" title="Ustaša">Ustašas</a>. But the greatest issue does not lie there. It lies in the fact that <i>Red Croatia</i> is a <b>geographical term</b> used for three southern Dalmatian Slavic early medieval principalities (and we have an article for <i>each and every one of them</i>): <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doclea.html" title="Doclea">Doclea</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travunia.html" title="Travunia">Travunia</a> and <a href="../../../z/a/c/Zachlumia.html" title="Zachlumia">Zachlumia</a> - and there is nothing that should be in this article, and not in those three. A great part of the article (referring to the nationalist irredenta bit) is from/should be in the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Greater_Croatia_87f8.html" title="Greater Croatia">Greater Croatia</a> article - which is the boil of controversy. Problem is that the "Red Croatia ideology" is just one of the numerous theories that exist for the soil, and <i>not</i> official historiography. In the end, the current article is <i>as large as it will get</i>, because there isn't much to speak about the term except: 1.Where the term is mentioned 2.What territories the geographical term accounts for ans 3.Where is this term repeated - all of which are already in the article. My suggestion is to merge it, preferably to the <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duklja.html" title="Duklja">Duklja</a> article, which by the way, already contains a mention of the term. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 13:24, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> per iruka &amp; CrnaGora. My original idea was to merge the whole article to <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duklja.html" title="Duklja">Duklja</a>, but I won't do it now when there's a separate article. --<a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxEquilibrium_609b.html" title="User:PaxEquilibrium">PaxEquilibrium</a> 11:29, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> for 2 reasons. 1) procedural: there no notice on the article suggesting it's up for deletion -- perhaps the stealth is part of the deletion agenda?? 2) substantive: there is/was a Red Croatia, it is well documented in the article, which is well-referenced as these things go, and is admitted by the nominator. The fact that the nominator believes a great part of the article (mostly dealing with modern (mis)uses of the term) belongs elsewhere doesn't provide grounds for deleting the historically valid parts. If you believe things ought to be moved: be <a href="../../../b/o/l/WP%7EBOLD_e2a0.html" title="WP:BOLD">bold</a> and move them, don't delete the parts we all think ought to remain. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 01:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per above. Also, because it does exist as a political concept. <a href="../../../c/r/n/User%7ECrnaGora_f348.html" title="User:CrnaGora">--Crna Gora</a> 02:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst Red Croatia encompasses the territory of the three Southern duchies, it seems to be a distinct geographical reference separate from the three individual duchies &amp; thus deserves it's own article. Also, the article is well referenced. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarinko_7cb2.html" title="User:Marinko">iruka</a> 02:31, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b>, I have completed the steps of the AFD nomination as of now. The article has an AFD notice which points to this discussion and this discussion's internal links work.

<li><b>Keep</b> no valid reason for deletion given, perhaps the nominators comments should be moved to the articles discussion page. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 09:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> The article fulfils all of the primary notability criteria.

<dd><b>Comment</b> You make it sound like any article which is on Wikipedia NEEDS to have global notability before it should even be considered as a valid article, regardless of content that might actually be valid and serving a purpose. Sure, I agree that most articles need to be notable to some extent, and some with masses of content are as useful as a blank page, but given there are tons of school articles on Wikipedia that maybe only a handful of people know about, this does have quite a bit more useful information to the passing reader. My nomination of Weak Keep wasn't because I feel it deserves to stay, but because it contains an amount of content which gives it better grounds to remain. <a href="../../../b/u/n/User%7EBungle44_50ba.html" title="User:Bungle44">Bungle44</a> 18:40, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this entry. This entry is the first for a UK ultimate team and one of only four entries for <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_teams.html#International" title="Ultimate teams">Ultimate teams#International</a> i.e. teams outside the USA, of which there are thousands in existence. Until more teams and national associations create entries it is difficult to demonstrate the notability of this article. The entry on Ultimate (sport) gives the impression that Ultimate is only played in North America, which is far from the case. This article describes the longest established, one of the most successful and internationally known teams in the UK. If high profile Ultimate teams are not suitable for inclusion that is understandable, in which case all should be deleted. Apologies for any bad wikiquette. This is my first discussion.

<li><b>Delete</b> It's a minor minor minor league sport. Non notable. It's about as noteworthy as the local boys softball team. Tomstdenis 14:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In which case, delete all Ultimate-related pages. Presumably the presence of <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_%28sport%29.html" title="Ultimate (sport)">Ultimate (sport)</a> establishes the noteworthiness of the sport. Ultimate is an Official sport of the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Games_2e2c.html" title="World Games">World Games</a> as are ten-pin bowling, ju-jitsu, karate, korfball, netball, racquetball, rugby, squash and sumo. The <a href="../../../u/l/t/Ultimate_Players_Association_fe94.html" title="Ultimate Players Association">Ultimate Players Association</a> has around 25,000 registered members in the USA and there are tens of thousands of players across the rest of the world. Robmitch 17:25, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Soccer (Football to the rest of the world) is also in Wikipedia. Doesn't mean the local kids league should be in Wikipedia. Ask yourself this, why is it important that anyone know about this particular ultimate team? You're confusing notability with character or standing. Speaking as someone who voted <b>against</b> keeping a vanity page put up about myself, there is a difference between the two. Just because you're (or in this case the team is) not notable enough to warrant a wiki page doesn't mean they're bad people or suck or whatever. It just means that in an ENCYCLOPEDIA it's not useful information. Tomstdenis 17:40, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Happy to accept those points, and if entries for individual Ultimate teams are to be considered non-notable, then fine, delete this and the other entries for Ultimate teams. This particular team is the longest standing in the UK and has an international reputation. Perhaps that is "character or standing" as you suggest, in which case fine, delete it (and the others!). I just wanted to give some context to ensure an informed decision could be made. I read your earlier 'Delete' vote as an objection to Ultimate as a "minor minor minor league sport. Non notable" and I considered this worth refuting. Reading it again, perhaps you accept the notability of the sport, but not of this team.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Bingo. I'm not arguing that we keep/delete other pages. I just picked this page at random from the AfD archive, read the page and offered my vote. Should other non-notable ultimate team pages be deleted? OF COURSE! Nominated them for an AfD if you haven't already. Again, please don't construe "non-notable" as a negative character quality. The vast majority of things people hold dear (family, possessions, etc) are non-notable in the context of an encyclopedia. Having to admit to the world that you yourself are non-notable is most fun hehehehehe&#160;;-) Tomstdenis 18:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> ...but telling the people you'll be playing against at World Championships next year that they are non-notable is likely to be less than fun, therefore I'll let others mominate other teams for an AfD! Of course I accept your points on non-notability. If I come across as emotionally invested in keeping this entry, I really am not. Perfectly happy for the decision to be taken in the usual way, by the published criteria. Robmitch 18:09, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For information, I credited myself earlier as the author of this entry. In fact, I was alerted to the fact that a stub existed, created by someone outside the team, some time ago and I added to it to substantially create the current entry. That's not of interest, but just for clarity as you mentioned vanity pages. Robmitch 17:57, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>There appears to be a conflict of interest here, and I do not feel that this topic is worthy of its own article on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Do not delete this topic</b>. I am the author of this topic, though I am not a "Good Blade". I am not attempting to advertise for this organisation, but I am a friend, which is why the article is so detailed, so perhaps I am bias. Please allow me to make this topic more objective, rather than deleting it straight away. I only referenced MySpace because at the time of writing it was the only source avaliable, however, Good Blades has expanded considerably since, now with its own website, as well as occuring on other sites. I shall reference these also if you wish.</li>

It does not outright advertise The Good Blades.

<dd>Yes, the notability aspect is important. Furthermore, Hoodooloo, I have reason to believe that you are not who you claim you are (a "Dr Harold Denver") on your profile page. Have you signed up to contribute to this discussion because you are in some way affiliated with the Good Blades? Wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion, nor for promotion of your friends. Reading the National Gazette, it is clear that it has no more credibility as a news source than an online blog. I also found no record of Lloyd Brown's supposed shortlisting for the motor-writing prize -- does the claim simply mean that he entered the competition? I'm not here to undermine the possible future success of the Good Blades, nor their writing, but the Wikipedia entry represents a mis-use of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerrencethetractor_e636.html" title="User:Terrencethetractor">Terrencethetractor</a> 17:02, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I agree with the two non-deleteters. The author should be given a chance to meet <a href="../../../n/m/g/WP%7ENMG_d058.html" title="WP:NMG">WP:NMG</a> protocol and provide a wider range of citation. I myself have only just read one of the Good Blades articles at www.nationalgazette.org, which they also referenced on their wikipedia page. Would this not count as example of noteability? If it is not enough evidence, the author, or someone, should be given a period of time (30 days?) to find and add more citings, rather than just myspace. stellabong, 22:41 23 January 2007. <small>— stellabong (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stellabong_5eb7.html" title="Special:Contributions/stellabong">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small> <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShadowHalo_6b04.html" title="User:ShadowHalo">ShadowHalo</a> 05:27, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Delete</s> Comment</b>. After seeing the right version, I don't necessarily see anything notable about it, as middle schools generally are not inherently notable. I'll look over it though.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Please, when you see silly things in an article, look at the history. Sometime after the revision as of 03:13, 7 November 2006 by Mrsparker9 , vandals changed it from a school with 60 girls to a school operated by 2 boys who have only 1 girl student locked in the basement. I will try and copy the last good text to replace what is in the present vandalized version, rather than reverting to a version lacking the AFD tagging. Then I will remove the Hoax tag. Speedy delete is completely unjustified if based on the vandal's version. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Added sources and removed the vandalism. We usually do not have articles for middle schools, but this one has an innovative program and has influenced other schools in the area to also adopt single sex education. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:09, 23 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've removed the hoax tag, yet I don't think any of the added references are done from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>, although rejected by the community, indicated that a school needs to have some media coverage or be historicaly important in order to be kept - something that simply can't be achieved by a small private school. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 19:14, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Now that it's been fixed I guess there isn't any reason to delete it except for notability. I'll leave the notability of the school for others to decide (because if it hasn't been in the news, I personally don't find it notable.) But it is slightly spammy... "with the school being so small, it gives students a chance to know their teachers personally and the chance to make friendships that will last a life time." is in no way encyclopedic. I would vote to get rid of it, or rewrite the biased information. <a href="../../../n/e/k/User%7ENekohakase_1540.html" title="User:Nekohakase">Nekohakase</a> 23:29, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

That was removed with the rational of, "<i>Deletion message deleted, although if not satisfied with my reasoning, you can put the message up again.

<p>An article about an academic facility for American students studying in Paris. First of all, there isn't a sourced word in the article. Second, I can't see how it is at all notable. Its only real claim in this direction is that the building represents "a crucial and vibrant link between the academic communities of The United States and France," but it seems to me that even if such a link existed and could be verified, that would make the PROGRAMS there notable and not the structure itself. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 17:01, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>The scope of this article is far too broad to be useful or encyclopedic. Seeking to list every film, TV show, music video, or computer game that has ever shown an NYPD officer is going to result in a 500K-article of dubious value. Why is such an article interesting or important?</p>
<p>The problem is that you can include anything from <i><a href="../../../l/a/w/Law_%26_Order_27ea.html" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i>, which is entirely about the NYPD, to a film about something else altogether in which you catch an NYPD in one frame. There's no way in this list to distinguish media ABOUT the NYPD from those that simple mention it. In short, this article is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKane5187_315f.html" title="User:Kane5187">Dylan</a> 17:07, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Exactly, but who's going to be the arbiter of what qualifies as "notable material" -- i.e. material that portrays the NYPD "enough" to be included?

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Unworkable non-encyclopedic list; even if the answer to the nominator's question is that the article is "interesting" and "important", those are not criteria to keep.

<li><b>Keep provided article is referenced and restricted</b> The article should clearly be limited to listing links to Wiki articles which <i>notably</i> mention the NYPD in a fictional context. Merely appearing in one frame, as the nominator suggests, would be insufficient for inclusion in this type of list. It has to be a notable, verifiable appearance mentioned in the article. In addition, the article is currently poorly referenced. So my keep vote is conditional on the article providing better references and making clear that it is restricted to article which notably, verifiably include a fictional version of the NYPD. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 18:41, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

Given how often the NYPD is portrayed (in a notable context) in fiction, the topic deserves a separate article. I do agree, however, that the article needs serious cleanup. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 20:38, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>As I read it, <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> clearly and repeatedly rules against synthesis and interpretation <i>to advance a position</i>. This is what sets apart normal Wikipedia writing (which, short of a copyvio, always involves unique synthesis and analysis of available information) - it's research, but not <i>original</i> research. This article clearly has no barrow to push, and I would disagree that WP:OR is violated here. --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 03:07, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>If it's just a list (as it currently is), there is not much (or any) synthesis really required. However, if it's to be made into a full article, some synthesis will be required, but it need not be particularly novel. For instance, the "History" section of any article about a country, city, etc. is <i>somewhat</i> synthesized. However, for the most part, it is only stylistic synthesis so as not to plagiarize from original sources. I'm not sure what kind of synthesis you have in mind. <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:26, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Maybe make it a section titled "The NYPD in popular culture"? It is pretty prevalent, and the portrayals themselves are interestingly varied, as are the NYPD's reaction to them. For example, the game <a href="../../../n/e/w/True_Crime%7E_New_York_City_6819.html" title="True Crime: New York City">True Crime: New York City</a> depicts a fictional undercover NYPD officer. The game comes with a small card that states (more or less) "The content of this game in no way reflects the actions, policies, or views of the New York City Police Department." It's fairly interesting that they felt the need to distance themselves this way from the game (On the other hand, <a href="../../../s/t/r/True_Crime%7E_Streets_of_LA_1cf4.html" title="True Crime: Streets of LA">True Crime: Streets of LA</a>, which depicted the LAPD, did not come with such a disclaimer). It's stuff like that that is valid enough to discuss in a section of the main article, I think. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 21:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Merge</b> to <a href="../../../n/y/p/NYPD_fb97.html" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> the section on the NYPD Movie/TV Unit. This would be just like any other "In popular culture" article, except the scope is too big and practically I doubt all the listed works will have their fictional portrayals described and sourced. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 23:08, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Probably needs a move to a more "major representations in popular culture" kind of title. I think this kind of list article is reasonable enough, though like most lists of this kind, its prone to being an inane trivia magnet that needs regular cleanup and rigorous patrol of weeding out of trivial references and speculationI don't think there are that many substantial NYPD shows etc. to make this page unwieldy <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:11, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Firstly, I don't think the list will be anywhere near as large and unwieldy as the nominator speculates - if so, why isn't it already? Because people have stuck to firm portrayals such as police procedural TV shows and crime movies, not single appearances of NYPD officers in episodes of <i>Seinfeld</i> or <i>Friends</i>. Regarding the notability of sources, if they're kept to those notable enough for a Wikipedia article (by which I don't mean "inclusion is an indicator of notability", but just that redlinks should be pruned regularly). --<a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 02:53, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep if de-listified</b> Frankly, I don't think that the article in it's current form is appropriate as an encyclopedia article. If re-worked to an analysis of <i>how</i> the NYPD has been represented in fiction, with well-cited references, then this article could have a fighting chance. Otherwise, I vote for a <b>strong delete</b>. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAervanath_c35e.html" title="User:Aervanath">Aervanath</a> 05:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>BTW, I have moved the movie/tv unit section into the NYPD article where it belongs. If this article is reworked, then a discussion of how the movie/tv unit influences the nypd's portrayal in fiction would be appropriate, rather than a simple description of what the unit's job is. <a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAervanath_c35e.html" title="User:Aervanath">Aervanath</a> 05:17, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - I can think of plenty of reasons why someone might be interested in fictional depictions of the NYPD and the article itself is easily verifiable. Since the <a href="../../../n/y/p/NYPD_fb97.html" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> is easily notable on its own, and this article is too long to merge, I think it can have its own article. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:59, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, which is why I went beyond the shorthand and explained my position, unless you'd like for me to retype everything the nom said and then add in my comment.

There are no secondary sources pertaining to the subject within the article, and I haven't found anything on the web that is non-trivial.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I expected this to be easy to source considering how often <a href="../../../a/n/d/Andrew_Sullivan_6a55.html" title="Andrew Sullivan">Andrew Sullivan</a> and <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jonathan_Rauch_fdec.html" title="Jonathan Rauch">Jonathan Rauch</a> blather about it. But as the nom said, not so easy. It appears their popularity has tapered as of late, and much of the direct sources of notability have been sucked away by media companies who don't like to host their own content after three months. However, using <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 3, "<i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>", we have reliable sources that attest this has occurred. First, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Press_7ad1.html" title="New York Press">New York Press</a> tells us that "<i>The <a href="../../../w/a/l/Wall_Street_Journal_599f.html" title="Wall Street Journal">WSJ</a>’s online <a href="../../../o/p/i/OpinionJournal.com_c98c.html" title="OpinionJournal.com">Opinion Journal</a> went even further, pulling in a piece by gay writer Paul Varnell on the gay conservative site Independent Gay Forum.</i>"<a href="http://www.nypress.com/15/20/news&amp;columns/signorile.cfm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nypress.com/15/20/news&amp;columns/signorile.cfm" rel="nofollow">[25]</a> I don't see an explicit date on that piece, but it says "<i><a href="../../../p/i/m/Pim_Fortuyn_0d35.html" title="Pim Fortuyn">Pim Fortuyn</a>, who was brutally assassinated last week</i>", so that gives us an idea. Second, the <a href="../../../o/n/t/Ontario_Consultants_on_Religious_Tolerance_ad4f.html" title="Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance">Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance</a> are using a citation to a piece from the Independent Gay Forum titled "<i>Punishing gays under Islam</i>" which, according to their citation,<a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_isla1.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_isla1.htm" rel="nofollow">[26]</a> was published in the Chicago Free Press on 21 October 2001. Chicago Free Press doesn't have their own Wikipedia article, but they do get their content republished by Lynn Conway at the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_of_Michigan_a8fd.html" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>,<a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Bailey/Chicago%20Free%20Press/Chicago%20Free%20Press%20EDITORIAL%208-09-06.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TS/Bailey/Chicago%20Free%20Press/Chicago%20Free%20Press%20EDITORIAL%208-09-06.htm" rel="nofollow">[27]</a> so they would pass <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> themselves (although it is never a requirement for any source to be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> enough to have its own article to nevertheless be used as a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>).

It's A reprinted from B, which is <b>exactly</b> what <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criterion 3 is asking for, and we have reliable source C that confirms they saw A reprint it from B.

Do you think they are not a reliable source? Unless you are proposing <i>that they are presenting false information</i>, then we can safely say that A reprinted from B: Chicago Free Press reprinted a piece from the Independent Gay Forum, which is no more and no less than precisely what WP:WEB is asking us to find proof of. And if you reread criterion 3, it does <i>not</i> require two as a minimum. You are thinking of <i>criterion 1</i>. Criterion 3 says clearly: "<i>The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster</i>". Just one: <b>a</b> medium. So either of these instances would stand alone. I am not defending the contents of the article, just the notability.

<p>The article is about a not-notable book. It does not list the author, sources, plot or much else, and the page has the wrong title. The book is called "Olivia Is Death With Grey Eyes" but the page is "Death <b>Has</b> Grey Eyes" so it is a wrong page even. Regarding inbound links, it is only linked to from <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_The_Shadow_stories_bb49.html" title="List of The Shadow stories">List of The Shadow stories</a> where most of the other titles do not have pages so I dont know why this book deserves a separate bad of this kind <a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPernambuco_dde4.html" title="User:Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> 17:23, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: For me, what will decide this is <i>does this band have nontrivial coverage in multiple reliable sources?</i> A listing saying that the band played a gig at a certain place and time is <i>not</i> "nontrivial" coverage. A couple sources already added to the article is a good start. I don't think we should base our decision off the early content of this article, but rather on the number and nature of sources available. If there are enough good sources on this, the article will improve over time. Also, I hate to crystal ball, but with an upcoming record, the amount of coverage this band is getting is only going to increase over time. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 20:13, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am new to editing/contributing to Wikipedia but am hoping to be able to add the necessary components to this article so that it may be considered acceptable.

In the interest of improving Wikipedia and expanding it's depth and breadth, articles such as these should be kept and users should be encouraged to improve them.

<li>Oh dear.

<li><b>Keep</b> as a notable act of terrorism, apparently the worst in 3 years of the war. So the crystal ball assures you that these deaths will be quickly forgotten? How did that work out with the <a href="../../../l/u/b/Luby%27s_massacre.html" title="Luby's massacre">Luby's massacre</a> in 1991 where 23 died? That article even lists the names of each dead person. Are mass killings outside the U.S. inherently non-notable and those in the U.S. inherently notable, or do we look at the coverage in international reliable sources? <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:19, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I would actually consider your mentioned event notable for the law it passed, not just the fact that it happened. It doesn't look like it gets much attention, anyway. What I'm saying for this article is that this bombing, while certainly on a larger scale than those before, is not an isolated event by any means. What makes this bombing inherently notable apart from the death toll? What about this is so important that it needs its own article? I could actually apply the same logic to Luby's massacre, but that's for another time. At the very least, should this article be kept, it could use a better title. – <a href="../../../s/o/m/User%7ESomeguy0830_d67f.html" title="User:Someguy0830">Someguy0830</a> (<a href="../../../s/o/m/User_talk%7ESomeguy0830_3c31.html" title="User talk:Someguy0830">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Someguy0830_4a47.html" title="Special:Contributions/Someguy0830">C</a>) 19:52, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Edison. Any major act of terrorism deserves to be documented; just because there are regular bombings in Baghdad doesn't mean they don't all deserve coverage.

The "Western Frontier" deserves an article, and the need for coverage of it as an integral subject is not met by the other articles mentioned, since they are only in small part about the Western Frontier and include much that is not about it. If this one reads like written by a junior high student, so do half the other articles on Wikipedia, so it will fit right in, and benefit from collaborative editing as do other articles.

<li><s><b>Delete and salt</b></s>. First off, the title is horrible. If nothing else, it should be retitled as "The <u><i>American</i></u> Western Frontier", but that doesn't get rid of the other problems with the title. Depending upon which time frame you choose in American history, the "Western Frontier" could be anything from what is now <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a> to frontier Alaska. Then on to the article itself, which is just a bunch of vague assertions and rather random events. There should probably be a good basic overview on this part of American history, but it should be titled something like Post-Civil War expansion of the United States, which would gives a brief overview on each topic, and would then link to the main articles on the <a href="../../../m/e/x/Mexican_American_War_4afd.html" title="Mexican American War">Mexican American War</a>, the <a href="../../../m/o/r/Mormon_Pioneers_48eb.html" title="Mormon Pioneers">Mormon Pioneers</a>, the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Gold_Rush_e2d6.html" title="California Gold Rush">California Gold Rush</a>, etc. <i><a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlankVerse_b65f.html" title="User:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="green">Blank</font></sup></a><a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlankVerse_add2.html" title="User talk:BlankVerse"><sup><font color="#F88017">Verse</font></sup></a></i> 04:20, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I was just about to post something similar - there might be a case for something like a timeline or a very broad synopsis, but it would have to be very heavily wiki-linked and let the individual articles speak for themselves. Even then it would be very difficult to keep the scope limited and the POV neutral, since there are thousands of articles about the American West during this period, many of which are unflattering to at least one of the primary parties. Whatever the result might be, its not <i>this</i> article which has no citations, is full of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">OR</a> and many parts fail <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <b>Delete</b> this version, and see if anybody is brave enough to try again. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 06:00, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, many journals are published, and a large collection is available on line as "Womens diaries of the western journey". Manuscript sources are problematic, and work with them would normally be considered OR here. But I do not see how the article depends on any of this,for everything described is well-known history, and any 2 good american history textbooks would do as the sources. One is already given. Many individual parts could also be sourced, &amp; for Chief Josephs famous speech not to be given a specific reference is not careful work.</dd>

<p>Per <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html#Criteria_for_products_and_services" title="WP:CORP">the relevant notability guideline</a> for products and services sold by companies, products are notable only if they have been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works or is so popular that the trade name suffers from <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genericization.html" title="Genericization">genericization</a>. Of those two conditions, the second obviously doesn't apply. Regarding the first condition, the <a href="../../../a/l/c/Alcohol_120%25.html" title="Alcohol 120%">Alcohol 120%</a> page does not assert the existence of any independent, non-trivial published works discussing the product.

<dd><b>Comment:</b> I guess the key question is whether at least two of those sources count as "non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself." If so, then Alcohol 120% is notable under either the current <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> or the proposed <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. If not, then it's not notable under either guideline. I think download sites like <a href="http://www.tucows.com/preview/287216" class="external text" title="http://www.tucows.com/preview/287216" rel="nofollow">the tucows page you link</a> are pretty clearly trivial and I question whether they're independent, but I'm curious what people think about on-line reviews such as <a href="http://www.itp.net/reviews/details.php?id=2959" class="external text" title="http://www.itp.net/reviews/details.php?id=2959" rel="nofollow">ITP.net</a> Thoughts?

Are you seriously arguing that <i>that</i> page constitutes a "non-trivial published" reference to Alcohol 120%? If not, why add it? I'm open to the question of whether the non-download sites constitute non-trivial published references and interested in hearing some reasoned opinions on the subject. On the other hand, I note that three of your links come from the same site, toptenreviews.com, and most of the others are one paragraph summaries on shareware download sites. On the gripping hand, if it's easy to find paper articles discussing Alcohol, go find a couple and add them to the article. That would far and away be the best result -- it would improve the article <i>and</i> resolve this debate.

<dd>Even in case one or two of these might be considered trivial or non-notable, I believe the rest are a very solid evidence of passing that criteria. Toptenreviews.com contains subsites relating to different software types, in this case, CD burning and game copying software. I am concerned that although these reviews are enough to establish notability, that shouldn't be used as references since they have a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point of view</a>. <b><span style="background:#000"><a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichaelas10_bbb3.html" title="User:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">Michaelas10</span></a> <a href="../../../m/i/c/User_talk%7EMichaelas10_7a56.html" title="User talk:Michaelas10"><span style="color:#fff">(Talk)</span></a></span></b> 21:10, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

An individual unfamiliar with the product should be able to find information about it on Wikipedia, which, let's remember, is not paper. Furthermore, though the article does need some expansion and clean-up, its exstistence does not detract from Wikipedia's image or authority.

<li><b>Keep</b> This should <i>not</i> be moved to Comixpedia, though it should certainly have an entry there. It is exactly the sort of cultural history article that adds worth to Wikipedia. The comic ran to several hundred strips (I have almost 200 just from September 1987 to the end of 1989, and it reportedly ran for over twice that period). Characters from it appeared in the San Bernardino County Sun, TC-128 and Carousel News &amp; Trader (<a href="http://www.carousels.com/articles.php" class="external text" title="http://www.carousels.com/articles.php" rel="nofollow">originally</a> the Carousel Trader). At the time it was most active - before the web which the WP:WEB guidelines cover was even invented! - it was distributed on <a href="../../../c/o/m/CompuServe_944e.html" title="CompuServe">CompuServe</a>, <a href="../../../q/u/a/Quantum_Link_c93c.html" title="Quantum Link">Quantum Link</a> and <a href="../../../g/e/n/GEnie_e7c7.html" title="GEnie">GEnie</a>, three well-known early online service providers. It had a separate section on at least the last of these. The only reason we still have any of it now is that people thought the comic worthy enough to keep archives of it from over fifteen years ago. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 05:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>To elaborate, I think the article really lacks references. However, it does seem to be a very early online comic, quite possibly the first, and that makes it notable. Furthermore, the nomination refers to websites, a historically later albeit related matter; my common sense tends towards keeping.

<li><b>Comment</b>: As the article stands, it's a clear delete, however, it looks like the article could be improved if GreenReaper can better track down sources. I'd be satisfied with 1) Keeping this with notability and unsourced concern templates for a few months and then revisiting the deletion issue if necessary, or 2) Deleting it without prejudice toward recreation, moving it to GreenReaper's user space so it can be improved, and then back to mainspace when it is more properly sourced. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 18:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I disagree quite strongly with your assertion that it is a clear delete. If a topic is worthy (and being the first comic regularly distributed online plus having its own section in GEnie is sufficient for me) but the <i>article</i> is not good enough, that just means the article needs to be improved - which has been the case for just about all Wikipedia articles at some time or another. This one certainly <i>can</i> be improved, and I had intended to do so myself several months ago (that's why I took the time to convert all the images that I have from Commodore format) but managing WikiFur, writing up my reports on a few conventions and the imminent release of <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_Vista_dc35.html" title="Windows Vista">Windows Vista</a> have intervened. The latter has not yet happened, which is why I'm still busy.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>I'm not really sure where you're coming from with "more properly sourced", either. An interview with the author taken at the time of the comic seem like a perfectly acceptable secondary source (the fact that the interview took place at all is also a measure of notability), and the comic strips and website are good examples of primary sources that can be used to confirm it. It would be nice to have specific references to confirm the specific claims about publication made in the interview. However, <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> states that such information can be used as long as it is not contentious - and they're hardly claiming to have been published in the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 19:41, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Since when was a bulletin board a reliable source? Its essentially self-publishing, which is one under vanity-press.

<dd>As far as I know, that was pretty much the best there was online at the time, aside from <a href="../../../n/s/f/NSFNet_e3ed.html" title="NSFNet">NSFNet</a> . . . and yes, I'd love to have more offline coverage, but it's hard to see who outside their community would have covered one guy "uploading" comics to an esoteric, mostly text-based service that <i>maybe</i> one in a thousand North Americans knew existed at the time. It took twenty years for online content creators to be recognized by <i><a href="../../../t/i/m/Time_%28magazine%29.html" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>. Ironically, given that BBS's <i>were</i> community-run, the closest equivalent nowadays would probably be an interview by <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikinews.html" title="Wikinews">Wikinews</a>.&#160;:-)</dd>
<dd>Another confirmation of material mentioned in the interview - Spiffy Spring Special '95 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.info/msg/8c42013c5b53f4ad?dmode=source" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.comics.info/msg/8c42013c5b53f4ad?dmode=source" rel="nofollow">is mentioned</a> in a rec.arts.comics.info post, and T.H.E. FOX is listed as one of the comics featured within it. I haven't seen any further mentions of the comic, though the publisher has a few other publications that are available online at Mile High Comics. Note that the comic is not notable because it was particularly <b>good</b> (it's certainly funny, but Joe was not a professional artist at the time, and it is clearly outclassed in technical quality by more recent work), but because it is the first that we can confirm as being regularly distributed online. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreenReaper_5514.html" title="User:GreenReaper">GreenReaper</a> 04:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Again, you have no proof that it was the <i>first</i>. No independent investigation or reliable sources which state it as such. A Wikinews interview would have the same problem. I realise we aren't going to have a published peer-review scientific or historical paper on the likely "first online distributed webcomic". But something independently verified and published by a reputable publisher or collator of cartoons (perhaps a large comic book house) should be possible. The problem is that esoteric here means obscure, and obscure for webcomics generally means non-notable. - <a href="../../../f/-/m/User%7EF-m-t_02fb.html" title="User:F-m-t">Francis Tyers</a> <a href="../../../f/-/m/User_talk%7EF-m-t_cc17.html" title="User talk:F-m-t">·</a> 12:26, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. It's better now that sources have been added along with some support for notability. However, being cited by less-notable venues doesn't really add a lot to the article. Would change to "weak keep" if better (i.e. more notable) references were provided. WarCry is indeed a moderately well-known gaming site. The main issue for me here is whether it's notable enough for an article, as determined by overall impact on the broader gaming community. --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 21:22, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep and stubify</b> - 1.5M Ghits, and this is a rather well-known network of fansites in the computer gaming space. Based on the comments from a couple of the commenters above, I have to assume that some who voted delete are simply unfamiliar with the most popular sites in computer gaming. WarCry is rather venerable and while this article could be improved (and I would advocate stubification) I really can't imagine deleting it. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 14:54, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>You need to sort of prove its popularity with some independent references. And only a small percentage of those 1.5M google hits actually refer to this fan site. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarasmusine_675c.html" title="User:Marasmusine">Marasmusine</a> 15:04, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The above statement is an inaccurate assumption. A quick statistical sampling of the top four pages of google for "warcry" turn up links that are 100% related to the site. The top four pages of google! While I'm comfortable admitting that <i>some</i> percentage of the 1.5M links are unrelated, I don't think that the percentage is "small" (whatever that means). Given that none of the core policies of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> are violated with this article, it seems obvious that it should stay as a matter of common sense. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Google News uses it as a news source. This on its own doesn't <i>prove</i> notability, but they do have their own exclusive interviews with various MMO studios.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Seems like a pretty significant site, like IGN &amp; Stratics. I added a couple of references to the article, mostly about other websites utilizing its (WarCry) as sources and the like. Also, it;s significant enough that they've been officially recognized (and somewhat partnerized) by at least one of the games they're covering (Lineage II - I added a reference to that too). And I also stubified it so that it gets more attention and hopefully gets expanded in the future by someone who knows more about the company's history. <a href="../../../s/h/r/User%7EShrumster_69ea.html" title="User:Shrumster">Shrumster</a> 19:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's a purely subjective observation that has nothing to do with either notability, or any of the policies pertaining to whether it should be included. It also demonstrates that this voter has only looked at the surface-level of the site: in addition, it is comprised of a large number of game-specific sites that are part of its network, each of which has its own additional content. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:14, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result was delete. On contributions from *cough* very new members of the community, they were all suprisingly coherent and some even centered on wikipedia policies or guidelines. Refreshing. However, this debate was still only loosely structured, and the main argument appears to be regarding the strip's satisif-ication of the web material guideline. This hinges on the <b>Web Cartoonist's Choice</b> awards, and the consensus (as demostrated here) amoung the more established editors is that it does not count as a a notable independent award. This is quite arbitrary, and I've raised a section on the talk page of the guideline regarding this: <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html#Web_Cartoonist.27s_Choice_award" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)#Web Cartoonist's Choice award</a><br />

<li><b>Abstain</b>, Well, "wikipedia's" requirements of "notability" basically exclude any and all web references including reviews and notables such as an Awards nomination, etc... a bit elitist... but slightly understandable because of the intent of which Wikipedia opperates... Sadly it's highly restrictive. In any case, I think Wikifur does not have this rigidness of "notability". Is there a Wiki for Webcomics (not comixpedia)? If not, there should be, without this "notability" rigidness... there needs to be a version of Wiki the is more inclusive of various Internet popularity. --<a href="../../../f/e/s/User%7EFesworks_ea8e.html" title="User:Fesworks">Fesworks</a> 05:00, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

Comixpedia has an article on this comic <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" rel="nofollow">[47]</a> that was originally based on this Wikipedia article.

<li>Comixpedia doesn't use Wiki technology, it's HTML I believe. Also I agree comepletely that "Notability is not the same as verifiability." which does seem to be the case with Wikipedia... It seems Wikipedia just wants to be an limited encyclopedia, excluding whatever doesn't seem to be in print or a favorite of the higher Wiki Editors. It seems very selective. Not just talking about this article, but numerous others. Some articles chosen for deletion make my head spin for the "lack of notability", even though a few simple click will prove you wrong because there it is, readily available on the net. Perhaps I'll print out a version and mail it in to you guys. But whatever. There are other reference sites less anal that I choose to use instead now. --<a href="../../../f/e/s/User%7EFesworks_ea8e.html" title="User:Fesworks">Fesworks</a> 21:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)<a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Dan_and_Mab%27s_Furry_Adventures" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>

<li><b>Keep</b> Notability is not the same as verifiability. The two concepts are often confused as indicated [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability/Arguments#Arguments_against_deleting_articles_for_non-notability|here" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>] and [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability#The_primary_notability_criterion|here" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Uncle_G/On_notability#The_primary_notability_criterion|here" rel="nofollow">[50]</a>]. Reading between the lines, Francis Tyers sounds like he's arguing based upon the fame/lack of fame of the comic in question - but this is not a wikipedia criteria. Though it may be a technicality, a large amount of material exists in the site's forum, which though hosted locally was produced by multiple sources that are independent of the site itself. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and DMFA is obviously not <a href="../../../n/f/t/WP%7ENFT_d510.html" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a>. I see no reason for deletion. ANTIcarrot 07:58, 25 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For clarity's sake, the forum is not hosted on the same server as the comic. In fact, neither was the old forum, nor the backup copy thereof kept for reference purposes. And all three were managed by independant people - although I'll admit the new forum is run by the author's relative. (since I host the backup, I must admit a touch of bias, and hence abstain from voting.) -- Llearch 15:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Notability rules and their application have been questioned often enough, and it's clear that they're hostile to webbased publications. Slapping well-known webcomics with semantics is a disgrace, and I don't believe that this is the aim of Wikipedia. DMFA has been nominated for an award and reviewed online multiple times. The comic is notable enough to be able to generate a healthy amount of monthly donations and has a dedicated forum with 450+ members. It's definitely notable enough for this single entry, and removing it would do more damage than good. --Sid 3050 20:56, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Part of what makes Sabrina Online notable is that it has created a universe in which many other authors have created stories and comics. In addition to the previously posted more traditional measures of notability, <i><b>having defined a sub-genre</b></i> certainly seems to denote notability to me. <a href="../../../t/g/i/User%7ETGIF_d943.html" title="User:TGIF">TGIF</a> 10:28, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> You're kidding, right? Aside from being one of the THE furry webcomics, it has won the 2001 <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.ccawards.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">Cartoonist's Choice Award</a> (Best Romantic Comic) and has been nominated in 2002 (Best Anthropomorphic Comic), 2003 (Outstanding Romantic Comic) and 2004 (Outstanding Anthropomorphic Comic). As per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (which is already hostile towards webcomics in my eyes), this IS an indicator for notability (won one award, nominated in multiple years). --Sid 3050 21:13, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> What happened to the Ursa Major article was just absurd. Comments in the deletion log like "furcruft", "I hate furries", "furry spam" make it clear that a strong undercurrent of bigotry was a motivating factor. Some people *really* don't like the furry subculture. I can understand this personally but that attitude has no place in an encyclopedia, period. Notability standards should be evenhanded. <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stan_Sakai_3200.html" title="Stan Sakai">Stan Sakai</a>'s article lists his Ursa Major award nominations. <a href="../../../s/a/m/Samuel_Conway_1c0f.html" title="Samuel Conway">Samuel Conway</a>'s page also mentions the award. The <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurofurence.html" title="Eurofurence">Eurofurence</a> page also has mention of the award as does the strip pages for <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newshounds.html" title="Newshounds">Newshounds</a> and <a href="../../../f/a/u/Faux_Pas_%28webcomic%29_baaf.html" title="Faux Pas (webcomic)">Faux Pas (webcomic)</a>. In other words, this is an award that means something. It just happens to be an award for something that enough wikipedia users and editors just don't like, perhaps are offended by, that objectivity is going out the window. If the award is notable, so is the author and his body of work. <a href="../../../t/m/l/User%7ETMLutas_c6d7.html" title="User:TMLutas">TMLutas</a> 02:24, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The three comments you quote from the deletion log were far after very valid and substantial arguments had already been made from which the closing administrator could have easily referenced in deciding to delete the article. The arguments for keep did not address the problem of reliably sourced coverage of the awards outside of its community. There does not seem to be anything procedurally wrong with the removal of that article as being on a non-notable subject. If you disagree you are always welcome to put it up for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 19:08, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I just looked at the Ursa Major AfD and can't help but agree with the absurdity of its deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> unless rewritten. Subject is notable, as per Ursa Major award (deletion of the awards page does not make the award non-notable, it merely means that the wiki page was poorly sourced), but the article lacks sufficient information to justify its existance.

<p>I could not find any sources (in English) that support the article's claim. When I first came across this article, it wasn't sourced at all.

Whether or not this process is notable enough to have a seperate article, I don't know.

This would seem to provide independent evidence that Studio Ironcat did indeed publish Namir Deiter. Whether Namir Dieter would have saved Studio Ironcat if it had been published sooner as the Ironcat Article speculated would seem to be a seperate question that can only be speculated upon rather than proved one way or the other.

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Comment</b>: The deletion log for the award contained very valid and substantial arguments from which the closing administrator could have easily referenced in deciding to delete the article. Some of the "I hate furries" comments that you are lumping together do not actually claim any bias against furries. There does not seem to be anything procedurally wrong with the removal of that article as being on a non-notable subject. If you disagree you are always welcome to put it up for <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>. The arguments for keep did not address the problem of reliably sourced coverage of the awards outside of its community in order to meet the guidelines of the encyclopedia making them wholly unconvincing (keep 'because people need to find this info somewhere' or 'because another article mentions it' are not valid criteria). In fact, the second argument presents a "notability creep" problem. If a notable subject relates to a non-notable one but notability is transferred in this manner, then if in the non-notable article (like this one) another non-notable subject is related, then this third article gets written referencing the second's "notability". <a href="../../../n/i/p/Nip_and_Tuck_4faa.html" title="Nip and Tuck">Nip and Tuck</a>, also submitted for AfD, is an example of this "notability creep" which is deriving its notability because Tales of the Questor won a supposedly notable award and both were written by the same author.

<p>I am new to wikipedia, but I started this article after seeing that there was no entry on Red Light Center. After starting with a two paragraphs, I have posted to the Red Light Center users forum to request that users who are familiar with wikipedia formats edit the article and add appropriate content. Since we have over 200,000 registered users, and since we are growing at about 40% per month, and since RLC has been featured everywhere from Wired to CNN, I think a wikipedia article is appropriate. That said, I am unclear how an article written and edited by people who use the software could be anything but original research. Since I am the creator, can I site myself when I give statistics? I can pull them from my database, which is how I report them to the press.

<dd>That's exactly the problem, and the Wikipedia-approved solution is to let somebody else write the article. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Life_f75c.html" title="Second Life">Second Life</a>, for example, has a page whose existence isn't controversial because it isn't written just by <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linden_Labs_539a.html" title="Linden Labs">Linden Labs</a>; there's a lot of journalists discussing the site, and even if editors of that page probably do include enthusiastic Residents, they don't have to speak for themselves but can quote those journalists.

<p>Notwithstanding its name, <i>Crap I drew on my lunch break</i> is a neat web comic, also available in self-published print form. Unfortunately, being neat is not one of Wikipedia's major content inclusion guidelines. There is some information in the WP article which is not on Comixpedia, which might be transwikied, but the essential facts are already available on Comixpedia. So far as I can tell, the article does not, and could not, be supported by independent non-trivial reporting of the <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> "notability is not subjective" type, and there's no way to verify the article beyond the trivial source that the cartoon itself represents. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 20:56, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I was the original author of this article; at the time of its creation it met the policy (or proposed policy) on the notability of webcomics, though I take it this policy has since been superseded by the stricter <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. The author of this webcomic will probably be aware of any third-party references to her work which would serve to establish <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> per Wikipedia's guidelines.

<p>I can find no evidence that these games are notable as Wikipedia defines it: "A topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject itself and each other." Therefore, I propose that we delete them. To avoid any perception of a conflict of interest or some kind of bias on my part, I will note that a) I tagged all of these and a few more for PROD; the tags were removed by various editors, which is why I've brought the debate here and b) these articles were brought to my attention after my deletion of Super Mario War as non-notable. <font color="#000000">♠<a href="../../../p/m/c/User%7EPMC_03a4.html" title="User:PMC">P</a></font><a href="../../../p/m/c/User_talk%7EPMC_cf58.html" title="User talk:PMC"><font color="#FF00FF">M</font></a><font color="#000000"><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Premeditated_Chaos_3dcc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Premeditated Chaos">C</a>♠</font> 21:28, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p><br />
This is precisely my point: Wikipedia's policies are very exacting, and if followed to the letter relatively few articles would survive your deletion policy! A lot, in fact *most* games do not have "multiple non-trivial published works" associated with them. And especially older games, like "Castle Adventure," which you've tagged for deletion, would've had no "professional recognition" whatsoever. By deleting these are articles you are helping no one. I think you should focus your energies on proper classification of articles (which you admins have been doing a good job of so far).</p>
<p>Consider this, in the optimal case, with "perfect" classification of all information on Wikipedia, there would be no need to delete articles, since people will always find what they are looking for. The less "perfect" our classification, the more articles we will need to delete in order to ensure that things are still easy to find. Information is very strongly classified on Wikipedia, as I see it, so only articles that are blatantly useless should be deleted. Mindthief 21:58, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I don't think these articles should be bundled together in one AfD. Unless I'm mistaken, all these games have in common is that they are games and that the nominator feels they're insufficiently notable. I don't see how that falls under the guidelines given <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html#How_to_list_multiple_related_pages_for_deletion" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">here</a>. <b>Relist individually</b>. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 22:21, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Relist a few at a time individually, please&#160;:(</b> Whilst the articles may have a common flaw, notability (at least so it seems at first glance), they are individual subjects which need individual attention. A similar AFD with wrestling moves a few days ago resulted in nothing more than a lot of noise and no consensus whatsoever. I wholeheartedly agree that there are too many non-notable web/casual/MMOG etc. games catching free traffic from WP, and intend listing several myself after becoming familiar with listing AFDs. However, I seriously doubt anything productive is going to come out of this group nomination - I tried looking at some games individually, but picking through websites takes time and effort. Please consider this. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuagmireDog_a5d9.html" title="User:QuagmireDog">QuagmireDog</a> 22:22, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, like QuagmireDog, I'd be quite willing to consider these articles for deletion individually, but putting them all together like this doesn't make for a useful discussion. <a href="../../../h/e/i/User%7EHeimstern_8a02.html" title="User:Heimstern">Heimstern Läufer</a> 22:27, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm in no position to comment on most of the titles you have nominated for deletion, but I can say that at least one title is a notable package. It is actively developed, has departed significantly from other related games, and is a very popular title in the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linux.html" title="Linux">Linux</a> community.

<p>Listcruft, plain and simple. Wikipedia isn't a guide to every little detail. A desciption of mini-games in general should be on the main <a href="../../../r/a/y/Rayman_Raving_Rabbids_f98f.html" title="Rayman Raving Rabbids">Rayman Raving Rabbids</a> article only. If people want to read about the mini-games, there is gaming sites for that. A popular mini-game series like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario_Party_69c6.html" title="Mario Party">Mario Party</a> has no list pages for it's games (to my knowledge at least), Rayman shouldn't be any exception. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobJ1981_7eb7.html" title="User:RobJ1981">RobJ1981</a> 21:35, 23 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

Also, per my reply to TrackerTV, I favor getting rid of (or balancing out) the article's Wii bias. We have articles on lists of mods and games with their own categories (Half-Life, WoW, ...). The Rabbids minigames came with the base game and are not fan-created. There's also nothing wrong with having separate articles on games like this, where the list can overwhelm the content of the main article. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_Havaname_2e6d.html" title="User:Idont Havaname">Idont Havaname</a> (<a href="../../../i/d/o/User_talk%7EIdont_Havaname_2580.html" title="User talk:Idont Havaname">Talk</a>) 05:58, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The 1037C articles need special handling, which is why there is a special project page just for them. Federal Standard 1037C is a public domain telecommunications dictionary, which was imported into Wikipedia a few years ago and lightly wikified (perhaps by bot, I'm not sure). In many cases the content in these little stub articles is more valuable than it first appears. Sometimes very little editing can turn them into good stubs. Other times, the content is best served by merging several related 1037C stubs into a single larger article. Sometimes they are best redirected to an existing article. Very rarely is AfD deletion an appropriate response. In this case, the article should clearly either be kept, or be merged into <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Personal_Telecommunications_c646.html" title="Universal Personal Telecommunications">Universal Personal Telecommunications</a>. Either way, it appears that the proponent of this AfD was misled by the article's poor formatting and the spam. I ask him to take another look at the article (which I have just wikified) and reconsider whether this AfD still seems appropriate.--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 03:22, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, but Uncle G, is there a reason that terms like this aren't part of a 1037C glossary or something similar, and a justification for wikifying the contents of an obscure (however widely applied) federal standard, when there are so many federal standards that could be so treated? Just askin'. --<a href="../../../d/h/a/User%7EDhartung_3c9c.html" title="User:Dhartung">Dhartung</a> | <a href="../../../d/h/a/User_talk%7EDhartung_8f0a.html" title="User talk:Dhartung">Talk</a> 05:06, 24 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's far from being the only case where editors expanded Wikipedia by adding lots of stubs containing public domain content. And one article per entry was simply the way that the editors who imported it chose to import it. As mentioned above, cleaning up the result has been an ongoing (and slowly progressing) project for several years. Feel free to help. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 13:08, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>The purpose isn't to produce a glossary article, but to expand Wikipedia's coverage of telecomm in general. The telecomm area of Wikipedia is in general sparse and underedited. Creating lots of stubs from a public domain source forms a "skeleton" of sorts that can be fleshed out later. What is lacking is a few editors with time to spare and solid background in telecomm engineering. Somebody will come along eventually...--<a href="../../../s/r/l/User%7ESrleffler_03c1.html" title="User:Srleffler">Srleffler</a> 17:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Undecided</b> - On the one hand, this is arguably trivia in its current form. On the other hand, the information presented in the article seems to indicate that there might be more significant meaning behind the existence of the aspiration.

<li><b>Speedy delete</b> If the permission to copy is bogus and this should be speedied as a copyvio.

<li><i>Comment</i> - most of the article text has been removed now, meaning it probably doesn't qualify as a copyvio.
