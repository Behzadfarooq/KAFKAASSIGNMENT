<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b> both. There have been a number of "keep" votes from anonymous users and entirely new users. Such votes are not always discounted, but due to the sheer number of them, I think that almost all of those votes come from the <i>same</i> person (for instance I cannot assume that it's a coincidence that at least three of the anonymous votes are from <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacksonville%2C_Florida_dcd8.html" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>?) All those votes have therefore been discounted as possible votes from <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppets</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 11:27, 4 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Not a speedy. He has a claim to notability (important position in three Florida political organizations, endorsements from U.S. congress people), but I would argue that he falls short of the bar. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%28%22Brian+H.+Graham%22+%7C+%22Brian+Graham%22%29+%28%22campaign+manager%22+%7C+%22Young+Republican+National+Federation%22+%7C+%22Florida+Council+on+Business+Ethics%22+%7C+%22Transportation+Club+of+Jacksonville%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%28%22Brian+H.+Graham%22+%7C+%22Brian+Graham%22%29+%28%22campaign+manager%22+%7C+%22Young+Republican+National+Federation%22+%7C+%22Florida+Council+on+Business+Ethics%22+%7C+%22Transportation+Club+of+Jacksonville%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">Google hits are quite low</a>, and a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%28%22Brian+H.+Graham%22+%7C+%22Brian+Graham%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%28%22Brian+H.+Graham%22+%7C+%22Brian+Graham%22%29&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">more open-ended search</a> makes it clear that he's not even one of the better-knonw "Brian Grahams" out there. -Hermil 11:44, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Clearly not a speedy, but <b>delete</b> nevertheless as per Harmil. <a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeelar_6424.html" title="User:Meelar">Meelar</a> <a href="../../../m/e/e/User_talk%7EMeelar_b3be.html" title="User talk:Meelar">(talk)</a> 13:59, July 25, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is part of article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Republicans" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Republicans" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Republicans</a> why in the world would you delete it and make the article incomplete?</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> It would be unfair to delete based on the Google search. This is clearly a common name. He is also found as Brian H. Graham and Brian Houston Graham. He is a national political figure with the Young Republicans and Fix Our Future. His father is a prominent Republican Party leader. He's the finance chairman for multiple political organizations. He's been endorsed by US Senators, Congressmen, candidates for Governor and he's only 21 years old. That sounds like he's worthy to me. Blueyez941 06:05, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete. The articles do assert notability, but I assert otherwise. Being an officer in various political organizations does not make someone notable. Aspiring politicians and minor political organizations are a dime a dozen. The Young Republicans are well-known, but does that make their <i>assistant treasurer</i> notable? Not quite. <a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsomorphic_e88d.html" title="User:Isomorphic">Isomorphic</a> 06:20, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> as the publisher of the of the Clay Chronicle newspaper in Clay County, Florida and political leader of many organizations he has established notability. The thing that makes Wikipedia worthwhile is the extra information found here. We will set a very bad example by deleting this article. There are hundreds of "less notable" article on people in Wikipedia, if we delete them we are doing an incredible disservice.JasonRecore 10:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Delete</b></s>. Not only because non-notable but because BHG and his supporters (or sock puppets) have shown themselves by their behaviour unworthy of being in Wikipedia. JasonRecore vandalised this VfD page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19715063" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=19715063" rel="nofollow">thus</a>. An anon vandalised it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19717194" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Brian_H._Graham&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=19717194" rel="nofollow">thus</a>. Zebolany (who, strangely, has not voted here) removed the VfD notice from one of the articles and then, when I re-instated the VfD tag, Zebolany vandalised several pages that I have created. And they could not even manage to link properly to <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a> - which might have helped. (Incidentally, did you know that "Brian … has raised over ,000 in less than one year for the Florida Federation of Young Republicans". <a href="http://www.afyr.org/custom.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.afyr.org/custom.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 03:52:35, 2005-07-28 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Userify</b>, ie. move to User:BrianHGraham. It is unusual, but there is no reason why Young_Republicans should not link to a user page. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 06:45:48, 2005-07-29 (UTC)</li>
<li>another <b>comment</b>. I am not sure why poor old Brian was singled out for the VfD grilling - possibly just cos his article was a bit too stubby. If he gets voted off, then it casts doubt on the other articles created so far for the YR officers: Nicolee Ambrose, Tim Kolpien (copyvio), Zack Scrivner, Glenn Murphy and Heather Harlow. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 07:06:59, 2005-07-29 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> not eveyone is as skilled as others with this site. That does not mean they do not use this site and certainly doesn't mean this article should be deleted. 66.157.230.18 20:55, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is the first time I have ever made a comment. If that makes what I have to say worthless, I wanted it to be out there on the table. However, I often use Wikipedia! It is my number one source of free information. It seems as if this has become too personal on both sides. I have added some of the information I have found on the web. Clearly when a 21 year old man is publisher of a major newspaper, he is worthy of an article. He's been endorsed by every major political figure in the South and has been recognized by numerous organizations for his ability to raise large sums of money. I am nearly 3 times the age of this young man, and I have not accomplished half what he has. 68.218.158.180 21:29, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Keep this article but <b>move to Brian H. Graham</b>. Notability has clearly been established. My only concern is how common the name Brian Grahamis. Changing it to Brian H. Graham is the best solution. 68.154.239.90 21:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> I made an error so I had to edit my previous comment. Since that seems to create some sort of controversy, I wanted to apologize for not being perfect. 68.154.239.90 21:42, 29 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If Graham is vote off then there are hundreds of other people that need to go too. There are <b>many</b> barely notable people on Wikipedia. In fact, that is one of the reasons Wikipedia is so popular. If we take that away then this site will be seriously lacking. 68.218.133.3 03:00, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Nother note. IP addresses for all the anons that have contributed so far are all registered to: BellSouth.net Inc., Atlanta, GA. Note to Citely above. I am a staunch supporter of the apathy party - I do not actually give a [expletive deleted] about BHG. I do however get very annoyed when people vandalise articles and try and make what is probably just one person, look like a crowd. Members of a political party, should act like grown-up responsible citizens. You are not presenting a very good image of the GOP. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 09:19:10, 2005-07-30 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>: Vanity, NN. Also the author's attempt to use sockpuppets to manipulate this vfd is noticeable. --<a href="../../../r/a/g/User%7ERagib_55a5.html" title="User:Ragib">Ragib</a> 23:27, 30 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Vandalizing articles is completely unacceptable, but so are the insults. Both sides are wrong on this issue. I do not know Mr. grahm and do not really care what you do with the article. I am very disappointed in the "keeps" as much as the "deletes". If I were the gentleman we're talking about I would not want anything to do with this site. And for all we know, he may not have a clue about the site. As for Ragib's insult. Isn't that a violation of the use of this site? Citely 01:08, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Internet search shows Graham lives in Florida and not Atlanta, Ga. Why is someone across the sea so involved? Could this all just be political?Citely</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I'm not going to join the childish comments. This has become far too personal. This is a <b>witch hunt</b> and needs to stop. <b>GROW UP</b> <a href="../../../6/4/2E/User%7E64.12.116.198.html" title="User:64.12.116.198">64.12.116.198</a> 01:12, 31 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
