<ul>
<li>Notability not asserted. The company was founded in 2004 by a couple of film students, and has gone on to make (by my count) four music videos, a few documentaries and a short film. Wow. <b>Delete</b>, for the love of $DEITY. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a> 03:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The fact that a couple of FORMER film students started the company in 2004 is irrelevant. What's relevant is, that as of 2007, the Company is, and has done notable work. A.P.E. also shows (by my count) 10 music videos at their official company website (www.apefilms.com) &amp; 16 videos and a DVD trailer at their official company myspace website(www.myspace.com/apefilms). It is the face of two up and coming directors crediting themselves as "APE FILMS". The Company is credited on two just released DVD's (Coco's 2007 Erotics Calendar DVD &amp; Coco's 2007 Black Men Magazine DVD) and a music video (Grandmaster Mele Mel - "M3 - The New Message"). Grandmaster Mele Mel (also spelled Melle Mel) becomes the first rapper (as leader of The Furious Five) to ever be inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007. A.P.E.'s "M3 - The New Message" music video is notable because it is being used to promote the first ever solo album by Mele Mel. It is also a sequel to the original Grand Master Flash &amp; Furious Five song &amp; music video "The Message" (one of most important songs in Hip Hop history) "The Message" was also written &amp; performed by Melle Mel. Grandmaster Mele Mel is featuring the A.P.E. "M3 - The New Message" music video at his official website (www.melemel.net). Company is clearly credited at end of video. Grandmaster Mele Mel also has 2 more A.P.E. Company videos ("Portal In The Park" &amp; "M3 - Making The Video") showing at his official Myspace website (use link from www.melemel.net). Company is clearly on end credits of those videos as well. A.P.E. is also credited on the Grandmaster Mele Mel's "Muscles" CD, world release January 2007. Company is listed in credits of MTV2 Fight Klub (this show airs in North America, Europe &amp; Asia). Company is listed as #1 friend at MTV2 Fight Klub Host International P official myspace site (www.myspace.com/ipfk). There is much aditional evidence to be found at the two official Company websites.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - a list of credits can verify information, but doesn't really fit the bill for reliable sources for establishing notability. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 14:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Comment</b> - true, but TV News reports, Magazine articles &amp; the distribution &amp; airing of the Company's works to a multi-national audience does. It's not the credits that are notible, but the company &amp; the works themselves that they create. For instance, they created a video that was used as part of a U.S. national Fire Prevention Campaign &amp; another that was used as a sequel to a very historic video by a equally historic Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame inductee (Grandmaster Mele Mel - "M3 - The New Message").

<li>Some info on company found by Googling "A.P.E. Films" &amp; "apefilms.com", rather than Artist Perspective Entertainment - Also found NBC-TV News video coverage of their "Take It Outside" music video by Googling the video title (Google video). I crossed referenced this with both company websites, &amp; found much additional evidence showing that this company did in fact produce this &amp; other nationally/internationally released works. Other company videos were found with Google video by Googling the titles of each work. Additionally, there are two full page articles found in U.S. national publications - The Ave Magazine (FALL '05 ISSUE p42) and Velvet Addiction Magazine (LIFESTYLES, MAY '06 ISSUE), - <b>Keep</b> Bh1967 21:39, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - as far as I can see the focus of the material is on CS Vernon rather than APE. I'd say that goes more for establishing the notability of Vernon, and would be suitable for an article about her. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 14:43, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - there is more verifiable info credited to her, but the videos they do are produced by both under the company name "A.P.E.". Jimmy Lee individualy is credited as director (along with A.P.E.) on the Mele Mel "M3 - The New Message" music video. The two individuals &amp; the company are credited on the two Coco DVD's. C.S. Vernon &amp; Jimmy Lee share director credit on the national "Take It Outside" music video. The company has a production credit. They also share director credit on the "Broke Celebrity" TV pilot produced for celebrity stylist/fashion designer Indashio (Indashio.com &amp; myspace.com/indashio). Jimmy Lee is the videographer/editor for MTV2 Fight Klub, although the credit goes to A.P.E.Playserious 18:50, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Note to other editors reviewing this AFD. User:Bh1967 is the creator of the article in question, and both User:Bh1967, and User:Playserious appear to be <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPA_03df.html" title="WP:SPA">single purpose accounts</a> with edits realted only to this article. -- <a href="../../../w/h/p/User%7EWhpq_e938.html" title="User:Whpq">Whpq</a> 20:26, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - APE Films' association with a handful of notable people does not adequately establish its own notablity. This AfD seems analogous to the AfDs I've seen for indie music journalists who interview every notable indie rock band as they come into town; sure, they can name-drop impressively, but that doesn't say anything about their own importance. There also appear to be serious problems here with <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a>. The bottom line is that this is not an article which will attract a group of knowledgeable, disinterested editors - which is the real purpose of having notability standards. --<a href="../../../h/y/p/User%7EHyperbole_1876.html" title="User:Hyperbole">Hyperbole</a> 21:25, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - The fact that I created the article should not be used as an excuse to dismiss the facts I have stated &amp; the sources I have listed. It is not the company's association with notible people that makes the company notible (although that too can be a factor in making something notible), but rather the work the company is doing that makes them notible. The Company performs video &amp; editing work for MTV2 Fight Klub (the industry's #1 source of producing this generations top MC's with dozens that have signed to Major Record Labels), and the fact that company is also producing video for Legendary Grandmaster Mele Mel, Hip Hop's 1st ever "MC" is notible. They are not interviewing notible artists "when they come into town" about the artists work. The company is gaining respect as an emerging company BASED ON THE COMPANY'S WORK. The company IS the artist. They are being hired by notible people &amp; companies to create new, original works. There is a BIG difference. This article is a work that will attract a group of knowledgeable, disinterested editors as the company continues to produce work in the public eye and more people become familiar with it.
