<p>This is a video game which was cancelled before it was ever finished. Doesn't meet <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>, as it never actually existed. Furthermore, we have no reliable sources on this, and the article is pretty much empty anyway, there being little to say about something that never existed.

They could theoretically all be merged together into <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Virtual_Boy_games_88b8.html" title="List of Virtual Boy games">List of Virtual Boy games</a>, or a newly created List of Cancelled Virtual Boy games, or just deleted <a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 23:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, as the creator of most of those articles I'm find with the decision to merge them into a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cancelled_Virtual_Boy_games_7c33.html" title="List of cancelled Virtual Boy games">List of cancelled Virtual Boy games</a>. I had considered it initially when I made them, but I was having trouble figuring out a way to put them on one page. So as long as the infoboxes and images are allowed to make the move safely, I have no qualms. And even though you did not include them in your list, I just need to reinforce that <a href="../../../b/o/u/Bound_High_129c.html" title="Bound High">Bound High</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/a/Dragon_Hopper_8e94.html" title="Dragon Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a>, and <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Racer_f793.html" title="Zero Racer">Zero Racer</a> all have plenty of information for their own articles and should stay (and should use {{main}} tags in the new List).

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Percy Nobby Norton uses this very style on his blog nobbynorton.blogspot.com.

<li><b>Keep Keep Keep</b> Vis-a-vis the old "goes back to the Ancient Greeks"-controversy, I would like to remark that although the claim might be slightly undersubstantialized, this is not really a problem, since we have to see it in its context of New Blogism. Blog-readers still largely prefer to consume texts that are written in the classical "claim-proof" structure, which principally reminds us of mathematics -- which in fact did originate with the Ancient Greeks, no question there. New Blogism is making the point that claim-proof is very much an outdated way of structuring a text and is substituting for it a revolutionary claim-claim-structure, which is currently finding its way upwards in all kinds of intromation (the spelling of this word is very much a topic of dispute) channels all over the world. <b>Giannis Kouros</b> 19:30, 12 August 2006 (CET) <small>No such user; this comment was left by <span id="129.125.104.172" class="plainlinks">129.125.104.172&#160;(talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.125.104.172_74ad.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.125.104.172">contribs</a> <small>•</small> <a href="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=129.125.104.172&amp;site=srv42" class="external text" title="http://tools.wikimedia.de/~interiot/cgi-bin/Tool1/wannabe_kate?username=129.125.104.172&amp;site=srv42" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#002bb8">count</span></a></span>) <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b>Srose</b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 18:46, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> there were five redlinks for <a href="../../../c/a/t/Cat_flap.html" title="Cat flap">cat flap</a> before I created the article a year ago and there are many more links in today. There were <i>no</i> links for 'Pet door' nor 'Doggie door' when doggie door was created as a one line stub last October and put up for delete/merge in November. However, merging doggie door with cat flap has caused no end of trouble. There have been four page move requests, all rejected, and several page moves against concensus. Cat flap is the correct, original term, despite what American authors and dog owners think (see <a href="../../../c/a/t/Talk%7ECat_flap_0fb5.html" title="Talk:Cat flap">Talk:Cat flap</a> for arguments ad nauseum). Nevertheless we might as well keep the two articles demerged to avoid further bickering.

</ul>
<p><b>§</b>Yikes! I wasn't aware at all of what I was walking into before reading that Talk history. Nevertheless, this POV fork (and that is what it is) has been opposed and defended by tendentious editing on both sides. Fundamentally, it is a dialect debate, with <i>cat flap</i> the admittedly UK-dominant term and <i>doggie door</i> the more familiar for US audiences. Based on the <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOS_8984.html#National_varieties_of_English" title="WP:MOS">Wikipedia Manual of Style</a>, the burden is to produce a single article under some name. The manual prefers a single, neutral article title where that is possible, such as <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevedore.html" title="Stevedore">stevedore</a> for the docker/longshoreman issue or <a href="../../../f/i/x/Fixed-wing_aircraft.html" title="Fixed-wing aircraft">fixed-wing aircraft</a> to end the aeroplane/airplane debate. Where it is not possible, the first non-stub entry is to take precedence (and the alternative reduced to a redirect), such as the petrol redirect to <a href="../../../g/a/s/Gasoline.html" title="Gasoline">gasoline</a>.<br />
There is no debate that the cat flap article is the first authored. The question is, or should be, whether that is the appropriate final location. I have lingering concerns from reading the talk page that the repeated consensus regarding the pagemoves has been flawed. Why do I make the bold assumption that the topic has been argued in bad faith? Because the talk pages admit as much. All of the following are from the discussion regarding the original move request, which quickly brought up the suggestion to move to <i>pet door</i> per the manual of style (each from a different author, to avoid overly selecting one person's viewpoint):</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Which could well be the nub of the problem. If it is a British English / American English thing, it should stay at the British English naming — a) for the priority choice of English, and b) since Cat flaps were more than likely invented in England."</dd>
<dd>"So another page using a British term was lost through American intransigence to seeing "foreign" terms. We ( the non-USians) have to put up with literally thousands of them on the Encyclopaedia."</dd>
<dd>"I also think removing the American systemic bias is a very important task within wikipedia. There may be other issues than the purely English-American differences in this case that should also be considered but I would describe voting on the basis of removing that particular systemic bias from wikipedia as being responsible voting."</dd>
</dl>
<p>Are there actual cultural differences? Yes, apparently due to large differences in pet culture -- Americans are more likely to have fenced yards and allow dogs easy egress, while British cats are far more likely to be "outdoor cats" with their own access independant access. But, just as the example <a href="../../../s/t/e/Stevedore.html" title="Stevedore">stevedore</a> article explains the differences in use in the two dialects, a single article under a neutral name could do that here. Way back in that first move debate, User:Waterguy provided at least some evidence that UK companies manufacturing these devices are cognizant of <i>pet door</i> and use it in at least some of their advertising material. The presence or absence of dictionary entries has been the primary sourced justification for preferring <i>cat flap</i> (with the talk on its page grudgingly allowing the parallel construction of <i>dog door</i> after it was resurrected by deletion review), but Wikipedia does not consider dictionaries to be the sole determiners of term validity. After all, <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">Wikipedia's not one of those</a>. Other arguments (on both sides) have been based on frequency of use, but neutral, technically-inclusive terms would seem to take precedent -- both for encyclopediac value and in observation of precedent (such as the fixed-wing aircraft issue).<br />
Clearly, this AfD is specious, bad-faith, and out of process ... but the purpose of AfD is to produce better articles. Surely there is a way to resolve this that won't fan the fires of national language furor? In its current state, I can see no future for this bifurcated article that does not involve a path to RfC or mediation... <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 08:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

Therefore the result of the debate is delete rather than merge. Then comes the question as to where to redirect this to (I should note here that decisions to redirect do not need afd to decide, and therefore if there is consensus to change the redirect destination, that can be done using the article's talk page). I'm redirecting to God (expression) because there is more opportunity to add information to that article, if suitable sources can ever be found. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetros471_bbc1.html" title="User:Petros471">Petros471</a> 11:35, 21 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Surely you do not hope for professors to spend their time researching on Leet? Leet is a form of online language and has no absolute definition and no way to verify. IMHO though urban dictionary and usenet messages may not be able to provide accurate and neutral sources for other things, they're just the right thing for Leet. By the way, there's not really much to verify. I admit there's some original research, but if you remove them there's still plenty of things that can be kept. <a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranherunar_05c3.html" title="User:Aranherunar">Aran</a><a href="../../../a/r/a/User_talk%7EAranherunar_ee4b.html" title="User talk:Aranherunar">heru</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Aranherunar_c9f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Aranherunar">nar</a> 14:41, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article about the linux audit subsystem. Has now been tagged with {{importance}} for a few months. I am nominating it for deletion because, well, because today is the day where the cleanup backlog focuses on entries starting with L.

<p>The promotional autobiography of a non-notable musician.

<dd>This AfD bundles related articles for deletion along similar reasons, primarily because the terms are <a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWINAD_d63f.html" title="WP:WINAD">dictionary definition</a> entries for neologisms, with no citation or verification besides.
<dl>
<dd>Clubbox is uncited and unverified, and reads, at-best, like advertising material. The article has been the target of vandalism (note the TROLL stub) that has gone uncorrected since 21 April, which does not bode well for its support as more than a neologistic search term. A properly written article would probably be still deletable as dicdef.</dd>
<dd>Cultural blog is likewise uncited, and consists primarily of a list of blog links. Little-to-no evidence that this rises above neologism. Certaily a dicdef.</dd>
<dd>Community blog has been tagged unsourced since 19 July. No sources seem to be coming. Article is a dicdef for a neologism, featuring an even more protologistic synonym.</dd>
<dd>Fictional blog. A cleanup of wording leaves only a dicdef.</dd>
<dd>Gossip blog. No assertion that the term is in actual use. <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Point-of-view</a> issues with what stub text is there now.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../o/n/l/Online_diary.html" title="Online diary">Online diary</a> is not actually being nominated for AfD in this bundle, as it is already under consideration for a merger to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blog.html" title="Blog">Blog</a>.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../p/h/o/Photoblog.html" title="Photoblog">Photoblog</a>, tagged unverified since its creation on 6 May. At its heart, a dicdef (the first line of the article). Primary origin of the word itself seems to be the several commercial web domains using the name.</dd>
<dd>Science blog primarily cites, well, science blogs as proof of its validity, in violation of Wikipedia sourcing guidelines. The <i>Nature</i> article may allow this one to survive, but given its poor sourcing, I am including it in the bundle.</dd>
<dd>Shock blog. Neologistic dicdef written in anything but NPOV.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam_blog.html" title="Spam blog">Spam blog</a>. Only some of this article even applies to its stated title. Suggest merger of the title-appropriate information to <a href="../../../p/a/g/PageRank_8fe1.html" title="PageRank">PageRank</a>, <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blogger_%28service%29.html" title="Blogger (service)">Blogger (service)</a>, and/or <a href="../../../s/c/r/Scraper_site.html" title="Scraper site">Scraper site</a>, as appropriate, and the other material to <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spam_in_blogs.html" title="Spam in blogs">Spam in blogs</a>, if needed. This underwent some no-consensus move/merger discussion at a previous time. The phenomenon is real, but I question the term as an article topic (is this neologism in wide use/has it been established as the prefered means of referring to this activity?).</dd>
<dd>Topical blog, tagged original research, uncited, and inappropriate tone. This is basically a rehash of the Types of blogs entry itself, without the linking.</dd>
<dd><a href="../../../v/l/o/Vlog.html" title="Vlog">Vlog</a>, again a real phenomenon, but neologistic with an entry that does not support the general acceptance of the term. Article currently consists of a series of admitted dicdefs, followed by a timeline that does not assert the term itself is in use, followed by a genre list that consists of original research. Anything worth keeping can probably be merged to <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_syndication.html" title="Web syndication">web syndication</a>.</dd>
<dd>The remainder of the base article requires no action. Travel log already redirects to <a href="../../../t/r/a/Travelogue.html" title="Travelogue">travelogue</a>, link blog is redlinked, and hobby blog has no linking at all.</dd>
<dd>Three entries linked from the base article are <b>not</b> being included in this bundled AfD. <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moblog.html" title="Moblog">Moblog</a> appears to have the basis of an actual article, largely due to apparent national Moblog in Singapore. And <a href="../../../c/o/r/Corporate_blog.html" title="Corporate blog">Corporate blog</a> (redirected from Business blog) has better documentation, as the phenomenon has been responsible for a great deal of policy discussion in the corporate world, and a lot of in-print ink. It could use some cleanup, but appears to meet WP article expectations. <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_blog.html" title="Political blog">Political blog</a> seems as though it should be able to be worked into an acceptable article. The current one needs extensive work, however.

<dd>Please note that the related topic Musical Blogs, although not linked in the Types article, is currently under AfD review as well.</dd>

<dd>Not forgotten, actually. The moblog article is not much better than the rest, but it makes the claim of a national moblog (using the term) in place in Singapore. I didn't spend the time to check up on the accuracy of that claim, but if a national government has created an officially sanctioned blog (of any sort), that is significant, and if it uses the term, it probably can stand on its own as an article. Probably. Assuming it all checks out, of course. <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESerpent%27s_Choice_5604.html" title="User:Serpent's Choice">Serpent's Choice</a> 23:18, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

On top of this I'd also like to point out that a) you're out voted, and b) the terms vlog, videoblog and video podcast are all a part of the lexicon right now. Much like spam blog people will be searching for clarification. If you want "blog" removed from the definition then great... let's replace it with journal. While I generally respect what you're doing 90% of the time with the vlog article, I think your constant slashing out EVERY SINGLE edit, because it is indeed every single edit, is what's causing it to stagnate and not involve. It's not even a matter of constructive criticism... one thing is clear... your dominating every aspect of the article... and fundamentally that's not right. This is not a trim and perfect process... it's muddy and it's dirty... but if you give some wiggle room it will evolve. --<a href="../../../m/m/e/User%7EMmeiser_deed.html" title="User:Mmeiser">mmeiser</a> 03:29, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Request for specific feedback IN the vlog article</b> Isotope, what would you consider good sourcing? Wired articles? Business week articles? How about the Rolling Stone. Vlogging and vlog company blip.tv was featured prominently in a PBS Now special on prime time TV about net neutrality. Youtube is the hottest damn site on the internet. Though many would shrug it off because it's sensational, a closed platfrom, and other personal issues it is clearly a video blogging platfrom. I can find sources on all these things. They probably should be in the timeline... but what did you have in mind. What does it take? We've got four books... apparently that's not enough... nor a the whole internet world gone mad over video. So what does it take... and if this craze isn't about video blogging than what IS it about... video sharing? I thought that was what P2P and bittorent were about. There's no denying that this is something different... not simply blogging with video... not simply sharing videos. It is certainly bigger than moblogging. It is consumed completely differently and used completely differently than blogging. Does blogging come in 'episodes' like TV... are they watched on portable media players like the iPod and Sony PSP. Perhaps this is all stuff that should be put on the wikipedia article... but my guess is the reason it's not... is because the powers that be have set to work slashing apart the article and anyone who attempts to edit it instead of collaborating on improving it. This has driven off all would be editors... for I've spoken to a great many of them... I ask is wikipedia getting setting so high a standard that no collaboration is possible? Or... is it more likely that certain people (not you) have set their own standard so high that noone else can live up to it. I have no doubt that many of the complaints about the article are justified... all that I've spoken to have complained about it... particularly the genres section, but mostly that it hasn't evolved... that every attempt to evolve it is immediately shot down. And I beg you to look at the history of the article... don't take my word for it... so at the least cite some guide for citations... or pretend like we're all human beings and actually *explain to me* what is lacking or best of all *cite specific example* by going through the page and adding in comments like *citation needed* like I see on many, many other wikipedia articles... Sorry dude, my frustration is not aimed at you... we need an end to slash and burn gate keeping of articles and more collaboration. I'm working on it offline too. P.S. Yeah I type a lot... people tell me that... but they also say I illustrate my points very well... so hopefully there's no crime with illustrating your points longhand on wikipedia.

<dd><b>Comment</b> No offense to Mrs Trimble but scholarly publications is what academics do. There does not seem to be an independent assertion of notability available for Prof Timble. Moreover she is not the author of 3 of the books listed but the editor! For those unfamiliar with the process, scholarly books are often collections of research papers on a given topic and the editors are the ones responsible for putting them together. Not that it's an easy job but it's way below authorship. I've removed them from the list on the article. THe last one with the notably long name is her PhD thesis. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 13:47, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I feel bad about this one because the creator is trying to do the right thing — it's well-formatted and even has footnotes.

<dd>It is no different from any of the other JROTC unit pages. it was written by a JROTC veteran (me) who worded it so that the information there was confined to what was found in the sources. Also, "notability" is a very relative term. The unit is highly distinguished in AFOATS, even if it is unlikely it will ever garner any kind of "media" attention. -<a href="../../../e/d/%21/User%7EEd%21_8d91.html" title="User:Ed!">Ed!</a> 03:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b> - classic vanity entry - creator/main contributor's only edits are to this article and to associated articles to insert a link to this page; incorrect format (since they have never edited another article, they have no idea what the correct format is); weak assertion of notability (profiled on a program that doesn't have an article on a network without an article); overuse of bolding; a picture that could probably only come from the subject's private photo collection.

While far from a national identity, thousands of people search his name to find and read articles, mostly those related to sport. The radio show coincides with the broadcast of a VFL match and 3SER's coverage rivals SEN1116 for ratings. Glen hosts the Sunday Roast and interviews people from AFL clubs (eg. David King last weekend). He also does boundary riding for the VFL radio broadcasts and I believe is notorious for being involved in newsworthy events <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.

<p>I thought that wikipedia was a good source for information. Unfortunatley it has come to my attention that it is only meant to benefit the rich and sucessful. The band The Frantix are a large part of the Long Island punk scene ask any local punker who they are and they will tell you!The punk scene is one which prides itself on an "Do It Yourself" mentality. By meeting with the wikipedia standards of a musician/band they are not punk anymore (major record labels or extreme sucess) because that independent factor is lost. If you are going to delete the wikipedia page about the frantix then you might as well delete any page that has the words punk rock or hardcore because in essence having them up goes against your "standards". <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.45.255.135 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.45.255.135.html" title="User talk:24.45.255.135">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.45.255.135_e891.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.45.255.135">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!</b>"...a true punk couldn't care less about having Wikipedia article." A true punk stands up for what they believe in. A fan of ours created the page because he enjoys our music and feels we are just as important as bigger acts.Anybody with common sense knows that having an album released doesnt mean a thing the band leftover crack(who is on wikipedia)have amazing recordings but are the worst musicians i have ever seen live.Ashlee Simpson was caught lip synching on television yet she deserves to be called a musician? I reall could care less if you delete the thing but I'm not about to just say thanks but oh fucking well to someone who took their own time out to do something so generous for the members of my band and I.Besides all of you "wikipedians" have your own little waste of space when you click on your name and I have a feeling nobody even likes any of you. We HAVE fans and yet you will still deny this page. HAH. I remember when wikipedia wasnt a dictatorship! Believe me I know you arn't judging our music. But I believe as a long time wikipedia user that maybe I should be listened to.

<li>If you would take the time to look it up and not be so close minded and full/sure of yourself you would come across it very easily. I bet you haven't even looked. They were on tri-state area Warped Tour which only lists major-record label bands. They are on the 2006 Bloody Solution tour. It's your job to look these things up so either take my word for it or get on it already. Reliable sources indicating prominant representitive status? Try looking on general TriState area alternitive music websites sites (punk/hardcore). Here's one to start with though: www.lipunx.com, that's all I'm going to help you with though. They are practically taking over the music scene while you're sitting here telling me I'm wrong. I've justified the reason for this band to be up here. If you are going to be bitter and make claims you aren't even looking into or won't further back up then Wikipedia is proven no different from a conservatie, stubborn, right-wing facist cult.

<li>The page you are talking about begins "User:". It's in user space, which is different from article space (and to make things more interesting, this discussion takes place within <i>project</i> namespace). If you click on almost any other username here, you'll find something similar. User pages are by definition vanity pages. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 02:21, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>To clarify this a little bit, Po, our user pages here are not quite vanity pages or MySpaces. I've always seen them as virtual <a href="../../../c/u/b/Cubicle.html" title="Cubicle">cubicles</a>, since Wikipedia is essentially an online <i>workplace</i>.

<p>I'm not an administrator for this website. I signed up to create pages I felt should be here and that's why I made a page for this band for they have made a big imprint on the alternitive music scene of the tri-state area. I have also supplied proof in the previous posts that you so frequenlty ignore. I told you what major tours they were on (YES WITH NOTABLE BANDS). That should be enough. I gave you the name of the tours. It's your job to go look it up not mine. It's not my website.Shuz 01:36, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

I don't see any mention of the Frantix as playing any shows other than the Amityville one we already know about.

<li>It is never enough. Bands that haven't done anything significant out of their community don't get a mention in wikipedia. The only pub burnt down in my home town - that was massive for the community, but doesn't warrant an article in wikipedia. Why should schools not get the same treatment?

A school's own website is <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Company_and_organization_websites" title="WP:RS">borderline</a>, as a source. I personally wouldn't reject information from such sources, but I'm not very happy about school articles where the only real source is an external link to the school's website. In the case of the article under discussion, at this moment we currently have a very odd situation in which there <b>is</b> an external link independent of the school... but that link is not used to support any facts that are currently in the article. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:12, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Verifiability is all-important, but that standard is only relevant to notability to the extent that articles on non-notable things are often also unverifiable. School AFD's would be more interesting if the basic verifiability of these articles was under fire, but generally its not. (As far as school websites go, I usually consider these okay sources for basic info, e.g. enrollment, principal, location, etc., especially for government schools.) To address the other points made above -- mention of that burned-down pub might be worth including in the article on the community, if it was as significant as you indicate. Nor does a keep vote on this AFD imply that the school deserves "its own article"; discussion of whether to merge the article belongs on the article talk page; the primary question here is whether the content should be deleted. A keep consensus never precludes a merger that retains the content. <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopher_Parham_7957.html" title="User:Christopher Parham">Christopher Parham</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChristopher_Parham_f0d3.html" title="User talk:Christopher Parham">(talk)</a> 23:31, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are a lot more things that are verifiable than are on wikipedia - mainly because they are not notable. AFD revolves largely around verifiability and notability. Schools are the only thing on wikipedia where the majority of keep votes ignore the notability. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:07, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

Come on, "grow Organically'? The article has been around since 10/2005, and it's still a stub. Only the recent AfD encouraged any 'growth'. There is an innate reason that primary schools are not as notable or important as high schools. School athletics and the fact that this (High School) is where people prepare for college (and/or the rest of their lives). Not everyone graduates highschool but nearly everyone has gone through a primary school. I've never heard of a college recruiting from a primary school. The only time I have heard about primary schools in the news is when a child is sent home for some violation of zero-tolerance or (and I hate when I hear it) some child is injured or some maniac goes nuts in the school. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 15:34, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>There was some problem with this AfD. I am merely substing the templates properly.

<p><b>Original reason by <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">User:BigHaz</a></b> - Renomination of a previously nominated page. All contributors to the previous AfD were invited to participate in a discussion on the article's Talk page about where the information was best placed. Consensus was to move those charged under Article 301 to that page (they already were) and those charged for insulting Ataturk to that section of that page (the one who was explicitly charged in that manner was redlinked, <s>which implies a lack of notability</s> - the section of the article in question also doesn't seem like the greatest place to put the names of those charged for insulting the man). Thus, we're left with an article which I'm not quite sure what to do with. I stress again that the overwhelming majority of useful information is in fact duplicated elsewhere on Wikipedia, which seems like as good a reason as any to delete this. That said, arguments were made during the AfD and the discussion about a possible rename, so that may be a worthwhile thing to bring up here. I'm in favour of a delete based on the rationale that the information is either duplicated or (in the case of the redlinked people still listed) just not there, but I'm only one man.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The title is inherently NPOV. There is no clear criterion for inclusion. Not all people mentioned are normally considered to be writers. The article lists people who are dead and alive indiscriminately, and makes no distinction between old cases and new cases, or between the cases in which the accused were convicted and acquitted or only charged. Those listed are often much less notable than those not listed. As such the article is not informative and serves no purpose. I do not agree with what BigHaz wrote above that being redlinked implies a lack of notability. Several if not most of these people <i>should</i> have an article. Actually there is a page <a href="../../../r/a/g/Ragip_Zarakolu_cbad.html" title="Ragip Zarakolu">Ragip Zarakolu</a>; its page title differs from the (proper) spelling in the redlink in this article. --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 16:13, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I guess at a pinch we could tree it out from Article 301 as "List of people who have been charged under Article 301", and use it as a place to list the "notable prosecutions" or whatever that article calls them. There's then the question of whether any individual who's not listed there (i.e. the redlinks we still have on this article) is notable enough to <i>be</i> listed for that - presumably there'd be a lot of stubs to be created running "X is/was a Turkish journalist/poet/author/other who was prosecuted under Article 301". <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 10:17, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Although possible, I'm not sure it is an ideal solution.

<dd>Valid point. I'd forgotten we had some ring-ins (the Mazlum Der head being probably the most ringing).

<dd>Sorry, it must be more of an Australianism than I realise. It means "something which is in a place where it doesn't normally qualify to be", so in this case the people who aren't necessarily "writers" in the normal sense of the word are ring-ins.

<dd>If it is only current cases, then a question is: How do we <i>keep</i> it current. For example, the article states: "Ibrahim Aksoy, ..., imprisoned ... since October 1995". This sounds like the man has been subject to the <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Express_%28film%29_a39c.html" title="Midnight Express (film)">notorious brutalities of Turkish prison wardens with atrocious accents</a> for almost eleven years now. But the reference given is from 1996. I further have some problem in making the criterion "other serious parts of the criminal code" concrete. (It would actually seem worse to me if writers are prosecuted by dint of frivolous parts of the criminal code.) How can we deal with this in an NPOV way? --<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:14, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Good point again (and I'll admit to not having checked those references, I'm not in great health at the moment so I give up on research a bit more easily). Perhaps the idea of rolling this into a subpage from Article 301 as "notable prosecutions" (and zapping anyone who we can't verifiably say was prosecuted under that article) is the best. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 23:19, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The cries of discrimination against Asian companies (or any company outside the US or UK) say little about the notability of this application or this article, and besides, anyone who looks at <a href="../../../m/a/n/Category%7EManhwa_bdf1.html" title="Category:Manhwa">Category:Manhwa</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/n/Category%7EManga_1537.html" title="Category:Manga">Category:Manga</a>, and <a href="../../../a/n/i/Category%7EAnime_6c0f.html" title="Category:Anime">Category:Anime</a> can't say that there's no room here for Asian content. Simply whining about perceived bias isn't enough - this entry has to stand on its own, and it does not. It reads like a sales brochure ("Our system provides...", "Our e-commerce module comes with..."), and if the consensus is 'keep' it's going to need a lot of cleanup. Anyone can nominate any article for deletion, and if you don't think an entry is notable you should nominate it for deletion and allow the community to decide by consensus. Notability is decided by the community, However, like it or not, this is the English Wikipedia. We can't use sources written in Thai, Korean, Chinese or Japanese to verify the claims made here because most of us don't read those languages. I'm sorry about that, but this version of Wikipedia is written in English. Besides, there are plenty of articles here that aren't in the Thai/Japanese/Chinese/Korean Wikipedias, and vice versa. Please stop accusing editors of not acting in <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">good faith</a>, because it doesn't help you or this debate. Instead, tell us why the article should stay in the English Wikipedia based on the merits and use of the product and only the product. There are more than 125,000 projects at SourceForge, so having SourceForge as a host isn't part of the notability criteria. I can't get wavelet.biz to load after trying three different browsers, so someone else needs to explain the notability of the site/app and where the claims can be verified – in English. <font color="darkblue"><b>Baseball,Baby!</b></font> <font color="red"><sup><i>balls</i></sup></font><font color="darkblue"><sup>•</sup></font><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BaseballBaby_1aec.html" title="Special:Contributions/BaseballBaby"><font color="red"><sup><i>strikes</i></sup></font></a> 23:47, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree, but your actions are truly inappropriate and undermine your own cause. From looking at your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.71.254.145" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/58.71.254.145" rel="nofollow">contribution history</a>, we can see that you've done nothing to even attempt to improve the Wavelet.biz article. Instead, you've gone on the attack against seven other companies' articles, at least some of which are clearly better (both in terms of asserting notability and in terms of sourcing) than the Wavelet.biz article. There's still time for you to fix the Wavelet.biz article instead of trying to inflict as much collateral damage as possible. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 17:03, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Extend AfD period and add sources to the article</b>. The article appears to have been at least somewhat rewritten during the discussion, making it read more like an encyclopedia article and less like an advertisement. If I had to vote now, I'd still vote 'delete', because it's still missing one critical piece -- sources, other than the project's own website, to establish notability. A flood of folks have shown up to defend the article. I would highly encourage those people to use their knowledge of the product to find neutral, verifiable, preferably-English-language sources that establish the project's notability, and quickly add those sources to the article. I don't know if procedure allows for it, but I'd like to see them given every chance to do this. (I know that AfDs are occasionally extended for a few days if there's no consensus, which seems to be the case here.) <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 16:56, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I would dispute that there is no concensus here. Many of the keeps do not list valid reasons or refute the arguements of the people who have voted for delete. Remember, it is the strength of the arguements, not the strength of the numbers. At this time it looks like Delete is the concensus and nothing about the article (as of this post) has changed to refute those claims. Another thing to remember about the AfD process, (right from <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>) <i>Unregistered or new users are welcome to contribute to the discussion, but their recommendations may be discounted, especially if they seem to be made in bad faith (for example, if they misrepresent their reasons).

I could see some sockpuppets and meatpuppets too. Overall, lets move forward, and see if the articles could be improved.

<li><b>Comment</b> While I respect that, your arguement is weak in the face of the matter that Wikipedia does not keep articles based on if they are interesting or not. <i>Wikipedia's three content policies are Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. Because the three policies are complementary, they should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>These three policies are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus</b></i> So if you believe it should be kept, please provide a reason that these pillars of the wiki community should be put asside for this one article.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 19:31, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In practice, Google testing also winds up being subjective, because Google itself has certain selection biases that need to be accounted for.

Leaving that aside, <a href="../../../m/a/d/Made2Manage_Systems_39b9.html" title="Made2Manage Systems">Made2Manage Systems</a>, an article you nominated for deletion (in your only other apparent contribution to Wikipedia), also rates a 5 on your proposed test. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Do not confuse the readers with the participants in one category from the other. Also, Singapore government is well known for its government efficiencies, policies and competitiveness. Accusing the Singapore government of not doing their job, just to bring out the point that Wavelet.biz is not worthy of wikipedia because Singapore government is not doing their job may not be the best thing to do. For the record, I am a Singaporean, and feel disturbed by the statement above, and sorry for my fellow countrymen. Singapore may be a small country in terms of size and population. But please do not insult us, Singapore as not serious in running our own country.

<li><b>Comment</b> My statement was certainly not an insult to Singapore. It was simply a statement that Singapore, like any other country, may run events or contests for participants of various levels of achievement and notability. Thank you for clarifying the nature of the contest, which was not clear from the source. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:38, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Wavelet.biz is recognized by Singapore Government and Singapore IT Federation, and represented Singapore in 2004 to participate in Asia ICT Awards in HK (year 2004).

<li><b>Comment</b> You already mentioned the Asia ICT Awards invitation, and I already replied. Unfortunately, the csia.org.cn article you link is not in English, making it difficult to determine what selection criteria were used. And RedHat application profiles are provided by the application writers, meaning that they are frequently self-promotional, and a listing does not mean that the product is important or well-known or widely-distributed. I appreciate you trying to find English-language sources; I just want to point out the problems with the sources you have provided. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 15:23, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I have to point out a striking thing about this debate: despite the volume of comments encouraging that the article be kept, <i>every single one of them</i> -- except for my own "quick, fix the darn article" comment -- has come either from an anon account or from what appears to be a single-purpose registered user account. In an AfD that superficially appears to have a volume of supporters on both sides, that's extraordinary. <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> 03:46, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Facts vs Consensus</b> <b>Remove</b> From what I see, in the interest of the wikipedia's editors' interest, it is better to remove Wavelet.biz. Since the primary users of the Wikipedia are wikipedia editors, facts are refuted, and subjective accusations, and "feelings" are taken into considerations. Pretty much like a war on who is more expert in creating some sort of SPA, to bring down the reputation of Wavelet.biz. Basically objective reference are discounted. Subjective comments are counted. Similar projects in wikipedia are kept, but Wavelet.biz is attacked by experienced wikipedia editors to play reverse psychology by creating sockpuppets etc. Articles that look like advertisements are kept, and article that state facts are removed. In order for the best interest of wikipedia, this discussion page itself should be removed forever, so that it does not affect the reputation of wikipedia.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In summary, by removing the article, Wikipedian editors with limited exposure and knowledge would be happy. A community project like Wavelet.biz continues without being affected. Governments in south east asia will not be insulted. Other sockpuppets created by similar projects to bring down the Wavelet.biz wins. So, I would vote for <b>Remove</b> or <b>Delete</b>. Everyone is happy. Marcussua 04:54, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. You seem to be perceiving this as a referendum on your own worth as a person and the worth of several countries, and perceiving the actions of everyone else in that light. Unfortunately, the premise is simply false, and as a result your perceptions of others' behavior are misdirected. Wikipedia's concept of "notability" does not equal "moral worth", it never has, it never will, and it is not intended to.

<p>This has passed an AfD with no consensus, but I don't see any reason why the article needs to exist. It's full of redlinks, the notability of the included firms is often dubious, and the content is nothing more than a list. If a firm meets <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> then it should have an article, and categories would be a better bet for listing law firms. Perhaps an article about particularly notable law firms (suggested in the previous AfD would work, but this list seems to be a list of firms of questionable notability. <b>Delete</b> <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>haver</i></font></a></sup> 11:08, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> This list has the potential to become incredibly large without any consideration as to the notability of the firms added.

<dd>I disagree. If an article consists mainly of redlinks, its often about people or organisations that aren't notable enough to warrant their own articles. Since a category only includes subjects of articles, they tend to be about something notable <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 13:14, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The major firms have articles, and we should not be encouraging creation of many more articles about law firms as most of them are of no importance. <a href="../../../p/i/c/User%7EPiccadilly_69e2.html" title="User:Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a> 10:28, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> I tried quite hard to bring some order to this page; establishing minimum criterea for inclusion; linking the lists to third party sources (to try to independently determine importance) - nothing worked. Free advertising is just too alluring for lawyers, and every Sue, Grabbit and Runne in Shitsplatt, Idaho puts their firm's name in there. I agree key law firms should keep their individual article, but a list of law firms article is just too unwieldy and, frankly, too uninteresting, to be worth all the aggravation. It is already covered by <a href="../../../l/a/w/Category%7ELaw_firms_dfd4.html" title="Category:Law firms">Category:Law firms</a>. The other point is that there was never any satisfactory sub-division. Currently it is done by countries, but many firms have offices in multiple countries. And the country approach takes no account of areas of expertise. You would be hard pushed to find a leading human rights law firm on the list. Let's just get rid of it. And let's knock off <i>List of U.S. law firms</i>, <i><a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_UK_law_firms_a843.html" title="List of largest UK law firms">List of largest UK law firms</a></i> and <i>List of Israeli law firms</i> whilst we are at it. <a href="../../../l/e/g/User%7ELegis_951c.html" title="User:Legis">Legis</a> 16:52, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Red links are possible on a list, <i><b>"</b>entire list<b>"</b></i> is <i>not</i> on in the catagory as there are red links. This is an advantage of lists.

<ul>
<li>You asked what on this list could not be represented by a category, "sequels and related works", and "name variations" are exactly the kind of thing lists do well and categories do badly. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 18:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Now, I remember where I've seen your name... You're the editor who de-prods everything. Lists do them just as badly. There was a redlink on the Anime list for Cyber City Oedo. The article was named <a href="../../../c/y/b/Cyber_City_Oedo_808_9ca4.html" title="Cyber City Oedo 808">Cyber City Oedo 808</a>. Most name variations are not important--they'll come up in a search as name variations are supposed to be linked and require redirects to be made. Entries are often made to these lists with no research or searching of the wiki for prior articles what-so-ever. If there is something particularly in need of a variation, the redirect can be categorized. Anime is an extraordinarily well covered topic on Wikipedia--converting these vanilla lists in to categories is no detriment to the wikipedia. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 19:15, 12 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Surely making them less vanilla then would be far better than simply deleting them? The topic page system uses lists, and lists can feature a brief one-sentance description of a subject (whereas currently, catagories cannot - something to change?) <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 20:16, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, once an article is created, it is removed from the request page listing -- <b>and automatically added to the category listing</b>.

<li>So the list served its purpose and now must move on to a higher existence. Wikipedia is constantly changing, and articles that were useful once are superceded by other articles, categories, and so on. This isn't the first article to have this happen, and it likely won't be the last. As for whether or not a Tokyopop category could have been populated without this list, that's just absurd. Plenty of categories haave been populated without a list existing beforehand. Certainly, the list made it easier to populate the category, but that doesn't mean it would have been impossible to do so without the list. ···<a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe"><font color="darkblue">日本穣</font></a><sup><a href="../../../j/a/p/Help%7EJapanese_d024.html" title="Help:Japanese">?</a> · <small><a href="../../../n/i/h/User_talk%7ENihonjoe_488b.html" title="User talk:Nihonjoe"><font color="blue">Talk</font></a> <font color="darkblue">to</font> <a href="../../../n/i/h/User%7ENihonjoe_c4ff.html" title="User:Nihonjoe">Nihon</a><a href="../../../j/a/_/WP%7EJA_dc61.html" title="WP:JA">jo</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><b><font color="darkgreen">e</font></b></a></small></sup> 23:34, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>biased, discredited, false, one sided. gives wrong impression because of the use of the word massacres - not in context. many of the dead are combatants, and none were deliberately targeted. only cited by discredited notorious propogandist Benny Morris, not enough information to put such a list which gives wrong impression for people who won't enter the specifics. Unusual list, not present for other wars. clear biased and POV reason for compling such a list with no encylopedic value. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 13:58, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, obviously</b>. This is a politically-motived listing. Amoruso has not given any of the reasons which are generally accepted as a basis for deletion, and has not given a single example of an error. If the article is biased, there are procedures for fixing the bias. Actually the article is conservative and well-researched. Many of the items link to articles with good quality citations to the academic literature. --<a href="../../../z/e/r/User%7EZero0000_cf31.html" title="User:Zero0000">Zero</a><sup><small><a href="../../../z/e/r/User_talk%7EZero0000_a23c.html" title="User talk:Zero0000">talk</a></small></sup> 14:48, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, it's messed up. Amoruso created a new section in another AfD entry to list this for deletion. I've tried to fix the AfD by giving it an entry, and adding the appropriate templete to the article, but I can't find a way to correct the fact his paragraph is repeated in the log <a href="../../../l/u/r/User%7ELurker_8fe9.html" title="User:Lurker"><span style="background-color:lightblue;color:black">Lurker</span></a> <sup><a href="../../../l/u/r/User_talk%7ELurker_c0e4.html" title="User talk:Lurker"><font color="red"><i>oi!</i></font></a></sup> 15:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Keep but it needs amendment for WP:POV. I think 'massacre' may be an emotive word, but if the incidents happened, they should be recorded. If there are similar incidents on the other side, they should be added to the list rather than the list being removed. Unlike the later Arab-Israeli Wars, the 1948 conflict was in the nature of a civil war. These are often particularly brutal. If there were massacres in wars elsewhere, they may deserve articles, and possibly a list. Peterkingiron 15:31, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Ok, I agree first the genocide term needs to be removed. Furthermore, it IS one sided , check the discussion page of the article. Many of these events aren't referenced by any reliable sources. And you can see the many critics on the discussion page which also refute most of the findings. So like you said, it needs atleast amendement for WP:POV, first by deleting the massacre word. (sorry for the log mixup, don't know how it happened). I've also given many reasons for deleting, acceptable reasons, the most important one that this according to many users in the discussion serves no encyclopedic value and that it is highly misleading. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 16:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b>. Bad faith nomination. This Nominator's edits suggests a strong Israeli POV (edits include changing <b>Arab claims</b> to <b>Arab "claims"</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battleground:_Fact_and_Fantasy_in_Palestine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67961932" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battleground:_Fact_and_Fantasy_in_Palestine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=67961932" rel="nofollow">[38]</a> ).

Plus a lot more suited for AN/I. As for the article, it covers both sides (or should). Notability: this might play a role in "the right of return" claim by the Palestinian side. Furtermore, other historians have researched this subject besides Morris, so there are more sources to cite for willing editors. -- <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Hart_8ceb.html" title="User:Steve Hart">Steve Hart</a> 18:57, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Any bad faith here is only by you, Steve. I've changed "claims" to claims only because I was citing the writer who said this. It wasn't my opinion. <b>You could have mentioned that it is I who wrote claims in the first place&#160;!</b> The whole article was written by me, it was an immediate edit. Therefore that shows bad faith from your side. Secondly, I only put tags where I thought it belonged, I always explained my edits, or nearly always. I removed a tag which was put for spite (a violation in the first place). Unlike some people like you who use pop-ups and damage articles written by Israelis or Jews with no apparent reason. Like a real speedy check said above, the article needs a serious clean up as it is critically one sided, based only on one discredited source, and is misleading and doesn't live up to wikipedia standards. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmoruso_6245.html" title="User:Amoruso">Amoruso</a> 20:31, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This appears to be derived from fanfic set in the <a href="../../../l/i/o/Lion_King_4c83.html" title="Lion King">Lion King</a> world. Searching for the author, Taka Khumbartha, finds nothing relevant and searching for <i>Empire</i> seems unlikely to be helpful. Unable to verify that the novel from which this term is taken exists while purgement + simba finds only this WP article.

It thus has an extremely large potential range, from sung texts dating before 1,000 C.E. in the collection, through the predominantly vocal music of the late mediæval period and Renaissance, up to works offered as public domain and composed in the 20th and 21st centuries. So basic is the voice to musical expression that virtually every notable composer has provided works capable of representation on the site, and the vast majority of music composed before 1700 would be suitable for eventual inclusion, provided copyright issues (similar to <a href="../../../p/r/o/Project_Gutenberg_b9aa.html" title="Project Gutenberg">PG</a>) are met. Moreover the site clearly invites contributions from volunteers (again, <a href="http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/User:Philip_Legge" class="extiw" title="choralwiki:User:Philip_Legge">I myself</a> am a contributor of CPDL editions) to improve its comprehensiveness in all vocal genres (although there is a historical bias towards sacred music), with a long term aim of complete editions of major composers as would be found in university or public library reserve collections.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a collection which the founders and Wikipedia can be proud of. The article is developing nicely, and day by day its content is expanded. It is the most important resource of choral music and it would be a shame if it had to be moved to another place on the web as it is a vast work of hundreds of contributors. However, I agree that content could be improved, but the site has developed so much since it became ChoralWiki that we can see the goal it aims at.

<li>The links pages of NIU and KSU predate the date of the rfd discussion, and should have been taken to account in that discussion. That they were not is incontrovertible evidence that the vote to delete was in error because of insufficient research on the part of those voting for deletion. The sites which list CPDL also list Werner Icking Music Archive, which also has a page, but which has not been nominated for deletion. How does one delete one, but not the other?

<p>No way is every minor bill passed by Congress that, in its entirety, names a building after someone notable.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> What makes this bill notable is that it is the first bill in history that contains an article from Wikipedia. This also gives our Pedia some degree of credibility. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarine_69-71_4b09.html" title="User:Marine 69-71">Tony the Marine</a> 15:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> First of all, I'm an inclusionist. Second of all, I agree with Tony is his assertion of this article's notability.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Inclusion and not exclusion is the key point here. I have seen many fake Wikipedia articles on this website that have survived the test of time. Many of them look like they were practical jokes.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> We need more well researched credible articles not fewer. Why this would be considered for deletion is beyond me. Also I want to be able to research US laws on wikipedia, not to get lawyerese about them, but to find out details like the ones in this article.<a href="../../../l/k/i/User%7ELkinkade_e028.html" title="User:Lkinkade">Lkinkade</a> 18:04, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Marine 69-71, if it's an article about a real law (there are many on wikipedia). I don't see any harm in the fact that it's a <b>minor</b> bill. Wikipedia is not paper. But the article could use better references. --<a href="../../../q/y/d/User%7EQyd_7b48.html" title="User:Qyd">Qyd</a> 19:31, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> A law passed by the US congress is notable and the fact that it has a wikipedia connection is even better.

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Emphatically KEEP</b> - an excellent article about a relevant topic. The bill is the world's first legislative act to cite Wikipedia, and if that isn't encyclopedic (and historic), I don't know what is. I think some folks the deletionist bandwagon had better look for something better to do. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidcannon_cb6f.html" title="User:Davidcannon">David Cannon</a> 21:56, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Normally this would be a pretty marginal topic, but given that it is a first (and especially because it is a first regarding Wikipedia!) it raises its notability quotient above other such bills. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 23:45, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I put on on DYK for precisely the reasons identified by Tony the Marine. Don't think it is vain or overly self-referential. -- <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_202a.html" title="User:Samir (The Scope)"><b>Samir</b></a> <small><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamir_%28The_Scope%29_5ee9.html" title="User talk:Samir (The Scope)">धर्म</a></small> 00:15, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, partially because the WP reference makes it stand out, but I'd probably be inclined to vote keep even aside from that. I do recommend exclusion of Tony's name and user name from the article, though, both to avoid the potential appearance of vanity and in accordance with the general idea of the project as a collective work. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 03:46, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> I believe the article is significant, and the mention of Wikipedia should be left in. Lots of people are discussing the validity of Wikipedia, and whether or not it should be referenced for papers/articles, etc.; if this is indeed the first bill to reference Wikipedia, that's notable. By the way, I find this reference disturbing; Wikipedia is a great place to learn, but a terrible place to cite. CalebNoble 03:57, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Any bill that passes is fair game for inclusion here. I would object if the bill did not pass though (few proposed bills are notable on their own until/if they get passed). --<a href="../../../m/a/v/User%7EMaveric149_24ee.html" title="User:Maveric149">mav</a> 14:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - but, more so for the WP angle the the post office angel. I think post office entries should, generally, be put under that person's page, but I could be swayed the other way on that issue with good arguments.

<li><b>Comment</b> - It quite is something made up in school, maybe one week instead of one day.

<dd>No, I can tell you for sure that it was not made up. Do I really have to find newspaper archives to prove so? The event had a thousand witnesses.

<dd>It was more of a Kingston event than a University event, only half the people there were Queen's students. There is defiantly a history to them, student street parties have been an issue for over fifty years. Being a big deal to one community is enough to make an article notable; if it wasn't I could spend all day putting afd tags on articles about events in other communities (but I won't, that isn't a threat). --<a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArctic.gnome_12d9.html" title="User:Arctic.gnome">Arctic Gnome</a> 20:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Guy, this has naught to do with the previous article. (In fact, until JoshuaZ pointed out that there had been a previous article, I was unaware of the fact). Morey has created much recent controversy regarding Islam, and as such merits an article (hence KC suggesting that one be written). Is the article topical, yes. Are we likely to need it in 10 years? probably not. But the same can be said for at least 10% of our articles. It might be nice if rather than re-AfD, you would wait to see what develops first. Right now, AfD's on an article less than 12 hours old <s>smacks of censorship and bad faith</s> is just wrong. <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim62sch_0484.html" title="User:Jim62sch"><font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF2400">•Jim</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#F4C430">62</font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000000">sch•</font></a> 21:00, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> While I think Jim's comments about censorship and bad faith are innaccurate, note that there were serious keep votes in the previous AfD, and part of the reason it seems to have been deleted was as a reaction to the sockpuppetry by Jason Gastrich. Most importantly, Morey is notable within extreme-right evangelical christianity. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 00:31, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> His book The <i>Islamic Invasion: Confronting The World's Fastest-Growing Religion</i> and the subsequent tract (same content with minor changes) <i>The Moon-God Allah In The Archeology Of The Middle East</i> has started a bit of a trend among right-wing Christian polemics who take his poorly researched weirdness as utter truth, causing a minor flurry of pulpits booming the news that Allah is a pagan moon god. Nonsense, but notable nonsense. Concur w/Guy that deleting Morey would help; that not being a viable option we should have an NPOV article on him for the curious.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Agree that "an article needs work is not criteria for deletion".

<dd><b>Comment:</b> Then the article should qualify that questionable sources say that the Shivalingam is just that. Since a claim has been made (by P.N Oak, a questionable "scholar" I'll admit) to that effect, the article should be kept, but qualified that there is no objective proof that the Shivalingam is a Shivalingam. Bear in mind that certain fanatic elements here are interested in keeping the "purity" of their race/religion from "Kaffirism" and, in the interests of that goal, would cheerily staunch the reporting of any issue, however controvertial it may be, that even suggests that there may have been a proto-Hindu connection with pre-Islamic Arabia (after all, similar elements wiped out a lot of the knowledge of pre-Islamic Arabia for precisely the same reason).<a href="../../../s/u/b/User%7ESubhash_bose_945d.html" title="User:Subhash bose">Netaji</a> 04:09, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Keep this OUT of Black Stone, if you please. It's starting to come into focus for me. The people advancing this theory belong to a particular faction in Indian politics, the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> folk. This is the faction behind the destruction of the Babri Mosque, at Ayodhya -- the mosque was destroyed by people claiming that it had been built on the site of a Hindu temple. Any claim that the Kaaba is built over a Hindu temple is a threat, it seems to me, a threat that the Kaaba could be torn down too. I see no reason to let this sort of political posturing into an encyclopedia article, particularly as the claim doesn't seem to be held by more than a tiny fraction of the Hindutavadis. (At first I thought it was just a lone kook -- the political implications weren't in focus; now I think it's perhaps one anti-Muslim fantasist and followers who would be prepared to support anything that offended Muslims.) If it belongs anywhere, it belongs in the <a href="../../../h/i/n/Hindutva.html" title="Hindutva">Hindutva</a> article. <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora</a> 17:09, 16 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

B) The NYTimes article does mention us - but they screwed up the name spelling it "Casting Words". I don't want to junk up Wikipedia, but if the only problem here is a lack of media, there are a number of other reports - a recent salon article comes to mind: <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/07/24/turks/index_np.html" class="external free" title="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/07/24/turks/index_np.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2006/07/24/turks/index_np.html</a>.

<p>Despite apparent effort and a great many external and internal links, this is still a article which, once NPOV'd and cleaned up, amounts to "the birthday of two important historical figures". Much of the information about the importance of the historical figures in question should be (provided it isn't already) included in <i>their</i> articles: their accomplishments and importance do not confer importance, notability, or paticular significance to their birthdate. — <b><a href="../../../p/d/_/User%7EPd_THOR_e92e.html" title="User:Pd THOR"><span style="color:#CC0000;">pd_THOR</span></a></b> <sup>| <b><a href="../../../p/d/_/User_talk%7EPd_THOR_67ac.html" title="User talk:Pd THOR">=/\=</a></b> | 21:53, 12 August 2006 (UTC)</sup></p>

The Google hits and the above-cited debate in the Darwin talk pages show there's considerable interest in the thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not going to vote on this; although I do think it's a bad-faith nom I agree that it's probably unnecessary list-cruft and fan-cruft. BUT. More important IMO is the fact that, as can be seen by the volatility of a lot of the Simpsons articles (<a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_neologisms_on_The_Simpsons_2683.html" title="List of neologisms on The Simpsons">List of neologisms on The Simpsons</a> is one example), I think all these nominations of articles on Simpsons minutae are a complete waste of time and energy. Because The Simpsons is a current program (in production currently), and has such a large, obsessive and computer-savvy fanbase, it's useless to remove <i>anything</i> from the WP Simpsons World, because every single time an episode airs, dozens of fans of the show (myself included) go to WP with the intention of checking to see if some obscure, listy fact we noticed in the episode was documented in the relevant article(s), and if it isn't, <i>we add it</i>, even if the same fact has been added and removed dozens of times before. This (the Simpsons' AfD nom phenomenon) is at once like trying to exterminate mice with atom bombs (wasteful, destructive, and, ultimately, useless) and trying to hold back a tidal wave with a sandbag (hopelessly inadequate). I therefore implore the community to just <i>leave these articles be</i> <b>for now</b>, because until the show's run is complete, we're just trying to empty the Pacific Ocean with a bucket, and it's a big waste of time. Just MHO, (hopefully) respectfully submitted. Apologies for all the similes. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 04:59, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy KEEP</b> Had I seen this article earlier, I would have voted to delete, but it is WRONG to pop in this AfD nomination so quickly after it survived a previous discussion.

<li><b>Comment</b>: To those who assert this is bad faith nom, I would ask that you please AGF, the only reason I nominated the article was because it was part of a dual listing. It should also be noted that I have remained neutral in this debate. I simply feel that we will benefit from a clear consensus (ie put this issue to bed once and for all) whether that is keep or delete. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 07:09, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I hear what you're saying but I think both your points are without merit. First, if you look at the recently closed AfD, many posters clearly differentiated between the two articles nom'd. Any of those editors could have criticised the double nom, and the closing admin or the nominator could have re-nommed or split the noms if having two together 'poisoned the well' so to speak. That didn't happen. Second, the only way this issue will be 'put to bed once and for all' is if the article is <i>deleted</i>, which IMO indicates a clear agenda on your part. To wit, a 'consensus' to <b>keep</b> would <i>not</i> preclude the article from being nominated again in the future, as can be noted by the numerous articles that are nominated for deletion over and over even after clear conclusions to keep. I respectfully suggest that you chill out on this issue for a bit, and if in 6 weeks or so you still bothered by the 'unclear consensus' of the previous AfD, if in fact you still <i>remember</i> this article&#160;;-) you can submit a nice clean re-nom and no-one will be crying 'bad faith'. <a href="../../../a/n/c/User%7EAnchoress_3b7f.html" title="User:Anchoress">Anchoress</a> 19:50, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> If this article had not been at AfD last week, I would vote "very weak keep". Is the article listcruft? Basically. However, it is cruft for one of the most popular, well-regarded, and influential television shows ever, which makes its cruft a bit more notable. However, my vote is for a speedy keep because the article <i>just survived</i> an AfD (albeit through lack of consensus). Do I think this is a bad-faith nomination? Absolutely, 100% not. Yet I still think it's unfair to ask for consensus on an article for which there was no consensus just a few days prior. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 23:56, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A virtually null <i>stub</i> version of the director's article ("This is a place holder for Bijaya Jena, an actor, producer and director.") was AFD'd at an earlier date; that AFD does <i>not</i> apply to the vastly longer and more detailed version that now exists at her title. I'm withholding judgement on the films, pending further information, but speaking as an admin, the situation is as follows: the director's article is <i>not</i> deletable as things currently stand — if you still think she's non-notable you'll have to conduct a <i>new</i> AFD on the <i>current</i> version. Since her own notability has to be reassessed, her film is <i>not</i> automatically nn. And since I'm not hugely familiar with the <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> film industry, I'm <i>not</i> willing to assert that it's non-notable just because <i>I've</i> never heard of it. <b>No vote</b>; require further information. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 00:29, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
