<dd>I've done some more research and I agree with JROBBO. I think the material should be merged with the Mercy Ministries section of the Youth With A Mission article. I favour a straight merge, but for the closing admin, if it comes down to delete/keep, this is a keep. <b>Sarah</b> 09:43, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Keep or merge</b> per Sarah - I'll lean towards a merge though if we can't get any sources— I had a look again and there isn't too much online besides mentions of the Charity on some web pages (and I don't know where you could find offline sources). <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 05:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep but help us to make the page better</b> I am the contributor who first put this up on Wikpedia and I am still learning the ropes. Some coaching would be welcome. I have put in some cross referneces and rewritten sections of the article, I trust that this will set skeptical minds at rest. In answer to Kevin's comment on our financials - true we have few assets - we give everything we can away. The article about the millionth dollar clearly says that it is talking of funds donated over the past seven years. Our momentum is such that we should give away a million dollars every 2-3 years now. Yes we are part of Youth With A Mission but we are seperately run entity and to merge us into the larger YWAM pages would deny us the distinctive place we have cut for ourselves in Mercy Ministries - we are known as ARMS before we are recognised as being part of YWAM.<a href="../../../o/z/m/User%7EOzmercy_87be.html" title="User:Ozmercy">Ozmercy</a> 12:47, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sorry I may have put my comments on the wrong end of the debate and am not sure of the etiquet of moving them once they have been uploaded. I think we have addressed notability issues.<a href="../../../o/z/m/User%7EOzmercy_87be.html" title="User:Ozmercy">Ozmercy</a> 01:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I will not make any further defense of who we are after this, you guys will have to do whatever it you are going to do, but I am surprised at some of the above comments. for instance I not sure why Sarah says that the article does say that ARMS is part of YWAM when the opening statement of the article reads <i>Australian Relief &amp; Mercy Services Ltd (ARMS) is a Christian aid and development organization that cares for the poor and needy both within Australia and overseas and is the mercy ministry arm of Youth With A Mission in Australia. The organization was founded in Canberra in 1988.</i> and links to the YWAM page.</p>
<p>With regards to the comments made about our budget size - regular NGOS have admin fees of 30% + that pay wages etc - we do not pay wages- all of our staff pay for their own travel - so effectively our budget could be measured as 30% higher than what it is - even though we have a small budget - our influence in some sectors of the industry is significant. Are we notable? I think so. But money and budget size does not define notability. Have we shown outside sources and news articles - yes. Do we seek organizational fame no. A lot of what we do we quickly and well. When we were in Iraq at the out break of the war we were the first western NGO to be operational in Iraq. The officer in charge of the Humaniatrain operations center medical response commended us on our work and ability to make a quick response - but there were no news articles about it, other than those we generated ourselves - but self praise is usually seen as no recommendation. When we were in Aceh Australian TV news covered our work in the refugee camps there and credited it to another agency who used the footage to fund raise for themselves nationally. We did the work but because of the inappropriate actions of others we lost the opportunity to tell our own story, as the Australian public saw that incident as being someone else. We find these things sad, but we are still detemined to do the work God has called us to whether any one recognises it or not. Thanks for taking time to comment on our aticle, I look forward to your final decision.<a href="../../../o/z/m/User%7EOzmercy_87be.html" title="User:Ozmercy">Ozmercy</a> 10:24, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
