<dd>my "vandalism" was to revert. npov presents all ideas sympathetically without implying that they are right or wrong ... but then provides substantive counterpoints by mainstream scientists to explain WHY they are wrong. copyeditor deliberately twisted the intro into his pet caricature of creationism, and stripped out all the qualifiers to show exactly where the issue is. he then made a mockery of all the links. no go, bro. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 12:58, 7 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You and me were talking different languages. I don't think it makes sense to discuss with you because I don't speak Ungtssese, so I stopped doing it. For example, you seem to think that "exquisite design" can be "good" or "bad", and "A, therefore B" is the same as "B, therefore A". Since you don't try to make yourself clear, your position seems to change every few minutes. Or maybe it <b>does</b> change every few minutes, I'm not in a position to know. It's a pain to discuss somebody like that. Anyway, you couldn't explain how the page is a strawman. You ended up claiming that I knew it is a strawman, which is not true.

<dd><i>this page is really getting places.</i> -- If by getting places you mean mired in quicksand.</dd>
<dd><i>we're starting to get cited opinions on all the relevent issues,</i> not even close. Look at the talkpages if you don't believe me. The current incarnation of the page is that only creationists are allowed to write on the creationist side -- there's no editorial control and it's impossible to make heads or tails of some of the incomplete arguments.</dd>
<dd><i>this page has a great deal of potential to be encyclopedic, if we're willing to explore the ideas on their own merits.</i> -- nonsense. The minority creationist view has a lot of shrill malarky but if it cannot even be presented in a consistent way, how will there be anything like an NPOV comparison?</dd>
<dd><i>i will only say that i have only presented creationist opinions on the creationist side</i> --&gt; I disagree entirely. Ungtss presents his own version of creationist opinions. This isn't anything like an NPOV -- even of creationism. He maintains the strict right to edit out opinions that I know exist in the creationist community but are inconvenient for him to accept. For example, I know that the vast majority of YEC accept a biblical inerrancy, but because Ungtss is one of those peculiar ones who don't, he somehow thinks it inappropriate to include this argument (which is made more often than not by people who are YEC) on that side. However, Flood Geology is trumpeted as if every creationist believes it. That's certainly not the case, there are some creationists that don't think all geological features were created by the flood like Ungtss believes. If this page were to be honest, it would be called "Views of Ungtss and mainstream scientists compared": is that encyclopedic?</dd>
<dd><i>all other mainstream editors are welcome to present the mainstream side as powerfully as they like.</i> -- Does anyone else find it problematic that we are setting up a place in wikipedia where people aren't allowed to edit?</dd>
<dd><i>i only ask that the creationist side not be weighed down by mainstream caricatures and deletions of creationist ideas.</i> -- according to Ungtss' own POV of what that entails. It's clear that the page should be deleted and Ungtss has no ability to see the problem of this false dichotomy.</dd>
<dd>It must be very encouraging for the creationist to be able to present his POV without having to worry about someone who actually studies the stuff edit it. That seems to be Ungtss' goal for this page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 17:36, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>all groundless and untrue accusations aside, the talkpage shows that josh's stated goal for this page has been to "make it look ridiculous" from the very beginning. well, it appears he's succeeded. i only hope mainstream scientists who have their heads on straight will be willing to develop this page into something good -- and i do think it has the potential to be something very, very good. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 18:30, 30 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The debate is ridiculous. The page, if it were to be done correctly would look ridiculous. This is because there is so much more to put down from a scientific perspective than there is from a creationist perspective. Ungtss doesn't seem to realize that people other than himself are familiar with creationist arguments and the current format discourages them from editting the creationist POV...</dd>

<dd>there are indeed people familiar with creationist ideas, but you're certainly not one of them. you've devoted yourself to caricaturing and deleting creationist ideas on the page, and adding loads of irrelevent information to the mainstream column, making it looking equally ridiculous. if the debate is ridiculous, i can't help but wonder why you take such an interest in it ... especially in light of the fact that there are many other evolutionists who think that the page is a great means of allowing the truth of mainstream science to put creationist pseudoscience to shame. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 02:16, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Maybe it's symptomatic of your idealization that NPOV means treating all opinions as though they are equals. Your opinion, sir, based entirely on non-science, is frankly not worthy of NPOV inclusion.

<dd>As another creationist editor of the page, I would strongly disagree with this. It is Joshuaschroeder who persists in turning the creationist views into a caricature, consistent with his stated aim of making the page look ridiculous.
<dl>
<dd>Phil and Ungtss have demonstrated that they don't even the most basic of science (for example they make claims on radiometric dating that are absolutely absurd). How can we have a constructive article writing if the writers of the article who are supposed "experts" don't know science? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 07:04, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Translation: Phil<b>ip</b> and Ungtss make claims that you don't agree with, so you accuse us of not [knowing?] science and accuse the claims of being absurd.</dd>
<dd>I didn't make claims for radiometric dating. I cited claims made by creationary <i>scientists</i> (including physicists). Joshuaschroeder seems to think that if it doesn't agree with the POV that he sides with, it isn't science and shouldn't be on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<dd>&lt;&lt;<i>It lists all the claims and actually cites them instead of the monstrosity we have here.</i>&gt;&gt;</dd>
<dd>I rewrote the section on radiometric dating to list the claims of creationists, citing essentially every one, and Joshuaschroeder deleted virtually all of them because he thought they were ridiculous. He didn't dispute that creationists claim them; he disputed that these creationist arguments have any merit. Any wonder Ungtss would rather he stick to the mainstream science side?
<dl>
<dd>There are creationist who also claim that the earth is the center of the universe (see <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modern_geocentrism.html" title="Modern geocentrism">Modern geocentrism</a>). Yet their claims aren't included. Why? Because they are nonsense (as they are shown to be in the referenced article). Likewise, putting in lies and non-facts is hardly encyclopedic with regards to presentation. And it is a bald-faced lie that I deleted all of them. But then, creationists do tend to break the commandment to not bear false witness. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 07:04, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The article is not <i>exhaustive</i>, so not mentioning something means little unless the possibility of mentioning it has been suggested and rejected, which I don't believe to be the case here. And geocentricism is only accepted by relatively few creationists, so <i>may</i> not warrant mentioning in an article <i>about creationists' views</i>. Wikipedia is supposed to take a NPOV, and it is disputed that some of the things Joshuaschroeder calls "lies and non-facts" are in fact that.</dd>
<dd>His view of NPOV is clearly that if the majority of scientists consider it to be fact, then those "facts" can be presented as true regardless of the existence of opposing views, and contrary to Wikipedia <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Introduction" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV policy</a> ("... we should fairly represent all sides of a dispute, and not make an article state, imply, or insinuate that any one side is correct.").</dd>
<dd>As for his claim that it is a "bald-faced lie that [he] deleted all of them", I actually said that he deleted <i>virtually</i> all of them.</dd>

Creationists argue that their views are as scientific as evolutionary ones; your claim to the contrary is merely a disputed POV. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<dd>By opposing "creationism" to "mainstream science", the article title suggests that creationism is a scientific POV.

<dd>Opposing "creationism" to "mainstream science" suggests that creationism is <i>opposed</i> to mainstream science. But if you can come up with a better title that doesn't suggest the opposite POV, that creation is <i>not</i> science, be my guest. And I disagree with you that calling creationism science is ridiculous, but this is supposed to be about the merits of the article, and our respective POVs should be <i>irrelevant</i> to that. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J.

<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>, possibly move to a better title. The thing is too long and its current formatting is awful. But it is a compendium of useful information, too valuable to just delete. It is obviously also a source of some bad will.<br />
The main problem seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding between the editors. Some don't understand that creation can't be proved or disproved by science and that the debate is purely about whether <i>available information</i> supports the view that the universe was created by design or not. Others insist that certain assumptions of science are necessarily true, when they are in fact just tools that allow us to make sense of the world and may as well be wrong. This can't be a discussion between scientists and creationists on the existence of a god and the uniformian assumption - these are not falsifiable and are thus not a good subject for scientific debate. <a href="../../../z/o/c/User%7EZocky_c719.html" title="User:Zocky">Zocky</a> 15:19, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not because this article is inherently going to be POV or flamebait or whatever, but because it is nothing close to an encyclopedia article. It is a set of two lists placed in parallel which, while serving as a wonderful metaphor for the actual Creation vs. Evolution debate in that they don't really seem to be talking to one another at all, is not a proper format for a Wikipedia article under any conceivable model. The other problem, that having only two literal columns, and thus only two categories, restricts all opinions to a simple one-or-the-other (the "all scientists"/"all creationists" problem) is another consideration, but ultimately I think that the article is unencyclopedic as is, and has no possibility of being encyclopedic—to make it an encyclopedia article would mean to make it an article on the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution controversy</a>, which already exists.

If X is not a "mainstream" view, the X article should say so, and should summarize the debate between X and the "mainstream" views. Anybody reading about a non-mainstream X shouldn't have to go hunting for the "Comparison of X with the mainstream views" to find out why and what the "mainstream" has to say about X. If the X article does not have this comparison of views, then it is POV propaganda for X, and if it does then the "Comparison" article is redundant. If the X article gets to be too long, it is very doubtful that the best way in general to split it up is to remove the section contrasting X to mainstream views. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:00, 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- Consider how one distinguishes a Wiki article from a forum argument. I suggest that a forum will accommodate ongoing discussions, with no intention to reach a state of completion, but that it should in principle be possible to complete a Wiki article – that is, to have it include virtually all relevant information in an NPOV form at some particular time. I can’t see how this article could ever reach a state of “completion”, since the debate is ongoing. It is far better to report the present state of the debate in related articles. For the same sorts of reasons, the article will never be “comprehensive”. Furthermore the article assumes that each side of the debate has some agreed account of their position that can be set against the view of the opposing party. This is not the case. Plainly creationists disagree with each other, and scientists disagree with other scientists.

<li><b>Delete</b> it. To be NPOV and fit its title, the righthand column would need to include the entire output of the sciences of biology, geology, astronomy and physics, to name a few. This is "things creationists dispute with science and what science has to say about them" masquerading under a more NPOV title. I think there <i>is</i> a case for an article that does list the problems creationists have with science but it would need to be <i>meticulously</i> sourced -- not a list of "some say this, some say that", and it should certainly not be presented as a dispute <i>within</i> science, which it is not.<a href="../../../d/r/_/User%7EDr_Zen_e6e6.html" title="User:Dr Zen">Dr Zen</a> 00:02, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> for reasons mentioned above, and more. Most importantly (which I don't think anyone has mentioned), the title seems to me highly inappropriate for any Wikipedia content. Wikipedia does not "compare" views, as that would be original research. Rather, we report the views of creationists and the views of evolutionists, and let the reader compare. Article's contents seems to be setting up some false dichotomy between "mainstream scientists" and "creationists" (with a disclaimer that not all creationists agree with whoever's opinions are in this article). <a href="../../../t/u/f/User%7ETUF-KAT_8b83.html" title="User:TUF-KAT">Tuf-Kat</a> 00:14, Jan 14, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Wikipedia most certainly does compare views - that's one of the cornerstones of the NPOV concept. As long as this article maintains this, than it's acceptable. The subject matter is one of those things 100% of the people will never agree upon, so therefore the "disputed" disclaimer at the top is fair. I do feel the article needs to be retitled somehow; as it stands I don't believe it's NPOV enough. However I can't think of another title at the moment that wouldn't come off worse. <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 07:10, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> The <i>article</i> is horrendous, the comparison of views is just a hide-behind for a creationist endeavor to paint a false dichotomy. There is science and then there is pseudoscience. Creationism isn't an alternative scientific theory: it is one of many alternatives to science. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 20:51, 14 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>keep</b> but only if it can be agreed to set up guidelines for NPOV in such articles. Please interpret my vote as <b>delete</b> if no such agreement can be reached. See <a href="../../../n/p/o/Wikipedia%7ENPOV_%28Comparison_of_views_in_science%29_b25b.html" title="Wikipedia:NPOV (Comparison of views in science)">wikipedia:NPOV (Comparison of views in science)</a> for a first attempt at such guidelines. This is a set of guidelines on NPOV in articles making comparisons between scientific or pseudoscientific positions. I believe that if those guidelines were strictly adhered to (and perhaps a few more sensible ones added) it would be possible to create an article such as this without it becoming NPOV. This topic is dealt with very badly in the web as a whole and it would be great if wikipedia could cover it properly and in an NPOV manner. I think the current version is heavily biased towards the creationist viewpoint but I do not think it is inevitable that this be so. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarnaby_dawson_0c30.html" title="User:Barnaby dawson">Barnaby dawson</a> 09:25, 15 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>The problem is that the most balanced treatment on the web to date is the talkorigins archive [www.talkorigins.org]. The creationists, however, think that it isn't balanced at all. <i>If</i> there is to be a debate at all, it has to be in the form of an exhaustive rendering of facts and a willingness (as expressed by the maintainers of the archive) to be constantly vigilant in keeping up to date on the latest creationist fad.</dd>
<dd>If this page is kept, it will either degenerate in a free-for-all posting of whatever flight-of-fancy creationists feel like pursuing with the scientifically-minded scurrying to find the appropriate niche-counter for their nonsense or it will be a complete repeat of the talkorigins archive. Either way, I'm not sure it behooves wikipedia to engage in a rehash of a very tired "debate".</dd>
<dd>My main point, however, is that this isn't really a "debate" at all. There are many alternatives to the scientific mainstream and to post a "debate" as such makes it seem like the only alternative is creationism. More than this, the current slant of the article is definitely YEC in flavor, which is only one type of creationism in general.</dd>
<dd>What we need to do is cleanup the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a> article and get away from this necessarily POV fork. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 06:01, 16 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Many good points have been made above in criticizing this page. However, we should keep this page to reflect the history of this debate accurately. Mr. Rossami argues that this page should be merged and redirected to <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a>. But this page is a breakout of the detail of that debate and has a totally different advantage for the reader--namely, to present data in a table. Mr. Schroeder suggests that the talk.origins site duplicates the function of this page, but it does not--because the talk.origins page presents only the right hand column--the mainstream science rebuttal to the creationist nonsense in the left column.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Untrue. The talkorigins archive contains references to all the nonsense (how else could they critique it? <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 18:32, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Mr. Bconline complains that this page does not honor properly the scientific view. But this is not the SciencePedia, this is Wikipedia, and <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> at least requires that the creationists should get to state accurately the documented history of their nonsense view of the world--which in my view this page does quite well. The page is getting there. 8)) As Mr. Zen complains, this page does not yet have the citations to scholarly publications. We will do that--and we will eliminate the original research that does not have citations to scholarly publications. But let's get the comparison of views first. Mr. Rossami suggests this page presents a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_dichotomy.html" title="False dichotomy">false dichotomy</a>, but it does not. This page merely tabulates the contrasting views in the debate. Nowhere on the page does it imply that you have to pick one or the other--quite the opposite. The parent page at <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation_vs._evolution_debate.html#A_continuum_of_approaches_to_creation_and_evolution" title="Creation vs. evolution debate">Creation vs. evolution debate</a> makes clear that there is a whole continuum of views in the debate from "Young earth creationism" to "Materialist evolutionism" (Scott 1997).</p>
<dl>
<dd>This is baloney because there is no way in the side-by-side format to decide where a nuanced view or a view that's not creationist but extra-scientific should go! <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 18:32, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>Along that continuum, there is less and less disagreement between the creationist view and the mainstream view as you move from the extreme of "Young earth creationism" toward the other extreme of "Materialist evolutionism." Accordingly, the Views of creationists and mainstream scientists compared page merely tabulates the observed differences where the empirical data indicates differences. I definitely agree with Mr. Dawson that we should consider seriously the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_%28Comparison_of_views_in_science%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_%28Comparison_of_views_in_science%29" rel="nofollow">proposed</a> Wikipedia guidelines for tabulating comparisons of science with nonsense. The issue here is how to treat nonsense in a legitimate <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> manner. ---<a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> | <a href="../../../r/e/d/User_talk%7ERednblu_c10b.html" title="User talk:Rednblu">Talk</a> 16:32, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I think <a href="../../../r/e/d/User%7ERednblu_9100.html" title="User:Rednblu">Rednblu</a> is evaluating a hypothetical article and not the one that currently exists. How are we going to decide what constitutes a reference that we can use as part of the argument? Creationists have views that range from the most absurdist miracle-based ideologies to technical disparaging based on physical misconceptions. To reasonably do the "NPOV" suggested here would mean the article would stretch out ad infinitum. How would anybody decide what was reasonable to include and what wasn't?</dd>
<dd>Much of what the argument against creationism is is that there is a VAST body of scientific evidence against them. I could begin posting public domain sources of the hundreds of thousands of rocks that have been consistently dated to counter the claims that the creationists make against isochron dating. However, this obviously isn't in Wikipedia's best interest.
<dl>
<dd>i'm not editing the page because it looks like it's about to be deleted. the fact that you think the left column is nonsense does not make lining that nonsense up with scientific truth pov -- if anything, it should make the left column look like nonsense in the light of the truth. i think this page could serve the purpose of getting the "issues" of the debate off the debate page and into a side-by-side comparison, so the debate page can consider more of the "big picture" issues, and it's only as long as we make it. <a href="../../../u/n/g/User%7EUngtss_3d2c.html" title="User:Ungtss">Ungtss</a> 19:09, 20 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In short, those who are crying NPOV for keeping the article haven't really thought the issue out.

<li>No, it <i>is</i> masquerading as fact. Where people came to it from is irrelevant. The article boldly states that "Sgt. Angelo Dante [is the] oldest member of the 15th Alpha Tactical Armored Corp.", "Dana Sterling puts everything on the line", and "Dante keeps a cool head and does not take unnecessary risks.". <i>All of these things are presented as facts, but are not facts.</i> There <i>is no</i> Sergeant Angelo Dante (or at least no notable one). There <i>is no</i> "15th Alpha Tactical Armored Corp". There <i>is no</i> (notable) Dana Sterling. And the behaviours of these non-existent people are themselves non-existent, too. <i>Every single sentence</i> in this article is false.

<li>Fictional and false are not synonyms. These things do exist, within a fictional construct seen by millions of viewers. This is not the same thing as a hoax, which is just a bunch of crap made up by some random newbie and maybe his friends too. Frankly these semantic games seem to be justifying an initial mistaken first impression. It's just silly because no one is disputing this is a bad article which needs to be disposed of in some manner, but we shouldn't throw around terms like "vanity" and "hoax" which clearly do not apply.

<dd>I don't know much about him because I don't listen to commercial radio stations because I can't stand adverts, but he's famous enough for me to have heard of him nonetheless. It is destcutive of the ulility of the category system to shove subjects of one type (a person) into an article of a totally different type (a radio station). If something is famous enough that someone might look them up for non-personal reasons, which is certainly the case here, he deserves an article. If you are American, you may not appreciate how prominent national radio presenters are in the UK, where radio is much closer to the status of TV than it is in the US. <a href="../../../p/c/p/User%7EPcpcpc_25a4.html" title="User:Pcpcpc">Philip</a> 02:23, 5 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I am the original author of this article, and I intended it as a stub. This is a about a well know Jewish school in New York, and information about its history. I would like to put information about the town it is named after, but very little is known. However, many people are researching this information, and it would add to the historical perspective, as many Jewish schools take their names from the towns in which they or their founders originated.</li>

<li>Terminal ballistics is already a large article, and deals with larger artillery, in addition to fire arms. Stopping power is an important and well used term in the vernacular. And there is a huge amount of research over the last century on this topic, see <a href="../../../m/1/6/M16_%28rifle%29.html" title="M16 (rifle)">M16</a> and <a href="../../../f/l/e/Flechette.html" title="Flechette">Flechette</a> for example.

<li><b>Keep</b>, too different to merge with the very general <a href="../../../t/e/r/Terminal_ballistics.html" title="Terminal ballistics">terminal ballistics</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but feel free to disregard this vote; as the original author (with an account, finally), I can hardly be considered unbiased. The vast majority of information in the article is indeed from Dr. Fackler. Exact citations are difficult since very little of his writing is available on the web, and I have no hard copies. The links section links to what little there is, though.

Just because no other encyclopedia would have this article doesn't prove that the article is bad: it shows that Wikipedia is exceptional. <a href="../../../e/j/e/User%7EEje211_5793.html" title="User:Eje211">Eje211</a> 23:41, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This isn't really an encyclopedia topic. What can it say? "Alien languages are languages spoken by aliens in science fiction stories. Some science fiction authors have constructed languages for the alien characters in their works. Example. Example. Example." That, in fact, is the gist of the first part of the article. The second part of the article is a bit of philosophy of language speculation/original research as to whether we could ever translate an alien language, in case there are real aliens who speak languages. A lot has been written in philosophy about the issue of translation, but a topic on "Alien Language" isn't where I would expect to find a discussion of this work. On top of all this, this article just duplicates material that is in <a href="../../../f/i/c/Fictional_languages.html" title="Fictional languages">Fictional languages</a> and <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constructed_languages.html" title="Constructed languages">Constructed languages</a>.

It's not taking up space required for more scholarly entries, I tried to make the entry dryly humourous, and if people are interested in it, what's the problem?

<li><b>Delete</b>. Firkin pubs are definitely not notable! They are a commercial chain of pretty un-unique proportions. Moreover there are, and have been, many more pubs in the Midlands of England which are far more worthy of inclusion than this one. (eg Barbarella's, The Golden Eagle, Bogarts, The Railway etc..) And yet even they are not included nor do they really deserve to be... --<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 14:18, 2 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>I really don't understand this attitude of certain things not 'deserving' to be included. I mean, surely the ideal encylopedia would have information on absolutely everything and anything imaginable! Your normal encylopedia has issues of physical size, and the time its authors must take to research and write an article,- things must be limited, so the concept of 'deserving' inclusion is relevant. Neither of these restrictions apply to Wikipedia, so what's the fuss? Why are people so desperate for an article to get deleted? And, even if you don't see the logic in what I just said, if the Slayer song 'Angel of Death' warrants it's own, multi-paragraph, entry, practically anything does.

<li><b>Delete</b>. IMDB lists a few films, none of which appear to have any business data connected with them (which suggests no wide distribution). The only person who bothered to review any of them said they were terrible as well. Since IMDB lets you list any film ever, being on it isn't an indication of notability any more than having your name on, say, one scientific journal paper makes you a notable scientist. <a href="../../../a/v/e/User%7EAverage_Earthman_c2cf.html" title="User:Average Earthman">Average Earthman</a> 14:08, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My understanding of it is that IMDB will list any film that is available to the public, even if that's straight to video. Look at their FAQ. It's not a strenuous requirement for notability, because they're a database, not an encyclopedia.

<li>No Google hits at all for "Power Rangers Toons" or "Divatoxine", and Power Rangers being the popular fad they are this probably means the show didn't exist.

<li>I had originally created the table for use on the British House of Commons paged but it was opted to be removed as that page was already very large.

I agree that this is a misnomer if it is passed off as a seating plan but is a useful tool in visualizing the strength of the labour majority and that of the other parties. I does not suggest that there is a crossbench but points out that it is impossible for all members to sit on the benches should they all be present in the chamber and that they would have to rush between the benches towards the table.

<li><b>Weak Indecision</b>. How accurate is this factually? As others have said, there is no seating plan <i>per se</i> in the UK House of Commons. There is, as far as I am aware, a government side (to the house) and a non-government side. Likewise, the figures of actual seats: are these correct? I'm not sure - and it's not overly easy to find out. These figures change often too: deaths and by-elections and so on. ON THE OTHER HAND, I like the idea of a graphical representation of the Political strengths in the House.

On General Election nights, the U.K. television news services draw these kinds of diagrams, but they are merely representational, being pretty much glorified pie charts, rather than actual accurate plans. The news services, too, have the problem of what to do when the number of government or opposition members exceeds the capacity of that side of the chamber.

<dd>I've notice a lot of people who regularly vote to have articles deleted do so because "it's not notable enough for me", forget that their personal opinion is not a sufficiently objective benchmark by which to judge subjects with which they are usually largely unfamiliar; such articles are <i>almost always</i> "notable enough" for <i>other</i> people - otherwise they wouldn't exist in the first place. Encyclopedias can and should be full of all manner of so-called "obscure" data. That is their primary value as a research tool. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 22:33, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No it's not. An encyclopaedia is meant to be <b>useful</b>. Wikipedia is also not a general database, so including every "obscure data" is not policy.

<dd>OK, fair enough. Let's assume that there is some information which is worth keeping (call it "obscure") and some which is not (call it "trivia"). The question then, I think, comes down to where is the dividing line between trivia and obscure data. Can it be anything other than a judgment call, i.e. opinion? Or is your claim that such a dividing line doesn't exist; that there is no information which is so trivial as to not be worth including? --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 23:55, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Got it in one. One person's "trivia" is another person's "priceless data". Articles about famous scientists, dead European monarchs and 2000 year-old religious controversies are not inherently "better" than articles about high schools, railway stations or Congolese paddle steamers merely because the latter subjects might be considered mundane by most people. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 02:52, 1 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and Cleanup</b>. The article (and the whole series) needs some major cleanup, and standing on its own it's kind of pointless, but in context it's interesting and notable.

<li><b>Merge</b> if it isn't going to be expanded.

<dd>If this was the only article in the series, I'd agree with you.

I think consistancy of presentation argues for leaving the shorter ones as they are. It might be worthwhile reviewing the names of the individual articles in the series to make them a bit more uniform (i.e. "sailing frigates" vs. "sail frigates"). --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 15:56, 31 Jan 2005 (UTC)</dd>
