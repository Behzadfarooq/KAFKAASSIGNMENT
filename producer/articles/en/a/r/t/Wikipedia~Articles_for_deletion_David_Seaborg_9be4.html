<dd>Okay then it is the same guy. So he's a human interest figure in San Francisco then. Human interest figures in LA have been deleted and that's a bigger town. Most of the other stuff cited on him is just that he's in a list of protesters. As his name his famous they might have just noted he was in the group due to that. At best he's of local northern California interest. If he gets elected to something in San Francisco maybe he'll merit an article.--<a href="../../../t/2E/_/User%7ET._Anthony_6578.html" title="User:T. Anthony">T.

<li><b>Agreed</b>. The alternative is to close this AfD and renominate it so we can vote on the merits of the wiki article, not the nominator.

<li>Okay, this is actually a <b>delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. If I (the article's author, from some time back) were to try and defend this as notable (and I am not necessarily doing that), I would say something like: "A child of a notable person is obviously not, for that reason, notable. However, it could plausibly be argued that if the otherwise possibly unnotable child has done something relating to the notability of the parent which is in some way quite interesting, it could make it notable. In this instance, it is somewhat interesting that the son of the discoverer of plutonium, and head of the AEC, became an anti-nuclear activist." But that would probably be a stretch. Anyway, it is just a little stub, Wikipedia will be no better or worse off no matter what happens to it, in my opinion; I have really no investment either way, and I am not writing this in any sort of remorseful tone. In all reality I'm not sure why I wrote the article in the first place -- I must have been making some edit's to his father's article and thought, "Oh, I'll throw the son in too." Not much of a reason, in retrospect! --<a href="../../../f/a/s/User%7EFastfission_730f.html" title="User:Fastfission">Fastfission</a> 02:22, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I never made any secret that I was asked, because I really cannot see what the problem is with that. Any other site would be happy to make new recruits. If you compare and contrast this to something like Reggie Finley's site, I have to say that there I was never treated as less than equal because I was new. The fact that that has happened here I find disgusting. I don't treat people like that who turn up on my groups and sites. And another thing, David, as you, being a co-moderator of that group are very well aware, the Google2 Beta group called maleboge.org also has been recruiting people into Wikipedia to beef up your side. So if you think that this "meatpuppetry" - a phrase I never heard anywhere but on this particular site - is so wrong in your view (remember, it isn't in my opinion) then aren't you the more to be blamed for being implicated in it than I am? You are in my experience one of the more fair-minded people on your side, so I hope you'll take due account of that point. Uncle Davey 10:02, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Why do you insist on polarising this as sides. I don't know what you mean about recruiting. Possibly there was commentary but since all involved had been active in wikipedia for a while (except WarriorScribe) i don't see whom was recruited to where. You'll have to be more specific. In some cases i was recruited to articles by Jason Gastrich himself. You can see that on my talk page. Ironic isn't it. More often than not newbies are helped a lot by the community. Your appearance in less than neutral territory, with a metaphorical gun, no less, meant you lost your honeymoon period. I am certain that if you leave Gastrichs shadow you will get the welcome you deserve. <a href="../../../d/a/y/User%7EDaycd_676d.html" title="User:Daycd">David D.</a> <a href="../../../d/a/y/User_talk%7EDaycd_ee80.html" title="User talk:Daycd">(Talk)</a> 10:12, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><em>Uncle Davey:I have to say that there I was never treated as less than equal because I was new. The fact that that has happened here I find disgusting.</em> I'm sorry to hear that you are disgusted. However, wikipedia has policies, and one of these is that votes of new users are usually discounted in controversial or close votes for deletion. Hopefully, you can understand why the policy is here: if it wasn't: (a) votes for deletion would be vulnerable to sockpuppets (b) votes for deletion would turn into campaigning contests, testing which side can garner more personal friends to go and vote. Anyway, I'm afraid the policy is not up for vote or for a debate here. If you are interested in debating the policy, please go to <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia_talk%7EGuide_to_deletion_ea48.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia_talk:Guide_to_deletion</a> --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a> 14:00, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>:Please note that this user (<a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">User:Usenetpostsdotcom</a>) is a suspected sockpuppet of <a href="../../../j/a/s/User%7EJason_Gastrich_9b2e.html" title="User:Jason Gastrich">Jason Gastrich</a>, the same user who started this AFD. Mr. Gastrich was the one who created "Uncle Davey"'s User Page, and that page consists of the same text as that of another of Mr. Gastrich's suspected sockpuppets (<a href="../../../w/i/g/User%7EWiggins2_f047.html" title="User:Wiggins2">User:Wiggins2</a>). -<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColin_Kimbrell_f9c3.html" title="User:Colin Kimbrell">Colin Kimbrell</a> 14:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Mr Kimbrell, this is demonstrably not the case. Please withdraw your comment. If you actually go to the website whose name is not so subtly encoded in my nym, you will see that I don't look at all like him, and you will also find ways to e-mail me. If you or any nominee of yours wishes to e-mail me with their telephone number, then I will ring them up and you can decide for yourselves whether I can even talk like a Californian, or whether I am the limey living in Poland that I claim to be. If you are so poor at checking your assertions as you have been in my case, then may I ask what business you have editing an encyclopedia? Uncle Davey 18:56, 24 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>
