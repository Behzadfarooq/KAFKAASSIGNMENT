<dd><b>Comment</b> The standard for inclusion of a neologism is a bit higher than simple passing references to the word. Either the word needs to have spread into massive widespread usage, or it needs to be discussed in secondary sources as a new word that--for example, an article that discusses the new word as a concept that's gaining acceptance. In any of the sources that you mentioned above, how is the word used? (I'm not against including it, I just want to see some stronger examples of where it's used.) <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 21:26, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Looking at those book through Amazon's "Search Inside" feature, "A Hacker Manifesto" and "Images of Organization" only have one hit for the term - the bibliographical listing of the book's name. Zizek's "Organs without Bodies" discusses the book and its concept for several pages in order to criticize/mock the authors' ideas as "a supreme example of cyber-Stalinism". <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 03:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete without prejudice to re-creation</b> I looked at the amazon.com references mentioned above, but those aren't really references.

However, it was soon discovered that much of the content was a copyright violation. Currently it is only a list of Law enforcement agencies in Westchester. Alternatives to deletion could include: moving to List of law enforcement agencies in Westchester County or integrated back into the main <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westchester_County%2C_New_York_0dbc.html" title="Westchester County, New York">Westchester County, New York</a> article. <a href="../../../2/4/f/User%7E24fan24.html" title="User:24fan24">24fan24</a> 18:24, 27 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Nothing</b> to indicate that this product stand out from countless other bits of software. The only print we're provided with is from the zdnet <u>blogs</u>, hardly the multiple/non-trivial/independant coverage. The length of time that this was previously on afd, rolled around on drv, and now back to here starts to add up... It's been consistantly claimed that this <i>could</i> have sources added that show its notability, but oddly that is not happening.

<dd><b>Comment</b> It doesn't have to "stand out" as you put it, merely be in either widespread usage or talked about in other media. That much was obvious from the google search. Frankly I don't care enough about the product/company to edit the article and add sources--I'll leave that to people more knowledgeable about it. I just don't think that deletions should be fired off soley on the basis of poor sourcing, which can be improved over time. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 23:35, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm not trying to be argumentative, just tossing it around, but "Obvious from Google" has been said often and led nowhere. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">The guideline</a> is clear: <i>All topics must meet a minimum threshold of notability in order for an article on that topic to be included in Wikipedia.</i> If <u>no one</u> cares enough about this topic to find and add in sources, it should not simply lie around until the day when someone might. I'll withdraw from the floor now, to let others speak. - <a href="../../../a/a/r/User_talk%7EAaron_Brenneman_c3ff.html" title="User talk:Aaron Brenneman"><font color="black">brenneman</font></a> 23:45, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I didn't think you were arguing. One thing I'd like to state, in addition to what's been said thus far, is that a lack of interest on behalf of the particular editors who happen to watch <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_T_b947.html" title="WP:AFD/T">WP:AFD/T</a> to fix an article is not a reason to delete the article either. WP does have facilities such as {{or}} and {{fact}} to push editors toward improving articles. If we removed all articles that included the latter, WP would be sparse indeed. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 00:04, 28 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Article makes explicit claims of notability, especially related to Robert Moses's efforts to clear what he declared were slums and create sleek high-rise towers on superblocks, for which Washington Square Village was a prime example.

<p>A walled garden of articles (two short films and their director) with no assertion of notability, no inbound links, no worthwhile information obtainable by internet search, and no reviews or other independent references which would allow us to verify the article. Submitted by Raphaelite (<a href="../../../r/a/p/User_talk%7ERaphaelite_c3b4.html" title="User talk:Raphaelite">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Raphaelite_bc99.html" title="Special:Contributions/Raphaelite">contribs</a>) (the films are produced by "Raphaelite Productions"). Raphaelite, who only edited Wikipedia briefly, has not edited in several months, so it's not viable to ask Raphaelite to provide better references or additional information.</p>

<li>"If he improves"? So we should determine who gets an entry based on how well we think an athlete plays? That's ridiculous. Even if that were the standard, Trautwein is an All-SEC starter on the 2006 SEC champion college football team, and a potential national champion. Further, he is a scholar athlete award winner. Combined, he's easily notable. He's quoted frequently in the local, state, and even national press, and his name is synonomous with the UF offensive line. Finally, there are hundreds of similar pages for less notable athletes on less notable teams, and no one has yet had a problem with them.

<li>Reading the above, I started thinking this might be a keeper, but a search indicates that he's a second-team All-SEC selection, I didn't see a mention in reliable news resources for the scholar-athlete award, and he came up only in three Google News links listing the All-SEC selection.

<li>"Charged with protecting Leak’s blindside this season, Trautwein has been an integral part of a UF offensive line that has yielded just 22 sacks in 13 games. He has started each of Florida’s outings this season, and graded out at a team-high 82 percent following the 21-14 win over Georgia in Jacksonville. His recognition as an All-SEC performer by the league’s coaches is the first of his collegiate career."

</ul>
<p>Not to mention, Trautwein is one of only a very small group who has graded out as "champion" (a distinction reserved for only the best game performances) every week of the 2006 season. To anyone who follows Gator football, it's a no-brainer that Trautwein is notable.72.196.99.99 02:10, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>I'm looking for verificaiton of the scholar athlete award, but he won it the week of the LSU game. Maybe CBS keeps a chronicle of winners, but I don't know...Gnewburn 02:25, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Here are the guidelines for bio notability: "Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, <b>or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States.</b> Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles. Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level."</li>
</ul>
<p>Trautwein CLEARLY meets these criteria. He's a second-year starter on the number 2 college football team in the country (which could be the national champion on Monday), and he grades out among the top offensive performers nearly every week. Couple that with his academic credentials "e.g., "Scholar Athlete of the Week," and there's no question he meets the wikipedia standard. This article should be kept--like the hundreds of similar articles that have been kept without controversy.Gnewburn 02:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Delete</b> - Unfortunately, I think you misread the notability requirement... "or at the highest level in <i>mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities</i>. Obviously college football doesn't even come close to fulfilling that requirement. Trautwein may be having a decent college career - but in my opinion, he hasn't sufficiently distinguished himself from the other thousands of college football athletes. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 03:50, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The <b>very next clause</b> in the sentence you cite reads, "...including college sports in the United States." Obviously that includes college football. And my point is that Trautwein is sufficiently similar to (in fact, more notable than) the hundreds of other college athletes who have non-controversial wikipedia pages, that his page should remain as well.72.196.99.99 04:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I think the "including college sports" clause is meant to cover sports for which there is no professional league, which would make the college version the "highest level." --<a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlan_Au_82f0.html" title="User:Alan Au">Alan Au</a> 05:32, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I read the "highest level" language to mean the highest amateur level, which includes college sports. And college football is not only a "mainly amateur sport." It's an entirely amateur sport. Even if we just use "football," that sport is also clearly "mainly amateur." Pop Warner, middle school, high school, city league, intramural, and pick-up football games are all amateur. There are thousands of independent amateur football leagues around the country, and only two professional leagues that I'm aware of (NFL and Arena League). Of the thousands of amateur football leagues, NCAA college football is the "highest level." Further, by your reasoning Troy Smith, the 20006 Heisman Trophy winner, isn't notable because he hasn't been paid yet. But certainly a Heisman Trophy winner is more notable than some fifth string NFL player no one's ever heard of. "Getting a paycheck" shouldn't be the standard for athlete notability, and isn't according to the WIkipedia guidelines. Amateurs can be notable, and Trautwein certainly is.150.104.190.22 13:00, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Master-planned communities do not warrant individual articles; nothing asserting notability that isn't touched on in the <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richmond%2C_California_789d.html" title="Richmond, California">Richmond, California</a> article remains once POV-text is factored out. <a href="../../../b/u/m/User%7EBumm13_d24e.html" title="User:Bumm13">Bumm13</a> 01:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep.</b> There are other articles about Richmond neighborhoods, though their notability is up for debate as well.

<li><b>Keep</b> Neighborhoods are not inherently notable, but not inherently non-notable. So we return to that old stand by, non trivial 3rd part sources. And the references are attached. Thus a notable neighborhood.<a href="../../../o/b/i/User%7EObina_7738.html" title="User:Obina">Obina</a> 15:50, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Seems notable and referenced. I would argue that many neighborhoods that are less interesting and notable than this one are inherently notable due to delineating geographical areas within urban areas. Neighborhoods in the burbs that are only visited by residents and visitors are not. By this I mean that <a href="../../../s/u/n/Sunset_District%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_a3e7.html" title="Sunset District, San Francisco, California">Sunset District, San Francisco, California</a> is even less notable than the neighborhood in question but delineates a section of a city.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<p>The result was <b>delete</b>. Of those who argued 'keep', I find very little to back up their claims. Richard Arthur Norton's argument that people come to Wikipedia to find out what a word means is untrue - that is what a dictionary is for (and Wiktionary don't accept urban neologisms). Weirdoactor asserts it passes <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> without showing why, and proceeds to attack all those who opined 'delete'. AnonEMouse says to keep as it's a 'many-off joke' (I do not understand this). RockMFR admits it has not been the subject of multiple reliable references yet suggests 'keep' anyway. Tarninth's keep is ignored. House of Scandal's keep is based on 'I like it'. Lyrl states it has multiple reliable sources, when it does not. Pseudothyrum states it ought to be kept as it will pass into the mainstream at a later date - Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. Darkspots, finally, fails to address <i>why</i> the article should be kept with any reference to policy or guideline, instead saying that it should be kept as <i>there are people who simply know whether or not someone is Jewish--and they really do, there is a set of signals</i>; not a good reason for an encyclopaedia article.</p>
<p>The "delete"s surround its lack of reliable sources (agreed), original synthesis (maybe), trivial coverage only (agreed), it being a dictionary definition (not really correct), and being a neologism (agreed). I beliebe the arguments for deletion strongly outweigh those to keep, and thus, delete. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 14:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>If by "next to nothing", you mean "articles that assert the notability of Jewdar", then you are SPOT ON. I'll read more carefully if you promise to do the same, especially before making counterfactual arguments in an AfD. And re: "Jewdars" (sic), the term has no plural; much like <a href="../../../d/e/e/Deer.html" title="Deer">deer</a> or <a href="../../../m/o/o/Moose.html" title="Moose">moose</a>. As to how Jewdar has affected me; I have it, passed from my mother and father, and it has led me to MANY tasty meals and lovely parties. So there. I’m not sure how jewdar has affected me PERSONALLY should be relevant as to it’s inclusion in the encyclopedia, as the last time I checked, it’s called “Wikipedia”, and not “weirdoactorpedia” or “recurypedia”, and thus the entries should <i>probably</i> reflect a broader range of needs and experiences than yours and mine. After all, what is Wikipedia but “a comprehensive reference work containing articles on a wide range of subjects or on numerous aspects of a particular field”, correct? -- <a href="../../../w/e/i/User%7EWeirdoactor_7234.html" title="User:Weirdoactor">weirdoactor</a> <sup><a href="../../../w/e/i/User_talk%7EWeirdoactor_eae5.html" title="User talk:Weirdoactor">t</a></sup><sup>|</sup><sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Weirdoactor_bb16.html" title="Special:Contributions/Weirdoactor">c</a></sup> 20:27, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I'm not talking about notability (although that case for deletion can certainly be made). I'm talking about having sources to actually write an article from. Even if they did assert notability (which they don't) that would leave us with an article that says: "Jewdar means you can tell when other people are Jews. Jewdar is a notable neologism that has been used upwards of 3 times in published writing."

<li><b>Delete</b> It's not relevant that this term has been invented by multiple newspaper columnists. The fact is that "Jewdar" is not a cultural phenomenon to the extent that there is one coherent idea of it which deserves its own article. The ideas expressed in this article belong in articles <i>where their information will actually be helpful</i> such as Judaism in America, rather than making a neologism out of them. <a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshibaka_df45.html" title="User:Ashibaka">Ashibaka</a> <a href="../../../a/s/h/User_talk%7EAshibaka_af0a.html" title="User talk:Ashibaka">(tock)</a> 18:46, 7 January 2007 (UTC</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> If Wikipedia was around 25 years ago, we'd be having this argument about "Yuppie". And I think there is definitely a phenomenon where, if you're in a particular group, you can tell who is and isn't one of your group even when you can't go by physical appearance. The use of the terms "Jewdar" or "Goydar" are allusions to the obvious example of this phenomenon, "Gaydar". <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquidfryerchef_cfcf.html" title="User:Squidfryerchef">Squidfryerchef</a> 22:29, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually this is a reason to delete rather than keep. While new words &amp; expressions appear daily, most vanish without a trace.

<dd>User:Humus sapiens says that Wikipedia doesn't have articles on neologisms, yet "Category:Neologisms" is alive and very well stocked; in fact, there are about 150 words in that category (not to mention "Category:Portmanteaus," "Category:Slang," among others) and I just added that category to this article. Echoing User:Weirdoactor, just a brief look around Wikipedia and one finds such words as Tillmonkey, <a href="../../../y/a/k/Yak_shaving.html" title="Yak shaving">Yak shaving</a>, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kripkenstein.html" title="Kripkenstein">Kripkenstein</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmocrat.html" title="Cosmocrat">Cosmocrat</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Fraudience.html" title="Fraudience">Fraudience</a>, among MANY others -- these pages are in existence and are not disputed (and are not as notable and/or widespread as Jewdar), the only sources supporting most of those articles being the Urban Dictionary and various informal blogs. In fact, some of those articles <i>don't even have sources</i> and yet no one disputes their existence, while this article has at last count <b>12 sources</b> (including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The Weekly Standard</i>, <i>The New York Press</i>, salon.com, etc).</dd>

<dd>At base this is an issue of what is and is not considered 'JC' by the people (overwhelmingly Jews) that create, expand, and upkeep articles dealing with Jews, Judaism, and Jewish issues -- there are certain people here that let their own personal views of Jewish issues cloud their judgment when it comes to keeping a NPOV in regards to Jewish-themed articles and vehemently (nay: FANATICALLY) oppose anything that is not entirely squeaky clean and 'JC.' This is obviously what is happening here. --172.132.170.249 05:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The article, with the new material, convinces me of its relevance and notability. The basic cultural question is, <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> There is no really quick answer, although I guess a lot of folks would differ with that assertion. Writing about Jewdar is uncomfortable but it makes the point that on the one hand you have a complicated definition with a lot of nuances and debate and angst, but, cutting through that, there are many people who simply <i>know</i> whether or not someone is Jewish--and they really do, there is a set of signals. It would never fly but <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_is_a_Jew__a96f.html" title="Who is a Jew?">Who is a Jew?</a> should link to this article.

<p>In other words, if <b>Rafed.net</b> is the subject of more than one (1) non-trivial (2) published works (3) whose source is independent, then the site is notable per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

<p>Now, considering that it has been mentioned as an example by (a) multiple scholars from universities and also by (b) two published books, (c) that it is baned in one country, (d) that the ban is discuses and that even though it is baned there, (e) it gets 40% of its traffic from there, (f) considering that it is affiliated with Sistani, the Shi'a leader with most influence in Iraq and the world and that Sistani reviews it on his own site, (g) and that it outrivals all other Shi'a sites except sistanis own site and the Iranian official site, can you with good conscience state that this site is non-notable? Does it hurt wikipedia do represent this site, with all this infomation, or does it become more informative internet site?</p>
<p>Also, the site is mainly in Arabic, and i could not do a better job proving its notability and presenting full reviews in Arabic, since i do not know Arabic. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 03:02, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I dont understand. First you argue that FFI has a <i>better</i> relibale source, then you note that Rafed.Net is also included in <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" class="external text" title="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/SA-F.html" rel="nofollow">that source</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't think you can argue that the quotes in books are "non-trivial"; they give a passing mention to one of a number of sites they are describing. The Alexa and Google rankings are immaterial - as I've said before, popularity is not equal to notability. It's harder for me to judge the seestani.com review, but I'm worried by both its independence and reliability. You say that "close relations and being allies" isn't the same as dependence and that might be true, but it certainly does not encourage <i>in</i>dependence. You also say that reliability is not an issue (interestingly the primary notability criterion on <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> recently had reliability added to it) but I can't agree with that. By that logic, if <i>I</i> reviewed a website and posted it to my personal blog or homepage, that would qualify as a source - clearly absurd. So I'm still going to support deletion. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 13:33, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Bro, what i find it strange is that people demand notable sources, and when they get that from sistani, the top representative for Shi'a, then it somehow is not good enough. And when the sistani coverage is "too good", then it somehow does not count. Well, even if you consider that the page was owned by sistani, wich it is not, then that fact would make it notable. You seem my point? But in any case, the site is NOT dependant on sistani, and nobody has claimed it is. And by the way, if you wonder why some of those pages has poor layout, consider the state of IT-technology in some of those countries, for example, Iran only has pre-paid dial up internet, from what i have gathered. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> - <a href="../../../s/t/r/User_talk%7EStriver_9f65.html" title="User talk:Striver">talk</a> 20:09, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm not bothered about the poor layout, it's the relationship between the sites that worries me. It isn't black or white whether something is dependent or independent (in my opinion), it's more of a sliding scale, and being closely related would tend towards the former. Would the comments about the website be objective? Doubtful I think, they'd surely be influenced by the relationship and shared ideals. To clarify, I don't think this deletion is clear-cut one way or the other, and you've done an excellent job arguing the case for keeping it. I still feel, though, that the articles will have length and sourcing issues, and will tend towards merely a directory entry. This looks like it'll end as "no consensus" anyway, so it probably won't matter. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 20:48, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><s>I have two main reasons for nominating this list:</s></p>
<ol>
<li><s><i>Scope appears non neutral</i>. Why have a list of heads of state that expressly leaves out female monarchs and dictators? This seems to inherently suggest that there is something wrong with those governmental systems.</s></li>
<li><s><i>Superfluous</i>.

</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. (2) A category can't replace this list (e.g. it can't be annotated or re-sorted). (1) You may want join the discussion on the list's talk page, if you want to rename it or redefine its scope. A reason for the current title may be that female succession to the throne seems more common than election or appointment. -- User:Docu</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As the list contains considerably more information than a category can provide, I don't think the latter could/should replace the former. I also have no particular problem with the scope, and if you (the universal "you", not specifically referring to the nominator) do, you should suggest changes, not deletion. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 14:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Withdraw nom</b>. In light of the views expressed here I recognise I may have been over-zealous in nominating the article. It is clear my POV concerns are not widely shared (and could potential be sorted by another route). I am also persuaded by the arguments as to why a list is more appropriate than a category in this case. <a href="../../../w/j/b/User%7EWJBscribe_824e.html" title="User:WJBscribe"><b>WJB</b><i>scribe</i></a>&#160;<sup><small><a href="../../../w/j/b/User_talk%7EWJBscribe_3a3f.html" title="User talk:WJBscribe">(<b>WJB</b> <i>talk</i>)</a></small></sup> 19:11, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

By contrast, the term "podunk" cite repeated usage, and has extensive historical merit. None of this is displayed by Bum Fuck, Egypt, and I am strongly inclined to believe that it is simply a total <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. <b>Delete</b>. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 03:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC) (I'm the nominator, anyways!)</li>

<li>The definition has it right, but it's going to be very hard to document this. Google will just turn up anything where people refer to BFE, but what I understand of the definition is pretty much echoed in the entry. Certainly wiktionary has room for fairly well-known (albeit obscene) colloquialisms. Not enough to keep here - it is, after all, a dicdef.

<li>For Wikipedia it is impossible to document, as there are no sources at all. For Wiktionary, it appears to be actually very easy. I found the phrase in several books, so supplying quotations in order to satisfy Wiktionary's attestation criteria and to demonstrate meaning should be easy and uncontroversial. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:12, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The article cites no sources. Searching, although it is possible to find people using these three words in sequence, I can find no sources that actually properly document the notion that the article claims they denote. It's possible for a Wikipedia editor to <i>deduce</i> documentation for the notion by analysing how people use this phrase, but that would be original research, <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">which is forbidden here</a>.

<li>Counting Google hits is not research. One has to actually read the things that the search locates. Additionally: Arguments that a word or phrase is in use are what Wiktionary deals in. This is Wikipedia. We write encyclopaedia articles on subjects, here. For those, we <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">require sources</a> that are about the subject denoted by the article title, and thus our arguments deal in the existence of sources. That a word or phrase exists does not make it an encyclopaedia article subject, and doesn't magically supply sources telling us about Bum Fuck Egypt — where it is, what it is, and so forth. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedia_is_not_a_dictionary_16de.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not a dictionary">Wikipedia is not a dictionary</a>.

I feel strongly, however, that it should <b>not</b> be a redirect to Little Egypt, which is what caught my eye in the first place. That's simply not an appropriate direct association (perhaps there is something etymological going on there, but I've never heard of it). For what it's worth, I can respect the filter you're trying to apply here, but I think that a considerable part of Wikipedia would not pass it. 69.149.223.52 13:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment to Administrator</b> Please note that Ronbo76's page lists entries that he has had successfully deleted. Furthermore, his "To Do List" states: "Create a kill list of articles that I have successfully nominated." I strongly question the merit of this deletion nomination, especially since a body of work such as mine stands on its own merits. Furthermore, I believe deletion of my self-published entries 'Curtis Newart' and 'Immaculate Records' would be a decided disservice to your readership. However, to avoid conflict of interest, all copyrighted materials owned by Immaculate Records and/or Curtis Newart will be removed.IMAC001 01:22, 6 January 2007 (UTC)(Curtis Newart, Immaculate Records Owner)</li>

<li><b>Comment to User:IMAC001</b> I have no expertise in this field whatsoever (check out my user page), thats the kind of the point of Wikipedia. I would recommend that you get to know Wikipedia by editing articles that interest you and maybe creating a couple on topics that you are not directly related to but knowledgeable about before jumping in and creating on article on yourself and your company. While this is not necessary it would allow you to gain experience in what is and is not acceptable conduct on this site. Right now you are experiencing the kind of divisiveness that is the worst part about Wikipedia, but if he were to look beyond these debates you would find that it is truly a great source of information and enjoyment. You will also find that using it as a promotional tool is very difficult. Good luck and have fun <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J. Leivick">Daniel J.

<p><b>Comment to IMAC001</b> I have proof that you are violating Wikipedia policy with this quote from <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConflict_of_interest_727a.html" title="Wikipedia:Conflict of interest">Wikipedia:Conflict of interest</a>.</p>
<p><i>A <b>conflict of interest</b> is an incompatibility between the purpose of Wikipedia to produce a neutral encyclopedia and the concerns or aims of editors who are involved with the subject of an article. This includes promotion of companies you work for and their products, and criticism of competitors.</i></p>
<p>In keeping with Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/e/u/Neutral_point_of_view.html" title="Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy, edits where there is a clear conflict of interest, or where such a conflict can or might be justifiably assumed based on the proximity of the editor to the subject, are strongly discouraged. Of special concern are organisational conflicts of interest.[1] Failure to follow these guidelines may put the editor at serious risk of embarrassing himself or his client.</p>
<p>If you have a conflict of interest, you should:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>avoid editing articles related to your organization or its competitors;</dd>
<dd>avoid participating in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html#Deletion_processes" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">deletion discussions</a> about articles related to your organization or its competitors;</dd>
<dd>avoid linking to the Wikipedia article or website of your corporation in other articles (see Wikipedia:Spam).</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - That's a fair question. The way I see it, if an external source makes the claim "Joe was the greatest fighter ever", we can mention that claim somewhere on Wikipedia. That's not OR, as it's not the original thoughts of the Wikipedia editor. It's just reporting on speculation that's been published. What we can't do is say ourselves, "Based on Joe's stats, he could be considered the greatest fighter ever" - and that's exactly what this article does. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 02:56, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment to Administrator</b> Please note that Ronbo76's page lists entries that he has had successfully deleted. Furthermore, his "To Do List" states: "Create a kill list of articles that I have successfully nominated." I strongly question the merit of this deletion nomination, especially since a body of work such as mine stands on its own merits. Furthermore, I believe deletion of my entries would be a decided disservice to your readership. Regarding Ronbo76's above comment, I was simply following the instructions that appeared on my page to improve the content. Furthermore, the age of some of the reference material is simply not available online and exists simply as tearsheets or programmes. However, to avoid a conflict of interest, I have removed all copyrighted materials owned by Immaculate Records and Curtis Newart and recommend both sites "Curtis Newart" and "Immaculate Records" be deleted.IMAC001 01:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)(Curtis Newart, Immaculate Records Owner)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There appears to be numerous references from solid secondary source newspapers. The article names and writers of the newspaper articles would help substantiate the newspaper references. I googled, and found some fair references to the artist on indy sites. It is nearly impossible to find web links for things that happened before 1998 (like the newspaper articles). I know because I tried in vain to find verification links for an artist that was signed to the industry giant Atlantic Records for all of the 1990s, and all I came up with was generic listings at VH1.com and MTV.com. I have no problem with verification links being added after AfD nomination, as I would expect a contributor to find verification links to prove their case. <a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoyalbroil_3602.html" title="User:Royalbroil"><font color="#000000"><b>Royal</b></font><font color="#FFCC00"><b>broil</b></font></a><sup>&#160;<a href="../../../r/o/y/User_talk%7ERoyalbroil_9d82.html" title="User talk:Royalbroil"><font color="#FF0000">T</font></a>&#160;:&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Royalbroil_8587.html" title="Special:Contributions/Royalbroil"><font color="#000000">C</font></a></sup> 08:31, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>The use of the word "vanity" is in reference to Curtis Newton's creation of the Curtis Newton biography page as well as his company's page. Wikipedia is not a tool for self promotion, please reference <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> note 3 for details. Also user IMAC001 deleting his real name and replacing it with his new user name borders on misleading, as it removes some of the evidence that this page is blatant self promotion. User IMAC001 should definitely not be involved in editing his own page as it is a conflict of interest and probably should not be involved in this dispute either. In addition google hits are a common method of determining notability, even somewhat obscure but notable people will receive hundreds or thousands of hits, while non notable people will receive only a handful. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_J._Leivick_6aaa.html" title="User:Daniel J.

No one has yet supplied any <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> writing about Moran's porn career (which is her only claim to notability), which means there can be no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. No verifiability means this article must be deleted.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Okay, I've added a few more details and references to the article. As for the comment from <a href="../../../v/a/l/User%7EValrith_e155.html" title="User:Valrith">Valrith</a>, it seems to me that up to now the discussion has been about -notability-, and several people have demolished the argument that Moran is non-notable. Now suddenly we're supposed to be talking about -verifiability-? Well, yes, it's not so easy to document a phenomenon that exists primarily on the Internet (i.e. she's a real human being, but mostly she is an Internet figure) but several links have now been provided; the woman is not exactly hard to find in even the most superficial web search. I think the text as it now exists is pretty solid. <a href="../../../c/r/e/User%7ECredmond_522f.html" title="User:Credmond">Credmond</a> 13:35, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have edited the article to present a less biased tone and have included additional links to industry criticism of this company. While it is clear that the article as orignally written was not neutral in tone, this company is definitely notable within the jewelry industry. This is the only retailer in the emerging "ethical jewelry" category to be singled out by diamond industry leader Martin Rapaport in his recent publication on the subject (see citation in main article). A Googletest on "Brilliant Earth" diamond on January 7, 2007 yields 1610 results, apparently all on the subject of the company and its positions on blood diamond issues. <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesB70_674d.html" title="User:JamesB70">JamesB70</a> 18:20, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Certainly needs to cite sources and is a pretty short article, somewhat POV, and it's full of all that ridiculous self-glorification/importance that it unfortunately wedded to most discussions of "art." That said, it mentions a number of practitioners of the form and it's roots/influences. Seems to sufficiently posit notability to me.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 05:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Also nominated is John Burnet Hall. Per precedents, University halls of residence are not usually considered notable (as a default), and these do not seem to be any exception. In fact, these are poor stubs with feeble, if any, assertion of notability.

<li><b>Keep</b> Halls of residence have been organised into the category University of St Andrews halls of residence. This seems to be the normal approach for posting halls of residences for British Universities on Wikipedia (for example: University of Bristol Halls of Residence, University of Manchester halls of residence, University of Reading halls of residence, etc.) --John345er 01:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> While a category would indeed be useful for large universities such as Manchester, with a student body six times larger than St Andrews, one well sectioned article would be preferable, and cumulative notability could be gleaned, at least to me, than six to ten stubs with limited notability. Of course things could still be linked with anchors to each heading. <a href="../../../m/0/r/User%7EM0RHI_862a.html" title="User:M0RHI">M0RHI</a> | <a href="../../../m/0/r/User_talk%7EM0RHI_5942.html" title="User talk:M0RHI">Talk to me</a> 03:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: please don't confuse notability of the subject with organisational structure within Wikipedia. This hall is a pretty bog standard hall which few outside the University will have heard of or would ever want to find out about. Unless anyone can find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> attesting to its importance, it should be deleted. Putting several non-notable subjects together into one merged article does not make the article encyclopaedically, nor the multiple subjects any more notable. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Stub encyclopaedia article" is not synonymous with "dictionary article". (For one thing, complete dictionary articles are rarely short.) A dictionary article is an article about a word or an idiom. A stub encyclopaedia article is a short article about the person, place, concept, event, or thing <i>that the word or phrase denotes</i>. The concept here, quite clearly, is the renunciation of citizenship.
<p>Furthermore: Per our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, we only delete stub encyclopaedia articles that it is impossible to expand into full articles. We don't delete articles simply because they are currently stubs. To argue that an article that is currently a stub should be deleted, it must be shown that it is impossible to expand it beyond a stub.

Indeed, neither has given any indication that xe has looked for sources <i>at all</i>. <a href="../../../n/e/o/User%7ENeoChaosX_e5d9.html" title="User:NeoChaosX">NeoChaosX</a> certainly didn't have all that much time to look for sources in the 2 minutes between the creation of the stub and the time that xe first nominated it for deletion. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 12:37, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Neo's nomination was valid. Here is what the article looked like to begin with: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renunciation_of_citizenship&amp;oldid=98351153" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Renunciation_of_citizenship&amp;oldid=98351153" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> The "give it a chance" argument [wasn't] especially valid [in that situation]. Stubs must have more than just a one-sentence dictionary definition to warrant existence. All that said, the article is filled out nicely now. Neo should probably retract his nomination unless he has another grievance. –<i><a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGunslinger47_cf62.html" title="User:Gunslinger47">Gunslinger47</a></i> 17:25, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Withdraw nomination</b> I apologize to Dr.007.

<p>Default non-notability of student halls of residence. The article is full of unsourced subjective appreciation and spam links. However, saving grace (per <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability</a>) is that it was designed by a famous architect (not that all works of famous artists are notable), and that the design was so badly executed that it cost tons of taxpayers' money in remedial work. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:55, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Sorry, but I'm going to have to disagree on this one. This site is clearly not a memorial, and is rather an article on a figure of some interest in a notable crime that occurred in New Zealand. There are a wide range of other articles, such as <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bergsten_6e2e.html" title="Jessica Bergsten">Jessica Bergsten</a>, <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Jones_1668.html" title="Holly Jones">Holly Jones</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Scott_89ed.html" title="Rachel Scott">Rachel Scott</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Wood_761e.html" title="Anna Wood">Anna Wood</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/e/Reena_Virk_852d.html" title="Reena Virk">Reena Virk</a>, and <a href="../../../e/l/y/Elyse_Pahler_2102.html" title="Elyse Pahler">Elyse Pahler</a>, to name only a few who have become posthumously notable. I don't see why we are singling out this particular case when there are other similar articles already included. The article is well-sourced, and appears to have been widely reported in New Zealand. I don't see any compelling reason to remove it - sometimes, sensational crimes create notable personages of their victims. Their deceased status has no effect on this. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 06:45, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm not singling out any particular article, I saw this one and saw on the discussion page I wasn't the only person who had concerns about his notability. I don't consider murder victims notable generally speaking, and it is possible to find press coverage for a majority of murder victims. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 06:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> "Other articles like this exist" is a problematic keep argument - see <a href="../../../p/o/k/WP%7EPOKEMON_abf7.html" title="WP:POKEMON">WP:POKEMON</a>. But to address Haemo's specific examples - <a href="../../../j/e/s/Jessica_Bergsten_6e2e.html" title="Jessica Bergsten">Jessica Bergsten</a> was murdered by a US sports celebrity and the case was the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary. <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holly_Jones_1668.html" title="Holly Jones">Holly Jones</a> - this article does a poor job of asserting encyclopedic notability, making only a vague implied claim that her murder led to a change in Canadian law. An initial google search shows that there is at least some evidence for this, with at least one Private Member's Bill proposed in her memory<a href="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2544166" class="external autonumber" title="http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&amp;Mode=1&amp;Parl=39&amp;Ses=1&amp;DocId=2544166" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> - further research needed to see if these changes in the law took hold. <a href="../../../r/a/c/Rachel_Scott_89ed.html" title="Rachel Scott">Rachel Scott</a> - victim of the Columbine massacre and subject of much religious coverage, including several books, due to the misattributed story involving a religious question asked by the killers. <a href="../../../a/n/n/Anna_Wood_761e.html" title="Anna Wood">Anna Wood</a> - at centre of Australian moral panic over ecstasy;<a href="../../../r/e/e/Reena_Virk_852d.html" title="Reena Virk">Reena Virk</a> - article asserts encyclopedic notability but in a vague unsupported way. This seems to be the weakest of this article group; <a href="../../../e/l/y/Elyse_Pahler_2102.html" title="Elyse Pahler">Elyse Pahler</a> - article does not assert encyclopedic notability well - but case is deeply associated with a band which seems to be solidly encyclopedically notable. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The crime may be notable for the manner in which it was executed, the perpetrator is less notable than the incident itself. The news articles focus on the perp or the trial as the principal subjects, and the victim gets trivial mentions. Furthermore, the deceased, god bless his soul, is just a random victim of a wanton act. I agree with nom: Wiki is not a memorial. Furthermore, Wiki is not a <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html" title="WP:CRYSTAL">crystal ball</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> Tragic, but wikipedia is not a news report archive or a memorial site. The article does not assert encyclopedic notability and, though obviously very serious for those involved, is not even a major news event. Being a widely reported event is not an automatic indication of encyclopedic notability. Newspapers and other news services have coverage criteria which are substantially different from an encyclopedia <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 07:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Move</b> top clarify that it's about the case, if it is genuinely considered of legal significance, otherwise <b>delete</b> since Wikipedia is not a directory of homicide cases. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 14:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, as the primary author of the article there is probably a conflict of interest in any comments I make. I would like to see the article kept for the reason the crime was at the time prominently reported in the New Zealand media. Of course looking through <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> I can see it probably fails beyond being featured in multiple non-trivial published works. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Monkey_6b08.html" title="User:Evil Monkey">Evil Monkey</a> - <a href="../../../e/v/i/User_talk%7EEvil_Monkey_65b0.html" title="User talk:Evil Monkey">Hello</a> 02:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p><strike>As my user page shows, I am certainly not a pseudoscientist, but this type of article isn't good for the health of Wikipedia and coverage of evolution. The article is a clear <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_fork_160a.html" title="WP:POV fork">POV fork</a>, something which shouldn't be created and in my experience can actually cause POV problems in the opposite way that was intended. By sequestering this information into its own article rather than adding it to the appropriate articles such as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution_controversy</a>, the page decreases the support for evolution in the articles that people will actually read. POV forks shouldn't be created just because it is difficult to make the proper articles have a neutral point of view. As a note, I should also mention that much of the material doesn't seem very informative. Evolution is an accepted scientific theory, and as such I would think that support for it by scientific organizations would be presumed. Listing scientific organizations that support evolution is like listing financial organizations that deal with money.</strike> --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 07:09, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Response</b> The entire area that concerns this controversy is immense, over dozens and dozens of articles. The <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution_controversy</a> article is a tiny tip of the iceberg. I have begun documenting some of the voluminous number of articles at <a href="../../../e/v/o/Talk%7EEvolution_controversyarticles_9a89.html" title="Talk:Evolution/controversyarticles">Talk:Evolution/controversyarticles</a>. This area is too large to be contained in one article by far. One could of course dismiss the entire subject by saying "there is no controversy, so all of those articles have no reason to exist". But in fact, there is a thriving controversy, with immense sums of money being expended on both sides. Dozens of court battles have been waged. Many states have implemented laws or flirted with implementing laws associated with this. The list of arguments on both sides runs up into the hundreds or thousands. Of course, WP cannot address all of this. But what WP can do is to provide some sort of structure to some of this material so someone from the outside can access it and understand it. At the moment, the <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">Creation-evolution_controversy</a> is too long and is poorly written and hard to understand. What I would like to do is to provide a service for the average reader like the high school kid who wants to learn what it is about and the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, the parent who is trying to understand the situation, the creationist who wants to have a clear view of how to change his or her strategy, the politician who wants to get up to speed to understand the issue, and so on and so forth. It cannot be written for philosophers of science, as many of the articles in WP on this topic are; they are worthless for the average person. It cannot be written for scientists who already have their PhDs; that is what we have in a large fraction of the evolution articles which do not acknowledge that the controversy even exists (nor should they, in my opinion). Problem areas in the argument which arise over and over and are huge sources of confusion should be written clearly with copious references on both sides, as I have done. Every charge and counter charge, involved in some way with support, I have found sources for both sides. If I have to rewrite it to make it more balanced, then so be it, I will do it.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 08:19, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>I strongly disagree.</b> Perhaps the organization information is not presented in the best possible fashion. We are considering a map format instead to make it more presentable. This can easily be resolved so it is not such a laundry list. I also have <b>multiple</b> statements in the text stating the opposing position, with links to 4 creationist organizations and their lists of hundreds of supporters as well. To satisfy the NPOV concerns, I propose to create a seperate prominent section where I collect all the contrary evidence that disputes support for evolution, prominently, and call it dispute for support for evolution. I also propose to change the title of the article to something more neutral. I do not believe that this article is an inaccurate description of the current situation. It is a straightforward description of the level of support for evolution, both positive and negative, in various domains. It states claims of support or lack of support in each domain, and then bolsters it with evidence on both sides. I also propose to create separate articles on support for creationism. I am currently logging the articles that support creationism and describe the arguments that creationists use. There are many of these; many more than there are evolution articles. This is because evolution mainly concerns itself with science on WP, and does not state its case in any way except by describing the nature of the science. On the other hand, creationism is in an aggressive stance with numerous arguments and organizations and strategies that are laid out in a very impressive suite of articles, dwarfing the "creation-evolution controversy" article and the small section in <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">evolution</a> <i>attempting</i> and failing at answering a few critiques of evolution by creationists (and doing it quite poorly and incoherently, and basically of no value to the reader at all, frankly). Even the creation-evolution controversy article spends relatively little space describing the details and aspects of the controversy. Most of it describes the accusations/objections in vague terms, and then the opposite side as well in vague terms. A reader who is not schooled in this debate will gain little from this overly academic imprecise hand-waving description. I ask that I be given a stay of execution to at least bring the article up to snuff. --<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 07:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've been here for quite a while, and have been fighting pseudoscientists like Aetherometrists, Anti-relativists, Pull-on-finger-to-diagnose-cancerists and New-age-quantumists since I created this account. I've experienced POV forks and their effects before, and know that creating POV forks like this isn't the right way to go about editing. The information itself in a POV fork can be NPOV, it is the content that is the issue - you are moving content which should be on one page into two pages, creating a battlefield of opposing articles. The consensus on Wikipedia is that this should not be done due to the many ill effects of doing so.</li>

<dd>As for the <a href="../../../e/v/o/Evolution.html" title="Evolution">Evolution</a> article, it should not contain significant information about the controversy. The article is about science, not media and religious controversy. Since creationism doesn't satisfy the appropriate source requirements (from the Pseudoscience ArbCom case) to be presented as scientific, it shouldn't be afforded space in the article. The controversy information belongs in the controversy article, which is about controversy, not science. But even then, creationism doesn't have appropriate sources to allow for defence against criticism in proper sources. You are viewing this as a battle, when in reality, it isn't one. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 08:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Well I will make it more obvious in the article that it is balanced and NPOV. It would be great if we could fit all this entire topic into one article. But there is no way to do it. It can be divided up by subject, by subtopic or whatever, but it is too big. A very small investigation shows that to be eminently clear. In fact, I think it would be great if we could wave a magic wand and make it completely disappear and never have to worry about it again. I do not think that is going to happen, given that the support level for evolution operating without supernatural interference in the general public is around the 10 or 15 % level in the US, and a good half of those surveyed were unable to pick the correct definition of "evolution" from a list of several possible definitions. Given that in the last couple of presidential elections, politicians on <b>both</b> Democratic and Republican sides have pledged to allow creationism in the science classroom, this is a movement with momentum, like it or not. Given the fact that the Santorum amendment is now in the records and will be treated as law to allow creationism in the science classroom, and the courts so far have not yielded, this is not going away. Given the vast sums of money on both sides involved, this will not go away. So you can claim there is nothing to write about here. You can claim that the entire subject is stupid, which it is, and no controversy exists, which it doesn't, in one sense. But that will not stop this creationism leviathan.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 08:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Because of the comments here, I have changed the article substantially:</p>
<ul>
<li>the lists of organizations that support evolution are gone now</li>
<li>I have a list of 4 organizations that support creationism</li>
<li>I can introduce a much longer list of organizations that support creationism. I am partway through a survey now and I can lengthen it considerably from 4 to maybe 50 or more creationist organizations.</li>
<li>I have put the creationist organizations in their own section and made them far more prominent.</li>
<li>I have devoted more space to creationist arguments and I will add more references. I have removed pro-evolution material.</li>
<li>I propose to enlist the assistance of some creationist editors to help add more creationist material.</li>
<li>I can change the title to make it blander. Perhaps the world support is too strong.</li>
<li>I can include more material about how creationism will probably come into US classrooms in any case because of the political situation, in spite of the supreme court rulings and other rulings.</li>
<li>There have been frequent calls from the creationist movement to recall all US judges (several tens of thousands) so that a proper judiciary can be installed. I will see if I can find the references to this and play it up as a good idea to balance things and make it more fair for creationists. People are angry at judges and they have a right to be. We dont need communists legislating from the bench. We need someone that knows the law and will give the US what it wants, which is a banning of evolution.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 09:36, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> this.

We already have extensive coverage of this topic. It doesn't matter that you're pushing the mainstream view here, it's still a fork.

<dd>This was my opinion as well - that the information was essentially good, but needed to be dispersed among various articles, and redirecting "support for evolution" to an NPOV page on the controversy would be somewhat difficult to justify. How about the following: the article could be moved to Opinions on Evolution as others have suggested, which seems to be a proper title for the content it is covering. Support for Evolution, instead of being redirected to Opinions, would be then be redirected to Evidence of Evolution, since after all, evolution's greatest support is from evidence. If this is agreeable to others then I will retract my nomination. --<a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilosophus_35c7.html" title="User:Philosophus">Philosophus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhilosophus_e2d3.html" title="User talk:Philosophus">T</a></sup> 08:40, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Agree–to meet GassyGuy's concern about edit history, would it be better to cut and paste the info rather than using the move function? Regarding dispersal, it's my understanding that several articles make reference to the extent of opinions, but don't have space to cover the point in so much detail, so this would be a useful resource making summary style sections fully adequate for each article and avoiding unnecessary duplication. .. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave_souza_a1d9.html" title="User:Dave souza">dave souza</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDave_souza_f5b4.html" title="User talk:Dave souza">talk</a> 10:03, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>This was our original intent on writing this article. Note that this article was not just written by me; I had coeditors when it was in a sandbox form for the last couple of weeks. I did not invite enough people to help probably; I will not make that mistake again. I would expect that all of the relevant articles would have a sentence or two that describe this, and then hopefully a link to this central subarticle that summarizes as much of the information on this topic as possible. It is not possible to do justice to this in another article in any depth, and I do not think it is desirable. I am not in favor of making our main articles so long and bulky that they are unreadable. I also will note that I have encountered this argument over and over by creationists; there is no support for evolution by the public, by religions, by scientists etc. Also evolution supporters are often a bit foggy about the level of support in each of these domains for evolution. This article attempts to describe very accurately what the situation is. Where creationism is strongly supported and how firm that support is. Where evolution is strong and how strongly supported. It does not ignore the ambiguity that exists on either side, which I do not think is useful for either party in this controversy, and not helpful for someone who is looking in from the outside and trying to understand the nature of the dispute.--<a href="../../../f/i/l/User%7EFilll_f8ad.html" title="User:Filll">Filll</a> 15:26, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is not the first fork. Each of the individual creationist positions has its article, and its arguments are presented in a sympathetic way. So do various aspects of evolution. It was never possible to keep a single article on evolution with all of the material--there is simply too much that needs to be said. I do not see this article, or the many creationist articles, as a POV fork, but a content fork. The creationist movement is notable enough and diverse enough to need articles on the movement--those coming first to these topics might not realize the range of possible positions. The movement itself is notable, many of the people are, and some of the publications. We have separate articles on the (you name it) view of evolution, and rightly so.</li>
<li>Similarly, the movement to support evolution is deserving of an article in its own right, as are many of the people, and some of the publications. It is not reasonable to always present the positions as a Q and A exchange.</li>
<li><i>This</i> particular article is neither. it is an <i>eminently fair</i> article on the state of the controversy, not on the merits of the positions. it is far better that this be centralized in an article exploring it in depth than presented in a superficial way dozens of times. <i>This is an article on the state of the debate, not the merits of the theory.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><i>*As a practical matter, anyone who has tried to edit any of the articles concerned will realize they are best edited separately, or else we have 10 subpages or 10 linked articles each saying the same thing. What is needed on all of these is depth. This article is a start. The POV question is whether the articles as a whole are fair, and they are. False statments in any of them should be challenged, but it is impossible to deny thaty the different views exist, and that there are intellectually honest people who support each of them.<b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</i></p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I was extremely skeptical about whether an article like this could be POV or valuable, after seeing the title. However, upon actually reading the article, I was amazed by how interesting, well-referenced, neutral, and most of the article is. This is an impressive accomplishment, and although I am a strong mergist in general, the sheer amount of information here makes it clear that full merging is not currently an option; if editors find that a large portion of the information is unencyclopedic, redundant, unreferenced, or non-noteworthy, then they can trim it, and <i>after</i> the trimming we can rediscuss a merger. Currently, though, the article's contents and topic seem to merit a distinct article. Could someone explain to me why it does not? I am not closed to the idea of deleting it, because I am wary of POV forks, but right now it seems like we'd just be losing a very interesting and useful article (albeit one that could still use a lot of improvement, sure). -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 09:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Also, <b>oppose move</b> to <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinions_on_evolution.html" title="Opinions on evolution">Opinions on evolution</a> or anything of the sort. The current <a href="../../../s/u/p/Support_for_evolution.html" title="Support for evolution">Support for evolution</a> article is tight, concise, and focused; I worry that if we made it as vague as "Opinions", it would rapidly accumulate trivia, cruft, and a wide variety of unrelated issues. Plus it just seems like a less encyclopedic topic; gauging how much broad support there is for evolution among various people is clearly an academic topic, but simply listing a random group of "opinions on evolution" seems too arbitrary and unfocused. If the reason this move is being proposed is because of concerns that people will interpret this article title as a POVed Wikipedia article <i>in</i> support of evolution, then my proposal is to move this article to a title that clarifies the <i>current</i> topic, not to a title that would dramatically <i>change</i> the topic. So, I'd recommend a move to something like <a href="../../../l/e/v/Level_of_support_for_evolution.html" title="Level of support for evolution">Level of support for evolution</a>, not to <a href="../../../o/p/i/Opinions_on_evolution.html" title="Opinions on evolution">Opinions on evolution</a>. -<a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilence_59ae.html" title="User:Silence">Silence</a> 08:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Which is why I had suggested something with the word <b>measures</b> or <b>measuring</b> in the title. How about Measuring support for evolution&#160;? Evolution support metrics&#160;? (possibly too complicated) Gauging evolution support&#160;? (probably too complicated) Measures of support for evolution? or if opinions have to be used, Measuring opinions of evolution? Measuring evolution beliefs? Evolution belief statistics? or something similar. I gather that a while back there was an article called <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Evolution_poll_297a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Evolution poll">Evolution poll</a> or something similar but it was deleted through AfD. The words "poll" and "survey" are ok, but this article also includes petitions, and statements etc to try to express support for one side or the other, so "poll" and "survey" are too narrow. The reason I chose "support" over "opinions" or "beliefs" originally was that "opinions" sounds more just a whim, based on no information, and "beliefs" sounds too religious. Both "opinions" and "beliefs" sort of make scientists queasy, and "support" sounds more neutral in that sense. I <b>did</b> ponder the conflict with <a href="../../../e/v/i/Evidence_for_evolution.html" title="Evidence for evolution">evidence for evolution</a> before I named it, and wondered if there would be confusion about the name.

<dd>I prefer "Level of support" simply because it <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">avoids a self-reference</a>.

<li>The breeder is one of the founders of this breed of dog... you are allowing Olde English Bulldogges which is the name invented by David Leavitt... and now the breeders have broken gain into Leavitt Bulldogs and British Bulldogges -- these are the inner working of the breeders at the center of this movement... the circle of breeders includes Tim Kelly who is the founder of the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club which you allow on wikipedia. He has indeed founded a new club the BBKC... I am not trying to spam about the club, while I am a member -- these are rare breed dogs that deserve a small corner of the universe to tell their story... and I simply want to put them on the pages where they belong... the breeding programme that started in the 70's has progressed and the different strains are now established and the circles are evolving and the story should be able to be told. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Danielsoren (<a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanielsoren_2e00.html" title="User talk:Danielsoren">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danielsoren_6b32.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danielsoren">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>There are two issues here. The main one is the lack of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> for the entry. We'll need some third-party sources to establish that this is a recognized breed. The second one is notability. I don't know enough about dog-breeding to offer a definite opinion on this issue, but (presumably) the CKC recognition that the rival breed has obtained is enough to establish <a href="../../../o/l/d/Olde_English_Bulldogge_e9f4.html" title="Olde English Bulldogge">Olde English Bulldogge</a> as notable. (<i>Is</i> CKC, as opposed to AKC or UKC, recognition actually enough? If not, perhaps the other article should go, as well).

<li><b>Keep</b> Punkermorten, as described in his profile, is supposed to monitor pages that deal with geography, Norway, and sports. Therefore, he should leave this site alone and get a life other than Wikipedia. You're in college. You're 20. Go have fun and stop ruining everyone else's. Furthermore, Mr. Ananth is obviously not some Will Ferrel, Adam Sandler, Kal Penn, or the like, but you never know where life will take you. He may very well rise to the top of Hollywood. And then what? The British came to India and took everything from us. Now when we try to regain our status, you try and bring us down again? What is it with white people?

<li><b>Keep</b> - The British Bulldogge is definitely a hoax. However, this breed isn't. Which created kennel club are you referring to? Also, that type of dog didn't die out, it evolved into the modern bulldog.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - This is exactly the type of thing that ticks me off about Wikipedia. An overexhuberant, proffessional wiki cop article deleter, trying for a barnstar. As if Wikipedia has more credibility than the OEB. This is a legitimate breed and there are A LOT more than 3 or 4 breeders of this dog. BTW, I don't breed or even own one of these dogs but I'm not so stupid as to think that it's not a legitimate breed.

<li><b>Very strong keep</b> — The two books cited on the article page discuss a very real trend by breeders to move away from the physical ailments of the modern English Bulldog. The Olde English Bulldogge is a very big part of that trend as it is one of a number of alternative bulldog breeds (e.g. the Victorian Bulldog) that exist now. Read the two books if you don't believe me. The books and authors have been cited on the front article page. I won't do your work for you. This breed and other alternative bulldog breeds have existed for many years. The person who originally posted that this article should be deleted believes that recognition by major kennel clubs is a necessary criterion for having a Wikipedia article. If we follow that logic, then you all better be prepared to remove dozens of articles on various dog breeds and hybrid breeds. My goodness, the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shar_Pei_6599.html" title="Shar Pei">Shar Pei</a> was not even recognized by the AKC until 1991. But anyone with any true knowledge about canine breeds knows that the Shar Pei has been in existence long before the AKC and its supporters were ever around. For the record, I am not a breeder or even a pet owner. I discovered this breed through my own research because one day I probably would want to own a pet. This article should NOT be deleted and should be free for any person to peruse. Prospective pet owners are entitled to have as much information as possible available to their fingertips in order to make a wise and informed choice. This article should never have been nominated for deletion. <a href="../../../r/a/n/User%7ERanger_Rabbit_9a06.html" title="User:Ranger Rabbit">User:Ranger Rabbit</a></li>

<li>The 160-page Jenkins/Mollett book details the current English Bulldogs origins, its serious health issues and the creation of Victorian Bulldog and the Olde English as viable alternatives.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b>. I'm sorry that a few of the people here are not familiar with this breed, but I must state that they have no idea what they are talking about SIMPLY because they know nothing about the topic, the "Olde English Bulldogge". Refer to Wikipedia's definition of a breed then refer to the American Rare Breed Associations website www.arba.org . Then refer to the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club www.oldeenglishbulldoggekennelclub.com . Also, two books written by Carl Semencic, "World of fighting dogs" and "Gladiator Dogs" not only describe this dogs origin back in 1984, but quotes the breeds creator. Unfortunately the breed was abandoned by it's creator back in 1994 and as aresult many unethical Bulldog breeders took the opportunity to capitalize on his departure from the dog world by creating Hybrid Bulldogs and attaching the name Olde English Bulldogge to them. As the President of the Olde English Bulldogge Kennel Club, I can attest to, in a court of Law, the bloodlines of this breed which are now being preserved by the O.E.B.K.C. Only Olde English Bulldogges that can be traced back to the original foundatoin can be registered with the OEBKC. The registry contains over 550 Bulldogges, past and present. There is much to this story, but the story is long and I don't believe that is what people are looking for here. However, I am disappointed that statements have been made here that CLEARLY have not been researched before they have been made and are TOTALLY INACCURATE. These are the type of people that have given the unethical breeders a market for their Bulldog Hybrids. People that are unwilling to do their homework before spewing their opinions. I could be wrong here, but I thought Wikipedia was opposed to that type of ignorance? <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonpelon_8f2c.html" title="User:Donpelon">User:donpelon</a></li>

<p>First of all, I was unable to find a notability guideline for TV shows, which strikes me as a little weird -- perhaps I just didn't know where to look. Or looked very badly. Anyway! <i>Colby's Clubhouse</i> gets 359 Google hits, and for a TV show that's still being broadcast (in reruns, sure, but still), that strikes me as very little. I couldn't find any links to anything that actually discussed, reviewed or in any way noted the existence of the TV show, other than scheduling information, a few fansites and whatnot -- nothing that would indicate that the show had been noted in the media. Going by the general <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">notability guideline</a> -- specifically, <i>"a topic is notable if it has been the subject of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself"</i> -- I don't think it qualifies. On the other hand, it should probably be stressed that they show it on the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Broadcasting_Network_0af7.html" title="Trinity Broadcasting Network">Trinity Broadcasting Network</a>, and I kind of get the feeling that what they do over there doesn't necessarily make a big impact on the, ah, more secular world... so the Google test may once again be a little weak here. TBN is apparently received in five million households per week, so potentially, I guess the show could be a fairly big deal... but I don't think it is. I guess one question to ask here would be "is every TV show notable?" I'm open to arguments to the contrary here, but I'm thinking no. -- <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptain_Disdain_3f42.html" title="User:Captain Disdain">Captain Disdain</a> 09:53, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

While I'm not sure I want to go on record as having said that "all TV shows are notable", it seems to me that a TV show that lasted 3 seasons and is STILL on air on the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Broadcasting_Network_0af7.html" title="Trinity Broadcasting Network">largest Christian network in the world</a> is notable by any reasonable definition. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 14:41, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As embarassed as I am to admit it, I saw this show a couple times in my younger years. As mentioned before, the ghit count isn't particuarly telling because it's a show for very young children and, on top of that, it serves a niche market. Because christian entertainment is certainly notable and this is a fairly well-known example within that market (perhaps not quite on the level of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Adventures_of_McGee_and_Me_8a5b.html" title="The Adventures of McGee and Me">The Adventures of McGee and Me</a> or <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superbook.html" title="Superbook">Superbook</a> but still well known) that makes it notable.--<a href="../../../v/e/l/User%7EVelvet_elvis81_65b4.html" title="User:Velvet elvis81">Velvet elvis81</a> 15:44, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Um...I don't know if I'm allowed to do this - as I am actually the Tara Hunt being deleted - but the entry isn't encyclopedic. I will disagree that it was self-promotional.

At some point I may accomplish enough to be notable (although I do find it interesting that notability means mainstream media references...but I suppose you need guidelines). It may be helpful in the future to keep the arguments unbiased. I can't argue the lack of references, but I find some of the comments here rather amusing and, moreover, un-encyclopedic.

<li>Okay. Well, thanks. I haven't really appeared in that many "mainstream" articles, really. I speak at quite a few big conferences in my industry (including ETech, Future of Web Apps, etc), but I know that doesn't really count. I must say, though, there are a heckuvalotta small-time porn stars on wikipedia. I suppose that there is a notoriety in that - they've been in 'movies'. I just wanted to point out how biased (and a wee bit sexist) the measure is. I saw a good friend kept after this debate because people said, "He is a notable developer on some fairly prominent web projects" and he is not a developer, nor do I see the notableness of being a developer over a 'soft science' type like myself. I, personally, don't need to have a page, but there is alot of weeding you need to do to justify deletes like mine when lots of stuff is kept that is not very "notable" at all. In fact, the measure I would use is: when history is looked at, will this person/place/thing/event have an impact at all? I know that is hard to judge, but it would help with the current weeding. That's just my opinion, though. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.81.245.70 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.81.245.70_8b92.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.81.245.70">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>The result was <b>move to a centralised discussion</b>. It is clear that there is consensus that these articles do not need to exist and should be <b>deleted</b>. All the opposition to deletion (except one vote) is due to a belief that AFD is not the best way to go about this.</p>
<p>We need to find a way to go about ensuring that there is a suitable opportunity for people who may only have one arbitrary day watchlisted out of the 1400 or so, and enough people have suggested a more centralised discussion for me to think that this is a better idea, as AFD is not the ideal place to determine this kind of wide ranging move (transclusion fixings and the like). I suggest somebody take this to <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENT_a4cb.html" title="WP:CENT">WP:CENT</a> (and refer people to it also via a note on the Village Pump). I will not do this, I am just closing this deletion discussion.</p>
<p>A bot might be helpful to tag all the days with some kind of bespoke 'Please comment on this discussion within 5 days' tag (5 days being the notice people would get via AFD anyway). Please note that the consensus at AFD was, however, that they should be deleted, but this discussion has not been made visible in the way it ought to for each and every article concerned, so further opinion may sway this. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:08, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

</dl>
<p>This is a tough one, so please bear with me. This is in fact a proposal to delete some <i>1,400</i> pages, i.e. all the pages in the categories <a href="../../../d/a/y/Category%7EDays_in_2003_f68b.html" title="Category:Days in 2003">Category:Days in 2003</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Category%7EDays_in_2004_c169.html" title="Category:Days in 2004">Category:Days in 2004</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/y/Category%7EDays_in_2005_c91d.html" title="Category:Days in 2005">Category:Days in 2005</a> and <a href="../../../d/a/y/Category%7EDays_in_2006_59d8.html" title="Category:Days in 2006">Category:Days in 2006</a>, or put otherwise, all articles on individual dates in this Wikipedia. I am <b>not</b> going to tag all those pages individually, unless consensus in this AfD wuold be that I <i>have</i> to do it before further discussion is possible. As far as I have seen, all those pages are quite similar, all seem to be created by <a href="../../../p/c/b/User%7EPcb21_4ad0.html" title="User:Pcb21">User:Pcb21</a>, whom I'll leave a notice on his talk page (even though he seems to have left the project), and no new page are being made (except for five ones in 2006). Reasons for deleting: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> for news reports (and these pages are basically newspaper frontpages), <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a mere collection of internal or external links (these articles say nothing about the date (not much could be said probably), but only provide links to articles about events that happened on said date, making it a strange and unnecessary variant of the disambiguation page). They are unmaintained, redundant, and orphaned (most of the articles have very few links, and most of those were involuntarily (someone linking the whole date instead of the standard double links to day/month and year), with the additional disadvantage that such complete links do not reflect the date preference set by users).</p>
<p>Older dates (2003-2005) also are transcluded onto a month page (last one seems to be <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005.html" title="December 2005">December 2005</a>), which would become largely empty if this AfD is successful. I have no opinion as to the usefullness of these pages, but we can always copy the info for the individual dates to the main month page if needed (as has been done for e.g. <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_2006.html" title="January 2006">January 2006</a>), or use the solution of the portal current events, as has been done since <a href="../../../j/u/l/July_2006.html" title="July 2006">July 2006</a> (yes, we have currently at least three different methods of maintaining month-year pages, another good reason to get rid of one of them).</p>
<p>I don't know if this unusual AfD will run like a normal one or if some special treatment is necessary; whatever you feel I should do to make this AfD more manageable, visual, ..., please say so, and I'll try to do my best. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 10:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Congratulations on a bold proposal. Since this is a blanket nomination, I say <b>keep</b>. I do not see how we can argue adequately for each and every one of those articles. And can anyone really claim that some dates are not important enough to warrant an article that is not merely a collection of wikilinks? To me this seems to be more of a policy proposal than a regular AfD.

<dd>I'd nominate the most notable one and keep nominating notable ones until you get a deletion. Then go for five in the next nom, then ten, then 15, etc as the notability falls. Or you can have a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Template%7ECent_b541.html" title="Template:Cent">centralised discussion</a> and delete all on the basis of that. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 11:57, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I don't quite see why this is problematic. We do have articles on each individual date (<a href="../../../j/a/n/January_1.html" title="January 1">January 1</a> etc) as well as articles on each individual year (<a href="../../../2/0/0/2005.html" title="2005">2005</a>). That's plenty of places to put the information (not to mention the subject-specific lists such as <a href="../../../2/0/0/2005_in_film.html" title="2005 in film">2005 in film</a>). All of that is well-established and heavily edited. <b>This is not</b>, and neither does it particularly help in finding anything. Hence, <b>delete</b> the lot of them. This is neither a policy proposal nor a trainwreck, this is an attempt to get rid of redundant and unmaintainable information. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a data dump. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 12:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks, I hadn't seen those previous AfD's. I just want to say that the individual dates do <i>not</i> have many links (December 16, 2005 has only 5 links, only two to true articles; December 31, 2005 has 5 true links and one via a redirect (oh no, there are redirects to these pages as well!), but only one of these has any real relation to the article; and June 1, 2003 has two links. Then again, January 27, 2006 (which does not exist) has also two incoming links, neither of them of any importance. October 18, 2006 has five incoming links, only one of them of any importance. It doesn't look as if those articles are much missed... But no problem, I would like to hear the opinion of a few more people todecide if we should discuss this at an AfD (this one or smaller ones for individual dates), the Village Pump, <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENT_a4cb.html" title="WP:CENT">WP:CENT</a>, or anywhere else (but please let's keep it in one place!). <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 13:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Discuss elsewhere with Comment</b>. Probably Village Pump (policy). You need to tag each and every article.

<li>Untrue, since <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a bureaucracy, and the fact that most of these articles have only a single author and thus are unlikely to be watched by anyone.

<li>I am not arguing for keeping the article, in fact I think they should be <b>all deleted</b>. I am arguing that <i>the process is faulty</i>. I once had an article deleted out from under me because it wasn't tagged for deletion because someone didn't want to tag 100 articles (2 articles per state times 50 states). The article was on my watchlist, but I was unaware and thus unable to comment on its AfD. I successfully argued to a second AfD in a deletion review. I don't want that to happen here. How do you know that people aren't watching any of the 1400 articles? A widespread discussion at (you pick the place) makes the most sense to me. Otherwise do an AfD nomination with 1400 entries. Just don't let the process fail again.

<li><b>Delete</b> <i>this</i> entry to set a precendent. Reasoning: it belongs to Wikinews not there. For example, let's compare it with December, 16: the latter has section on events, each of them is notable, and most of them either have their own article, or play important role in another linked article. Then go sections on births and deaths of notable people.

Articles such as <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_2005.html" title="December 2005">December 2005</a> are almost <i>completely</i> made up of these types of articles transcluded, so in effect deleteing individual date pages such as this one also blanks those month pages. Probably these should really be <a href="../../../s/u/b/WP%7ESUBST_6f53.html" title="WP:SUBST">subst'd</a> instead, but we'd still probably need to keep the individual dates as redirects for the page history. At any rate I really think this needs to be discussed at <a href="../../../c/e/n/WP%7ECENT_a4cb.html" title="WP:CENT">WP:CENT</a> or some other appropriate venue, not at AfD. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryanG_1aea.html" title="User:BryanG">BryanG</a><sup><a href="../../../b/r/y/User_talk%7EBryanG_f39b.html" title="User talk:BryanG">(talk)</a></sup> 21:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>No opinion.</b> I think this is a fascinating idea. Fram argued that a single user created these pages, which for obvious reasons are no longer maintained or categorized. I also agree that the information contained in the "day" pages is redundant with what can or should be found in the "month" and "year" pages. There are a couple of other points to make. First, I am not convinced that ten separate events are truly held together by the coincidence that they all occurred on the same day. Of course, the four plane crashes on September 11, 2001 <i>are</i> held together because they all resulted from a single terrorist plan. But there is no relationship between those attacks and the results of games that took place in the Italian soccer league on that day (for example). Second, it seems unreasonable to me that Wikipedia should contain day-by-day entries starting in 2003, but not beforehand. We have some sort of timeline for World War 2, but should we have individual articles for "September 1, 1939" and "December 7, 1941"? Obviously not. In spite of all that, the scope of this discussion is too large to handle in a standard AfD. You could either nominate "day" articles for ten days at a time so that each individual article can be reviewed, or you can transfer the discussion elsewhere, as others have suggested. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 22:34, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'm undecided on whether or not to delete these articles, keep them or merge them into existing by-month or by-year articles. The one opinion I do have is that <i>all</i> these articles should be handled the same way. It wouldn't make sense to keep some of them and delete others (except possibly to delete dates which are empty of information). So the only suggestions above I don't agree with are things like "delete this date to set a precedent" or "delete a couple of them and see what happens". Instead, consider all these articles part of the same informational structure, and handle them as a complete unit. If the structure is redundant and/or impossible to maintain, then delete all of it. If the structure can be somehow maintained, and the information appears interesting and useful to readers, then keep it all and maybe look for a project to handle upkeep. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:47, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> Normally, batch nominations are to be done with great care. However, all these articles are essentially the same, with the essential nature of each article common to all 1400 articles. Thus, it is feasible to evaluate the merits of the articles in one sitting. Batch noms cause real problems when there are substantive differences between the articles and/or the article's content, causing commentors to split their&#160;!votes. That is, all the articles are a bullet point of news headlines for the day's news, with links to those news stories. However, Wikipedia is not <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">an indiscriminate collection of information</a>, and there is such a thing as Wikinews. Thus, I say <b>Delete all</b>. Failing that, I recommend taking this to the village pump for policy development.-- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanntm_9b62.html" title="User:Danntm">danntm</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/a/n/User_talk%7EDanntm_6305.html" title="User talk:Danntm">T</a></sup> <sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Danntm_aafb.html" title="Special:Contributions/Danntm">C</a></sub> 05:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Close, then rethink the strategy without going through AfD first</b> There's very few things these days that make me reach for the speedy keep thingy, and nominating 1400 articles in one go is one of them. I'm not sure if we can form a binding result here and now; if we decide things here and now, the closing admin will have an absolutely sucky afternoon. We need to decide this elsewhere and with less strict time limits. But since the nom asked, here's my recommendation anyway: Turn all of the articles to redirects to the individual days, without merges (<a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16%2C_2005.html" title="December 16, 2005">December 16, 2005</a> to <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_16.html" title="December 16">December 16</a>, etc), let God sort the mergeable content out; then reach a strong opinion on what to do with them for the future years and as-of-yet uncreated day articles (leave them uncreated or turn them to redirects too). --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 12:06, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>'<i>Strong Delete all</i> It would make <b>some</b> sense to create these for the current year, and then delete or merge them, but it wouldn't be worth the work.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had no idea there was a category for surnames. Anyways, after looking over that category and clicking around randomly it seems that all the surnames listed there link to disambiguation pages that link to all individuals who have articles and that surname. The article under discussion here is an actual article rather than a disambiguation page, which is why I am questioning notability. I think surnames are different from villages and such, but that is a discussion for a general policy rather than this particular article. I wouldn't mind seeing this as a disambiguation page perhaps with a small intro but I still don't see a reason to have actual articles on surnames. Wikipedia also clearly doesn't actually aim to provide the complete sum of human knowledge otherwise we'd wouldn't have policies regarding notability and only have policies regarding verifiability. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 00:38, 31 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It's not clear that this person is significant or notable; although a documentary film and a book are mentioned, no details are given, and the implication is that they're produced either by the company that he runs (which would give them something like vanity status) or by one of the organisations for/with which he works (which isn't much better). There's no sign of any sort of peer-reviewed publication or widely available or known work, or of anything significant that he's done or produced. Earlier versions of this article were speedily deleted as they made no attempt to claim significance for him.

<dd>The first three don't demonstrate notability in themselves; much depends upon the notability of the otrganisations concerned (and they're not very notable); the last would only count if the book and film were genuinely widely (not "semi-widely", whatever that means) circulated — and there's no indication that that's the case. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 19:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would contend that the organizations are very notable, if a quick Google search showing pages mentioning them is any indication. On the point about how widely the books and film need to be circulated, both have been viewed several thousands of times. (about 33,000 views for <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6581761732541483047" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6581761732541483047" rel="nofollow">the film on Google videos alone</a> which is just a quick statistic not taking into account the DVDs and other ways the film was distributed; I would assume the books have been similarly widely read) I personally would consider that fairly widely viewed. (of course no where near as much as blockbusters, but a healthy amount compared to other similar types of documentaries and books) (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">Cardsplayer4life</a> 03:28, 5 January 2007 (UTC))</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> vanity. Not significant. As was noted above, Bruce Klein has no peer-reviewed publications and has made no significant contributions to society that are worth writing about. Should everyone with a website be entitled to their own vanity article at Wikipedia? Publishing an unpopular ebook is not only not notable, but it's trivial in the internet age where free publishers abound and will accept anything for online publication. Unless it's on Amazon best seller list or equivalent, the ebook publication is not notable. Similarly, being the owner/administrator of a website forum that calls itself CEO of non-notable or otherwise questionable organizations is not basis for a wikipedia article. Like I said above, Bruce Klein owns a website, just like millions of other people, and that is not basis for a wikipedia article. --<a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a>

<dd>He doesn't simply "own" a website as you contend. He is the co-founder of one institute, is the director of a fairly large research institute, and is the CEO/President of moderate sized company. He also has websites and such, I am sure, but that was not expressed as a reason for his page to be kept. I do not personally know how much the book was distributed, so if you have statistics to back up your claim that it was "unpopular", I would be interested in seeing them, but if the distrobution of the movie is any indication (it may not be, but they are the only statistics I could find) then it is fairly popular. (as stated earlier, over 33,000 people watched film) (<a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECardsplayer4life_41e9.html" title="User:Cardsplayer4life">Cardsplayer4life</a> 17:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC))

<dd>He does simply own a website and his finance degree is not even related to immortality, life extension, or science at all. Anyone can setup a website forum nowadays and label their forum as some institution or company; that is not notable. I labeled his book as "unpopular" because it is not on any best-seller list and also because no-one I know has ever heard of it, nor of Bruce Klein's company. Like I said above, anyone can produce ebooks nowadays. It's as simple as producing a pdf and uploading to a web server. Anyone can do this. And about his "movie" on Google Video, are you kidding? Do you know that anyone with a webcam and video editing software can make these things? Do you know how many people upload movies to Google Video and YouTube every day? Uploading a home video to Google Video or YouTube is not notable. I still have not seen one notable accomplishment from Bruce Klein.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Bruce Klein is President of Novamente LLC, an active AI software company with a dozen staff and contracts with major customers. He also was founder of the Immortality Institute, which organized a large conference last year; and organized a conference for the AGI Research Institute this year, which included a number of prominent AI researchers in attendance. By the standards of wikipedia's other entries it is VERY VERY OBVIOUS that Bruce is sufficiently "important" to merit a Wikipedia entry. I believe this attempt to get Bruce, Ben Goertzel and Novamente LLC removed is simply an attack by someone who is angry at Bruce Klein due to internal Immortality Institute politics. I note that in recent weeks Bruce's colleagues have been spammed by some particular person angry at Bruce due to ImmInst politics, and the AGIRI wiki site has been vandalized. It is a shame that this attack has spilled over onto wikipedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.140.44.37_6545.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.140.44.37">69.140.44.37</a> (talk) 19:45, 6 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<dd>First, running a company with twelve employees does not make for notability. Secondly, anyone can form an institute and organise a conference; it doesn't require, nor does it create, notability. Thirdly, being a conference organiser doesn't make one notable (do you have any idea how many conferences there are every month? I've organised conferences myself; I was co-organiser of an international philosophy conference held in London when I was a third-year undergraduate. It didn't make me notable). Finally, the implication that those who are arguing for the deletion of this page are doing so in bad faith is objectionable, and likely not to help the cause about which you clearly feel strongly, and with which you are personally involved — whoever you are. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 20:49, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This person who posted the above comment with IP address 69.140.44.37 is Ben Goertzel who also had his vanity article deleted. Both the Bruce Klein and Ben Goertzel vanity pages linked to each, which suggests to me that they are both working together to attempt to create their Wikipedia vanity pages. Thus, Ben's suggestion to "Keep" the Bruce Klein vanity article should not be given any merit since this person has questionable ulterior motives that does not include doing what's best for the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 22:32, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Bruce Klein founded the Immortality Institute, which until just a few months ago owned the top rank for the word "immortality". In effect, it has been a hub for immortalist movement for the past several years. The Immortality Institute has attracted notable scientists in the aging field, including Aubrey de Grey and S. Jay Olshansky, as well as other prominent figures in the areas of artificial intelligence and cryonics. The institute's first book, while not a national best seller, included big name authors. The movie may be available for download, but that hardly makes it a "home video". It's a documentary stitched together from dozens of hours of footage of scores of individuals across the country. As for ulterior motives, who is this Mnepomis? His position shows a familiarity and disdain for Bruce that should make his position as irrelevant as he asserts that Ben Goertzel's should be. <i>My</i> "ulterior" motive? I have nothing to hide. I'm a director and former chair of the Immortality Institute. Unlike Bruce, I don't think my accomplishments deserve a page at wikipedia. Bruce, on the other hand, formed a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and secured the support of authors, scientists, and financial donors, and put the Immortality Institute on the map within the immortalist and life extension communities. We have multiple ties with the Methuselah Foundation; Aubrey de Grey is an Advisor at our institute. Bruce now leads the Novamente team, building upon the connections and experience gained in building the Immortality Institute. I say Keep. Jaydfox 05:17, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Jaydfox, the reason you don't have a Wikipedia page is the same reason as Mr. Klein; neither of you are notable. As for my motive, I am trying to ensure Wikipedia standards and to not have any 'John Doe' feel like they're entitled to post their vanity pages at Wikipedia. Maybe this isn't just a vanity page, but may also be a marketing ploy to direct visitors to the Imminst forum to try to get money from them. Whatever it is, I can tell you what it definitely is not: It's not an article over a notable person. You think it's notable that Bruce Klein's website used to have top rank at Google for the word, "immortality"? Are you kidding? Show me peer-reviewed publications, or a Nobel prize or Field's medal, or just anything that's considered "notable" or otherwise a significant contribution to society, and I'll be happy to change my vote. The desperation of the Imminst forum staff to have this page suggests it's partly a marketing ploy and a lame attempt to get visitors to Bruce Klein's forum.

<li><b>Keep</b> - but out of curiosity why do you have a humble wiki page as you call it Mnemopis, since every argument you have asserted against Bruce is just as relevant with respect to your own page? In fact even more so since you claim no notability and demonstrate none.<br />
Why haven't you deleted your own page due to its lack of merit?<br />
Is it perhaps that you don't have sufficient *notoriety* to warrant even this much debate over your page as I have read so far on this page and perhaps envy the interest? His page should be kept for his apparent notoriety if not his still nascent notability. He certainly garners sufficient interest and support to warrant it.<br />
Your disdain for the topic of Bruce's sincere interest and demonstrated commitment to the promotion of human longevity is "noted". Nevertheless it does not require peer reviewed publication to warrant a page as apparently you have such a user page and present no such credentials to support having it. It also doesn't require unanimous approval of the individual. What I see listed on Bruce's page are verifiable facts. They may not be noteworthy to some but they are to others and ultimately it is the interest that they hold at all that matters most as criteria to keep a Wiki user page.<br />
Also the interest shown by many of the members of the forum to keep this page is not a "marketing ploy" since the institute doesn't "sell" anything as a product. It is however a legitimate method of attracting interest in an idea that is at the core of the institution's purpose: to promote longevity through learning and action. Bruce's efforts are noteworthy in that his efforts have yielded some small global organizational result already toward this goal and he shouldn't have to die to be made notable for taking the idea mainstream. Wikipedia should keep his and even keep yours in my opinion Mnemopis. 08:46, 7 January 2007 69.119.142.107 08:39, 7 January 2007 (UTC) Ken Sills

<dd>No matter how many sock puppets vote to "Keep" the Bruce Klein vanity page, it doesn't matter because the real Wikipedians have already overwhelmingly voted to "Delete" it. It's nothing personal. It's just standard Wikipedia policy. If everyone was free to post their vanity pages, then the quality of Wikipedia would go way down. You have your own personal website, so post your vanity pages there. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 09:07, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

This is not only a form of unfair discrimination by definition if true; it also sounds like you certainly are making it personal. 69.119.142.107 14:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)Ken

<dd>I don't know if they are talking about user pages or not, but getting to Mnemopis's points: 1) <i>Everyone</i> is a "real Wikipedian" as you put it, that is the point of having an open encyclopedia. (and they are not sock puppets, that would infer the same person every time with different accounts, if I understand the term correctly, which is most definitely not the case) 2) Bruce's page isn't a vanity page, that is the whole point of the previous points made on his notability that you have not yet countered.

<dd>Cardsplayer, the problem I have is that the Bruce Klein page is a mere 4 sentences that contains nothing notable, nor that anyone considers a significant contribution to society. The only people who are voting to "Keep" are either anons, sock puppets, or members from Bruce Klein's web forum who were exhorted to come here and vote but who have never used Wikipedia before. This last part is problematic because these forum members who were exhorted to vote seem to be under the impression that Wikipedia is a free-for-all and that practically anybody and everybody should have their own vanity page here. That's not what Wikipedia is about. Show me something notable. The absence of anything definitely notable about Bruce Klein is reason enough to delete this 4 sentence vanity article. Bruce Klein might have good intentions with his Immortalist movement; that's fantastic. I, myself, would like to end world hunger and bring world peace; but good intentions are not notable. And neither is having a web forum that is designated an "institution", nor is producing home videos and uploading to Google Video or YouTube, and neither is producing pdf's and making available on a server. You may be under the mistaken impression that a person with lots of non-notable things makes for a person that is notable. Well, a bunch of zeros still add up to zero. <a href="../../../m/n/e/User%7EMnemopis_cf30.html" title="User:Mnemopis">Mnemopis</a> 21:19, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't accept that everyone is a real Wikipedian, though in fact that isn't how I put it; editors from anon IP addresses count for little in this sort of debate, and are barred from voting in many debates, precisely because they're not accounted sufficiently part of the Wikipedia community. And the page is vanity (though that term is, I admit, used nonstandardly in Wikipedia). --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 17:34, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, as I said I was responding to Mnemopis on that.

<dd>Well, so far one "keep" has been registered by an account that has more than twenty edits behind it; the others are either from anon IP addresses, or in all but one case an account whose one and only edit has been here (the exception has nineteen previosu edits, of which twelve were made to other AfD discussions in the minutes before the edit to this one). In my book, none of them count as real Wikipedians for the purposes of taking what they say seriously, or counting them in closing the AfD. I think that I can fairly say that that's an almost universally held view among regular editors and admins. --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font></a>) 00:20, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I find it humorous that you get to decide who gets to vote and who doesn't since you are the one who nominated the article for deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Bruce Klein is not just another website founder. He is unique. The website he founded is also unique as would be revealed if one spent some time looking through the history and the posts.

To brush-off the accomplishment of not only a website which has impacted individuals to transform their lives, but also a film, and a book, dealing with a subject as taboo as the pursuit of physical immortality, does not do the person who reccomends deletion any favors by illuminating their inability to see the significance of Bruce Klein's contribution.--Kevinperrott 00:40, 9 January 2007 (UTC) (<b>Note</b>: first and only edit from this account.)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the <a href="http://www.imminst.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.imminst.org/" rel="nofollow">Immortality Institute</a>. which Bruce Klein has co-created and run has been a major force in the world of life extension.

The Immortality Institute on-line forums are well-utilized and active discussion areas in the subcultures of <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life-extension.html" title="Life-extension">life-extension</a>, <a href="../../../i/m/m/Immortality.html" title="Immortality">immortalism</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/n/Nanotechnology.html" title="Nanotechnology">nanotechnology</a>, <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transhumanism.html" title="Transhumanism">transhumanism</a>, <a href="../../../c/r/y/Cryonics.html" title="Cryonics">cryonics</a>, etc. The website is currently ranked at about 142 thousand on <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.imminst.org%2F" class="external text" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=www.imminst.org%2F" rel="nofollow">Alexa.com</a>.. This can't compare to Wikipedia, but it is a high ranking in the context of websites in the world which probably number in the millions. More important, however, is the influence Bruce has had through his organization both in the website and his many other projects in which his profile is much lower than what he deserves. His book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9875611352" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9875611352" rel="nofollow">The Scientific Conquest of Death</a>. is published in the name of the Immortality Institute, and yet it is really the product of his effort. Similarly, his DVD/video <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6581761732541483047&amp;q=Exploring+Life+Extention" class="external text" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6581761732541483047&amp;q=Exploring+Life+Extention" rel="nofollow">Exploring Life Extension</a>. was not created under his own name, but the interviews were almost entirely produced by him. (He is not even mentioned in this notable and valuable contribution to documentation of the <a href="../../../l/i/f/Life_extension.html" title="Life extension">life extension</a> movement.) His last <a href="http://imminst.org/conference/" class="external text" title="http://imminst.org/conference/" rel="nofollow">conference in Atlanta, Georgia</a>. was attended by over 150 people, a respectable number for a scientific conference.

Or of a conference that he helped organize that brought in a whopping 150 people. Are you kidding? Most conferences I've heard of bring in at least over 20,000. 150 people is hardly a conference.

<li><b>Delete</b> Biting my lip to avoid all the jokes that spring to mind, the bottom line is that in most cases there's no reason to sort people by physical attributes. The main exception might be when a physical attribute is typically used by an industry in some sort of official capacity. For example, boxing commonly lists boxers by height, weight and reach, so one could reasonably argue that it makes sense to create lists sorting articles about boxers into weight classes, ordering by height or ordering by reach. By contrast, bra size has no particular official use for (most) female celebrities. It might be possible to come up with <i>some</i> industry that would find bra sizes actually a very useful statistic, but the broad overall category of "celebrities" isn't that industry. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 23:59, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

Okay, maybe it's just that I'm a guy and I never read the manuals anyway and I can't make sense of all these weird numbers =) Also, some issues with the content: "Smallest" and "Biggest" are misleading because they're based on the list itself and not any source that would actually say anything about biggest and smallest.

<p>It's since been deleted three times by separate admins at Gone with the blastwave, and is back yet again and was tagged for <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html#A7" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD#A7</a> again.

<dd>Sorry I don't do much outside of reading articals so I am not sure of this procedure but I am assuming I am supposed to reply here. No, I am not a forum moderator, I am not even signed up to the forums. I also do not believe that this artical was largly my work, if you compare my edits to the previous version, you will see that I mainly made the already existing artical clearer. The fact that this comic is going into print is what matters, not that it's publisher is a small company.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Here is my proof that this webcomic is notable:</dd>
<dd>1) It had around 16,000 unique site views and around 46,000 page views on New Years Day alone (which is a traditionally low traffic day) and records don't go far enough back for me to see what kind of traffic it was getting before the festive season. <a href="http://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id=856&amp;type=3" class="external free" title="http://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id=856&amp;type=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.projectwonderful.com/advertisehere.php?id=856&amp;type=3</a></dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>2) It was featured on the main page of VGcats.com for several weeks recently (VG cats is one of the most notable webcomics)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>3) It is coming 22nd in the buzzComix list (one of the most notable comic ranking sites). <a href="http://www.buzzcomix.net/index.php?from=1&amp;to=100&amp;bannershow=10#Morr" class="external free" title="http://www.buzzcomix.net/index.php?from=1&amp;to=100&amp;bannershow=10#Morr" rel="nofollow">http://www.buzzcomix.net/index.php?from=1&amp;to=100&amp;bannershow=10#Morr</a></dd>
</dl>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>5) It had an artical written on it in 'No Mutants Allowed' <a href="http://www.nma-fallout.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.nma-fallout.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nma-fallout.com/</a> (which has an alexa rank of 65,634)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>6) The comic itself has an alexa ranking of 66,374 (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blastwavecomic.com%2F" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blastwavecomic.com%2F" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blastwavecomic.com%2F</a>)</dd>

</dl>
<dl>
<dd>8) It was also featured in a Polish magazine which I do not have an image of.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>9) It is going into print.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>NEW 10) Prints of images based on or around the comic are available right now. Website seems to be down (?!) link coming soon...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for the proposed salting, the previous articals were created many months apart and reflect different stages in this webcomics development. Even this artical was to be deleted, who is to say this webcomic wont become far more notable in the near future, and a salting would hamper efforts to create an artical. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 13:30, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>None of these "sources" even remotely qualify it for inclusion. To begin with, pageviews, Alexa ranking, and hits are not sufficient to form the basis for keeping an article. The article needs to be the object of several reliable, verifiable articles. You have provided no evidence of this, other than one article on a single website - (which I cannot find, but I will take your word for it). You picture of the national newspaper is not verifiable, as we have no idea why they are printing a single frame of your comic, or for what purpose. The same could be said of the purported Polish magazine. Suffice to say there is no evidence of notability, and (as noted) the article remains basically unchanged from the previous form. A future promise to get it into print means nothing either. I vote to <b>Delete</b>, but not salt, since the strip may become notable in the near future. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 19:04, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, Darkcraft's sources look promising. And what's with the salting requests? The webcomic may be a bit borderline on the notability department right now, but it's still being updated and publication seems likely in the near future so the situation could easily change. Salting should only be for something that will definitely <i>never</i> warrant an article. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 16:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>When an article is repeatedly re-created and then dleeted and then re-created, without anything actually changing overmuch other than perhaps being published by a guy who publishes one other cartoon, his own, then <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">WP:SALT</a> is appropriate. This has already been transwiki'd top Comixpedia. Plus the artist says he's off to join the army anyway. The above info is not significantly different from what was seen at last AfD, the ranking of 22 puts it well below other comics which have been deleted previously. Nothing here speaks of actual encyclopaedic notability. And then there's the <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> problem... <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 16:43, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Guy, your ability to misrepresent facts to further press your own viewpoints on others is amazing. The artist is going on compulsory 6 month army service, after that he is coming back to continue his comic. A lot has changed since last time a similar artical was created, and in my opinion, and apparently the opinion of most people, it has become notable enough to have it included in Wikipedia. I don't see any problem with Original Research in this artical, and that does not seem to be the issue here anyway.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 01:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article can be found on page 24 on the Nov 23, 2006 issue of Tages Anzeiger, available online on pressdisplay.com . It's in German, though, so I can't read what it says, but other editors should be able to verify what it says. However, you certainly have a point regarding the Polish magazine, which isn't verifiable.

<li><b>Keep</b> You begin to wonder what makes a comic notable. Whether or not the author goes on a hiatus should not be taken into consideration regarding the <b>notability</b> of the comic. This has been confirmed to have been in one newspaper. You'd be better off trying to find other webcomic articles that have no notability at all. According to the notability guidelines, it has to have been the subject of multiple published sources. We currently have one newspaper and one magazine. If I'm not mistaken that's multiple. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndecisionV_59dd.html" title="User:IndecisionV">IndecisionV</a> 23:51, 4 January 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndecisionV_59dd.html" title="User:IndecisionV">IndecisionV</a> (<a href="../../../i/n/d/User_talk%7EIndecisionV_2026.html" title="User talk:IndecisionV">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_IndecisionV_049a.html" title="Special:Contributions/IndecisionV">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<dd>I agree, standards have to be met, but what this string of comments is discussing is Guy and how he, in my opinion, is doing something he shouldn't by placing SPA tags on the comments of 3 people, whilst two of those people have accounts with a fair amount of edits and have existed since before this artical. It says in the SPA guildines that by placing an SPA tag outside of the guildines, action can be taken against you, so clearly he was doing something wrong.

Again, this is <i>not</i> a vote, and it serves absolutely no constructive purpose to have editors weighing in on an article with little to no understanding of the standards required.

<li>A single unverifiable newspaper article, which no one has examined, and of which we have no idea of the context being used.

This does <b>not</b> meet the standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.</li>
<li>A purported magazine article, of which there is absolutely no evidence given that it even exists. This <i>definitely</i> does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.</li>

<dd>I reiterate, <i>again</i> that the only meaningful criteria for keeping the article in question is whether or not it conforms to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>.

<dd>It is up to all editors to find out how notable this is and weigh in all evidence. I am giving you evidence, but you are saying "Not good enough I need more" without actually searching for more yourself. Furthermore, the newspaper IS verifiable as other peoples comments have stated. I am hoping to get more information on the magazine artical soon. The editors are not accepting this without question, the ones who agree appear to have weighed the facts and decided this is notable and worth inclusion. Alexa is not E-polling, it is a measure of how many visit the site, and is an excellent resource to determine a sites popularity. Many arguments of notability and popularity include Alexa rankings and amounts of site visitors as they are hard facts and are not subjective. <a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 06:08, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The onus is not on me to find evidence which may, or may not, exist. I have done my research, and determined that this article does not quality for inclusion under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. I have no other evidence to present. I will, however, take issue with other evidence presented. Especially when it simply does not conform too <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, or even <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. In material that I accept would conform to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> standards, you have a single article which apparently no one can read, in order to back up your claims of it conforming to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> (I would question how you know it is applicable to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, when you cannot even read it, but that is besides the point) and a magazine article which may or may not exist in any form useful to us. Again, under <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a> the onus is on <i>you</i> to show that these are reliable sources relevant to the object being discussed. This has <b>not</b> been done, and as such they do not qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and the article should not be included. Claims are evidence are not evidence, evidence we cannot examine is not evidence, evidence no one has a (even untranslated) text of is not evidence.</li>
<li>Per the Alexa rankings - the fact that others have used them as some kind of metric for notability does not matter. All kinds of erroneous arguments are routinely put forward in deletion debates relating to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> (as our anonymous friend has illustrated) but they have no bearing on the argument. Again, read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> - nowhere in that section are Alexa rankings listed. They have absolutely no bearing on this discussion, and should be totally dropped from consideration - again, the features we must consider are laid out in <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. <b>None of the purported references meet this standard</b>. You have repeatedly claimed they, yet there has been no evidence that they do. Again, under <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">WP:VERIFY</a>, the onus is on <i>you</i> to show they do - not on me, or any other editor, unless they so wish it. I have tried my <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">good faith</a> best to ascertain the status of both articles but have been stymied by the fact that one simply has not been presented, and the other no one can apparently either read, or even provide a transcript of it for translation. I cannot in good conscience consider retaining an article on the strength of such completely nebulous sources, and I <i>strongly</i> urge other editors to consider this argument in reaching consensus on this matter. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 07:52, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>So the Alexa rankings are not evidence because you say they are not evidence? They are not evidence because they are not part of the guildines? Alexa rankings are an <i>unbiased</i>, <i>objective</i> source for <i>data</i>. This <i>unbiased</i>, <i>objective</i> source is giving us information but you want to discard it because it is not part of the guildines? It is a similar story with the amount of hits it gets. Take for example Chugworth (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugworth_Academy" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugworth_Academy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugworth_Academy</a>) (<a href="http://chugworth.com/" class="external free" title="http://chugworth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://chugworth.com/</a>). When you discard it's Alexa rank, amount of visitors, and links from other comics, you have virtually no evidence of notability. Do you know why that artical has not been deleted? Because the guildines are guidlines, not cold, definate rule. Very few webcomics that currently have wikipedia articals would actually fit the guildines for notability because a webcomic being: A) Put to print, B) Featured in an offline publication, or C) Being featured on a major website, is a <i>major</i> and very rare accomplishment. You seem to be completely ignoring that this webcomic is about to be put to print. Clearly we have an artical about this webcomic in a national newspaper, but due to problems that we seem unable to avoid, we cannot actually read it I have unsubstantionated claims that it was featured in a Polish magazine. At this point, I can't back up those claims, but in my opinion you should at least give me the benefit of the doubt. I believe that this webcomic is notable enough to make it into wikipedia, however some people's strictness when it comes to the guidlines means we have to debate whether it should be considered notable. We even had a <i>deletionist</i> agree with me, and I believe that really does mean something.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 08:16, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><s>I very strongly disagree with your decision and it seems as though most of the community agrees with me. In my opinion, I was not using the 'Pokemon Defence' as I was drawing no parallels between this artical and 'Chugworth', but I was trying to make people look at the decision process behind deciding whether an artical on a webcomic exists or not, and why it differs from Chugworth to Gone With The Blastwave. As for the inclusion not equaling notability, I could find many other webcomics on Wikipedia from which I could use a similar process to invalidate the WP:NOTE arguement. In general, I believe that Wikipedia is too hard on webcomics because it is so difficult for them to fulfill those criteria. I would have liked another day of debate because I would have liked to have seen a rebuttal to my post just above yours, and I believe 'Guy' was not acting as he should have.</s></dd>

<dd>How do we cite them, per say? Since none of us read the language the newspaper is in, there's no possible information we can get from it. Multiple non-trivial published works. One newspaper and one magazine. If you're going to say two is not multiple I'm afraid I will have to throw a dictionary at you. If your problem is that the magazine has not been verified yet, I would have to suggest you wait on the <b>Delete</b>s until it is <i>proven that the claim is false.</i> Also, no one has used the Pokemon Defense, the only thing I can see that you could have mistaken for it is Chugworth Acadamy. He is simply stating that by the very guidelines you are condemning this article that Chugworth Acadamy has no right to exist.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Again, if you can provide a clean scan, or transcript, I know people who can read German, and would be happy to help out. Until then, we cannot determine the nature of the publication, and so the evidence cannot qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. With respect to the magazine, we have no <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">verifiable</a> evidence that the story exists, let alone whether or not it is relevant. Claiming this article as a source is contradictory to every <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> stands for. I have addressed the Chugworth issue, but would state in any case that it is irrelevant to the issue at hand - even if Chugworth failed under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, which it does not, that would not mean we allow other articles to remain if they fail as well. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 19:49, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>WP:NOTE is not set in stone, as it says itself. I believe I have enough evidence of notability to prevent this artical from being deleted at this time. Where in WP:NOTE, does it say, even though we have evidence of an existance in a national publication and website, that our inability to read it at this time means that it can't be used as evidence, and is "contradictory to every(thing) <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> stands for." Ok let's say, purely for the sake of argument, that this entire newspaper artical is saying how terrible this webcomic is and that it is really bad. So what? It was still in a national independant publication, which works under WP:NOTE.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 00:47, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Again, please read the standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. In order for an article to qualify it must have multiple, non-trivial, publications in which it is the main subject of discussion. Because we cannot read the article, we have no evidence that this is the case - all we know is that a newspaper used a single cell of the comic in a publication. We have no idea what the context is, or if it qualifies under the requirements in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> - therefore, we cannot admit it as evidence of notability. Again, although <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> is <i>not</i> set in stone, it has reached one of the highest levels of consensus possible, next to official policy, and unless there is a compelling reason to consider an exception, it should not be ignored. In fact, the section you are opting to be overlooked is the very <i>core</i> of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, which is derived from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, which is official policy on the site. Either you are arguing one of two things - that your site does not qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, but that doesn't matter, because <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> should be disregarded, or that your sources do qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. I would object to the first argument in the <b>strongest</b> possible to terms, and believe that I have shown that the second argument is incorrect by the policies outlined in <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. If you wish to take issue with the standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a> then I suggest you bring it up on their discussion pages, and argue that webcomics should be prevented more leeway than is currently perscribed. Once you get that changed agreed to, then you can re-create the page, if it is deleted. A deletion argument is the wrong place to begin arguing that the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> standards are misapplied or incorrect. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 02:10, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The newspaper article <b>does not meet standards</b> and thus does not qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. We have no way of ascertaining the nature of the article in question - simply being mentioned, or included, in an article does not meet standards. It must be the <i>object</i> of the article in question. We have no idea whether or not that is the case here. <b>This does not qualify.</b></li>
<li>The given mention in NMA does not qualify - a two-sentence news post does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. None of the other mentions I can find on that site are any longer. This <i>does not meet standards</i>, and <b>does not qualify</b>.</li>
<li>Alexa rankings, Buzzcomix, cross-links by VGCats, etc. None of these qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, as I have repeatedly explained to you, and am not exactly keen to explain once again. <b>They do not qualify</b>.</li>
<li>The Polish magazine does not qualify, since we have no idea about it, as we have not been given a name, date, or any other documentation of existence. <b>This does not quality</b>.</li>
<li>A promise to be going into print in the near future does not qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. Future notability does not translate into current notability. If the publishing deal goes through, then it meets standards. Not before. <b>This does not qualify</b>.</li>
<li>Let me say this again, to be <i>very</i> clear - <b>none of your sources qualify the article for notability under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a></b>.

<dd>I have read all the guidlines, and I have determined that this artical is notable according to those guidlines. The guidlines themselves say to use common sense, and common sense tells me to include Alexa/siteviews as evidence. I don't understand how being mentioned by several webcomics, at least one notable one, does not qualify under WP:NOTE. I have expressed my views multiple times and I stand by them. This debate is going in circles. Unless you or someone else has any new evidence or whatever to bring up in this debate, I think it is time we had an admin close this. We have both explained how we have drawn our respective conclusions, and we both disagree with eachother, so I see no point in continuing this. As I said before, I will now sit and wait for an admin to close this, unless someone has more to add.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 11:37, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh one thing I didn't point out is my reasoning behind the webcomics being sources. Here is an extract from WP:NOTE:</dd>
<dd>"What constitutes "published works" is broad and encompasses published works in all forms"</dd>
<dd>VG Cats is an independant, published, notable work, so therefore it should be acceptable under WP:NOTE.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 11:42, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> - there's really no reason to request a close on this - it expires in a couple of days, at which time an admin will make a descision. You are misreading the guidelines under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28web%29_6df7.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (web)">Wikipedia:Notability (web)</a>. Alexa/siteviews <i>do not</i> fall under the purview of those sections, in the same way that Ghits do not. Look at the criteria for inclusion. <b>Nowhere</b> are this mentioned in it - thus, it does not qualify for inclusion. It really cannot be anymore singlular. There have been no <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> sources which meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> presented, and thus this article does not meet standard. Again, a link from VGCats does not count. Two sentences of "check out this comic" do not count. The webcomic community routinely engages in this kind of tit-for-tat recognition, and it does <i>not</i> qualify as a <b>non-trivial</b> published works. You seem to believe that because a source is notable, everything they write is qualifiable for inclusion under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. This is not the case - if the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Times_d49e.html" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> wrote an article about webcomics, and included <a href="../../../g/o/n/Gone_with_the_Blastwave_8a11.html" title="Gone with the Blastwave">Gone with the Blastwave</a> in a list in that article it would <b>not</b>qualify - it doesn't matter that the New York Times is one of the most reputable and notable newspapers in the world. It still does not meet standards. In order to qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> a source must meet <i>every word</i> of <i>has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself</i> - not some of them, and certainly not just the parts that apply to the particular purported source under consideration. Again, you seem to harbour grave misunderstandings about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and I strongly urge you to re-read the guidelines therein. You are attempting to retain an article based on notability, without having any sources or references which conform to standards. I find this unacceptable - it is nothing against the comic (I very much enjoyed reading it) - but rather a belief in the guidelines which help improve Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 20:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I did not request that an admin closes this, I said that I am content to wait for an admin to close this, because neither of us are bringing anything new to this debate. Gone With The Blastwave is mentioned 4 times on that page, but due to that sites lack of a search feature, I can't find anymore references to it from that site. These mentions are small, but together they must count for something. Sorry I will continue my rebutal later, I have to go now.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 00:33, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(Continuing from above) Yes, I know that Alexa and siteviews do not fall under WP:NOTE. WP:NOTE says editors should use common sense, and my common sense is telling me that it's Alexa rank is high enough for it to have some weight as to the deletion of this artical, and so do it's site views (having an Alexa rank of below 100,000 is a proposed addition to the WP:WEB guidlines anyway). I don't understand why you choose to follow these <b>guidlines</b> to the letter, when really they are just guidlines, and they themselves ask editors to use common sense. You didn't explain why being featured on VG Cats doesn't count under WP:NOTE. My interpretation of WP:NOTE is that it does. Gone With The Blastwave has been linked to by several webcomics, and even if somehow none of them fit under WP:NOTE, it should still hold some weight.</dd>
<dd>WP:V is irrelevent unless we are sourcing material from the newspaper into the artical. Surely you will agree with me about that. The newspaper artical/image fit in under WP:NOTE because, and I will repeat this as many times as I have to, whatever the context, artwork from the webcomic was featured in a national, independant newspaper. Your analogy about it being featured as a list in The New York Times makes little sense, if this image and artical were featured in The New York Times, I would still believe that it fit in under WP:NOTE.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 09:37, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>, although the article needs to freshen up. The easiest thing to do would be to reimport the olsd article from Comixpedia and bring it up to date, rather than fixing the current one (which seems a little bit amateurish - no offense). Send an email to that swiss paper about a screen on behalf of wikipedia - it might get fixed, and we can have the screen on Commons. Basically, the newspaper article is a short review of the webcomic, describing what it is about, mentioning the creator and so on. Together with the fact that the comic is going into print, and that it has throned the webcomic rankings, I believe that it is notable enough to have it's own article here. But as I mentioned earlier - the article has to be freshened up. <a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrainman_16b7.html" title="User:Brainman">Brainman</a> 18:53, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- Excellent work, Brainman! With this translation, we can see that this source probably does qualify under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. As a result, I would change my&#160;!vote to <b>Weak delete</b> - we really only have one source, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> requires several, but the addition of only one, or two, other non-trivial sources could bring this article up to standards.

<dd>I don't see any reason at all under WP:NOTE for it to matter whether it were in print or not, yet clearly we all agree that if it were in print, it would affect it's notability. This is an example of using common sense when it comes to use of those guidlines. The artist was approached by the publisher who asked him whether he wanted it to be printed, so clearly both the publisher and artist want this webcomic to be printed. If there is a promise that this webcomic will be put in print in the near future, then why should we disregard this? especially seeing as being in print doesn't meet the WP:NOTE standards anyway.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 01:15, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>"The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators." I interpret that to mean distributed by an independant source, such as it being published as a weekly comic in a newspaper. Being put to print as a book of comics is not independant of the author, however if it were publised weekly in a well-known newspaper, then it would be published through a "well known and independant source". I understand that being put to print would be a rule of thumb, but being put to print itself, unless I am mistaken, does not meet the WP:NOTE guidlines.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 07:27, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm afraid that interpretation makes no coherent sense. The creator of a work, like a webcomic, will invariably be involved with the publication of his works to the degree you have outlined - it is illegal, in most jurisdictions, <i>not</i> to be, since he retains copyright on it. What the guidelines are actually stating is that the <i>medium of distribution</i> is independent of the creator of the content - for instance, a previously established publisher, or magazine. It is designed to exclude self-publication - that is, when a creator also publishes or distributes his work - being printed by a publisher who is independent of the author, and not a self-publication house, counts. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 00:08, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are most likely right, but still I am not convinced that your interpretation is correct. I could draw up some artwork, run off to a publisher, offer them money, and have my work published. It is not independant because they are just taking money from the artist, and turning it into printed images. However a newspaper will have certain standards. A newspaper is independant of the artist, but a publisher is not. Maybe my interpretation is incorrect, but that section from WP:WEB you have quoted is fairly vague. What does it mean by medium? A medium as in print, radio, or television, or a medium as in a specific newspaper, specific radio station, or specific tv channel. (I don't think I am explaining my self very well.) How would you define one medium 'well known'? "Print is a well-known medium, but radio is not." Or is it more like "NBC is a well known medium through which it could be published, however Fox is not." My interpretation is that by 'medium', it means, in this case, a specific form of print. A well known, specific kind of print would be the New York Times, however spending your own money to put your own material to print would not be because the medium is not well known. Sorry if this is a bit confusing.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Anyway this artical is going into print fairly soon. If the closing admin did decide to delete this, someone would probably remake it as soon as it went to print, and then it would go through this whole AFD process again, and then still could be deleted. Ask yourself "If it were in print right now, would I still be voting delete?" If you answered no, then I think you should rethink your stance on whether or not this artical should be deleted. This webcomic is going to print. The chances of one of the two suddenly backing out of the deal is very unlikely, so I treat this webcomic as though it is already in print.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 01:42, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the thing is, a publisher has to approve you for publication; I mentioned that pay-for-print houses are not considered independent of the creator - as the medium is produced at the behest of the creator. However, agreements wherein the publisher and the creator split the payment <i>do</i> qualify, since the medium is independent of the creator. The section is intentionally vague - it is meant to be broadly applicable to all kinds of media, without restriction. However, there are generally specific sections for certain media - radio can be notable, but being aired, say, once a week in small-town Texas radio is probably not. The same is true for other media. Nonetheless, we are still discussing a future event, and notability does not inherit from the future. When it's published, it will probably be notable, as per the guidelines - when, not a "promise" or "very sure thing". --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 01:52, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ok I accept that. Though I stand by my argument for the inclusion of this artical in Wikipedia. We have short articals at www.nma-fallout.com that have been verified, and images from the comic are in print right now: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/print/378534/" class="external free" title="http://www.deviantart.com/print/378534/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deviantart.com/print/378534/</a></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I have mentioned other reasons for it's inclusion above. Even if these other arguments do not meet WP:NOTE, seeing as there are so many references to the webcomic, these references should be collectively taken into account in the final decision making process.<a href="../../../d/a/r/User%7EDarkcraft_ce89.html" title="User:Darkcraft">Darkcraft</a> 11:45, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Again, the articles on NMA are too short to constitute non-trivial publications. The fact that there are lots of them does not make them notable as a group - a bunch of things which individually do not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> as a group. This, really, seems to be the heart of your argument - that, though you admit that each source does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, you argue that a group of them does. This is contradictory to what is outlined under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>, and I cannot support inclusion of an article on this basis. Furthermore, Deviant is <i>specifically</i> designed not be independant of the creator - it is like saying that because I got my art printed by CafePress, it has been "published". That is contradictory to standards. I too stand by my argument that this article does not meet standards under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and thus should not be included in the encyclopedia. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> (<a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaemo_527d.html" title="User talk:Haemo">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Haemo_5540.html" title="Special:Contributions/Haemo">contribs</a>) 00:39, 10 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Since is this going to be deleted anyway, let me tell you something: You people really do a good job at appearing on the payroll of big corporates. This is my real name, the company is real, we're not spamming, we're hardworking people just placing a NPOV page on wikipedia the same way you have 15 or 20 links to similar services. It's doing wikipedia a favor by adding content. Spam is the crap you get in your inbox title 'Viagra Free Free Free'. That's not us, capice? I take real offense being called a spammer. Talking about spam, what did those other services do to deserve being on Wikipedia? I'll probably never know - but I wasn't born yesterday, so next time, just give me the PO box to send the bribe to.

<p>An article on an advertising slogan, a deliberate coiining of a neologism, sourced from Encyclopaedia Dramatica (yes you read that right), a Google search and Urban Dictionary. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:40, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> changing my opinion in the light of Canley's additional references. The Australian National Dictionary project one is a little thin, as it simply uses it as an example, but it does confer some notability. The reference from The Age is also a little sketchy as the article is about the show not the term, but it does note the term specifically and point to its popularity and importance. Add these to the use in the Thorpe's TV ads and there's enough of a case for me. More would be better though. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 03:27, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak delete</b> - for the record, this phrase is not a neologism, and it is very well known in Australia. It's been used in reputable news sources like <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/shortstories/stories/s1390775.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/shortstories/stories/s1390775.htm" rel="nofollow">ABC</a>, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,20921074-5005364,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/story/0,21598,20921074-5005364,00.html" rel="nofollow">news.com.au</a>, and <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/21/1100972261052.html" class="external text" title="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/11/21/1100972261052.html" rel="nofollow">SMH</a>. Also, it existed long before Thorpe's ad - that ED article is a pile of crap. The only reason I'm voting delete is because I don't think you'll find enough academic sources out there to write a full article this phrase. Still, a one-line definition should be added wherever we define Australianisms around here. If we do ever find some sources which outline the phrase in more depth, I'd have no objection to recreating an article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 07:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> But "fully sick" isn't just an example. It has its own meaning, just like "top notch" means more than "top" plus "notch". That's why it needs to be properly defined somewhere on Wikipedia. There's a bit of history behind the phrase as well - as I said above, if we find some more sources about that aspect, I'd be perfectly happy to see this article kept as an independent. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 02:41, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, sorry, got my AfDs muddled up. Replace "Church" with "experience", the point still stands. Having an editor try out the whole thing still leaves us with an editor's personal experience. Information on Wikipedia needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> which means that a reader can go look up what is claimed in a reputable, independent source to confirm it. So for example, if the New York Times writes an article about Lord of the Zeppelin you can include it. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 23:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable local chapter of a national fraternity. This would be roughly the equivalent of an article on a lodge of <a href="../../../b/e/n/Benevolent_and_Protective_Order_of_Elks_7713.html" title="Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks">Elks</a> or a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chamber_of_commerce.html" title="Chamber of commerce">Chamber of commerce</a>. It is well sourced, but every source is from the local chapter, national organization, and one minor one from the college. There are no independent, reliable sources offered to establish notability of this organization. A redirect to the national organization's article was tried several weeks ago but quickly reverted. <a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetros232_d0ba.html" title="User:Metros232">Metros232</a> 14:28, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> well what is the notability of it? It won a bunch of awards on the campus and within the frat, that's about it, right?

<li>I find the timing of this quite offensive, not only because the image was properly uploaded, but this particular attempt to delete this article comes on the heels of an attempted deletion of this article <i>without feedback</i>, fended off not two weeks ago.

<li>I could write a tremendous, feature article quality article on myself using sources and making it totally verifiable. Would that article stay? No, because I'm not notable.

<p>Response From Sizzerb Management:</p>
<p>I'm afraid that is false. Look up "Crood Sizzerb" on Google:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood+Sizzerb&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>If you look up Crood, the first 3 sites that come up are directly related to the artist:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Crood&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>If you look up Sizzerb he comes up and is also included on the Sizzerb/Sizzerb International websites:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=" class="external free" title="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Sizzerb&amp;meta=</a></p>
<p>Crood is also a respected artist in the Serbian hip-hop community and the Sizzerb mixtape series has sold over 30 thousand units worldwide. Look up Sizzerb Vol. 1 for example and multiple sites including ebay will show up, which carry the product. Crood is featured on all the tapes, this is obsurd. He is also referenced in <a href="../../../s/i/n/Sin_%28rapper%29.html" title="Sin (rapper)">Sin's</a> Wikipedia biography. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 74.110.167.195 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_74.110.167.195_77a9.html" title="Special:Contributions/74.110.167.195">contribs</a>).</small> (see also Sizzerbiatch (<a href="../../../s/i/z/User_talk%7ESizzerbiatch_3f0c.html" title="User talk:Sizzerbiatch">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sizzerbiatch_41e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sizzerbiatch">contribs</a>))</p>
<p>And the 3 sites are: MySpace, record label, and "coming soon".

<p>This is rediculous... Anybody in the music industry knows anyone can get their music on Amazon with about $50 and you use that as guideline to see if pages are authentic? It seems like you have more knowledge of spamming then you do of the music information your trying to delete off here!</p>
<p>How about these sites, they all sell Sizzerb mixtapes, and Crood is featured on everyone of them (see track listing):</p>

<p>Sizzerb Vol. 1 featured on MTV Mixtape Mondays:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/" class="external free" title="http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/mixtape_monday/080105/</a></p>
<p>You really need to check into the information your providing, how could Sizzerb tapes be sold on all these different sites and featured on MTV if they weren't factual? Crood (rapper) is on every one, just read the track listing.</p>
<p>Here are some other reviews i found with Crood mentioned in them.</p>

<p>"The production by Crood, where he samples choirs and Indian classical music, only adds depth to the search for inner peace, a slight spiritual touch dropped in one's personal plea to get out of hell. "</p>

<p>"The melodic and haunting vibes of “Burn” ends up as the albums finest cut, thanks to a spectacular production effort by Crood."</p>

<p>Milk Crate consists of DJ Flatline/KendeR/Red Eye Jedi/Crood/Keith Burst and are an up and coming crew from Toronto. They specialise in creating some of the freshest underground hip-hop music and their music features a collection of remixes created to illustrate the skill, talent and dedication to true hip hop in all of its forms.</p>
<p>I can keep going, but the fact is you need to provide proof, not speculation that this is not factual. What your basically saying is, this may be spam so lets delete it. Where as, i am giving you concrete examples to prove this is NOT spam, it is impossible to make this stuff up or duplicate a talent such as Crood's.</p>

<p>Since when does an artists visibility on the internet reflect their legitimate contributions to MUSIC??? I could name you 10 artists from Yugoslavia (where Crood is from) who are superstars there, but barely visibly online. What your saying doesn't make sense. I've listed respectible publications covering Sizzerb AND Crood with direct quotes about Crood, his music and tracklistings with CROOD songs on them on websites which sell CD's ie. Mixunit (top mixtape site in the world) or rapreviews.com - top hip-hop review site online www.hiphopcanada.com www.allhiphop.com and other respectable urban websites. Just because your nerd search engine isn't picking it up is irrelevant when i am showing you DIRECT LINKS of pages which feature Crood, on known websites/publications!</p>
<p>If Crood had enough power to forge himself into all those websites i listed, his online presence would be as big as his music which is not the case yet. This is discrimination against a new/foreign artist the way i see it... You can't base someone accomplishments off 1 search engine when i am giving you DIRECT LINKS of respectable publications/sellers.</p>
<p>Not to mention that every mixtape Sizzerb has done (all of which Crood is on) are hosted by a-list level hip-hop DJ's. Look up any of them from DJ Vlad to Big Mike to Nu Jerzy Devil to Team Invasion. This is undesputable success especially from a artist based in Canada/from a foreign country. I have faith Wikipedia will review the information i gave them accordingly.</p>
<p>For direct reference to Crood on here, also see Sin (rapper)</p>

<p>I agree with that but all the info was used with the artists permission and we can provide any documentation necessary to prove that. The biography was taken with permission from the artists website. There is no conflict of interest we are just making sure the artist is being represented properly becuase a third party could do the same thing and change the story/manipulate details, especially our enemies/competitors. We are not speculating but stating facts, and documenting a growing artist/movement early on. If there is anything you feel needs to be changed please state it specifically, i believe all the links i've provided is more then specific proof of Crood's role in hip-hop and Sizzerb, he is also documented in Sin's biography on here. I can also provide links to stores that sell all the mixtapes in the discography with the acception of Sizzerb INternational Vol. 1 which was a free download. Any other information you need including medical/police reports which prove what was said in the biography is true are available to you upon request. We'd be happy to accomondate anything to fit your standards, and understand the information on this page is definitelly something which will be used as a long-term reference to the artist. There is no denying everything stated is factual and relevant to Crood's role in hip-hop and who he is as an artist.</p>

<p>I have no problem providing reviews or interviews, in fact i already noted some. I wasn't claiming the person was famous, just outlining achievement. If you need direct links to works/reviews/interviews be specific and i can provide what you ask for. But is that supposed to be included in the article? I stayed away from putting too many links in the actual article because i figure u don't want linking done unless manditory. I'm willing to do whats neccessary to fix the issue. I tried to make it more like it would look if you read about an artist in a physical book encyclopedia, they usually don't provide such links (to websites/articles etc.) if you prefer a different better referenced format i can do that but this way its focusing on the individual more then the coverage which i think is key for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I added many more references in the article. I hope that helps. Let me know.</p>
<p>Here is a article i scanned from Huper Magazine (Serbia). It reviews a compilation Crood executive produced and is featured on. If you look under "preporuka" where they list reccomended songs after the review, you will see a song featuring Crood as well.</p>

<p>I'm going out of my way here guys. I already listed 3 reviews and 10 stores/coverage sites in and above source. This is scanned directly out of the magazine.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect this is a hoax, made up in school one day by two best friends. A Google search for "Earthshatter" brings up only references to <i><a href="../../../w/o/r/World_of_Warcraft_d385.html" title="World of Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a></i>, not any Marvel Comics character. The individual named as the article subject "Tyler Froberg" is the same name as the creator of this supposed character. Neither name shows up in a search related to Marvel Comics. The article then suddenly changes its subject to <a href="../../../b/o/o/Bootleg_%28comics%29.html" title="Bootleg (comics)">Bootleg (comics)</a>, a real comic character... and "Earthshatter" is not mentioned in the article at all. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanley_017b.html" title="User:Canley">Canley</a> 14:33, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I personally don't want chapter lists on Wikipedia considering anyone can easily go to the national website wherein the reader will find a more comprehensive and updated chapter list. I've argued for this in the past. Having long chapter lists are redundant, <i>however</i> I vote keep on the basis that this issue has been dealt with on several individual fraternity articles and the consensus was to make a seperate chapter list. --<font color="#0000CC"><a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDysepsion_8adb.html" title="User:Dysepsion">† Ðy§ep§ion †</a> <sup><a href="../../../d/y/s/User_talk%7EDysepsion_77d7.html" title="User talk:Dysepsion"><i>Speak your mind</i></a></sup></font> 18:46, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I pretty much have to say "Ditto" to Dysepsion's comment above. I personally think that the chapter rolls are out of place on Wikipedia entirely- especially so for larger organizations such as this one.

However, once you allow these lists you can't really object to the external links that go along with the individual constituents of the lists because they directly relate and illuminate that content- in fact they can almost be considered citations in a way in that they attest to the existence of that chapter. --<a href="../../../e/l/i/User%7EElipongo_843a.html" title="User:Elipongo">Elipongo</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../e/l/i/User_talk%7EElipongo_d80a.html" title="User talk:Elipongo">Talk</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Elipongo_25d6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Elipongo">contribs</a>)</sup> 08:38, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak keep from the creator</b> I was hesitant to make the list when I did, but it was out of a bit of a necessity. Being the largest fraternity by chapters in the world, the list was gunking up the main article. I'd get rid of it entirely, but since it's such a large fraternity it is invariable that EL and chapter lists were tinkered with almost daily by anon editors. Keep out the external links, and keep the list for brevity's sake. <a href="../../../t/e/k/User%7ETeke_11ee.html" title="User:Teke"><font color="maroon">Teke</font></a> <sup><small>(<a href="../../../t/e/k/User_talk%7ETeke_b34c.html" title="User talk:Teke"><font color="gray">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 00:41, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. MIT's fraternities and sororities account for 40% of the undergraduate population, and form a significant portion of student life there. At MIT, they're not just fraternities and sororities in the traditional sense. For example, the Sigma Chi chapter was founded in 1886 (25 years after the university was founded, before it was even called "MIT" or located on its current campus), and many of the other houses have traditions lasting 100+ years. The first dorm on the campus, Senior House, was founded around 1930, forty years later! Many of the houses are also significant historical pieces in Boston, between Chi Phi's John F. Andrew mansion (house of the son of the Governor of Massachusetts during the Civil War), and Phi Delts, who live in the old Massachusetts Lt. Governor's house. I think the volume of notable alumni from the FSILG system alone justifies this article. The article needs work, agreed, but deleting it would not benefit the Wikipedia community. <a href="../../../f/i/r/User%7EFiredancer414_bffd.html" title="User:Firedancer414">Firedancer414</a> 17:37, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>""Do Not Delete"" It is my understanding that Wikipedia is a centralized location for information rather than some sort of popularity contest. There naturally will be a relatively small number of web references to a band whose lifespan predated the widespread availability of the Internet and whose material has been unavailable for some time. Independent music in the time period was covered by independent print media (fanzines, etc.) that has largely not been archived on the Internet. To base the significance of a band solely on its contemporary web presence is a form of information Darwinism that will skew future discourse toward only the most commercially successful artists.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contrary to assertions in previous posts, there are multiple non-trivial articles, reviews and other references about the band readily found on the Internet (Googling "27+various+ackerson" will yield more focused hits, since "27" and "various" alone are extremely common words):</p>

<li>""Do Not Delete""It is unfortunate that the lack of information online would cause deletion of an entry on a band who released 5 records on notable labels. Twin/Tone, for one, released records by Soul Asylum, The Replacements, Robyn Hitchcock and many others that are far above the mentioned "local" label. Additionally, band founder Ed Ackerson has gone on to release records on Interscope (last I checked not a local label) and is a notable producer who has worked on records by The Jayhawks among many others. The Trouser Press entry mentioned above should alone validate this entry. --Jackpine1000</li>

<li>""Do Not Delete"" (Disclaimer: I ran sound for this group and, as mentioned in the article, played bass for them briefly.) The *tone* of the article reads more like a promotional bio/history than a Wiki article; it could be edited to remove sentences such as "The band's Midwest audience had solidified, and the years of touring seemed to be finally paying off." This group meets item #s 4 and 5 in the "Criteria for musicians and ensembles" in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and so I contend that the band article should stand. --Omnidrew 07:11, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Small stars" is limited by observational technology and accidents of selection, not the stars themselves. The list should have been named "stars with smallest measured diameter" in the first place, and even then it's not notable enough to be worth a list. <a href="../../../b/s/v/User%7EBSVulturis_2e19.html" title="User:BSVulturis">BSVulturis</a> 20:35, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - Aside from the "stars' diameters are not frequently measured" argument, I see another problem. The transition from "small star" to "large gaseous planet" may be gradual. Determining what is a "star" or a "planet" or whether brown dwarfs are "stars" could lead into a semantics argument that is not worth having, and this list may force the issue. Therefore, I vote to delete it. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr._Submillimeter_7547.html" title="User:Dr. Submillimeter">Dr. Submillimeter</a> 10:17, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>She is not notable enough to warrant her own article, considering the current <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farahnaz_Pahlavi_96fd.html" title="Farahnaz Pahlavi">Farahnaz Pahlavi</a> article. True, she is the eldest daughter of <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_06b7.html" title="Mohammad Reza Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a>, but this is already present in his article, see <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_06b7.html#Wives_and_children" title="Mohammad Reza Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi#Wives_and_children</a>. The rest of her article lacks references and does not describe anything notable about her, just that she has attended college and has a job.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have no problem with this article remaining on the site. Farahnaz Pahlavi was a member of a royal family recently deposed in the span of history, I vote that it should stay.

<dd>Thanks for adding a source for some of the items about her, but the fact that they are from her own homepage doesn't help. Non-notable people can have homepages; I believe the non-notability still applies. She is important only in that she is the eldest daughter of the Shah, but this already covered in the Shah's article. She hasn't had much involvement in major events. Many people were somehow involved in the Iranian revolution(I assume that is the "tumultuous moment"), but they do not all have pages. If she had some significant role in the actual events of the revolution, mention and source this into her article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 17:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is a <i>proposed</i> guideline. Why should it be accepted here? Let us go by official notability policy regarding people. I will soon elaborate, point by point, why she does not fit the criteria adequately(too tired now).

<dd>Actually, Wiki's proposed guidelines seem to be the norm, ie following them (see most, if not all monarchs and former monarchs, and you will see that their children, however minor their lives, are given their own pages, per Wiki's proposed guidelines, which would seem to establish a certain precedent in these matters). Any deviations from the proposed guidelines seem to be decided by consensus. Curiously, your focus is solely on deleting Farahnaz rather than proposing to delete articles about all of the Shah's children and those of other royals; is there a reason for that particular focus on that particular individual? At the moment the score seems to be 1 for deletion, 2 for inclusion.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 15:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I think that the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farahnaz_Pahlavi_96fd.html" title="Farahnaz Pahlavi">Farahnaz Pahlavi</a> and <a href="../../../a/l/i/Ali_Reza_Pahlavi_II_a737.html" title="Ali Reza Pahlavi II">Ali Reza Pahlavi II</a> articles should be deleted simply because those two haven't done anything notable. Their two siblings ought to have articles because they have gained significant media coverage. Their position in the royal family is already noted in the <a href="../../../m/o/h/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi_06b7.html" title="Mohammad Reza Pahlavi">Mohammad Reza Pahlavi</a> article, and the rest of the information regards unimportant personal facts. In the case of Farahnaz, the article is acting as an extension of her homepage. I find her to be trivial based upon <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Consider the central criteria from the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page...</p>
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
   * This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, magazine articles, books, scholarly papers, and television documentaries2 except for the following:
         o Media reprints of the person's autobiography or self-promotional works.3
         o Works carrying merely trivial coverage, such as newspaper articles that just mention the person in passing, telephone directory listings, or simple records of births and deaths.
</pre>
<p>Consider Farahnaz's article. The source for the information is not even a media reprint; it is her own homepage. She is not the primary subject of multiple non-trivial works simply because she hasn't done very much to gain real media attention.</p>
<p>Now, note the other criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Farahnaz does not appear to have made an enduring to her field, which is social work and child psychology.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Political figures holding or who have held international, national or statewide/provincewide office, and members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislature.6 (For candidates for office, see the ongoing discussion at Wikipedia:Candidates and elections.)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>She approaches qualification for this one, due to the political aspect, but it specifically refers to actual offices, not simply titles. She also is not a former legislator.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Major local political figures who receive (or received) significant press coverage.5 Just being an elected local official does not guarantee notability.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>She has not received significant press coverage, as mentioned earlier, though the "local official" qualification does not fit her anyway.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - Hollywood Walk of Fame).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Not a widely recognized entertainment personality or opinion maker. Unlike her older brother, <a href="../../../r/e/z/Reza_Cyrus_Pahlavi_ecee.html" title="Reza Cyrus Pahlavi">Reza Cyrus Pahlavi</a>, she hasn't been a significant voice regarding Iranian affairs.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles. Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Obviously, she has no sports recognition.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions. ...</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>She is clearly not an actress or television personality.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>While some of her relatives have made significant works, bringing them to notability, Farahnaz hasn't done the same.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, not a major player in her field. Not to say that she doesn't have any accomplishments in child psychology, but she doesn't appear to have done anything particularly enduring.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events, such as by being assassinated.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, no newsworthy event involvement.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>

<p>Considering the her complete non-notability under the general, well-accepted notability guidelines, I hardly see why a <i>proposed</i> subcategory for Royalty should take precedence over the accepted guideline.

<dd>Uh, it's not her own homepage; it's her mother's (please note the primary web address: farahpahlavi.org, with the sub page being about her daughter, ie it's her mother's official website). In any case, per Wiki precedent, children of rulers can be given their own pages. Are you also lobbying for all children of all royals, especially those who have done "nothing" in your estimation, to have their articles deleted? If so, that is something to be taken up on a wider level in Wiki. In any case, the tally thus far for Farahnaz is three votes for KEEP and one vote (yours) for DELETE.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 22:09, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree, I was wrong about it being her own homepage, though I do not see what difference that makes to her notability. A mother writing about her daughter on her homepage doesn't make the daughter any more significant. You correcting me is nice, but has no real bearing on my argument that Farahnaz is not significant enough for a Wikipedia article. Was that all you could think of in response to my post? Right now, I am only addressing the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farahnaz_Pahlavi_96fd.html" title="Farahnaz Pahlavi">Farahnaz Pahlavi</a> article, based upon the application of the criteria above. How about you respond to the points I made with the above criteria instead of presenting pointless questions about my "wider" aims?

I thought it would be nice if you were able to provide extensive reasoning behind your position, but judging based upon your responses, you are not able to. This is unfortunate, because I would really like to know how exactly you have judged her by the criteria of the official Wikipedia policy and still deemed her notable. It seems you have used a <i>proposed</i> guideline, but I then wonder how you can place the <i>proposed</i> guideline above official Wikipedia policy in your reasoning. If your responses were more persuasive and less evasive, I might even vote against myself. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 23:23, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Behnam, the proposed guideline comes from Wiki and is extensively used as the basis for the Farahnaz's article inclusion, as well as other royal family members of various royal families. It is, therefore, precedent, what the present Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the US has called <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stare_decisis.html" title="Stare decisis">stare decisis</a>, ie "the doctrine of precedent". If you wish to try to upend this precedent, please feel free to entice supporters, et cetera, and let's see where this goes. Wiki is a community and therefore many precedents/guidelines/rules were developed through consensus and clear voting. At the present time, the votes are 3-1 against your desire to delete. That's called the democracy, I think, and if you continue to be outnumbered, you will have to claim defeat and shake hands and move on to other, more important matters. I've already placed my vote, and my reasons for doing so are precedent per Wiki's own stated guidelines. I do not believe that I need any stronger reason than that and therefore, with all due respect, rest my case.<a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 23:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The fact that is a <i>proposed</i> guideline and specifically not meant to be treated as official policy, because it is not entirely agreed upon by "consensus and clear voting" is why I do not think you should use it as a precedent here, when there is the more general and actually official policy regarding notability. I have raised objections based upon this actual official policy, rather than a mere proposal. Of course, you can respond to what I have stated if you like, but you seem committed to giving up on arguing your case. If you ever feel like presenting more of a case, I welcome you to do so.

This point is, "The debate is not a vote; please make recommendations on the course of action to be taken, sustained by arguments." So Mowens35, I think it is best that you continue to make your case, as this is debate is to be sustained by arguments, so you should respond to new arguments I present.

<dd>Perhaps the use of the word "vote" was incorrect; however, we discussing whether to keep or delete an entry, so the word works, at least loosely. My vote is already for KEEP (Mowens35 here, having difficulty signing in). I have already discussed, thoroughly, why I feel the article should remain, as per Wiki proposals for members of royal houses. I went back to WP: Royal to see what the proposed guidelines state, per previous discussions, and discovered this passage, which is that on which I base my KEEP response: "This includes former monarchies - if the person was born while the monarchy was still in existence, they are notable on that basis. Any children of a deposed monarch, even if born after the deposition, are automatically notable (thus, for instance, the younger children of the former King of the Hellenes, or all the children of the former Kings of Romania and Bulgaria)." I am adhering to this proposed guideline, which has been developed through previous discussions of other other editors, and feel that I cannot emphasis my reasons for keeping Farahnaz, et al, any more clearly. It is now time for others to weigh in. It is pointless for me to continually respond to Behnam, when my answer(s) remain the same: my KEEP opinion is based on Wiki precedence, as per the quoted passage.67.142.130.20 14:08, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It seems you still fail understand the distinction between a <i>proposed</i> guideline and official policy or even an official guideline. An official policy is an accepted set of rules for editing Wikipedia. An official guideline is like official policy except that situational exceptions should be considered in application of the dictates of the guideline. A <i>proposed</i> guideline is a guideline that some have simply <i>proposed</i>; it has not been accepted by the Wikipedia community as an official guideline, and should not be treated as an official guideline.</dd>

This is not in adherence to Wikipedia policy.

<dd>I am baffled at Behnam's misinterpretation of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It states in the second paragraph, "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious). However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)." It says it is not Wikipedia policy. Interestingly enough, Behnam states that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> "is official policy". Unless Behnam feels he can speak for the entire Wikipedian community, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should not be referred as official policy. I would also like to submit to Behnam's consideration the fourth paragraph of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, it states "This is not intended to be an exclusionary list; just because someone doesn't fall into one of these categories doesn't mean an article on the person should automatically be deleted." I appreciate Behnams bullet point explanation as to how Farahnaz Pahlavi does to meet the list in central criterion for inclusion in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, but he must know that in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> it states a person does not have to meet any of those categories to be included in Wikipedia. I certainly agree with Behnam that this page is for debate and is not a page for just votes. Thus, I will use my energies in convincing Behnam as to why this article should be included. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</dd>

<dd>Good catch! You are right about my misinterpretation, regarding it being policy. However, the distinction between "guideline" and "proposed guideline" still stands, and people have judged the Farahnaz article based upon the a <i>proposed</i> guideline instead of the more accepted guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The fact that she did not fall into the categories is why she was not automatically deleted. Hence, this discussion. I am wondering whether or not you want to convince me that she meets the criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, or you plan to convince me through some alternative argument.

<dd>Thank you for your speedy comment. I appreciate your devotion to improving Wikipedia. Furthermore, by insisting upon deleting this article you have motivated others to improve it. This is a very commendable act. I hope you too will try on improving this article. I must say most of your argument for deleting this article is based on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Although, you have made a new point in your last comment about using <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> above a proposed guideline. I am afraid this is irrelevant to my last comment since I did not cite <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a>. Since the notion of notability is not definite (<a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> stated "This guideline is not Wikipedia policy (and indeed the whole concept of notability is contentious)"), alternative test can be used to explain a certain person's notability. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has a section called "Alternative tests" and in this section it explains the Speed Engine Test, "Search Engine Test -- Does a search for the subject produce a large number of distinguishable hits on Google ([1]), Alexa ([2]), Yahoo! ([3]) or other well-known Internet search engine?". Although this test may seem trivial, it is part of a Wikipedia guideline. I ask you to run this test and see for yourself that in fact there are "a large number" of hits on search engines. I received 1,400 hits on Google for the query "Farahnaz Pahlavi". To end your wondering " I am wondering whether or not you want to convince me that she meets the criteria on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, or you plan to convince me through some alternative argument.", I used the alternative test called "Search Engine Test" on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. This is another testament, which uses a guideline and not a proposed guideline, to Farahnaz Pahlavi's notability. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:15, 7 January 2007 (UTC) Agha Nader</dd>

<dd>The search test is considered a proposal on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page, not an actual criterion of the guideline. See the first sentence at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html#Alternative_tests" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO#Alternative_tests</a>. You are mistaken in considering the search test as not a proposal, as you did in concluding your last comment.</dd>
<dd>Anyway, I have searched Google for "Farahnaz Pahlavi" earlier, not as a simple hit test but in a quest to find significant sources for her article. Many of the results were from Wikipedia mirrors, or simple reproductions of her basic biography from her mom's homepage (royalty databases). Last night I selected a few that had more unique mention of her, but she wasn't the primary subject. I cannot find online, independent media stories about Farahnaz Pahlavi. Some references have been added to her article, which is good, though I fear she is not the primary subject of all references, or that the other references may be trivial, but I plan to go through them upon gaining access to print materials. The main problem, therefore, is that she isn't receiving significant media coverage, at least not on the internet.</dd>
<dd>Since by citing the search test, a proposal, instead of addressing my points made using the criteria of the accepted guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, I fear that same problem exists as does for <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> versus <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. How can a proposal be held over the accepted guideline? I really think the best approach, for you, would be to try showing her significance according to the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, since it is accepted guideline. I do not know those arguing to KEEP the article have not tried to show her notability by going through the criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> as I did to explain why she is not notable. I think that to do so would lead to a much more constructive discussion. Thanks Agha Nader, for carrying on with the case, rather than giving it up like Mowens35 did, as I think we both understand that discussion is important on this matter.

<p>I am again grateful for your speedy comment. You are truly an exemplary Wikipedian; you do not seem to have any motives rather than improving Wikipedia. You state, "Thanks Agha Nader, for carrying on with the case, rather than giving it up like Mowens35 did, as I think we both understand that discussion is important on this matter". I am grateful for your accolade. I wonder if your accolade is addressed to me or Mowens35. I consider it addressed to me since you posted your comment as a reply to mine. I cannot and will not speak for Mowens35, since I do not know him or his motives. But, Mowens35 seems to have only improved Farahnaz Pahlavi's article. I must disagree with you when you say he has given up. Although he has not replied to your arguments for a while, he has added more information to the article. These added informations have references also. Mowens35 also stated, "I've already placed my vote, and my reasons for doing so are precedent per Wiki's own stated guidelines. I do not believe that I need any stronger reason than that and therefore, with all due respect, rest my case." As you can see, he has provided a reason as too why he is no longer replying to your comments: he has already stated his reason for why the article should remain. You argue that many of the returns for the proposed Alternative Search Test from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should be disregarded, "Many of the results were from Wikipedia mirrors, or simple reproductions of her basic biography from her mom's homepage (royalty databases)." Although the website of the last Queen of Iran my seem bias to you, it is a verifiable source. There is no provision against sources that are published by a family member. As you already know, "self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources." <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html#SELF" title="WP:V">WP:V#SELF</a>. Except this is not a self-published source (Farahnaz Pahlavi did not publish it, Farah Pahlavi did). They are not the same person. Furthermore, Farah Pahlavi is a third-party. i.e. she is not Farahnaz Pahlavi. Please refer to the guideline on notability, it states "What constitutes a 'published work' is deliberately broad" <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. You may believe Farah Pahlavi's website is not a published source, but you cannot prove this. If you can prove that this source should not count, please provide an argument. As it follows, you say many of the returns are mirrors of her site. There will always be mirrors in a search, so this is not exclusive to Farahnaz's Pahlavi. And thus you should not disregard the Search Test. You still seem to misinterpret <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. It is only a guideline: it is not official policy. You ask, "How can a proposal be held over the accepted guideline?". There is a crucial flaw in this question: <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not accepted by all. It even states in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, almost as a disclaimer, "However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)." So you can see <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is just the opinion of many Wikipedian, but not all. It does not even state that it is the opinion of most Wikipedian's. This is the case for the Alternative Search Test. It is the opinion of many Wikipedian's that it should be used as an alternative test. It is not the opinion of all Wikipedians, and it may not be the opinion of most. I do not think we can weigh the importance of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or the Alternative Search Test. We must look at each article on a case by case basis. I believe the Alternative Search Test is a testament to Farahnaz Pahlavi's notability. There is another point to be made. Ask yourself, will there be students who wish to do research on the Pahlavi Dynasty? Will they want to know about Farahnaz Pahlavi? Will they want to know about the fate of the Pahlavis? This article is very helpful to such students. And it can be more helpful if we improve it. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 21:11, 7 January 2007 (UTC) Agha Nader.</p>

<li>The response was to you, and the accolade was for you, Nader.</li>
<li>I said Mowens35 gave up on arguing <i>the case</i>, not on the article.</li>
<li>I objected to his reason for giving up because he treats <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> as one of "Wiki's own stated guidelines", which I consider incorrect because it is only a <i>proposed</i> guideline, while his description assigns much more authority to the proposal than is true for Wikipedia. Please read <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a>, as it provides a sort of 'disclaimer' against treating it as a full guideline.</li>
<li>I simply noted that numerous results were either Wikipedia mirrors or reproductions of information from a personal webpage. The search test itself seems hit-based.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think we both should carefully read <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a>.</li>
<li>The page states that <b>guidelines</b> are "authorized by consensus"".</li>
<li>The page also states that a <b>proposal</b> are "any suggested guideline, policy or process for which the status of consensus is not yet clear, as long as discussion is ongoing".</li>
<li>You are wrong in believing that we cannot "weigh the importance" of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> versus Search Test, as the differences page shows that guidelines are more valuable than proposals in assessing qualification, as <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is a guideline while Search Test is a proposed method.</li>
<li>Also, read the page about the Search Test, and you will see that it is hardly a well-defined qualification. It admits that the test is very open to interpretation. So, you think that he results are notable, but I do not think so. Is your opinion better than mine?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I have already noted that it is Farah's site, not Farahnaz's.</li>
<li>Even putting aside the bias possibility you brought up, it still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, since it is a personal website.</li>
<li>Quote, "<b>Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources.</b> That is, they should not be used as sources of information about a person or topic other than the owner of the website, or author of the book.". This is from the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> guideline.</li>
<li>But it is good that you have brought up bias; does Farah Pahlavi's official website have a bias under <a href="../../../n/e/u/WP%7ENeutral_point_of_view_15f3.html#Bias" title="WP:Neutral point of view">WP:Neutral_point_of_view#Bias</a>? If I had to suggest one, I would suggest a possible political bias. After reading the site a bit, I would describe it as a promotion of the former Empress of Iran, and perhaps as promotion of monarchy in that country. Do you think there is a bias? I wonder, since you brought it up.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Aside from whether or not the homepage is even a good source, the issue of notability remains, and considering the page about the differences between proposals, guidelines, etc., <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> should not be ignored.</li>
<li>With this in mind, I ask that you please assess Farahnaz Pahlavi based upon the criteria of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guideline.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As far as students go, I do think some will be interested in the Pahlavi dynasty. I don't know about these particular students' institutions, but I know that my university, Wikipedia shouldn't be referenced in research about a topic not related to Wikipedia.</li>
<li>I definitely support improvement, but Wikipedia is not supposed to be a directory, any more than it should be an extension of Farah Pahlavi's homepage.</li>
<li>If I decide that there is good reason for Farahnaz to be considered notable, I definitely will drop my case here. The additional references seem to mostly mention her in passing, but that can be discussed on the article's talk page.</li>

<p><br />
Thank you for your neat bullet point argument. I have considered replying to you in the bullet format, but I believe in the convention and style of English in the essay format. Unfortunately, you did not respond to all of my arguments. Will a bullet point format help you respond to all of my arguments? Do you use a bullet point format because I don't respond to all of your arguments? I certainly hope not. Let me first begin by addressing the points you make. Thank you for the link <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a>. It was very informative. Although I believe this case is unique in that there is a certain disclaimer at the beginning of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. This disclaimer, as I have been known to call it, is "However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)." It is clear, from this quote of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, that, in fact, there is not a consensus on the guideline on notability. I hope you take special note in this argument. You say, "You are wrong in believing that we cannot 'weigh the importance' of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> versus Search Test, as the differences page shows that guidelines are more valuable than proposals in assessing qualification". In this comment you say that <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a>, when you say "the differences page", shows that guidelines are more important than proposals. I found nothing on <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a> to indicate this. Furthermore I do not believe <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a> states "that guidelines are more important than proposals in assessing qualification". Please give me the quote from <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a> that states this. As of now I consider it your opinion, and nothing more, that <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a> "shows that guidelines are more valuable than proposals in assessing qualification". In regards to the Alternative Search Test you say "that it is hardly a well-defined qualification. It admits that the test is very open to interpretation. So, you think that he results are notable, but I do not think so. Is your opinion better than mine?" I must remind you that the Alternative Search Test tests notability and not qualifications. Let me just say, that even though one of your opinions may be more informed opinions, with regards to Wikipedia, neither of your opinions count. And thus, neither are better. You say that the Alternative Search Test "admits that the test is very open to interpretation". I did not find anything on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that says the Alternative Search Test in open to interpretation. If you have a quote from <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> that admits the Alternative Search Test "admits that the test is very open to interpretation" then please provide it in your next comment. I have tested people who have articles about them on Wikipedia, and whose notability is not in question, and many had equal to or less than the amount of results as the query "Farahnaz Pahlavi". Fortunately, there is no room for opinion when it comes to arithmetic. With regards to Farah Pahlavi's website as a source you state it "still fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, since it is a personal website." If you think a "personal website" is a website about a person, you are wrong. But, in the context of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, a personal website is a website published by the person the Wikipedia article is about. Consider the title of the section from which it stats personal websites are not allowed: "Self-published sources (online and paper)". The reason I brought up the point of bias is that you regarded Farah Pahlavi's website with doubt previously. Also, suggest a political bias for the source of Farah Pahlavi's website, "I would suggest a possible political bias." Why would there be political bias? Farahnaz Pahlavi is not in politics. Neither is her mother. Take this note into consideration, who knows Farahnaz Pahlavi better than her mother? You make a very interesting point with regards to Wikipedia's acceptance in academia. You say the university you attend does not accept Wikipedia as reference, this is ashame. I hope that our efforts as Wikipedians can improve the acceptance of Wikipedia. Furthermore Wikipedia can be helpful to a student who attends your university and is studying the Pahlavi Dynasty. i.e. the student can use references used in the Farahnaz Pahlavi article to find out more about her from sources that are accepted by your university. Also, a students studying of the Pahlavi Dyanasty is not exclusive to university students who wish to use Wikipedia for school work, or even university students in general. You are a very reseanable person, and because of this we can agree on many things. An example of this is when you state, "I definitely support improvement, but Wikipedia is not supposed to be a directory, any more than it should be an extension of Farah Pahlavi's homepage." I agree with you on this, and I hope we can agree on the fate of the article on Farahnaz Pahlavi. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 06:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC) Agha Nader</p>

<dd>Thanks again for the response. I have no problem with you using either essay format or bullet format, though I suggest you utilize paragraphs, as paragraphs are commonly used in essays to improve organization and clarity. I am willing to address you regardless of which you use. I will now address your response:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I do not know why you say that I did not address all of your points, as you do not say which points I actually did not address.</li>
<li>I understand that you did <i>respond</i> to my points by further elaborating your position, but you do not specify which points I <i>failed</i> to address. I think we both did a good job addressing each other's points.</li>
<li>If there is something that I have missed, please bring it up and I will try to address it.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I assert that <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a> values guidelines above proposals because it states that guidelines are "authorized by consensus", whereas the status of consensus for a proposal is "not yet clear". I suppose that if you do not consider consensus important for policies, guidelines, etc., then we do not have common ground here, but I thought it reasonable to assume you valued consensus.</li>
<li>Considering <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>, my judgment's reliance upon contrasting the level of consensus of a guideline versus a proposal is not out of line, as Wikipedia also seems to value consensus.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I understand that there is a 'disclaimer', as you are known to call it, on the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> page.</li>
<li>However, the 'disclaimer' you quote simply states that "not all" Wikipedians agree to the guideline. This does not mean it lacks consensus.</li>
<li>According to the differences page <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a>, a guideline has been "authorized by consensus". As <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is indeed a guideline, it apparently met this consensus, and is so authorized. It cannot be a guideline otherwise.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You say that you "did not find anything on WP:BIO that says the Alternative Search Test in open to interpretation".</li>
<li>I recommend you try reading actual page for the Search Test, namely <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a>.</li>
<li>Read it carefully, and note <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html#Validity_of_the_Google_test" title="WP:SET">WP:SET#Validity_of_the_Google_test</a>, which opens, "Given that the results of a Google test are interpreted subjectively, its implementation is not always consistent."</li>
<li>As it is given that the results are "interpreted subjectively", I am correct in saying that the Search Test is open to interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>You then said, "Let me just say, that even though one of your opinions may be more informed opinions, with regards to Wikipedia, neither of your opinions count. And thus, neither are better."</li>
<li>I apologize, but I do not understand your statement. Can you please clarify?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>As far as your notability test of other people, I can only suggest, again, that your read <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a>, which elaborates on these kind of inconsistencies in the test.</li>
<li>I quote you, "Fortunately, there is no room for opinion when it comes to arithmetic". I say that while <a href="../../../a/r/i/Arithmetic.html" title="Arithmetic">Arithmetic</a> may not have much room for opinion, the value assigned to the hit number of the Google test <i>is</i> subjective, based upon the quote from <a href="../../../s/e/t/WP%7ESET_8bd1.html" title="WP:SET">WP:SET</a>, "Given that the results of a Google test are interpreted subjectively, its implementation is not always consistent."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I describe Farah Pahlavi's site as a personal website because it is her official website. I quote from the main page, "Welcome to the 2006-07 Official Site of Empress Farah Pahlavi"</li>
<li>I do not think that a personal website is simply a website about a person. This website is <i>her</i> official site, not just a site about her.</li>
<li>I suggest you look at <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html#Self-published_sources" title="WP:RS">WP:RS#Self-published_sources</a>. The opening, "A self-published source is a published source that has not been subject to any form of independent fact-checking, or where no one stands between the writer and the act of publication. It includes personal websites and books published by vanity presses".</li>
<li>Since it is Farah Pahlavi's personal website, but the information under discussion regards Farahnaz Pahlavi, the website is acting as a secondary source. It would be a primary source if we were discussing Farah Pahlavi.</li>
<li>Under the subsection titled, "Self-published sources as secondary sources", the opening line is, "<b>Personal websites, blogs, and other self-published or vanity publications should not be used as secondary sources.</b>".</li>
<li>Therefore, it is not an accordance with Wikipedia guidelines to use the source.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I <i>suggested</i> a political bias, since the site seems to focus largely upon women's rights in Iran and the country's condition under the former monarchy; both are subjects related to politics.</li>
<li>Based upon the opening to her site, she still titles herself "Empress", rather than "former Empress". This smells political, but maybe it's just me.</li>
<li>Farah may know stuff about her daughter, but I hardly see why her posting information about her daughter on her personal website makes her daughter notable by Wikipedia standards. See <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I really don't have much more to add to the hypothetical "student" research conversation, but I appreciate your opinions on the topic.</li>
<li>I am glad you agree that Wikipedia is not a directory. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I hope I addressed everything. I would still like you to address the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria. Thanks again for contributing further good points to the discussion, and I look forward to your response. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 08:32, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Thank you for the advice on using paragraphs in my essay format. I believe I have been using paragraphs in my comments, I distinguish each paragraph from the previous with the return key. I will make them easier to distinguish this time.</p>
<p>I will start off by addressing any ambiguity or statements you believe may foster chaos. I wrote "you did not respond to all of my arguments." The argument you failed to address, in your comment previous to that in which I made that statement, was "It is only a guideline: it is not official policy. You ask, "How can a proposal be held over the accepted guideline?". There is a crucial flaw in this question: WP:BIO is not accepted by all. It even states in WP:BIO, almost as a disclaimer, "However, it is the opinion of many, but not all, Wikipedians that these criteria are a fair test of whether a person has sufficient external notice to ensure that they can be covered from a neutral point of view based on verifiable information from reliable sources, without straying into original research (all of which are formal policies)." So you can see WP:BIO is just the opinion of many Wikipedian, but not all. It does not even state that it is the opinion of most Wikipedian's." You did not address the "disclaimer", as I have been known to call it, in that comment. This is all IRT, if you know what I mean, (Irrelevant). This is because you addressed this argument in your last comment. I only bring this up because you asked me to, "I do not know why you say that I did not address all of your points, as you do not say which points I actually did not address. I understand that you did respond to my points by further elaborating your position, but you do not specify which points I failed to address. I think we both did a good job addressing each other's points. If there is something that I have missed, please bring it up and I will try to address it."</p>
<p>You state, "I suggested a political bias, since the site seems to focus largely upon women's rights in Iran and the country's condition under the former monarchy; both are subjects related to politics." Do you have any evidence that her website has political bias? Or are these suggestions based on "smells": you state, "This smells political, but maybe it's just me." Please provide EVD (evidence)of the political bias of this source.</p>
<p>You asked me to clarify this statement "Let me just say, that even though one of your opinions may be more informed opinions, with regards to Wikipedia, neither of your opinions count. And thus, neither are better." Previously you asked me "Is your opinion better than mine?" And the answer I gave was my opinion (or yours) maybe more informed, but neither of your opinions matter with regards to Wikipedia. What matters is reason and EVD that it IRT.</p>
<p>You state, "I really don't have much more to add to the hypothetical "student" research conversation, but I appreciate your opinions on the topic." I believe this is because we have exhausted this argument and many others. It would be best to move on to different arguments since you have not convinced me and I have not convinced you with the argument presented so far.</p>
<p>So far you haven't provided any argument as to why Farahnaz Pahlavi is not notable, except for the fact that she does not meet the criteria listed it in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. All you have done is read too literally into guidelines and proposed guidelines in order to find an excerpt that is beneficial to the deletion of Farahnaz Pahlavi. Since notability is contetious this is not enough, you must look at the big picture. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not an exclusionary list, it is a guideline, to guide people to decide whether someone is notable or not. This does not necessarily mean notablitiy is subjective, rather, it is hard to define. And in some cases is elusive. In fact, the only reason for deleting the article on Farahnaz Pahlavi you present is that she does not fall into the criteria presented in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a></p>
<p>You have asked me to say which criteria Farahnaz Pahlavi meets in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. I will start of with a word of warning, if you wish read too literally into the guidelines and policies of Wikipedia, we will not reach an agreement. As you know, Farahnaz Pahlavi was a Princess in Iran. At that time the political system in Iran was a monarchy, so the Shah of Iran, was a politician. This is because politicians are policy makers. This goes for the Queen of Iran. This is evident if you know her previous title, and I believe you do. It was Shahbanu, which means Empress. Surely an Empress is involved in policy making decisions in a monarchy. This can be extended to a princess as well. Thus Farahnaz Pahlavi meets this criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, "Political figures holding or who have held international, national or statewide/provincewide office, and members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislature." Please provide non-IRT EVD in your next comment. <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 03:53, 9 January 2007 (UTC)Agha Nader</p>
<p><br />
My bulleted replies are grouped in correspondence to the paragraphs of your response:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thank you for making your paragraphs clearer.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Well, I don't think that there has been any real <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaos.html" title="Chaos">Chaos</a> here, since we have both been fairly straightforward, but the precaution doesn't hurt.</li>
<li>You rightly call the elaboration irrelevant since you admit that "[I] addressed this argument in [my] last point".</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I <i>suggested</i>, rather than <i>asserted</i>, simply because it was the impression I got from the website, but did not feel it important enough to have a lengthy argument about it.</li>
<li>While it's possible that I <i>could</i> ground my suggestion with evidence, the possibility of the site being biased isn't highly relevant to my argument for deletion, so unless you feel it <i>does</i> matter, I do not think it useful to discuss at this time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Um, still doesn't make sense. Is it possible that you mean "our" instead of "yours"?</li>
<li>I provide reasoning and evidence based upon guidelines. Considering the relevancy of the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> guideline to Biographies, and that other guidelines are also applicable, the "IRT" description hardly applies to guideline-based arguments.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Good. As we agreed, Wikipedia is not a directory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You say I failed to provide any arguments, "except for the fact that she does not meet the criteria listed it in <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>". Considering this is a <b>biography</b>, an argument based upon "the fact" that shes doesn't qualify under <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> definitely counts.</li>
<li>Your attempt to discredit my analysis based upon <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria relies upon the presumptive and disrespectful assumption that I "read too literally" into guidelines and proposals.</li>
<li>Your following insinuation that I do this "too-literal" reading in order to find an excerpt that is beneficial to the deletion of Farahnaz Pahlavi is a grave and baseless violation of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Apparently, you assume I do this just to delete her article, not because I found her genuinely non-notable.</li>
<li>I nominated her article for deletion because she is not notable based upon the guideline for biographies, and I presented a thorough criterion-by-criterion argument in support of this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Thanks for finally responding to a criterion.</li>
<li>As Empress, Farah Pahlavi was politically involved. However, <a href="../../../p/r/i/Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> is a title, and it does not follow that by virtue of being a princess, Farahnaz was also policy-maker. We need evidence of involvement.</li>
<li>If you can present evidence that she was an active politician, involved in policy-making, I would find your argument to be stronger. It seems that the closest she had to "involvement", based upon the current article, was wearing a diamond tiara at her father's coronation.</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> - This article should definitely remain. Contrary to what Behnam has stated, she has received much media coverage. Even though this media coverage was in Iran, it still qualifies since Wikipedia is not restricted to the West. Iranians abroad and in Iran know and recognize her, and she is famous. Also since she is mentioned on other articles, readers will want to know more about her. Not to mention, she is royalty, and is thus notable. Plus she is in line to the Head of the House of Pahlavi. To purge wikipedia of articles about people who are royalty but haven't done anything note worthy is irrational and unpractical. If Behnam has a problem with this article, maybe he should expand it! <a href="../../../a/g/h/User%7EAgha_Nader_ba7f.html" title="User:Agha Nader">Agha Nader</a> 00:35, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - She appears borderline notable by herself, and I agree with the proposed <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> standard, whether it's official or not. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 01:40, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Before there were official guidelines, there were principles and common sense that guided decisions about what is notable enough for inclusion in a "non-paper" encyclopedia. It isn't the official status, but the rationale that underlies it which lends it ongoing authority. Some of those rationales are undergoing development and articulation at <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a>, but we need not await that process's completion to act upon sound reasoning. The discussion with <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> illustrates the value of completing and promoting <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a>, because IMHO he's right that the extant guidelines fail to encompass the relevant point, which is that royalty's notability does not derive primarily from what they <i>do</i>, but from what they <i>are</i>, any more than a nation's flag is significant because of what it does or is made of or how unique its design is. It's a <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symbol.html" title="Symbol">symbol</a>, and its importance isn't intrinsic, but a function of the significance attributed to it by others who value some or all of what it stands for. Ditto the notability of royalty. Royalty is a living embodiment of national identity, history and tradition, very much in the same way that a <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag.html" title="Flag">flag</a> or <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anthem.html" title="Anthem">anthem</a> is, except that flags and anthems are plentiful and royalty is extremely rare. Nations do change or discard flags, or change their consensus about what such symbols mean -- as they do about royalty. But that change usually results from extended debate or struggle, and is often re-considered or reversed long afterwards, which is why deposed royalty remains notable (look at how often in the last 100 years Greece established and overthrew its monarchy, and ask yourself why Brazil voted on restoration of the monarchy over 100 years after it had been abolished, and why Uganda, South Africa and other African, Pacific and Asian nations are institutionalizing so-called <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_chiefs.html" title="House of chiefs">traditional leadership</a>, which is to say re-constituting local monarchies decades after abolition). Nor is royalty just about the monarch: No nation, whether monarchy or republic, has laws governing marriages of <a href="../../../p/r/i/Prime_minister.html" title="Prime minister">prime ministers</a>, yet nearly every nation that has a monarchy -- constitutional figurehead or <a href="../../../a/b/s/Absolutism.html" title="Absolutism">absolutism</a> -- has laws governing who its royalty may and may not marry, because royalty -- unlike celebrity -- is about <i>family</i>, i.e. the <a href="../../../k/i/n/Kin.html" title="Kin">kinfolk</a> of the monarch. Nor need people approve of, believe in or care about the symbolism of a monarchy for them to find its royalty, well, <i>interesting</i>. You might persuade me that a given royal is not notable by arguing that their dynasty has lost all remnant of public interest (e.g., if the media were to show no more interest in them than in me), but <i>not</i> by arguing that their individual deeds in life lack significance, since that is not relevant to what makes royalty notable in the first place -- whereas public interest <i>is</i>. Finally, given the number of "Keep" votes mounting up on this page, the nominator might want to consider switching to a more relevant line of argument as suggested above -- unless (<a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikilawyering_fdcf.html" title="WP:Wikilawyering">Wikilawyering</a>) is the real point of this exercise -- even though it seems to me that there is a guideline -- nay, a policy! -- to the effect that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Soapbox" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a soapbox</a>! <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 08:08, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks for your personal views on the importance of royalty, and why you think that <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> should be made into an actual guideline. However, as of now, it remains a proposal, and should be treated as such until it is made into a guideline.

<dd>The point wasn't my personal views on royalty, but why your arguments aren't proving persuasive here.

<dd>I appreciate your views greatly, as they help me understand why <i>you</i> believe all royalty matter.

The criteria you have outlined are more appropriate for the talk page about the <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> proposal; if this proposal were made into guideline, I would have no problem with this article; however, until then, I cannot see how proposal can be placed above actual guideline. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 20:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

I argue for deletion because I feel that Farahnaz Pahlavi does not meet the notability criteria of <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Your insinuation is not appreciated.
<dl>
<dd>People who engage in wikilawyering don't do it because they've read about it and bought into it, but because it's their natural style in discussion. Despite the fact that several editors have commented here that they consider the <i>principles</i> embodied at <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> to be appropriate and therefore valid to apply, you continue to insist that until it becomes a formal guideline, it is irrelevant to this discussion and should be irrelevant to people's votes. As you can see, however, that isn't working for you. The <a href="../../../w/i/k/WP%7EWikilawyering_fdcf.html" title="WP:Wikilawyering">Wikilawyering</a> article describes the phenomenon as, "Breaking the spirit of a policy or guideline through sticking to a too-literal interpretation of the letter of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Wikipedia%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_cdad.html" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a>. Asserting that technical interpretation of Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines should override the principles they express...Wikipedia policies and procedures should be interpreted in a commonsensical way to achieve the purpose of the policy, or help dispute resolution." That clause is why I cited it in this discussion. A fundamental criterion for articles in WP is <i>notability</i>. Extant guidelines help us determine if that is present in specific cases, but don't exhaust what people consider "notable". Focusing on getting people to "stick to the rules" as you interpret them (despite the fact that "the rules" themselves say they are neither exhaustive nor binding), while ignoring what people tell you is the <i>substantive</i> basis of their decision in a specific case, is considered wikilawyering. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 19:29, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for the clarification about your use of Wikilawyering against me. While I now understand where you are coming from, as my argumentation here <i>is</i> rather rule-based, I don't think that my approach is a "too-literal interpretation", or that it breaks the spirit of a guideline. My case is rooted in guideline; yours is rooted in proposal. There is nothing wikilawyering about drawing a distinction between the two; in fact, there is a section devoted entirely to their differences. See <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicies_and_guidelines_f50a.html#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc." title="WP:Policies and guidelines">WP:Policies_and_guidelines#The_differences_between_policies.2C_guidelines.2C_essays.2C_etc.</a>. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 20:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for giving thoughtful consideration to my argument that focusing upon whether this article complies with <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> fails to address the underlying criteria your interlocutors consider relevant and decisive, and is therefore unlikely to achieve the deletion of this article that you seek. I am now convinced that you fully understand and prefer that outcome to the prospect of building consensus in support of your proposal to delete, if that would require you to address concerns you consider improperly raised. While I disagree with your interpretation, it strikes me as a coherent and well-articulated one. I have enjoyed exchanging points of view with you, have learned, and look forward to future opportunities to work together to improve WP. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 06:28, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You are <i>advocating</i> that people base their decision exclusively on the guideline <i>you</i> prefer to apply, despite evidence that people, having heard your arguments, continue to base their decision on other factors they deem relevant. I thought perhaps those "other factors" hadn't been articulated clearly and fully enough for you to "hear" them, since you keep soapboxing the same point -- "Prove to me that this princess is notable according to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>" -- so I tried to fill that gap. Sorry if that doesn't help.

<dd>My main issue has been that using <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> as a "stated guideline" is not appropriate, since it is a proposal, which is not supposed to be treated as an accepted guideline, a.k.a. it is not authorized by consensus. Not only is this justified by the categorization of proposal relative to guidelines and policies; a quick look at the <a href="../../../r/o/y/WP%7EROYAL_19a8.html" title="WP:ROYAL">WP:ROYAL</a> talk page confirms the uncertain status of consensus that keeps it as a proposal(though it appears you are already familiar with the talk page). I have, since the beginning, relied upon the guideline <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> because it is designed to be a guideline regarding biographical articles, such as the <a href="../../../f/a/r/Farahnaz_Pahlavi_96fd.html" title="Farahnaz Pahlavi">Farahnaz Pahlavi</a> article. I don't consider arguing based upon accepted guidelines as soap-box advocacy, and I do not intend that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> be <i>exclusively</i> applied. If you have an argument for Keep that is based on actual guidelines, not <i>proposals</i>, I am very open to consideration, but proposals lack authorization by consensus. The soapbox accusation hardly seems acceptable. By the way, your big speech above about why royalty matters seems to be more "soapboxing" than anything I've done, since you do not argue by policy but instead by your personal values regarding royalty. I don't have anything against you having those views, but please remember that Wikipedia is not a soap box. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Behnam_a247.html" title="User:The Behnam">The Behnam</a> 20:18, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> is not the only WP guideline which might apply. As BIO notes, other criteria may apply.

<dd>I am very open to the application of other guidelines, but these should be actual guidelines, not <i>proposed</i> guidelines. Many of the Keep votes have been based upon treating a proposal as an accepted guideline, but the differences are significant.

<dd>As is noted in a bunch of places, one way that a guideline which is proposed becomes accepted is if people say "I agree, we'll use that".

<li><b>Delete</b> I agree with Wer2chosen that this criterion for notability applies. However the references given do not appear to meet the criteria. One of them is for a book that hasn't been published yet, so we have no way of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifying</a> it. <a href="http://catnyp.nypl.org:2082/search/tAlley+cat./talley+cat/-2%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=talley+highlights+yesterday+for+tomorrow&amp;1%2C1%2C" class="external text" title="http://catnyp.nypl.org:2082/search/tAlley+cat./talley+cat/-2%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=talley+highlights+yesterday+for+tomorrow&amp;1%2C1%2C" rel="nofollow">One</a> is for a book that is about the Allen Family, and while I don't have a copy, I am skeptical that this could count as an "independent review" of Graham. The last reference is for a book apparently published thirty-some years before the artist was born. If proper references could be found I'd be willing to change my mind on this, but for now the article does not meet the criterion specified. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> (<a href="../../../g/w/e/User_talk%7EGwernol_ca56.html" title="User talk:Gwernol">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gwernol_0674.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gwernol">contribs</a>) 17:56, 4 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No sleight to the artist or their work, but there is not sufficient notability. Wikipedia says about living biographies, "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field".

<li><b>Reply</b>: 'm thinking "widely recognized... opinion maker", and "published ... editors... who received multiple independent reviews" for at least The Howard Factor which seems widely reviewed (google search) and perhaps his own columns although I have not searched. Google also reveals he is an editor for the some of the publications from the International Red Cross. Plus, sifting through the numerous google hits reveals some potential mentions in other media so he might even meet <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> directly. <a href="../../../c/c/s/User%7ECcscott_e3f9.html" title="User:Ccscott">Ccscott</a> 15:20, 30 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Actually, I have a soft spot for articles about quacks like Schappeller and as far as I know, he was rather "influential" before WWII. At least he became rather wealthy by his follower's donations. However, in contrast with <a href="../../../v/r/i/Vril.html" title="Vril">Vril</a> or Nazi Ufos there seems to exist no reputable english-language source. Among the few I know of is Henry Steven's book on German Flying Saucers the most prominent one, but his writings are more than questionable, and the same is true for the rest of the english sources which I know. On the other hand, the only german-language source I know of which seems to be halfway reputable is out of print for ten years and I wasn't able to get it via libraries. Otherwise I would have done a revision of this article by myself. Maybe, it would be wise to mention him in a WP-list of quacks or pseudoscientists but in the moment, I see no practicable way to write a stand-alone article about him that would fit the WP-standards. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypto-ffm_8a4f.html" title="User:Crypto-ffm">Crypto-ffm</a> 14:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> to recommend an article for speedy deletion you just have to add the appropriate tag to it.

<li>Contrary to your opinion, Wikipedia's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notability guidelines</a> emphatically rule out the possibility of "everything, no matter how small" being included.

<li><b>Comment</b> Damn, I was sure they'd played the season before that - sorry, my mistake. However, upon re-reading the link to the article on Jones, I was reminded that Moxey still qualifies for the same reason as Jones though!

<p>I think it will be impossible to complete or maintain this list. I raised a concern about the list being a collection of information that belonged on individual articles.

<li><b>Delete</b>, since 'fiction' is such a vast category, and there are only 365 dates in a year, the list can't avoid being either badly incomplete, or an unmanageable mass of unsorted data.

<li><b>Delete</b> What Squiddy said. This list is potentially infinite (<a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information) and of little foreseeable use.

<li><b>Note</b> - this article likely came about because editors added these fictional dates to date articles and were told to go create their own article instead.

<li><b>Question</b> - is this article really less legitimate than other Wikipidia lists of stuff in fiction, such as fictional countries, swords, and companies? <a href="../../../m/d/i/User%7EMdiamante_0dff.html" title="User:Mdiamante">User:Mdiamante</a> 4 January 2007.

<li><b>Response</b> - <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_swords.html" title="List of fictional swords">I</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_countries.html" title="List of fictional countries">don't</a> <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_companies.html" title="List of fictional companies">know</a>. I would speculate that it might be because dates are pretty hard to avoid using in fiction while the other things are usually included and named because they are important to the work. -- <a href="../../../s/w/e/User%7ESwerdnaneb_2a97.html" title="User:Swerdnaneb">Ben</a> (<a href="../../../s/w/e/User_talk%7ESwerdnaneb_879b.html" title="User talk:Swerdnaneb">talk</a>) 22:01, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>I'd argue</b> that comparatively few fictional media list specific dates. We aren't told the dates of Terminator 2 or Jurassic Park or those of H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds (I've checked). How many millions of Law and Order/Star Trek/Simpsons/Friends episodes are there? Only a handful of each might list actual dates. As for the charge that this list could become huge and unmanagable, why not address that if and when it became an issue? <a href="../../../m/d/i/User%7EMdiamante_0dff.html" title="User:Mdiamante">User:Mdiamante</a> 4 January 2007.
<ul>
<li>Comparatively few fictional media list specific dates? This list is open to every novel, play, poem, film or TV series ever created anywhere in the world. Let's take Richardson's <i><a href="../../../c/l/a/Clarissa.html" title="Clarissa">Clarissa</a></i>, supposedly the longest novel in the English language. It is composed of 176 letters, almost all of them dated. Now not every date in the book will be important, but this list has so far failed to define its criteria for notability. The same problems would apply to any fictional work in the form of a diary. And, oh yeah, historical novels? Do we include the date January 24, 41 AD because that's the date <a href="../../../c/l/a/Claudius.html" title="Claudius">Claudius</a> became emperor both in reality and in Robert Graves's <i><a href="../../../i/%2C/_/I%2C_Claudius_1406.html" title="I, Claudius">I, Claudius</a></i>? --<a href="../../../f/o/l/User%7EFolantin_9fb0.html" title="User:Folantin">Folantin</a> 11:30, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

There's an entry from the film The One. How is that useful? As for dates, I think fictional dates are neat because they occur once a year.

I think that that's more likely to occur than someone spreading the word about "Anistance" from The One. <a href="../../../m/d/i/User%7EMdiamante_0dff.html" title="User:Mdiamante">User:Mdiamante</a> 4 January 2007.</li>

Also, I don't see how copyright violations are "reasons for improvement" especially since it's taken very seriously on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam12901_0b6a.html" title="User:Adam12901">Адам12901</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam12901_3080.html" title="User talk:Adam12901">Talk</a></sup> 22:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you would now concentrate on geography of Russia, for example, I will surely forget your past behavior soon. But if you continue in your AfD crusade against churches although you are clearly not expert in this field, to put it mildly, I must warn other editors. - Regarding copyvio and spam in articles about notable subjects, the solution is easy: stubify the article. I've done it and now its text does not violate any copyrights and is no more advert-like.--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 10:53, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Adam, in the last month you AfDed 111 articles. From these 111, 103 were church-related (I include the Burnt Church First Nation band here). From the 103 church-related articles, 21 articles (20%) were deleted as non-notable according to your suggestions, two are pending - and most of the rest was nothing more than annoyance for the fellow Wikipedians. Do you have a better word for such an activity?</dd>
<dd>Understand me, I am not against deletion of nn articles and I nominate many articles for deletion myself, including church-related ones. But the case must be reasonably clear and well researched - and therefore you should limit yourself to the areas of your expertise. I hope that you will be a great editor and I am trying to help you, not to "punish" you for your mistakes...--<a href="../../../i/o/a/User%7EIoannes_Pragensis_cdfc.html" title="User:Ioannes Pragensis">Ioannes Pragensis</a> 19:29, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>If you were to count the number of articles that I speedily delete, churches would not be anywhere near that percentage. As a newpage editor, I view newly created pages. I found <a href="../../../w/o/r/Worldventure.html" title="Worldventure">Worldventure</a>, and did a redirect (after realising that speedy deletion wasn't right for it). I did not go on some sort of crusade looking for this article, I found it while doing what I usually do on Wikipedia - patrol newly created pages. I will expect you to stop bringing up past matters in future AfD articles, and to be mature about this. Again, if you have a problem with what I'm doing, notify an administrator. I am sick of your crap, and I am not going to discuss this with you any further. Thank you and have a good day. --<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdam12901_0b6a.html" title="User:Adam12901">Адам12901</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdam12901_3080.html" title="User talk:Adam12901">Talk</a></sup> 20:42, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Once again: I will happily stop it if you stop AfD church-related articles (except in clearly non-notable cases, of course; I have no objections if you delete a brand new church with ten members).

<p>With all due respect to my man Morgan the creator, this phenomenon is not verifiable or notable enough to create an article. Moreover, this movement basically has nothing to do with the wigga movement in the '90s to now so merging the 2 would be factually wrong. <a href="../../../b/o/n/User%7EBonafide.hustla_8457.html" title="User:Bonafide.hustla">Bonafide.hustla</a> <sup><a href="../../../b/o/n/User_talk%7EBonafide.hustla_8a10.html" title="User talk:Bonafide.hustla">Talk</a></sup> 19:05, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The author is very notable, and this is an article about the essay, and not the movement.

<li><b>Delete or merge with a relevant article</b>. The problem is that the article isn't about the movement; it's about an essay that talks about the movement, with no context.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The attention that the photographer has received from critics, curators and magazine editors seems to be enough to establish notability. The person sounds much more notable than the average photographer. --<a href="../../../e/a/s/User%7EEastmain_2651.html" title="User:Eastmain">Eastmain</a> 21:04, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Isaacs is my vote. This photographer is quite notable. Editor Hoary decided long ago he didn't want Isaacs' on WP for whatever reason. We both obviously see, along with others, that Isaacs work is as notable as half of the photographers on WP whether its art photography and/or commercial photography. I fleshed out alot of this article but I do understand to google Lee Isaacs is not easy since alot of people have his first and last name as a middle name and last name. I have a book here, UPsouth, that has many examples of his work. This is a Warhol project grant through Space One Eleven. He is in good company as far as the notoriety of the other artists here is concerned. Emma Amos and bell hooks are in the book along with Willie Cole and Marie Weaver. Cole is the only other male in this project. Maybe someone could sift through some of this. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 04:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><i>Delete</i>. Yes, Isaacs' work seems considerably more notable than that of the average photographer (me?). His commercial work, as presented on his website, is good: way better than the average. His nature work seems variable: some works are pleasant but picture-postcardy, others are first-rate. ¶ However, what you or I think of his photography is (perhaps unfortunately) of little importance. What's important is what's verifiable about his work, and its verifiable notability in the eyes of others. ¶ Let's look at the external links, one by one. There's (i) Isaacs' site, automatically discounted as not disinterested. And then there are: (ii) <i><a href="http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/September2001.htm" class="external text" title="http://www2.una.edu/universityrelations/September2001.htm" rel="nofollow">Alabama Art Monthly</a> Noles-Ross lists this in her bio.</i> / (iii) <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1230298/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1230298/" rel="nofollow">"Johnny Flynton," 2002</a></i> / (iv) <i><a href="http://www.pinholeday.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.pinholeday.org/" rel="nofollow">Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day</a>'</i> / (v) <i><a href="http://www.portfolios.com/zoom.html?User_number=LeeIsaacs&amp;imagecount=4" class="external text" title="http://www.portfolios.com/zoom.html?User_number=LeeIsaacs&amp;imagecount=4" rel="nofollow">MedPartners</a> Photo attribute to Isaacs</i>. The second and fourth say nothing whatever about Isaacs. The third is a claim that Isaacs was the photographer for <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329245/" class="external text" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0329245/" rel="nofollow">Johnny Flynton</a>,</i> a short film that may for all I know be first rate but for which IMDB gives a grand total of zero external reviews. The last shows a single, rather indifferent photo by Isaacs. The notes prove to my satisfaction that Isaacs participated in two exhibitions; in one, he was one of ten (or more?) participants, in the other, one of <i>seventeen.</i> ¶ <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">WP:BIO</a> talks of <i>Published authors, editors and photographers who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.</i> I see no independent reviews (just the odd mention), and no award. <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_History_of_photography_bea3.html#Notability_criteria_for_photographers" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject History of photography">WP HOP</a> says that <i>Provisionally, a notable photographer is one who meets one or more of [eight] criteria</i>; Isaacs doesn't appear to meet any of the eight. ¶ On 18 December, I posted the following question on the article's talk page: <i>Any books? Any solo exhibitions? I don't see anything mentioned, and his own site is uninformative. / Isaacs seems to be touted here as a notable pinhole photographer. <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;q=%22lee+isaacs%22+pinhole&amp;btnG=Google+%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;q=%22lee+isaacs%22+pinhole&amp;btnG=Google+%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">Google doesn't support this.</a> The man's own site <a href="http://www.leeisaacs.com/Bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.leeisaacs.com/Bio.html" rel="nofollow">suggests</a> that he's only now exploring the noncommercial, and it doesn't say anything about the commercial. / What am I missing here?</i> I haven't yet received a satisfactory answer to that. ¶ We're told above that googling for the man's photography is difficult; I think it's very easy (just click <a href="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;ie=Shift_JIS&amp;q=%22lee+isaacs%22+photography&amp;btnG=Google+%8C%9F%8D%F5&amp;lr=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.jp/search?hl=ja&amp;ie=Shift_JIS&amp;q=%22lee+isaacs%22+photography&amp;btnG=Google+%8C%9F%8D%F5&amp;lr=" rel="nofollow">this</a>). There's little there, and certainly no sign of a book or major solo exhibition. And there's no surprise there, as <a href="http://www.leeisaacs.com/Bio.html" class="external text" title="http://www.leeisaacs.com/Bio.html" rel="nofollow">Isaacs himself says</a> that he <i>is just now coming to terms with his “place in art”.</i> I wish him all the best: Let him get a major solo show or a book all to himself, and then he will deserve and likely get a Wikipedia article. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:45, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> I am sure WP needs people like Hoary to hold the rules in check but I think with art the rules here should be more open. Isaacs is an artist who has as many credentials as at least half the photographers on here and I think he deserves an article. So I dont understand the power welding here its not needed nor warranted. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 15:53, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Isaacs makes very modest claims for himself as an artist. Rather, it seems that he's a commercial photographer who's started as (self-conscious) artist. So let's first consider him as a photographer. <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> has notability criteria for photographers. Isaacs doesn't meet them. WP:BIO is of course just a guideline, but there's no sign of verifiable alternative notability, other than being one of ten people to have contributed to one exhibition and one of seventeen to have contributed to another. As for the claim that Isaacs "has as many credentials as at least half the photographers on here", I'm willing to believe that a considerable number of photographers with articles on WP are very dodgy indeed (for all I know there could be entire hoaxes among them), but the simplest place to survey a list of photographers is (wait for it) <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_photographers.html" title="List of photographers">List of photographers</a>, and I wonder whether Artsojourner really believes that the credentials of Isaacs -- no solo exhibitions, no books, no particularly famous (or in modish language "notorious" or "iconic") photograph -- outclass those of even five percent of them, let alone fifty percent. (Would he care to choose one letter of the alphabet and compare Isaacs with listed photographers whose surname starts with that letter?) ¶ I also don't understand what's being said about "power welding" (wielding?): I for one am arguing one side, perhaps ineffectively but I think politely; Artsojourner and others are entirely free to argue the other. ¶ Again, none of what I've said belittles Isaacs, his work, or his chances of getting an article after future advances in his career. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 16:24, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> Notability not established, and the article reads like something from his agent ("Hard to tie down, Isaacs has involved himself with ..."). <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a wire service or promotional site</a>. | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDarcy_622c.html" title="User:MrDarcy">Mr. Darcy</a> <small><a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDarcy_1572.html" title="User talk:MrDarcy">talk</a></small> 16:11, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> If even some of those who want to delete for non-notability admit that the photographer is relatively notable, what more is there to say? <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 04:27, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Eh what? I see only <i>one</i> suggestion of this by somebody making a "delete" vote; it's where <i>I</i> say: "Yes, Isaacs' work seems considerably more notable than that of the average photographer (me?)." I hardly thought it would be necessary to labor such an obvious point, but [sigh] <i>there are millions of photographers, of whom millions are average.</i> I'm one of them. I can get the lighting right. I can get the exposure and focusing right. I can produce a handful of photos that won't put you to sleep. But compared with the hundreds of notable photographers, ranging alphabetically from <a href="../../../b/e/r/Berenice_Abbott_64fc.html" title="Berenice Abbott">Berenice Abbott</a> (or earlier) to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Stanislovas_%C5%BDvirg%C5%BEdas_27ff.html" title="Stanislovas Žvirgždas">Stanislovas Žvirgždas</a> (or beyond), my photographs are crap. Perhaps I merely suffer from false modesty -- but worries about this are by the way, because editors can write a substantial amount of <i>verifiable</i> information Abbott or Žvirgždas whereas they can't do so about me, and Abbott and Žvirgždas have <i>verifiably</i> had major solo exhibitions and have had books of their works published by non-vanity presses. So there's a huge gulf between (a) the average joe (or the average hoary) and (b) the photographers who rightly get articles in WP. Isaacs doesn't (yet) belong to the latter: he doesn't come close to satisfying <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or any alternative that anybody has yet suggested. He's way better than I am: good for him, and I hope he goes far. If/when he does, he'll deserve an article. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 05:22, 9 January 2007 (UTC) slightly rephrased for clarity 23:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><s><b>KEEP</b></s> Isaacs work on 20 issues as a photography contributor and photography editor to an arts magazine counts for something, besides all of the other things he has done both artistically and commercially. Isaacs has work in a book. He was a still photographer on a film. Isaacs continues to develop new techniques for Pinhole and this all counts for something. I do not compare Isaacs work to the average artist as I feel he has done so many things and warrants his own article on WP. <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArtsojourner_b7ca.html" title="User:Artsojourner">Artsojourner</a> 06:25, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But Artsojourner, you already voted "keep", just four days ago. (See above, "Keep Isaacs is my vote.... 04:53, 5 January 2007....") Of course you are most welcome to add additional comments and arguments, but it's odd to preface them with the word "KEEP": doing so implies a second vote. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 06:50, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>So much on the form; now, comments on what you say. <i>Alabama Art Monthly</i> may have been an excellent periodical but neither the British library nor any of the great majority of (all of?) British libraries stocks it. Most recent or contemporary photographers who get articles in WP don't merely have a few pages in a single book, they instead have entire books devoted to their work. The film is commented on above: being the still photographer for a film might be of significance if stills from it were of some significance; this film has not a single external review that's linked to from IMDB, and its only mention within WP is that within the article on Isaacs. Pinhole photography: what are these new pinhole techniques of Isaacs'? The article merely says that he studied pinhole photography and that he participates in Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day (as do very many photographers, one might add). -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:04, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Some of those are good. Just remember that <b>you</b> have to be the focus of the article for it to count as a source about you. The news.com article mentions you briefly as a quote (which wouldn't really count). You're referred to as "a commentator" in the Publish.com article (which means it DEFINATELY doesn't count). The Web Pro News articles could probably be used as a source, and the Clickz.com article might work too (I suggest you check out WP:SOURCE for more about properly sourcing an article). The Ziff Davis news wouldn't work as it's focus is on the AdWords program, and neither would the E-consultancy.com article. I hope that helps clarify things. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 23:29, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> when even those wanting to delete say the person is notable but not quite notable enough, they are not following the spirit of the guidelines.

<li><b>Comment</b>: When the major contributor is the subject of the article and then he further solicits help through his personal blog (see above) and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" class="external text" title="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" rel="nofollow">a second blog</a> solicits help for SEO AfDs, calling me (as the AfD submitter) a vandal...well, "everyone says" acts more as a vote and not a discussion which is not the point of AfD. Notability is not subjective and the article (as acknowledged by other editors above) was poorly written and likely did not meet the criteria when I submitted it for AfD. The intent is to have the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiabililty</a> necessary in the form of <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliably sourced</a> proof of notability and not to poll the audience to see enough colleagues will vouch for the subject's notability or not. This article has been improved and the closing administrator may see that WP:BIO has finally been met. For an example, it would be useless to have the criteria if I could create an article about myself and then ask fellow bioinformaticists who read my blog to come and say "Aw, come on, he's notable...let it go!" and satisfy the guidelines in doing so. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 07:32, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I did not intend to suggest that you had influence on the other blog. I was only intending to point out that because we can't always control what people will do outside of wikipedia, we need to follow the guidelines and policies that are put in place to establish neutrality and notability for each article on its own. Also, we must do so in discussion of whether the article fits policy and guidelines and not as votes of confidence for the subject matter for conditions such as notability. Argue to the facts of the article and whether they meet specific criteria, not to emotion or (not-so-)common sense and subjectivities. <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 11:31, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm not in agreement with the notability of quite a few of the SEO consultants in that category as I probe further. The existence or age of other articles is not a meter for whether another article meets the criteria for WP though. Furthermore, someone who just joined the SEO profession, but had an immediate notable impact would warrant an article, while someone else who has been there for years does not.

<li>"Functionality Creep" is not the accepted terminology, but rather, "Function Creep". The issue came to a head a month ago after a user vandalized both pages and the "function creep" entry became a protected re-direct. The person behind the controversy (he who is causing the problems: the curator of the "functionality creep" page, user: Kreepy Krawly) is engaing in personal attacks, accusing users like Mathmo of uploading viruses, and posting personal information against another user's wishes - in this case, mine. Not only should the "functionality creep" page be deleted and/or turned into a protected re-direct back to the original "function creep" page, but the user Kreepy krawly should be banned from this site permanently. Also, he is posting under a variety of pseudonyms, so those users should also be deleted. Additionally, there should be a ban placed on anything coming from the IP address 71.210.62.238. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.211.139.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.211.139.121_71fe.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.211.139.121">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Delete or redirect</b> - As best I can tell from a Google search, this is the pet phrase of a small group which is opposed to universal identificaction documents. Let's just say that it is not a good sign when a googling of "funtionality creep" turns up this article first followed almost exclusively by the Wikipedia mirrors. The non-Wikipedia web pages which use this phrase are all of the anti-identification genre.

<li>Cutts isn't a PR agent. He's a software engineer who acts as the technical representative of Google for webmasters; that's very different. And yes, I'd absolutely expect to see articles about people in equivalent roles in equivalent companies like Microsoft, Apple, Cisco, Oracle, etc. The reason these people are notable is they get a lot of press coverage and are widely known. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 21:40, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> He is a very notable person in the tech world and there are a huge amount of pages and posts about him. I have heard of him several times and do not work in the tech world. this is definitely a keep. thank you. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThebt_fc33.html" title="User:Thebt">Thebt</a> 20:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Cutts is more than just the PR man for Google - he is the public face of Google for everyone in the search industry. As Gwernol stated, his notability is easily verified by any of the links above, as well as via searches in Google News, Yahoo News, and probably any other news outlet you decide to look <a href="../../../c/a/y/User%7ECaydel_1b50.html" title="User:Caydel">Caydel</a> 21:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For example, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3783507.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3783507.stm" rel="nofollow">here</a> he is interviewed by the BBC. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 21:52, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If that's the case, then get the information into the article. As it stands, the article cites some blogs as its primary sources of information -- and as we all know, blogs are generally not valid sources of information, unless the blog is written by the subject of the biography. I shouldn't have to read an AfD discussion to get an assertion of his notability from a reliable source. And... ehh, that BBC article doesn't really assert Cutts's notability, anyhow... he's made out to be "one of many" people working in a certain area at a company... not everyone interviewed by BBC automatically qualifies. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 22:07, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I've already added the BBC interview to the article. As for the assertion that an interview with the BBC doesn't establish notability: I'm not sure what to say to that. What do you count as notability then? Its just fine for an AfD discussion to turn up valid new evidence for an article. That's why we don't just delete articles on sight. We're all here to build the best encyclopedia we can: if good information turns up in an AfD and allows us to improve rather than delete an article, then I call that a win. <a href="../../../g/w/e/User%7EGwernol_c4bf.html" title="User:Gwernol">Gwernol</a> 22:20, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Merely being interviewed, especially in the context of being a representative for the company you work for, doesn't make a person notable. <i>Doing</i> something noteworthy does. What has Cutts <i>done</i> that is noteworthy, other than do presentations at advertising industry events (yawn) and speak on behalf of Google on specific subjects? In what ways does he meet our <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> notability criteria? <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 22:34, 4 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Careful. We do keep <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_Hilton_9740.html" title="Paris Hilton">Paris Hilton</a> though she has "done" very little in her life.

<ul>
<li>Bad example. Paris Hilton is many times more notable than this guy, according to Wikipedia's notability guidelines -- she's a book author, movie actress, recording artist, and a notable cultural figure in New York City, not to mention that there are successful products named after her. What's Cutts got... a blog? He runs a team of a few people at a company of 10,000? He speaks at conferences? Shit, if that's all it takes, then we've got over a thousand Microsoft employees that need to be added! Like I stated, there is going to be a bias to keep this guy because he works for Google, and so "fans" of the company (who are quite numerous on Wikipedia) will conflate his importance in spite of his failing to pass <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;font-size:larger;font-family: Monotype Corsiva;"><a href="../../../w/a/r/User_talk%7EWarrens_9305.html" title="User talk:Warrens">-/-</a> <a href="../../../w/a/r/User%7EWarrens_af91.html" title="User:Warrens">Warren</a></span> 14:13, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This process allows for a consensus to determine whether notability is established/establishable for the article (which consensus is showing that it is). AfD discussions do not default to deletion. Furthermore, the existence of other poorly sourced articles does not connote this or any other article as untouchable if it does not meet the criteria required (nor does the deletion of an article connote that it can not be reintroduced...potentially as a much better incarnation). <a href="../../../j/u/6/User%7EJu66l3r_7fc0.html" title="User:Ju66l3r">ju66l3r</a> 06:01, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> -- previous discussion about blogs not notable / mainstream media is notable is misplaced. notability should NOT be based on the medium, rather based on readership / circulation figures. there are several notable blogs that have as much or greater readership than top 50-100 mainstream media sources, see <a href="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/11/161.html" class="external text" title="http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/11/161.html" rel="nofollow">Technorati State of the Blogosphere Oct 2006, Blogs vs Mainstream Media</a>. also one person's reference above to 'over a thousand folks here at Microsoft' reeks of bias. while i wouldn't disagree there are lots of potential Microsoft notables, this isn't a race. for anyone who spends any time at all in the search industry, Cutts is a very notable figure (as is Danny Sullivan and several others). the fact that <a href="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" class="external text" title="http://searchengineland.com/070108-170335.php" rel="nofollow">Sullivan weighs in on it and cites multiple references</a> in both blog &amp; mainstream media should end this discussion. and i agree, whomever is wasting our collective time with this question needs a reality check. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemc500hats_0c05.html" title="User:Davemc500hats">dave</a> 02:44, 9 January 2007 (UTC) <small>-- The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavemc500hats_0c05.html" title="User:Davemc500hats">Davemc500hats</a> (<a href="../../../d/a/v/User_talk%7EDavemc500hats_258b.html" title="User talk:Davemc500hats">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Davemc500hats_f6f6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Davemc500hats">contribs</a>) 02:39, 9 January 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<p>Regardless of the artists ability or intent, there is not enough notability to warrant an entry. There is no mention of this artist in peer assessed periodicals or journals, or any evidence that this artists has made a significant contribution the discipline and history of painting. The 'creation' of an anachronistic art movement that has no mention in contemporary discourses of art does not constitute a contribution. The art movement 'transpressionism' isn't mentioned or discussed in art circles, and only exists by virtue that Guity Novin has pronounced that it does. The article proper reads like a personal statement, rather than an article. The accomplishments of this artist (shows, commission) are no more than those of the thousands of working artists in her country, and not enough to warrant a wikipedia inclusion beside Anselm Kiefer, DaVinci, etc. Excuse me if I sound frustrated, but I have had to extricate Guity Novin from other articles. She somehow found her way into the History of Painting and the History of Contemporary Art, amongst other places. It seems like self promotion. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamiel_d2db.html" title="User:Thamiel">Thamiel</a></p>

<dd>Unfortunately, Novin's supporters seem to want to place her name and that of transpressionism in so many articles it borders on spam. Whatever Novin's merit as an artist, this only serves to cheapen her reputation. I've also been searching out ludicrous additions to other articles and it's annoying. As for Novin's notablity, I'm personally inclusionist enough to accept her article, but in radically edited version, which is mostly at this point original research with some pretty ridiculous claims. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 22:15, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wonder why this artist provokes such hostility, not only in the fanatically chauvinist-dominated countries but also in the countries that supposedly tolerate a thinking woman. The enthusiastic support of some of the artist's students cannot be used as weakness to attack the artist's notability. An artist who has been active for more than 40 years and is a quiet, thinking and creative individual. According to Wikipedia policies:</p>

<dd>As I've said, I'm willing to be inclusionist about the article in question, but what I am concerned about is a) the amount of original research in the article which needs to be edited; b) the spamming in countless articles by Novin's supporters; c) the personal attacks (including I would like to add, accusations of chauvinism and hostility) for merely attempting to edit articles; d) other aggressive actions by Novin's supporters such as attempts to delete my userpage; and finally, the actions of Novin's supporters serve only to diminish her reputation. If Novin is notable, fine. I'm willing to support an article on her, but let's not overstate her importance as a whole, which only, ironically, makes her seem <i>less</i> notable. In other words, her supporters' undoubtably genuine enthusiasm in fact makes her article seem like a vanity page.

<dd>Files with the National Gallery and and the Vancouver Art Gallery do not amount to peer assessed reviews or criticism, they are merely files (files amongst thousands). I found about the artist only because of vandalism to the History of Painting entry, and followed it to the artists wiki entry. There is no mention of transpressionism (a made-up movement that has not been discussed in any serious journal) in Parachute, Border Crossing, Art Forum, Canadian Art, Art in America, Modern Painters, etc.. Wiki does include "Painters, sculptors, architects, engineers, and other professionals whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who are likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field" but the work of this artist isn't widely recognized, and because there is absolutely no discussion of 'transpressionism' amongst critics and the intelligentsia, there is no reason to think that the work of this artist will be part of the enduring historical record. Occaisonal newspaper articles don't count as enough critical discourse to think otherwise. My problem is that is appears someone is trying to re-write art history, and include this artist and the movement she has made-up. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamiel_d2db.html" title="User:Thamiel">Thamiel</a></dd>

<dd>I am not judging the quality of the artists work, or making a personal attack. The artist isn't widely recognized, and the printed material isn't of a quantity or quality that makes one think that the artist and the work will be a part of the historical record. As for 'elites', if you mean the people who critically think and write about art, both past and present, and are recognized as authorities in their field, then who else writes the historical record? The artist isn't being evaluated in this instance, only their place in a historical continuum. We as individuals shouldn't decide our own importance, it is left to others, and if we aren't a major facet of art history, why should we be dissatisfied. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamiel_d2db.html" title="User:Thamiel">Thamiel</a></dd>

<dd>Thamiel, are you sure that you are not judging?!! Artists like Guity Novin like to taunt the "intelligentsia". This is what Cézanne did when he was in his late 20s. When he loved taunting the art world and its Salon exhibitions. He laughed at artists who were “widely recognized”. He once advised artists only to send their worst works to the Salon, and although other rebels occasionally managed to show there, he was always rejected. When he participated in the first impressionist exhibition it was the same - the “recognized authorities in their field” reserved their coarsest laughter for his work. The critic Roger Fry (a member of intelligentsia in the 1920s) wondered what might have become of Cézanne if his early paintings had been praised. To him the early works of Cézanne really were appalling; if they had been accepted, Cézanne would have painted more exaggerated scenes of sensuality and violence. Today, it's hard to be so trivializing of the young Cézanne - he is shocking and genius.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Similarly Novin has shown that she can only remain a successful painter, a powerful painter, so long as she refuses to historicize herself, so long as she refuses to let the others to decide for her of “her importance” as a moment in history. As soon as she becomes aware of “her own historicity”, she is unable to make the strong and unequivocal claims she must make in order to matter historically. That is why the undemocratic officialdom (the patrons of your Intelligentsia!) rejected her works and banished her to exile. She was denied her historicity, based on the kind of allegation that she shakes dull clichés of “historical continuum”. Yet she was praised by the kinds of late <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmad_Shamloo_d704.html" title="Ahmad Shamloo">Ahmad Shamloo</a> the poet laureate of Iran for “seeking the path to human renaissance” and her “optimism and conviction in the possibility of that renaissance”.

<dd>Time judged Cezanne and put him in the cannon of art history, he didn't judge himself. Similarily, if time judges Guity as being as important as Cezanne, I will not debate her inclusion. Scholars in consensus have deemed Cezanne important (not to mention the incredible pictorial breakthroughs he had and the many painters in many countries that were influenced by him). You can't rewrite history. Tranpressionism is a <a href="../../../p/a/s/Pastiche.html" title="Pastiche">pastiche</a> of former styles, in an age where manifestos are no longer relevant. Nothing new there. I doubt it will stand the test of time. If a few supporters and Guity herself decide that her work is historically important, it does not make it so. If you choose to villify scholars, then throw away your art books, and your knowledge of what has past, because everything you know about any art outside your own is predicated on them. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThamiel_d2db.html" title="User:Thamiel">Thamiel</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/a/User_talk%7EThamiel_b2e7.html" title="User talk:Thamiel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thamiel_751f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thamiel">contribs</a>) 03:47, 5 January 2007 (UTC).</small></dd>

"!!! And if Roger Fry was wrong about the young Cézanne, is it we, who "villify scholars", or his own closed-mindedness? You persistently claim that Guity's supporters are trying to rewrite the history. I wonder if that "writen history" is a closed book of taboos that should never be questioned? No my friend everything I know is not predicated on some old text books of art written by a growing number of talented, hungry, and frustrated young scholars, desperately seeking a tenure track. I go to exhibitions and listen to the young artists and through them I discover the energy and the creativity of the old-masters like Cezanne. Cheers!</dd>

<p>I think we are all getting carried away and talking in circles. This isn't a discussion page for anything but the nomination at hand. We need to vote on the merits of the proposal and be succinct, and not take things personally (and I include myself here as well!). <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 15:27, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b> I feel strongly about the abuse to numerous articles by supporters of Novin--the insertion of "transpressionism" in countless pages and lists. However, doing a quick search of Novin indicates she is a painter of some note. I am not convinced of the importance of transpressionism, and I feel that the Novin article needs to be edited as per NPOV policies, and by disinterested contributors (i.e. not Novin's supporters, and probably not by the two or three of us who have been editing so far. Things are too touchy right now for that). As for her some of the cites of importance, I agree that a file at the National Gallery is next-to-meaningless. I'm on file there too, and although it's cool to see my name on file, it doesn't mean much. But some of the other sources check out and I think an edited version of the main article should stay. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreshacconci_f743.html" title="User:Freshacconci">Freshacconci</a> 15:34, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b> Nothing can be farther from truth than the allegation of |self-promotion. It is ironic that in a democratic forum such as this an attempt is being made to wipe out the name of a truly authentic artist by such cheap shots. Of course, I have no doubt that some of the concerns raised by Freashacconci are genuine and valid. But I wonder on whose behalf those who incite a backlash against the artist are acting.</li>

<dd>In fact, she has been quite reluctant to give us permission to include a number of important documents about her artistic achievements. We have insisted on this minimum, because it is important for us to lionize her courage and her convictions. Despite a concerted attempt by her native art officialdom to silent her historical role many underground art periodicals and university students¡Ç websites glorify her contributions (just Google to find out).<a href="../../../1/4/0/User%7E140.80.199.91.html" title="User:140.80.199.91">140.80.199.91</a> 18:33, 5 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Her painting are nice and well executed, but unfortunately she just isn't important or well known enough to warrant this entry, and vandalism to art history pages and personal myth-making aside, she isn't a part of the historical record.

<li>Such self-righteous intolerance is rampant among the art administrators of small towns. Censorship is not only a bad rap for those who are censored: the artist. It is also a bad rap for the rest of us, in the sense that genuine conflicts of views on art are never had out and thus never resolved. Anyhow, I checked the artist web-site( guitynovin.com) on the article tab, you can find in the resume section. At the end of her resume there is a record of various Solo and group exhibitions by the artist. e.g., for artist-run-centres: she participated in 2004 show "Body and Soul" in Ferry Building Gallery in West Vancouver ( Google to verify). In 2001 she had a solo exhibition at Place des Art at Coquitlam entitled “ And Indeed There Will be Time; MY BC perid”. For well recognized commercial galleries, in 1998 and 2001 she exhibited at Guthenham Gallery "Rhapsody on a windy night" and "painting shadows over imaginary lines" in the Granville Island of Vancouver. (you can verify by calling the admin of GI). In 1996 she exhibited at Cumberland Town Hall "l'importance c'est la rose". And the list goes back to 1968. Tobiasforart</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Please note that since the above comments I have drastically edited the article. I agree with and endorse all of Freshacconci's points above. I also recognise that Thamiel presents a coherent case. My keep vote! is based on the article not returning to its former state. Also Guity Novin and Transpressionism should not be inserted in other articles boosting her status above what is merited. She is not a major artist. I do consider, however, that she is of sufficient achievement to merit inclusion. There are plenty of bands included, for example, who are not The Beatles. <a href="../../../t/y/r/User%7ETyrenius_ce89.html" title="User:Tyrenius">Tyrenius</a> 03:07, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Probably true. In that case, you'd probably have to use one of the following criteria:
<ul>
<li>The person has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person</li>
<li>The person made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in their specific field.</li>
<li>Widely recognized entertainment personalities and opinion makers (e.g., - Hollywood Walk of Fame)</li>
<li>Notable actors and television personalities who have appeared in well-known films or television productions.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>There's no obvious claim to any of those things in the article. The strongest claims are probably in the following sentances "He won the PCW Heavyweight Championship after defeating Wog Warrior in May 2005 at PCW's most important show, Carnage. He is currently a trainer at the PCW Wrestling School." Is the PCW heavyweight championship especially important? No idea. Or does his role as a trainer mean he is a significant player in the development of wrestling in Australia? Again, no idea. He doesn't seem to be mentioned in <a href="../../../p/r/o/Professional_wrestling_in_Australia_b7ec.html" title="Professional wrestling in Australia">Professional wrestling in Australia</a>, if that says anything. So on balance, I'm leaning towards delete without predjudice, more on the grounds of lack of evidence of notability than anything else.

<p>Trademark means something in action and protected, and "poli" is that. To smell'I'm italian by technical devices pointing me as italian is a task really useless, to be honest I'm partly austrian and partly moldavian by the side of relatives, but I was born and live in the country called Italy, and I didn't curse about it neither I want to disclaim this evidence. About the good or bad english I pretend you to let go, since it's not always properly, the way you use your language, go figure other ones. Study and try to get more isn't in your reach? Honestly my knowledge is really low, compared with the unlimited world around us, so I shoudn't criticize, but all along my life I tried to improve. I hope, this be told without any aggressive content (there's too much aggressive stage lately).</p>
<p>"Non notable" means what? Something not still deployed worldwide but that has the wings to do so (that's not notable) or something that spread around distress nurtured by money and so called "notability" and is that way "notable"? Yes, under the general employment side, this is absolutely due and notable. Under the world we may (and I suppose, must) build up, this is a side notable effect. Under the employment side it will be effective as soon as the wings will be open. Franco Cumpeta</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> A readily available episode of a show is a primary source and acceptable as a source on wikipedia. Interpreting the information from those sources often constitutes original research but not always. Its original research of the conclusion drawn from that material favours a particular point of view, but there is nothing point of view for example about "Character A had name X in episode 1 and it was changed to name Y in every subsequent appearance". As far as cruft go, I do agree that wikipedia does delve into minutia on fictional topics more than it should, however consistency issues are something that are often discussed, especially in popular works of fiction. A merge suggestion would have been more apt here than a deletion, and could have been handled much more quickly. A mention in a parent article that there have been some issues of inconsistency in the series with a couple of notable and verifiable examples. There are only a small number of items on this list that I would actually consider to be OR (as I detailed on the talk page) with the rest being obvious which do not require interpretation on the part of the editor or reader. I don't think all examples need to be merged, just a couple. We don't need to add a long list or section to any parent article.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:31, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Disagree with a merge, it would just move the OR to another article (or sets of articles). How would this merge be accomplished, without violating <a href="../../../g/f/d/GFDL_75b9.html" title="GFDL">GFDL</a>, anyway? <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 16:44, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The same way any of the thousands of other merges that take place on wikipedia are done? You've been here for years now, I'm sure you've seen information merged from one article to another more than once. That is why we have the {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergeto_cea0.html" title="Template:Mergeto">mergeto</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../m/e/r/Template%7EMergefrom_0c79.html" title="Template:Mergefrom">mergefrom</a>}} templates. The main gilmore girls article could make mention that there are inconsistencies in the show and make note of a couple of examples. As I stated, only a handful of the actual inconsistencies are actually OR, some do not satisfy the criteria to be considered OR, those are the ones the examples should be drawn from.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:54, 5 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are talking about merging information from one article into several different articles, which would lose the edit history. I don't appreciate the snide dig, by the way. And <i><b>every single one</b></i> of the inconsistancies is OR, unless multiple <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> have documented it. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 18:59, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Yes, and a television episode is a reliable primary source for information contained within it which is the basis of these inconsistencies. Any inconsistency which does not require interpretation is not original research. And nowhere in that section does it say that it requires multiple sources. The sources are given in the article itself for each inconsistency as it labels the episode from where the inconsistency originates. Episodes are available for independent checking for rent, purchase or in syndication. Nowhere in here have I said that we should have an article on this topic, only that a mention should be made in the parent main article for the series. <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> clearly allows for descriptive comments to be made about a subject based on primary sources so long as no interpretation of those facts is made.

<li>It is your opinion that a television episode is satisfactory source material, but <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> cals this a primary source and deprecates it. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 22:11, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I've never claimed it is anything BUT a primary source. I've also shown you where in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> that it allows for material to be drawn from primary sources and the conditions under which it can be used and how it can be written about. While they don't need an article of their own, some of the material is written within the confines of all the polices and guidelines. In fact <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> clearly states <b>Thus, primary materials typically require interpretation, interpolation, extrapolation, or corroboration, each of which usually constitutes original research. Wikipedia articles may use primary sources, so long as they have been published by a reliable source, but only to make descriptive points about the topic. Any interpretive claims require secondary sources.</b> There are inconsistencies which are not making interpretive claims and therefore don't require secondary sources. The current network that the show airs on and the publishing company responsible for distributing the seasons on DVD are more than reliable sources.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 22:18, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sure you can use a show as a reference (e.g. "in this show, character A said B"), but any analysis or criticism about the reference is still OR.

<li>It is true that the info is in articles already but this brings up an interesting issue about information organization. Sometimes one would like to gather certain pieces into one place. The ability of Wiki to be more than just an electronic version of a paper encyclopedia should be used. Not sure though how that could be implemented in this case. This is a case of a user trying to use Wiki to bring together existing wiki info in a different organizational format to better suit their needs and possibly the needs of a larger group. I think this might be a bigger issue that needs to be discussed before we go on just deleting it. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.230.145.243 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.230.145.243_ad20.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.230.145.243">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> How is the Big Bang related? Well, there is a page that lays out the timeline. How is it arbitary? Well, it is subject to individual judgement. For example, I don't believe it.

<p>Also nominated is John Burnet Hall. Per precedents, University halls of residence are not usually considered notable (as a default), and these do not seem to be any exception. In fact, these are poor stubs with feeble, if any, assertion of notability. So I beg to move: <b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 05:42, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> - could create one good article from all the information in the several scattered articles we have on halls at the University of St Andrews.

<li><b>Keep</b> Halls of residence have been organised into the category University of St Andrews halls of residence. This seems to be the normal approach for posting halls of residences for British Universities on Wikipedia (for example: University of Bristol Halls of Residence, University of Manchester halls of residence, University of Reading halls of residence, etc.) --John345er 01:23, 6 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> While a category would indeed be useful for large universities such as Manchester, with a student body six times larger than St Andrews, one well sectioned article would be preferable, and cumulative notability could be gleaned, at least to me, than six to ten stubs with limited notability. Of course things could still be linked with anchors to each heading. <a href="../../../m/0/r/User%7EM0RHI_862a.html" title="User:M0RHI">M0RHI</a> | <a href="../../../m/0/r/User_talk%7EM0RHI_5942.html" title="User talk:M0RHI">Talk to me</a> 03:20, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: please don't confuse notability of the subject with organisational structure within Wikipedia. This hall is a pretty bog standard hall which few outside the University will have heard of or would ever want to find out about. Unless anyone can find <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> attesting to its importance, it should be deleted. Putting several non-notable subjects together into one merged article does not make the article encyclopaedically, nor the multiple subjects any more notable. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 03:39, 8 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> no indication, or even hint, of notability. Merging will create one large article instead of many smaller, but that is still going to be non notable. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 16:14, 7 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
