<p>This article has been created approximately 12 different times, and deleted each time. The earliest delete seems to have been in April. The article appears to me to be autobiographical, as the author at one point signed his name "HINES" on a talk page - however, I have asked him if he is Brad Hines, and he has neither confirmed nor denied it. The links the author gives do not seem to support notabilty. (He was quoted in one line of a story in USA Today, but the article was not about him. The other links are, I believe, mainly about the industry he is in rather than the person himself). An independent search also has not turned up anything notable about this person, and it's my belief that he is therefore not notable. Please let me know if you have any comments or questions. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 01:20, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am the author of this page, and I am not Brad Hines, I work within Yum Domains. When I signed "Hines" it was a joke as you had implied I was in the previous posting. That article in the USA Today was written in the first place because Brad Hines suggested it. You can call up Jon Schwartz the editor at the USA Today and verify this.</p>
<p>The other thing to consider is the fact that as time goes on this entry will only become more valid as Mr. Hines gains credibility (although he is already noteworthy per his age, accomplisments, and press credits that back these up). I blanked the page to start over as I had screwed up my HTML. Also please note I am new to wikipedia.</p>
<p>Please check the entries for both <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mark_Zuckerberg_9e76.html" title="Mark Zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> and <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bob_Parsons_432c.html" title="Bob Parsons">Bob Parsons</a>. Anyone can see both these entries are very similar. There is little information on the domain industry on wikipedia. It's people like me that will build this and change it, please help me work together with you folks to make it solid information.</p>
<p>What does it matter if Googling "Brad Hines entreprenuer" turns in little results. That's ridiculous. Try Googling "Brad Hines Domains" A QUARTER MILLION come up.</p>

<dd>Ok, I'll take your word on that - but a friend of Brad Hines is only marginally better. The argument that the person "will be notable eventually" is made pretty often. However, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>, it reports those people who are currently notable - not those who think they will be.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Mark Zuckerberg and Bob Parsons work in the same industry as Brad Hines, but that does not make <b>him</b> notable. I work in the same industry as Antonin Scalia and Eliot Spitzer - but am nonetheless non-notable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>(added paragraph:) About the Google hits. I only get about 250. I haven't studied them, but it looks like at least half are about someone else (someone at Lockheed). So 125 hits isn't a lot - I probably have about 50 pages with my name on them, and I'm not actively promoting a business and starting websites that include my name. (end of added paragraph).</dd>

<dd>You mentioned that you are new to Wikipedia, and I am glad you're here. Although I don't think this article should be included, I nonetheless hope you'll continue to contribute on other ones. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 02:55, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Here is the thing though, the analogy about Zuckerberg or Parsons had nothing to do with industry, I could have chosen Dan Galambous instead for example. It was about the magnitude. All Three are Presidents of their company. Niether zuckerberg nor parsons have donanted an Art club to a university either. In fact, based on what you have told me, zuckerberg's entry ought to be removed. It seems to mostly dicuss his personal life.</p>

<dd>At the risk of selective quoting (which I don't mean to do), Utzchips and I have been continuing a conversation on his talk page (which is not strictly the right way to go about it, but I wanted to feel him out on this issue a bit without clogging up the AfD). Here are a few things I've learned:</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li>Brad Hines is about to start managing a rap artist.</li>
<li>Hines has an apparently self-published book about how you can get rich buying and selling cars. www.autoprofitz.com.</li>
<li>Hines has donated to an art museum.</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>None of those things necessarily militates one way or the other, and I encourage you to read the full talk page for context if you're interested. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:06, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Hines donated A virtual museum, not to a museum. He currently manages lenny P and is a rapper himself (montrealbrad.com). Thats not as interesting as his position with yum domains however.--<a href="../../../u/t/z/User%7EUtzchips_72b8.html" title="User:Utzchips">Utzchips</a> 04:31, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Argh. Now we've got two apparently brand new users with no user pages or discussion pages arguing to keep within 10 minutes of each other. I don't know how to check this out, and I don't mean to toss this accusation around lightly, but they look like sock puppets to me.

<li><b>Keep</b>, among domainers, Brad Hines is really well known, even if he's not universally famous. I think the press he's gotten verifies this. '"BradHines" domains' gets 264 hits. I remember when the old rule was "if it matters to 1000 people, its notable for wikipedia." Consdering the ever-growing size of the domain community and the attendence of the conventions these days, I think that Brad Hines surely meets this threshold, especially as the President of Yum Domains. <a href="../../../i/v/y/User%7EIvymike21_1400.html" title="User:Ivymike21">Ivymike21</a> 03:05, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Okay then. I should really go create an article about my crush. She's popular, so I'm quite sure at least 1000 of the people at my school would care. Do you honestly think that means she is notable enough for an article? And as for your 264 google hits, that at LEAST picks up every single Brad Hines mentioned on the Internet. And I can imagine the search terms not being in quotes, this giving you results from every page that mentions ANYONE with first name Brad along with ANYONE with last name Hines. -<a href="../../../a/m/a/User%7EAmarkov_3e91.html" title="User:Amarkov">Amarkov</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/m/a/User_talk%7EAmarkov_2ad4.html" title="User talk:Amarkov">babble</a></sup> 03:28, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>, salt, and block user if he won't stop recreating an article. This is a conflict of interest, the subject is non-notable except to a tiny group of people (and aren't most of us notable in some way to some group of people?) and the writer is using Wikipedia as an advertisement and promotion. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlene.fic_2ff8.html" title="User:Charlene.fic"><font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Charlene</font></a> 03:45, 2 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I usually hate it when, when someone voices an opinion against the majority, people start asking "why are you voting that way?" (Because that's their opinion...) But I'm going to break my own rule to pose a question - if someone who was in Hurricane Katrina is quoted on the front page of USA Today commenting on the hurricane, are <b>they</b> therefore notable? Similarly, if a little-league team wins the Little League World Series, and one of its players is quoted in the New York Times, is that little-leaguer notable? I'm just not sure that saying that "a quote is enough" wouldn't open up the gates to anyone and everyone - there are hundreds of news stories every day, and most of them quote at least a person or two. Or is there something about this particular quote that makes you think it is different/sufficient? I'm in no way saying that your position is "wrong" - only that I'm not sure I understand it yet. (Oh, and I don't think JChap meant offense by reformatting your comment - he was just trying to make it easier to read.) Thanks.--<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 02:18, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Re: your examples -- is the Katrina victim's job to be a professional hurricane victim? Is it the Little Leaguer's profession to be a Little League player? A quote is enough in this context since it is directly from the man's profession and area of expertise. I took no offense at being reformatted, but made mention to discourage others from doing the same. I think bolding the lead word puts too much emphasis on it as if a vote, rather than a brief summary of my discussion points. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 03:23, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Those are fair points. But then the requirement is that the person is quoted for saying something in connection with his job and expertise? What about an attorney that is asked to comment on a murder case? It's clearly his job to be a lawyer and know the law, but he could just be some yahoo attorney the reporter happened to know. Would the comment in an article make him notable, if he'd not otherwise ever done anything notable? (I'm taking you down this road, because it's suddenly looking like <b>I</b> might be notable.&#160;:-P) If so, what is he notable <b>for</b>? He's not a notable lawyer, so he could only be notable as "that guy that said that thing that day." But that can't be enough, can it? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 04:40, 4 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, absolutely right. If Brad Hines gets to keep his article, then we are <i>all</i> obligated to write our own articles, for we are by all means notable by virtue of participating in this discussion.

<dd>There is no slippery slope. Put the nail where you like it. I will do the same. Notability is NOT policy for very good reasons. I think someone quoted in their area of expertise in the national newspaper is notable enough.
