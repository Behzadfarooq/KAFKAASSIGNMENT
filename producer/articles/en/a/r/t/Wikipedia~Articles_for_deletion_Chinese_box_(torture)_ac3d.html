<dd>Well George Mason's book is there because I put it there. His book does not refer to this alleged form of torture at all. The British Library does not hold the Sair book which suggests to me that Amazon is wrong and it does not exist.

<dd>I have asked and no one has been able to verify it. Sair is not a China scholar so even if the book existed it would only prove that in 1944 people wrote dumb things about China.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Charliez 09:04, 16 August 2005 (UTC). Articles that cannot be verified in any way, doesn't belong in an encyclopaedia. To add insult to injury it's written in a manner that is completely unscientific. Remove it but by all means let someone write a completely new article at a later point, should they somehow manage to verify these claims. As anyone with even a minor interest in the logic of philosophy would know, it's in fact not possible to prove that something doesn't exist. Unless articles like this are deleted, Wikipedia will slowly be filled with undocumented claims and nonsense.</li>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> maybe. As far as I know, a chinese box is a box within a box, within a box, etc. It's also an expression and a famous thought experiment. In terms of the torture device, it does seem like something that would be written about in the 19th century, when China and the far east were "exotic" and any tale of bizarre torture would please 19th century audiences, whether they are true or not. Both cited sources are real. Thus, if the article were written in terms of how this 19th century term for a torture device came about, etc., then I say keep the article. The device is obviously an exaggeration, but there may be something to the myth which might be worth preserving. Of course the article as such does none of this. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 01:57, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>There is a disambiguation page that provides links to the box-within-a-box and to the famous thought experiment (and to a film as well). There is no need for another one. At least one cited source is real, but as I said, it does not mention this device (which suggests it is not true). The other one is more elusive. As I said above "Sair is not a China scholar so even if the book existed it would only prove that in 1944 people wrote dumb things about China. If it were real a real scholar would have mentioned it. They do not." What is worth preserving and where is the evidence for it? <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 11:10, 19 August 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Granted, but even if this Sair fellow is not a Chinese scholar, he might have used reliable sources in his book. I think someone, preferably the original editor of the article, should produce a more specific citation of the Sair book, or check which original sources he used before we discredit the whole thing. That being said, it sounds like this article is more of a myth than a hoax, and from that angle, the myth of the so-called Chinese box can be written about. I think we should at least give the editor the benefit of the doubt. I agree, in 1944 people probably wrote dumb things about China (and about a bunch of other things), but dumb things usually have a source in the collective unconscious of the time and reflect interesting cultural trends. This is why myths are worth preserving, so we can understand how our thinking has evolved over time and why we see things the way we do. <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 14:15, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>One more thing, there is a book in print called "The instruments of torture" by Michael Kerrigan which lists in it's index under China:death by insects. I wonder if anybody has access to this book if this mentions anything about a box?? <a href="../../../n/r/e/User%7ENrets_9478.html" title="User:Nrets">Nrets</a> 14:26, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Been there, read that. Not a bad book really. I guess Jane Austen got a little too boring for him. It refers to <i>one</i> case in modern China in which a man was allegedly chained up outside where the mosquitos bit him. And another few cases from the rest of the world. As far as myths go I am happy enough with moving the page to Sexual Fetishism or the like. It seems more appropriate and as long as it is rewritten that way. But it would probably be best to delete it and add some stuff to the pages that exist already. <a href="../../../l/a/o/User%7ELao_Wai_79b4.html" title="User:Lao Wai">Lao Wai</a> 13:16, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>
