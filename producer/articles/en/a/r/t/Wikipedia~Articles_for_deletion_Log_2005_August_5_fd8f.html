Hetep and Respect Bgeer and Good Spirits</p>
<p>Thanks for you interest in this article and your advise and council. I just came back from rewriting the cultural poisoning article (I hope you can find time to take a look). I have read all your comments and reread what I wrote and I am shocked.</p>
<p>My bad, as the young people say. I made a number of errors contextual and otherwise. If I had to vote again (I know I can't do that) I would "vote keep but rewrite" myself. Give me a minute to get my rewrite pen out and fix some of the errors you have pointed out.</p>
<p>I wrote this early version of the article when I first came to wikipedia. I am up here, on and off, for less then two weeks. Most of my time has been spent learning wiki and the rules. I think I am starting to get the hang of it and would like to thank everyone for your help.</p>

Since all these terms must be related from this article's perspective, I am concerned that the usages here may well be original research. Further, looking through the Google hits, at least some of them are from non-authoritative web fora and in some cases links to the apparently personal site(s) of the author. Looking through the first few pages of Google hits, and judging by their summaries, I found <a href="http://odeo.com/channel/4359/view" class="external text" title="http://odeo.com/channel/4359/view" rel="nofollow">this</a> which is unconvincing. By way of reference to Cultural poisoning, listed below, Amazon has <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0595228585/ref=cm_bg_f_3/002-0584482-9823204?v=glance" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0595228585/ref=cm_bg_f_3/002-0584482-9823204?v=glance" rel="nofollow">this</a> which is, as the nominator implies, by Aunk. The question is then, does an article about an author's theory qualify as <i>original</i> research when the same author has a published text containing that theory? It is published by <i>"Writers Club Press"</i>, which "publishes on demand" <a href="http://www.writecontent.com/Publishing_Tools/Publishing_Links/Publishing_Links2/publishing_links2.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.writecontent.com/Publishing_Tools/Publishing_Links/Publishing_Links2/publishing_links2.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> so in this case, there is no independent publication. By way of defence, I see some references at the bottom of the article. <i>However</i>, and this is important, they are not referenced in the text and carry little weight with me as a result since they are not used to support the text. The "See Also" section can be as long as it likes, without mitigating original research. All of which leads me to a delete. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 01:15, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. The author's view is very un-encyclopediac, but the term "Cultural health" is an accepted one in modern Human Geography studies.

However, I can't see that there is anything here that wouldn't have to be completely re-written. Alternatively, it could be pared down to a tiny stub, and re-written from that. So I'll put "heavy cleanup" as a secondary vote if some sort of consensus needs to be made. --<a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcelight_76ef.html" title="User:Icelight">Icelight</a> 16:53, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, The phrase cultural health is not something new. Putting it in google gets 45,000,000 hits. Millions of people in America are talking about this topic. The article stub needs work to be encyclopedic but the topic is encyclopedic. Someone from the Asian American community at some point in time, will reflect their communities understanding of cultural health. The medical community will do the same. This is a big discussion with many "experts" and the article will grow.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. From the discussion above, it is clear that this subject has the potential to have a good, unbiased, article written about it, but the current article is so not that article. I suppose you could do a massive cleanup on it, but that would probably amount to a complete re-write. Might as well just nuke it now, and if somebody wants to write the real article, they can go ahead and do that at some point in the future.

<p>This article is a neologism describing user Aunk's original research. User has not provided evidence that anyone other than him/herself uses this term. <a href="../../../b/g/e/User%7EBgeer_b6e6.html" title="User:Bgeer">Bgeer</a> 00:23, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Hetep and Respect Bgeer</li>
</ul>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>Bgeer in his Vfd said:</b>"…This article is a neologism describing user Aunk's original research. User has not provided evidence that anyone other than him/herself uses this term…"</p>
<p><b>There are three claims</b> in Bgeer's two-sentence comment.</p>
<p>1. Cultural Poisoning is a <b>neologism</b></p>
<p>2. The article describes Aunk's <b>original research</b></p>
<p>3. Aunk has <b>not provided evidence</b> that some one other then he, uses the term</p>
<p>First let me say I appreciate Bgeer's interest in cultural literacy. For those who do not know Hetep (sometimes pronounced Hotep, means peace). Bgeer I think you jumped the gun. I was having a similar discussion on the discussion page with individuals interested in the article. I am new but was getting ready to make adjustments to the stub. But let me respond directly to your concerns.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b>1. Cultural Poisoning is a neologism</b></p>
<p>This is a debatable assertion. See info from wiki below. The difference between debatable and deleteable is considerable. "…When a word or phrase is no longer "new," it is no longer a neologism…. Opinions differ on exactly how old a word must be to no longer be considered a neologism; <b>cultural acceptance probably plays a more important role than time</b> in this regard…" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism" rel="nofollow">[2]</a></p>
<p><b>Cultural acceptance is important</b>. This phrase is accepted in the African American community. I have not run across an African American in cyberspace or on the ground that asserts cultural poisoning does not exist in the African American community. In addition many other ethnic groups use this phrase as a google test verifies. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cultural+poisoning+-aunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cultural+poisoning+-aunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[3]</a></p>
<p>"Yesterday's neologisms, like yesterday's jargon, are often today's essential vocabulary." – Academic Instincts, 2001[1]</p>
<p>The phrase cultural poisoning is <b>essential vocabulary</b> in the cultural literacy discussion of today. See quote from wikipedian below.</p>
<p>"…used frequently in the cultural literacy cult, I've also seen it in Eastern journalism decrying the poisoning of their culture by Western influences…" user: Jareth.:. see his vote and comment below:.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2. The article describes Aunk's original research</b></p>
<p><br />
The article has been <b>rewritten as source-based research</b>. See wiki policy below.</p>
<p>"…Original research that creates primary sources is not allowed. However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged. In fact, all articles on Wikipedia should be based on information collected from primary and secondary sources. This is not "original research," it is "source-based research," and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia…"</p>
<p>All information listed under <b>references</b> , in the article comply with following wiki policy.</p>
<p>"… it is essential that any primary-source material used in an article has been published or otherwise made available to people who do not rely on Wikipedia…"</p>
<p><br />
<b>The other reason that "original research" should not apply</b> to this article is as follows.</p>
<p><b>Aunk is writing as and expert</b> on the terms Cultural Health, Cultural literacy and cultural poisoning as they related to the African American community. See the applicable wiki rule below.</p>
<p>"…No original research" does not mean that experts on a specific topic cannot contribute to Wikipedia. Indeed, Wikipedia welcomes experts and academics. However, such experts do not occupy a privileged position within Wikipedia. They should refer to themselves and their publications in the third person and write from a neutral point of view (NPOV)…"</p>
<p><b>3. Aunk has not provided evidence that some one other then he, uses the term</b></p>
<p>See google test <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cultural+poisoning+-aunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=cultural+poisoning+-aunk+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;as_qdr=all&amp;start=20&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> cultural poisoning -aunk -wikipedia 500,000 googles</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Looking at <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">infantilism</a>, it looks like a rather dry exposition of something from <a href="../../../d/s/m/DSM_IV_2543.html" title="DSM IV">DSM IV</a>. Well, we're all grown-ups here, we all know it's fun to dress up and play-act, especially with someone we love. The adult baby thing seems to be a description of the fun side. It isn't something that interests me but I can't see any problem with dressing up in diapers and getting changed--I'd do it for someone I love. Equating the infantilism article to this article seems a bit like saying we ought to redirect <a href="../../../h/o/m/Homosexuality.html" title="Homosexuality">homosexuality</a> to <a href="../../../b/u/g/Buggery.html" title="Buggery">buggery</a>, or even <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a>.

<li>Ummm... yeah. This appears to be an attempt to characterize this nomination for VfD as a value judgement.

<li>Absolutely not. I'm only saying that merging the <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantilism.html" title="Infantilism">infantilism</a> article with the <a href="../../../a/d/u/Adult_Baby_c81d.html" title="Adult Baby">Adult Baby</a> article would be a loss. I have absolutely no idea why you want to delete Adult Baby in the first place--as I said, you only need to edit it to point at whatever you want it to. Honestly why do you describe my comments as "wild rhetoric"? --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 00:43, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Are we to remove references to all minorities, and post only discussions of the majority? Yes, the Adult Baby community is small. So what? There are other communities which are small, but we wouldn't dream of eliminating records of them. And if there is a single party that has chosen to attempt to eliminate all such references to anyone minority, whether that is a sexual, racial, religious, national or whatever other variety of minority, then the motives of such a person should be called into question. Why are attack of such vehemence so frequently applied to this one group? Would the person in question please answer as to what is driving these repeated attacks against even the mere mention of the existence of this minority? <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavy_Blue_c6f5.html" title="User:Davy Blue">Dave</a> 01:53, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Umm... again, yeah. First putting this on VfD is like saying sex is rape, now I'm some sort of crypto-puritan?

<li>It would be easy to assume this wasn't personal. If it weren't originating with just one person. Sure, let's talk about the article as a description of a minority in a cultural context.

<p>"Sacred Heart School" gets ~85,000 google hits. It's gonna take an amazing disambiguation page to straighten them all out some day. Not notable. <b>Delete.</b> Or at least rename to something more specific.

<li><b>Delete or speedy delete</b>: It's a perfect criterion #1 speedy delete, in my opinion, as a predicate nominative is not an article. At present, this is an answer, a Yellow Pages entry. Further, the article is wildly misnamed. Further, there is nothing here to explain what is unique (other than the address) about it. All the school harpists can go back to sleep, since I know none will actually do some work to affect the improvement, and save your energies for an actual <i>article</i> on a school listed on VfD. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 18:52, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>Geogre, poppet-me-pet, could you please indulge me? HOw could an article called Sacred Heart School, written about a school called coincidentally Sacred Heart School, possibly be described as "wildly misnamed"? What name would satisfy you? Wild Hogmistress of the Deeps of the Western Frond Marshes? I'm sorry but I cannot imagine an occasion on which I would regard "Sacred Heart School" as an inappropriate name for an article about a school of that name--I hope you're not joining those advancing lack of disambiguation as a reason for deletion of an article.</li>
<li>And then there the other falsehoods you pile on this. You tell us that the article is "a Yellow Pages entry". Well so what? You claim that it's a CSD 1, no it isn't. "No meaningful content or history, text completely meaningless or unsalvageably incoherent (e.g., random characters)". The article is an excellent stub because it's useful, it informs someone who didn't know (I didn't) that there exists a school in Halifax, Nova Scotia, called The Sacred Heart, it's a mixed sex, multiple-age school and the current Canadian leader of the Sacred Heart Society is an alumna. This is not a CSD1 and the fact that you blatantly assert falsehoods in proposing its deletion does not help the case. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 23:13, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>One has to wonder why you so desperately wish to obscure the anchor tag however. It makes it appear that you wish for someone to read your rationale and, not clicking the link, believe that <a href="../../../s/c/h/Wikipedia%7ESchools_Arguments_66b9.html" title="Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments">Wikipedia:Schools/Arguments</a> shows why this school should be deleted, when, in fact, it shows both sides of the argument. Surely, that is not what you intend but it is how it appears. I agree, btw, that those in favour should anchor their link as well. Perhaps the arguments page should be split into 2 sub-pages. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 15:58, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>I don't think it would be a good idea to split up the arguments just because Aaron is engaging in abusive and dishonest editing. Let's leave him to it and refuse to let his disgraceful behavior influence the disposition of the page, which is currently perfectly fine. If someone were to transform the headings into unanchored bolds, however, I would not oppose this. This would cause all links to go to the page, in the absence of "#Keep" and "#Delete" anchors. Aaron was not the first person to engage in abusive linking to that page. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:33, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>speedy keep, I wrote the biography, posted it on the website and hold the exclusive right to use it. There is no copyright violation here. By posting the biography on this page I authorized it's use on this page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hi, 68.161.66.112 (again.) First of all, there is no such thing as "speedy keep." Secondly, please sign your remarks by putting 4 ~s afterwards. Thirdly, you claim that this is a "high-profile race" in Westchester. The only mention of "Cass Cibelli" that I could find in the news was a two sentence, second-paragraph mention in an online-only newspaper <a href="http://www.whiteplainscnr.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3611" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.whiteplainscnr.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3611" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. Finally, if you are the person who wrote the promotional biography on Cibelli's website, then it is inappropriate for you to copy and paste this to create the page on Wikipedia. (The content you posted, whether you own it or not, is not "neutral" ("NPOV" in the parlance.) It is inappropriate for an encyclopedia article. If the article is not deleted, that content will be, by me or someone else.) 128.112.24.137 05:41, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: We already have a process for resolving copyvio. VfD is not it.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. The argument for VfD is that the person is not-notable. There is an additional copyvio issue, which in part arises from the fact that the subject is sufficiently non-notable that there is no other source of information on him. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 23:34, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This page is an archive of the proposed deletion of the article below. Further comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or on a Votes for Undeletion nomination). No further edits should be made to this page.</p>
<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b> (no consensus). This one is very difficult, because there are a number of votes from users with very low edit counts. In particular the nomination is by an anonymous user, and the two last keep votes are both from users whos' votes are among their earliest edits. Nonetheless, all these users appear to have been making legitimate edits as well, and all were created before this VFD started. Because of this, and also with the "when in doubt, don't delete"-rule in mind, I will accept all the votes. The main concern here has been verifiability, I will therefore add a {{verify}}-tag on the article. <i>If no verification is provided, the article may well be listed on VFD again in the near future.</i> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 07:44, 16 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>probable hoax; google returns only a few mentions (less than a page) all of which are dubious touristic sites. 128.112.24.137 03:40, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Twisting the Cow is not a hoax. I actually first read about it in a reliable, factual, book which I trust (Bloody Scotland, Horrible Histories series). In fact, I think most of the webpages are almost directly plagiaristic copies of the book. Hey, it's not my fault the Scots like such strange things (haggis)&#160;;)&#160;! If you don't believe the book, I guess the only way to prove it not a hoax is to find the results from the Invergarry Games of 1820. I also just realized that I need to change it from "Twisting the Cow" to "Twisting the cow". How do I rename a wikipedia page?<a href="../../../c/o/n/User%7EConfusius_9428.html" title="User:Confusius">Confusius</a> 03:44, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

See <a href="http://www.clyde-valley.com/glasgow/scotland.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.clyde-valley.com/glasgow/scotland.htm" rel="nofollow">[14]</a>.

<dd>Well... okaaay. Your HTML reference also refers as its source back to the same book that Confusius remembers seeing it in, a book which also tells you how to "how to terrify a tourist with gory Scottish ghost". I guess I'm just not convinced it's anything other than an urban legend that happened to appear in a children's book (ages 8 and up!) 128.112.24.137 04:25, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think the main thing that we're trying to decide here isn't whether to delete it or not, but whether it's an urban legend or not. If it's not, then keep the page.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have heard several accounts in my time of such an event taking place in the past in Scotland.

<li>You're right-- although vanity is often cited in VfD discussions, it really shouldn't, of itself, be grounds for deletion: it's the notability that matters. "Vanity" is really a not very apt shorthand for a problem with the style of writing-- it feels like a puff piece, not an encyclopedia entry. I'll make a stab at a re-write.

<li><b>Keep</b> Sorry Guys, I mean no Offence. I thought this might be a touchy subject. I honestly am not just placing this on the web for myself. My group of friends LOVES this game. It is actually quite fun. You should try it. Before I posted this article, I looked at Wikipedia's <a href="../../../d/r/i/Drinking_game.html" title="Drinking game">drinking games</a> article. I thought our game would be a good contribution to the listing but I am not the expert, this is my first addition to Wikipedia. I do not want to do anything to compromise the integrity of the best open-source website on the internet. When I wrote the article, I considered the way it should be presented. Since it is a drinking game, I thought humor would be a good way to render the subject matter into an enjoyable article. I am open to suggestions and am willing to remove names since you guys main complaint about the page is believe that it exist just because I am a vain person. Which I really am not.&#160;:<a href="../../../b/u/p/User%7EBuphoff_d7a8.html" title="User:Buphoff">Buphoff</a> 07:01, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Please understand that "vanity" is not accusing you of being vain. It's just a comment that several elements of the article seem to be self promoting, if not of yourself, then of your group. In any case, even if written in a more neutral fashion, the article would still fail the notability test and would probably qualify as original research, which is not permitted. Don't feel bad, and don't let this chase you away. If you look around, I guarantee that you will find something that you contribute to. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EManoaChild_4445.html" title="User:ManoaChild">ManoaChild</a> 09:39, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I could argue that most of the living people here do not fall in all these categories and that wouldnt make me any more right or wrong than the people who included them maby i should mave a call to delete 30% of the bios here because they are not famous in my part of the world.

<p><b>Author's Response</b><br />
I personally do not see how this is advertising, as, unless someone hits the page using "Random article" (and what are the chances of that?), they aren't going to stumble upon the page without actually looking for more information about the game itself.</p>
<p>Screenshots and the website for the game are due out in just a couple of weeks, and it is only a couple of months before the game makes its debut.</p>
<p>You say that Wikipedia is not a "Crystal Ball," and yet there are tons of pages about upcoming movie, music, and game releases. The only reason you are against my example of it is because I come from a very small, independent game company, which doesn't give me the same kind of voice.</p>
<p>I've had the same problem getting information about the game published on game websites--no one believes me. Yet this game has been in development for over a year, and is very far from an amateur attempt at an MMORPG. We have a rather large and fully capable team of coders, designers, modelers, and writers who have given enormous quantities of their time over the past year making this project a reality.</p>
<p>Delete it if you must, it'll just be recreated again when the game comes out this winter. Instead of trying to destroy every attempt at deleting every page that might be some kind of indirect advertisement, just have some trust, for once, and let the information about the game be out there for your audience to see.</p>
<p>That's all I'll say, and if you, the editors, still are not convinced, you are more than welcome to delete the page. <b>End of (unsigned) author's response</b><br /></p>

The only thing I'm not sure about is if the label, Loveless Records, fits the description "more important indie label". Their homepage, <a href="http://www.lovelessrecords.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lovelessrecords.com/" rel="nofollow">here</a> doesn't seem to indicate that they have a "roster of performers, many of which are notable". That is, I couldn't find a page of ours on any of their other bands, which should exist for a <i>really</i> notable band, i.e. one which would make the label itself notable.

<dd>Looking at unit standards of measure comparatively by cultures</dd>
<dd>makes it much easier to see who shared measures with whom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you would like to see them compared in their own or contemporary units</dd>
<dd>as well as mm, why not put that comment on the discussion page?</dd>
<dd>Most copper age measures are given as multiples of a standard</dd>
<dd>of which the best surviving example measures 1/2 meter.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to giving their values to the nearest whole mm rather than to several</dd>
<dd>decimals of mm, copper age standards are not precise to decimal mm</dd>
<dd>or variant to 10's of mm and generally best established to +/- 1 mm per foot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For those cultures for whom there is a written contemporary</dd>
<dd>primary reference to sharing a standard (as with the letter of Nanse}</dd>
<dd>which was cited on the discussion page for ancient weights and measures)</dd>
<dd>There are long term investigations of the units involved and the results</dd>
<dd>are now considered basic historical fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the past many people have applied an ethnocentric perspective</dd>
<dd>to "their measures" stating that they are "Anglo Saxon", "German",</dd>
<dd>"Danish" French or "English" when they actually have much longer</dd>
<dd>histories that have been explored in the literature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being able to see the connection broken down by conventional archaeological</dd>
<dd>period rather than simply lumped to gether as ancient makes the similarities</dd>
<dd>and differances much clearer</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The objection that these studies are original research is also invalid</dd>
<dd>as their original sources have been cited on the discussion page and</dd>
<dd>in some cases transcriptions of the original ancient language with</dd>
<dd>translations given in English</dd>

<p>As the votes-for-deletion hopefully have shown, Wikipedia is not the right place for the type of material you are producing. I have given you a number of reasons before, and other Wikipedians have now also expressed their opinion.</p>
<dl>
<dd>rktect 8/7/05 The votes for deletion are ultimately reviewed</dd>
<dd>by a competant administrator who will probably decide</dd>
<dd>what to do with the articles based on their overall content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have made a number of false statements about them</dd>
<dd>which a competant administrator will probably pick up.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have claimed they are original research when the articles</dd>
<dd>cite sources that are in their fifth printing and</dd>
<dd>in some cases date back to classical sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have claimed they are just lists when in fact they are tables</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You have claimed they have no value or are covered elsewhere</dd>
<dd>which is far from the case because they are comparative tables</dd>
<dd>which restore the comparitive nature of having lists of unit</dd>
<dd>values on the same page that you removed by putting them</dd>
<dd>on separate pages plus adds the utility of putting them</dd>
<dd>in a table form for comparison</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>What amazes me is that the articles were not even complete before</dd>
<dd>you began demanding their deletion. What that tells me is that you</dd>
<dd>are afraid of discussing their content.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Egil, your massive edit changed the whole nature of the page</dd>
<dd>You proposed to "cleanup" the page by catagorizing</dd>
<dd>by culture rather than measure</dd>
<dd>On your own, over protest, you unilateraly did so</dd>
<dd>Then you decided to delete all reference to the original version</dd>
<dd>which preserved the comparison of units between cultures on a single page</dd>

<p>We are not taking of burning of books. The Internet is full of places where you can put your content. Very many free of charge. I defintely suggest you move your material to other such locations before your valuable material is deleted.</p>

<dd>Egil claims "this is utterly broken as a concept</dd>
<dd>because the units were often dramatically different from city to city</dd>
<dd>and from time to time, even in the same country"</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>yet its very easy to see by looking at a list of German cities</dd>
<dd>that these "dramatic differances" are nothing more than a multiple of earlier standards.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Its not always the same multiple or the same standard and</dd>
<dd>in some cases they have multiple standards but its still reconstructable.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Part of what I am doing is giving the unit and the multiple for comparison</dd>
<dd>I can go back and compare what Ogilby said about the equivalence in 1607</dd>
<dd>shortly after Elizabeth changed the statute in 1593 and see that it makes</dd>
<dd>a difference what the reporters standard is at the time.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Looking at unit standards of measure comparatively by cultures</dd>
<dd>makes it much easier to see who shared measures with whom.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Medieval standards are different than copper age standards</dd>
<dd>because there are many references to their having been copied from Greek or Roman</dd>
<dd>units already well established in the popular literature as opposed</dd>
<dd>to obscure technical publications written in dead languages</dd>
<dd>so they are much easier to document and much more accessible web sources.</dd>
<dd>As to giving their values to the nearest whole mm rather than to several</dd>

<dd>For those cultures for whom there is a written contemporary primary reference</dd>

<dd>There are long term investigations of the units involved and the results</dd>

<dd>In the past many people have applied an ethnocentric perspective</dd>

<dd>Rktect: 8/5/05</dd>
<dd>If you could provide a list of all the names of medieval measuring units</dd>
<dd>even for one year out of a period of over a millenia, that would be pretty impressive.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In some standard reference works people have tried to provide such a list by city,</dd>
<dd>or by country and region or province and then by city, generally focusing on major</dd>
<dd>periods of redefinition such as Queen Elizabeth's changes to the mile by statute in 1593</dd>
<dd>or the effect of the Metric system being passed into law in France in 1812.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Klein's "The World of Measurement" is pretty good that way, so are a couple of on-line sites</dd>
<dd>that compare various definitions of land.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the standard reference works in which there is an attempt to collect them systematically</dd>
<dd>giving examples that match a definition, comparision tables are very useful.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I have seen a few attempts in the collection of medieval measures to show</dd>
<dd>where a measure is geo-commensurate or based on Greek or Roman standards but</dd>
<dd>in general the effect of Egils massive edit is that it no longer is easy to</dd>
<dd>compare one set of influences with another in two different kingdoms let alone</dd>
<dd>in two different periods.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the Ancient Weights and Measures discussion page when user Egil first proposed this</dd>
<dd>I put sufficient facts to explain why its not useful to look at weights and measures</dd>
<dd>in isolation divided up not according to commercial interest but political interest.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The point he seems not to get is that measures define property and commercial interests</dd>
<dd>are very resistant to having someone change the rules when they are in the middle of</dd>
<dd>their transactions.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Looking at unit standards of measure comparatively by cultures</dd>
<dd>makes it much easier to see who shared measures with whom.</dd>
<dd>Egil says the subject is already covered but that is false</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Associating units with cultures makes it appear that every time a new culture arises</dd>
<dd>it reinvents the wheel and starts over again from scratch with new standards of measure</dd>
<dd>that have nothing in common with those that went before.</dd>
<dd>That is clearly not the case as measures are used to define property and people</dd>
<dd>tend not to like strangers coming around and messing with what's theirs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The important thing about this period are the letters documenting the desire</dd>
<dd>to establish common standards between countries which have been placed on</dd>
<dd>the discussion page where anybody can read them.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In this case in particular I would point out this is a work in progress</dd>
<dd>since it takes time both to do the data entry and translate the cites</dd>
<dd>from the original languages.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The standards of the Jemdet Nasr are both similar to and different from</dd>
<dd>copper age or iron age or medieval standards. In many cases they are better</dd>
<dd>documented by weights than by land units because this is the period when</dd>
<dd>the Sumerians first became heavily engaged in trade with Melluha, Makkan,</dd>
<dd>Dilmun and Egypt and first needed agreed upon international standards</dd>
<dd>of weights and measures.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Its the period in which the first archaeological and written evidence</dd>
<dd>of standards appears and in many cases the values of goods and services</dd>
<dd>are directly related to their standards of measure.</dd>
<dd>Traders moved overland, up rivers and along coasts which they surveyed.</dd>
<dd>Rivers like the Indus, Tigris, Euphrates and Nile connected with the Erythrian Sea</dd>
<dd>In the case of the Nile by means of overland portages and eventually a canal</dd>
<dd>As the Sumerian and Hurrian traders moved into Syrio-Anatolia well in advance of</dd>
<dd>any conquering armies they carried with them standards of measure for</dd>
<dd>commerce and agriculture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>These Sumerian units are not always already well established in the popular literature</dd>
<dd>Sometimes they are found in obscure technical publications written in dead languages</dd>
<dd>copper and iron age units are easier to document and have much more accessible web sources</dd>
<dd>so only now are they begining to emerge on line as citable primary sources.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As to giving their values to the nearest whole mm rather than to several</dd>
<dd>decimals of mm, Sumerian standards are not precise to decimal mm</dd>
<dd>or variant to 10's of mm and generally best established to +/- 1 mm per foot.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>For those cultures for whom there is a written contemporary primary reference</dd>
<dd>to sharing a standard (as with the rod of Gudea) which was cited on the</dd>
<dd>discussion page for ancient weights and measures, there are long term</dd>
<dd>investigations of the units involved and the results</dd>
<dd>are now considered basic historical fact.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In the past many people have applied an ethnocentric perspective</dd>
<dd>to "their measures" stating that they are "Anglo Saxon", "German",</dd>
<dd>"Danish" French or "English" when they actually have much longer</dd>
<dd>histories that have been explored in the literature.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Being able to see the connection broken down by conventional archaeological</dd>
<dd>period rather than simply lumped to gether as ancient makes the similarities</dd>
<dd>and differances much clearer</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The objection that these studies are original research is also invalid</dd>
<dd>as their original sources have been cited on the discussion page and</dd>
<dd>in some cases transcriptions of the original ancient language with</dd>
<dd>translations given in English</dd>

<li><b>Question</b>--it says "Hobbs agreed to a pre-contract with Liverpool and will officially join the club on his seventeenth birthday. He also agreed on a three-year professional contract at Anfield and will be placed into the Liverpool Academy set-up."--Does this mean he doesn't actually see playing time at the highest level games?

<li>He will probably play in the reserves or u-19 team first (there aren't any 'minor leagues' that he would play in, though some would argue that the Lincoln City team he was signed from could be considered to be - they play in a league 3 levels down from Liverpool) - but I can't actually find anywhere which says he'll be placed into the Academy (the Academy deals with the 'underage teams') set-up. Not to say that that won't happen though. There are other footballers out there with pages that won't get to see first team game time this season - should we delete/vfd their pages too (by the way this is a serious question, not a cutting remark - I'm pretty new to wiki)? <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECursive_f668.html" title="User:Cursive">Cursive</a> 14:29, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> — an ugly story, but it doesn't seem notable in and of itself. This VfD discussion needs to be monitored for edits by 195.92.40.49. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:02, 5 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Yes, an ugly story, but I've found no indication that this is some sort of "international scandal" or even that this woman's case is being used as a reason to get the law changed. Either of those things would make this story (and thus the victim) notable. As an aside, the original author's reaction to this nomination is rather amusing. Neither Slashdot nor the BBC would care about a single article being deleted from Wikipedia, and using this threatening tactic in defense of an article isn't going to change anyone's mind. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 16:15, August 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If we have article about the criminal bitch PFC Lynnie exploiting detainees like animals, than we should have article about a detainee being exploited. If we only carry the criminals, then Wiki is aiming for a new low. Wiki is supposed to be an encyclopaedia, so the amount of media attention is not a measure for inclusion. If it were, Wiki should be called Reader's Digest instead. But as far as news go, Jackie's federal venue civil rights violation lawsuit series will certainly make it into the big news sooner or later, so why not have the article now?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>As for Slashdot, they already the carry the news from yesterday, that wikipedia is starting to censor officially (read it here: <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95" class="external free" title="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95" rel="nofollow">http://slashdot.org/articles/05/08/05/2012229.shtml?tid=187&amp;tid=95</a>). I think this Jackie Noyes article is perfect example why wikipedia will fail. People delete info they find disturbing and the majority of netizens are in USA, so only US-pinkglasses info can be posted and wiki has less and less to do with reality over time. However, I need to warn, that it is EN.wikipedia.org and not US.wikipedia.org, so you cannot sanitize this wiki of all US-condemning info.</dd>
<dd>By the way, the Jackie case was an international affair, because it was the AI who did most to get her and the baby out of prison. They secured the support of a european monarch, mother herself, who contacted the wisconsin governor via a mutual friend, an influental lobbist-businessman and this really set things in motion. But this is not offical info that could get into wikipedia. — <i>(Unsigned comment by 213.178.101.126; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_213.178.101.126_dad8.html" title="Special:Contributions/213.178.101.126">1st</a> edit.)</i></dd>

<li>Prisoners, and mental patients, get raped in prisons and mental institutions around the world every day. It's sad. Scandalous, even. It would be instructive, and encyclopedic, to have information on the incidence of such events in various countries around the world. Anons and slashdotters, feel free to make such an article and include this person in it on an equal NPOV basis with other identified victims of prison abuse worldwide. This person, alone, is unencyclopedic for reasons of disproportionality in view of her non-notability. Oh, and in view of the last anon post, add to the reasons for deletion: conspiracy theory. -<a href="../../../e/d/m/User%7EEDM_5af9.html" title="User:EDM">EDM</a> 17:02, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and cleanup</b>. I think, given the media coverage, that this is notable enough for Wikipedia. However, it really needs to be cleaned up, and should be linked from <a href="../../../c/u/s/Custodial_rape.html" title="Custodial rape">Custodial rape</a>. Lots of girls go missing each year - what makes an <a href="../../../e/l/i/Elizabeth_Smart_kidnapping_5fe8.html" title="Elizabeth Smart kidnapping">Elizabeth Smart</a> notable and not a Nicole Morin is the relative media coverage in each case, and if Jackie has become some sort of media figure representing custodial rape, by all means we should include the article. Blackmail is unfortunate, but it shouldn't factor in our decision to keep an article unrelated to the perpetrator. <a href="../../../y/e/l/User%7EYelyos_5db4.html" title="User:Yelyos">Yelyos</a> 07:07, August 7, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment:</b> It might be worth looking at the whole "List of popular MOOs" section at <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html" title="MOO">MOO</a>. While I think the general concept of MUDs and MOOs is encyclopedic, individual ones probably aren't. There is some interesting historical material in <a href="../../../l/a/m/LambdaMOO_a39e.html" title="LambdaMOO">LambdaMOO</a>, and (to a lesser extent) <a href="../../../l/i/n/LinguaMOO_c132.html" title="LinguaMOO">LinguaMOO</a> and <a href="../../../m/e/d/MediaMOO_76ef.html" title="MediaMOO">MediaMOO</a>, but overall I'm thinking it would make sense to merge the significant parts from those individual articles into <a href="../../../m/o/o/MOO_ae17.html" title="MOO">MOO</a> and have one good article instead of a smattering of trivial ones. I'm not sure, however, if that discussion is in-scope for this particular VfD. --<a href="../../../r/o/y/User%7ERoySmith_da3a.html" title="User:RoySmith">RoySmith</a> 13:25, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Simply being a character on Sesame Street does not confer notability.

<ul>
<li>But the point is valid. Notability is not written in the deletion policy guidelines. If we can't find a more objective reason to delete an article than notability, perhaps we should assume it may be notable to someone else. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMistercow_17cc.html" title="User:Mistercow">Mistercow</a> 07:19, 6 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Many things and people are notable to one people or a few people, but I think the key to notability here on Wikipedia for personalities is when something can be talked about in a random conversation with most people you know or just see on the street and they can note who they are. This obviously is still a little too broad for a personal policy, but it's a starting point. "Dinger" doesn't meet that qualification, he(it?) should be <b>merged</b> into the minor characters article. Also, is it just me, or has Kappa voted to keep in every vfd he's been in? I assume that the paper comment is on the possible limitlessness of Wikipedia since it has no specific spatial qualities. Otherwise, I wish you told me earlier because I tried to make <a href="../../../o/r/i/Origami.html" title="Origami">Origami</a> out of some articles, and it wasn't pretty&#160;;-) <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">Karmafist</a> 19:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would've tagged it for deletion even if it wasn't a one sentence stub. Schools aren't inherently noteworthy. And before anyone even gets started, I know that Wikipedia isn't paper, but it's also not a junkyard. The only reason I changed my vote to keep was because the age of the institution is notable. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 21:34, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I'll be watching your taggings carefully for a while. There is no CSD for a school article on grounds of non-notability. You were right to bring this to VfD. It would have made more sense to do some research--it's what you're supposed to be here for. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 21:55, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>You appear to have misunderstood. I'm well aware that there's no CSD for non-notability. I tagged the article for speedy deletion, and that request was favorably acted upon, because the original article had no content other than "It's located in Portland, Maine." What I was referring to was the fact that I personally believe that the majority of articles regarding schools do not belong on Wikipedia due to the fact that while education is inherently notable, the buildings where instruction occurs are not. It would've made more sense to actually read my statement before commenting -- it's what admins are supposed to be here for. -<a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> 22:22, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wrongly speedied articles, particularly schools, are always resurrected (I should know, I usually do it myself). It is wrong to speedy an article on a school solely because it only correcly locates the school--that is all we need to expand it. I'm taking the liberty of moving the school building/homeschooling debate to the talk page of this VfD. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 10:01, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article was speedy deleted as nonsense, but was undeleted after discussion at WP:VFU. This appears to be some sort of cartoon.

<li>Then mark it with a stub or expansion topic or find the WikiProject snakes or look up some info or find some herpophile Wikipedians and ask for input ... but don't VFD an article about a subject when you accept it's a perfectly valid one for an encylcopedia article. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBen-w_c1ef.html" title="User:Ben-w">Ben-w</a> 22:04, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: We are here to report on the world, and one of the truths about the world is that there are groups that are frequently considered extremist. Recently there has been a pernicious notion that since Wikipedia is not supposed to <i>endorse</i> one POV over another, that Wikipedia should not <i>acknowledge the existence</i> of controversial POVs. In short, I find the nominating statement of "there's no way this could ever be NPOV" to be entirely at odds with the very notion of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a>, and the only reason I am not supporting the keeping of the current article is because it is currently just one item long and its subject, that of <i>all</i> extremist groups, too broad. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 18:18, 6 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> The problem is that groups considered "extreamist" today may not be in 10 years, so at the very least its quite time-based --<small><a href="../../../r/n/_/User%7ERN_11b5.html" title="User:RN">Ryan Norton</a> <sup><a href="../../../r/n/_/User_talk%7ERN_aed3.html" title="User talk:RN"><font color="#6BA800">T</font></a> | <a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_RN_6d83.html" title="Special:Emailuser/RN"><font color="#0033FF">@</font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RN_f224.html" title="Special:Contributions/RN"><font color="#FF0000">C</font></a></sup></small> 00:58, 7 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - cannot be anything but POV. Definition of extremism is totally based on someone's POV from "extremist liberals" to "extremist conservatists" to "extreme environmentalists". At the very least, the list would have to include <i>very copious</i> notes <i>who</i> consider the group extremist, making it bona fide edit war bait. I think we can write about various groups "considered extremist" by defining what they do (ie. sort of "show, don't tell"). - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 08:49, 8 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You're completely right that an acceptable article on this topic would need copious notes to verify that the groups are "widely" considered extremist. But there seems to be a common confusion these days between "the subject of the article is a POV, or multiple POVs" and "the article is inherently POV" -- two entirely different things. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:52, 8 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Bias propaganda selectively citing reports of abuse by U.S. Marines. This information is covered in the page on Fallujah and so (1) does not need it's own entry, and (2) even if it did this shouldn't be it. As a person who spent a long time in Fallujah (not during the attack in question) I am willing to admit not all the acts by US soldiers in Iraq may be morally acceptable. However, I would argue <i>most</i> are and that this entry <i>well</i> over-exaggerates the bad behavior of US soldiers in Iraq. It was also my experience in Iraq that a large amount of the reports given to the media by Iraqis were themselves lies or exaggerations. Heck, I've even been to the hospital cited in this article.</p>
