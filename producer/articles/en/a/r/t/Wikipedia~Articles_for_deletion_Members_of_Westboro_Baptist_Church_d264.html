Some of these members are minors, and there is far too much personal information, some of it highly speculative accusations.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> I am sure that most of the people pushing for the deletion of this entry are members of the Church in question. They are an embarrasment to this nation. They are insulting the people that DIED, WILLINGLY, to support their right to say FOOLISH things like this. Man, its going to piss these people off when they die and find St. John standing in front of the gates dressed in BDUs (Battle Dress Uniform...Camoflage Uniform). This article needs to stay. These people are blatently stupid and deserve the negative publicity they are getting. They claimed the holocaust (nazis killing the jews) was just a MINOR mishap and that the Jews are the real nazis. I dont know how you can be so stupid as to think something like that. This isnt a religion...this is borderline CULT.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.243.49.233 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.243.49.233_93ce.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.243.49.233">contribs</a>) 06:54, 2 May 2006 .</small></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Westboro and Fred Phelps articles are approaching, if not already exceeding, the recommended Wikipedia article sizes. Thus, merger with those articles would be IMHO impractical. Westboro acts as a collective when it protests groups and individuals; even its youngest members participate in the protests. Although the group thrives on publicity, all the information is in the public record already and it is pertinent to know who is involved with this organization. I vote to keep the article as a stand-alone, both due to size problems with combining it and due to its importance. <a href="../../../1/6/0/User%7E160.147.240.6.html" title="User:160.147.240.6">160.147.240.6</a> 18:56, 1 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete ASAP-giving these judgmental, rude, ignorant people preaching a different and incorrect form of Christianity (it is not christian, feel free to worship as you wish, but do not bring down a good faith by labeling yours Christian) is not significant enough to waste space on.

<li><b>Kill</b>. While the Westboro Baptist "church", if they deserve the name, is a living mockery of all that religion is supposed to be about, a list of their members is not notable enough to be worth keeping, and this one is low quality besides.
