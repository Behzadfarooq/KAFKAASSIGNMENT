<p>I am a patient man and a free mind. I use to read all the contributions to a Wiki talk page very carefully, think about their soundness and reliability, and try to find out if one or the other comment is written just for the reason to serve for a private purpose or to serve for the improvement of the relevant Wiki article. If I find that someone writes contributions that do not serve the core _idea_ of the Wikipedia, then I use to give this _someone_ another 30 days to come back with writing something which does _make sense_ and at the same time follows the Wiki rules. But after 30 days of reading nothing new from this _someone_, I use to write _very blunt_ comments about such a _someone_. The _someone_ in question is a man who uses the Wiki entry <a href="../../../e/m/a/User%7EEmax_3329.html" title="User:Emax">Emax</a>.</p>
<p>Hans Rosenthal (hans.rosenthal AT t-online.de -- replace AT by @ )</p>
<p>PS: My next comment will be a most clear one.</p>

<p>Your version is funny in the context of this sentence: "...had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism"...&#160;:)</p>
<p>And you are showing one more time lack of historical knowledge. The last Hanse meeting found place in 1669 and in the 18th century Hanse stops to exist. And please <b>stop</b> using German names for Polish cities.</p>
<p>"mostly German speaking city" - it has nothing to do with Schopenhauer life - but its a nice try to make him more German (and btw also Gdansk). His family and himself <b>had strong feelings against any kind of nationalism</b>, why do you not respect that?</p>

<dd><i>Feeling against nationalism</i> does not mean <i>not having a nationality</i> - you are correct! His nationality was Polish, since he was born in Poland, so if you want go on, add it in the article&#160;!&#160;:) Or are you the opinion that Zinedin Zidane is an Algerian, Mike Tyson an African and Dirk Nowitzky a Pole?&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Dariusz Michalczewski, who was born in Poland, and speak German like me English, was considered in Germany as "The Deutsche boxer Darius Michalczewski!"</dd>

<dd>Um, but youy DID also argue that someone can be a certain nationality even if he is born in another country, as long as his origin is of the initial nationality. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Slavoljub_Penkala&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=4318666" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Slavoljub_Penkala&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=4318666" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. &lt;sarcasm&gt;Of course, if it would make someone polish, then this is OK.&lt;/sarcasm&gt; -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_73_2ea7.html" title="User:Chris 73">Chris 73</a> <a href="../../../c/h/r/User_talk%7EChris_73_0282.html" title="User talk:Chris 73">Talk</a> 02:32, Feb 5, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Dear chris, could you show me Poland on a map in 1871? thats a different thing. And do you see the entry? "Slavoljub Eduard Penkala (April 20, 1871 - February 5, 1922) was an engineer and inventor from <b>Croatia</b>." Did i changed it to Polish inventor? Did i added him to Polish category? Not the best example&#160;:)</dd>

<dd>Actually, yes, I do. Also, could you comment on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Talk%7EArthur_Schopenhauer_445a.html" title="Talk:Arthur Schopenhauer">Talk:Arthur Schopenhauer</a> instead of here?

<p>I used the "Introduction" section written by David Berman in the following source for a few comments below:</p>
<pre>
 "The World as Will and Idea, Abridged in One Volume"
 Edited by: David Berman
 Translated by: Jill Berman
 Publisher: Everyman Library, Orion Publishing group, London, U.K.
 Date: 1997
 ISBN: 0 460 87505 1
</pre>
<p>This souce says he was named Arthur so the name would be recognizable in many European languages, and also because his father had hoped that he would be born in England (during a visit there) so he would enjoy 'immunities' valuable to a merchant. ([1] p. xvii)</p>
<p>The first paragraph of the WikiPedia entry says "...that saw life as being essentially evil and futile...". [1], p.xxxii says that Shopenhauer saw the "Life, in short, (1) is morally wrong, (2) has no meaning or purpose, and (3) will always have more pain than pleasure." I think a statement like the latter might be clearer. Morally wrong, since "To exist is to be unjust, since it is impossible not to encroach on the will of another." ([1], p. xxxi). Also the wikipedia definition of evil doesn't seem to fit well to me. A brief explanation in the first paragraph on why he felt life is morally wrong, as in the referenced quote, would probably add value and clarity.</p>
<p>In the section on Philosophy, I think the link between "desire", "Will" and the "noumenon" thing-in-itself could be stated more clearly? i.e. The Will (to life, to exist) is desire, and both, being equivalent, are the thing-in-itself. All things that exist are therefore objectified desire. And because existence is desire, there must always be more unhappiness than happiness in the world, which seems to be the root of his philosophy's pessimism. ([1] p. xxv, xxxii)</p>
<p>I'm a novice at Wikipedia. My comments are _only_ meant in the spirit of constructive criticism. I was recently reading the above mentioned source, so these comments were fresh in my mind.</p>
