<li>This disagreement is limited to a small subset of Wikipedia contributors. I would imagine most editors do not participate on AFD and the vast majority haven't the slightest idea what happens here. If we could agree to keep schools small and large, just as we do cities, a lot of wasted effort could be refocused on improving other areas of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 06:35, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Or, if we agreed to delete all schools, major and minor, we'd achieve the same effect. Luckily, neither seems likely to happen. Unluckily, neither does any sort of compromise on this issue. It's like Wikipedia's vi vs. emacs. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELord_Bob_eeba.html" title="User:Lord Bob">Lord Bob</a> 06:37, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>According to <a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> if there is no consensus for deletion, the article is kept. 99% of the past 300 school-related nominations have resulted in either keep or no consensus, the remaining 1% being hoaxes or non-verifiable articles. The logical answer is to stop nominating schools for deletion and to stop clogging up AFD. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilensor_a49f.html" title="User:Silensor">Silensor</a> 06:41, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Your claims that it is a 50/50 split on schools is demonstrably false. You claim it all the time, as do most of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles", but it just ain't so.

<li>This article is neither definitive, nor normative. Your claims are spurious, clearly shown by the balance of other school AfDs currently underway which all show an overwhelming majority to "keep". As usual, your claims that the schools debate is some "50/50 split" whilst ignoring the preponderance of evidence, demonstrates why your good faith in these discussions is often questioned.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 07:00, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Aaron, don't try and come off with some "babe in the woods" routine. You are fully aware of the track record of schools, and what is more, the listings of schools are on schoolwatch for all to see and yet you still persist in the consistently dishonest flailing about of some fictitious and partisan "50/50 split no consensus" lie. If you somehow aren't aware of the overwhleming track record, then you are guilty of insisting on your damned partisan "50/50 split no consensus" claim without having even bothered to do the research to back up your claim. Either way, you are either trying deceive others about the record or else you are grossly negligent in doing the easily-obtainable research to support your statements. I can't really figure out which is worse.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:07, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Very well, there was no need to get a dig in against you for that vandalism. However, I might ask the same thing of you (ie. "why do you persist in increasing the level of conflict?") in this case by either willfully or through negligence, continuing to misrepresent the record on school AfDs as a "50/50 split"? Based on how easily this false claim is researched and refuted, and given your frequent contributions to this and other "discussions" with definitive statements such as "This is <i>not</i> consensus, and one hundred 50/50 splits in a row doesn't make it consensus." (see above) Can you understand how one might suspect that you are <b>purposely</b> misrepresenting the facts of the debate? I concede that there is a possibility that someone who makes declarative statements and has been long-involved in this debate MAY indeed be negligent in researching his arguments, but then the question becomes why on earth he would bother to make such statements if he wasn't sure they were correct, espeically given the contentious nature of these "discussions"?--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:42, 10 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fair enough. I've been grazing in other patches, and the last analysis I did almost two months ago (13/09). At <i>that time</i> it was fairly definative, with a very slight edge to deletion. The sample I had <i>at hand</i> was this one and the last school listed as closed on Schoolwatch, both at over 40% delete at the time I made my comments. I'm frankly shocked by the links that you provided, and had no idea the debate had shifted so. I will return to data gathering...<br />

<li>We had almost this VERY SAME "discussion" on IRC just the other day <b>before</b> all of your comments made here, where I maintained (among other things) that, for instance, high schools are 95%+ keep results (as opposed to no consensus) and that thusly the "no consensus" claims of "those who routinely nominate and/or vote to delete school articles" are spurious. IIRC, you dismissed my claims about consensus by essentially claiming that "keep" voters are a bunch of low-edit-quotient trolls who constituted a dedicated minority and really ought to be disregarded for their bloc voting and cookie-cutter arguments (or something to this effect). I pointed out in that discussion that I had already done all the counting on high schools and that if anything, the results were actually greater than 95%. I am not really sure how you can be "shocked" by my citations today, unless you simply disregarded my claims on IRC the other day as just false nonsense claims I was making.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:57, 10 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As nicely as possible, at that time the same request was made as I made here: show some citations. Then you failed to do so, despite being asked several times. Thus, to be frank, I thought no more about your claims, having observed some (admittedly older) evidence to the contrary. Now that you <b>have</b> provided some evidence, I've thanked you for it and said that I'll review it. I don't know what more I can say to this, except that we're now taking up WAY too much of this AfD.<br />
