<p>This is an unsourced article about a high school talent show. It's currently unverifiable, however I think even with sources, it should be deleted for lack of notability. "Notability" is a dirty word to some, but the day that high school talent shows are encyclopedic is the day that Wikipedia is indeed an "indiscriminate collection of information". A tiny bit of it could be merged into the school article, but IMO there's no call for pages of information on this topic. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:45, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> - In my oppinion, articles this like make Wikipedia what it is. I think the article is very useful. It is not only a tradition at the school, but a long standing tradition in the city of Hialeah. This article should stay.</li>
<li><b>Merge</b>- My Sister went to this high school and I went there for a month before we moved. I still live in the area, and I can tell you that outside of <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hialeah_High_School_a96e.html" title="Hialeah High School">Hialeah High School</a>, the talent show is UNKNOWN. Its not a tradition in the city of Hialeah, because Hialeah has two other schools serving it and students attending those schools don't know about Autum Capers (cause its a Hialeah High Tradition), so maybe its a tradition in the portion of Hialeah served by Hialeah High, and not in the portion served by <a href="../../../m/i/a/Miami_Springs_Senior_High_School_6373.html" title="Miami Springs Senior High School">Miami Springs</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/a/Hialeah-Miami_Lakes_Senior_High_School_fbec.html" title="Hialeah-Miami Lakes Senior High School">Hialeah-Miami Lakes</a> High Schools. Autum Capers is just another school talent show that really has no meaning to anyone but its students and alumni. I lived in Hialeah for 10 years and didn't even know about it until my sister went to the school, and then forgot about it as soon as I moved. It's not worth of an entire article, but it is worth having its own section on the Hialeah High Page. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 20:17, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Im the author.There are dozens of articles on Wikipedia, on small things that people come searching for, I dont see what harm having a page about a pretty descriptive and comical talent show at a high school could bother someone. If i did a search for "the alliance of twelve" in Alias, i would find it, although there are dozens of people who dont watch Alias or care about. I just think articles like this are what make wikipedia a personal experience for people. Alexander Prieto--63.211.54.166 23:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Autumn Capers doesn't deserve a whole page.

<li><b>Comment</b>: This sums up the problems with the concept of notability. Autumn Capers is clearly notable to some of the people who go to Hialeah High School, the problem is that it is not <i>verifiable</i> to the rest of us. <a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrollderella_9ec1.html" title="User:Trollderella">Trollderella</a> 20:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Honestly, the event is huge in Hialeah High. It consumes like a whole week, and alumni come in to watch it and everything. Then Again, HML and Springs also have talent shows that are huge in their areas and tend to be a huge tradition at the schools, they're not all-consuming like autumn capers is at HHS, but that doesn't merit it its own page, just a nice long mention at the Hialeah High article. <a href="../../../p/r/u/User%7EPRueda29_902e.html" title="User:PRueda29">PRueda29</a> 20:55, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: I strongly believe that a local activity which is of no material interest to anyone other than the people currently attending a single educaitonal institution has no real claim to being notable, and any entry about it is necessarily unencyclopaedic as it will be (a) substantially unverifiable to anyone but the particiapnts and (b) highly likely to change with time.

<p>FROM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF:</p>
<p>I'm glad you think the publication I have spent 9 months (and my predecessors have spent 5 years) creating, is pointless. But what I believe to be more pointless is your obvious glorification of your own self importance over a harmless article on this very sucessful publication.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p><b>Keep</b>I actually came across this company on the web before in the 90's, apparently before it was aquired, it did have it's own website. This was definitly a real company. <b>Keep</b>Hello people, I am the article's author. Yes I've tried google too, unsucessful. This is a real company. I can prove it. There was a book used for a project i did last year on turkmenistan. It was called "turkmenistan" and it was published in 2005. I am not sure what publishing company is but this should help the google searches. I read about a company founded by a man with a dream to rebuild a country. That company was brenco and that man was brennan roy. I did find a site about the company a few months ago while i was doing the report but apparently it was shut down. Please keep trying this company deserves recognition. I don't want you to go out your way to find this book, but if you ever come across a book titled "Turkmenistan" please see that it contains information about this company. I strongly appreciate this thank you.</p>

<dd>No, not at all, anybody can add. But you justified the speedy under the criteria for "patent nonsense," which it was at the time you added the tag, only because someone had edited it to read "this was created by a BigDaddy sockpuppet." The initial entry, which I restored, doesn't fit the "patent nonsense" speedy criteria (it's understandable -- just horribly biased), or really any other that I could determine.

<p>I don't think this page should be deleted. It is maybe not completely true but people can see that and its fun and amusing.

<li><i>(Disclaimer: I'm the person who originally put this in AfD)</i>. I don't think it's at all true, personally&#160;:) Liking it or not is irrelevant; it's not appropriate for Wikipedia. Even if rewritten to be more obviously humorous, it still wouldn't be suitable. We could have a long debate about why "humour" articles on Wikipedia are a bad idea, but that's probably already been done countless times before. 195.92.168.176 16:31, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>(Disclaimer: I'm the person who originally put this on Wikipedia)</i>. The material in the article is all true, if a little (and occasionally a lot) exaggerated&#160;: ) However, having read the sections on verifiability, in particular parts addressing original research, as well as notability and music guidelines, I think perhaps this should be taken off of Wikipedia. I will keep it in my own files at home until such a time as the Crazy Meese meet the guidelines and have some verifiability. Fans, just a few more short years to wait if all goes well!</li>

<p>Possible vanity, non notable anyway. --<a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMissmarple_5c77.html" title="User:Missmarple">Missmarple</a> 19:24, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article is notable because David Wong is both an attorney and classical pianist. David Wong is like a Condoleezza Rice -- who is also a concert pianist in addition to being the current Secretary of State. That's notable. It also seems that if this article is deleted, the article on Rosa Parks should also be deleted, because both Rosa Parks and David Wong object to racial discrimination and took strong personal stands against it. They are historical figures. 20:28, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>My problem is not just the vanity article itself, but the disengenuous attempt to "save" the page with convoluted, illogical statements like those above. Condoleezza Rice is notable purely as the Secretary of State of the United States, not as a pianist. David Wong holds which position in the U.S. government? Didn't think so. What's irritating is that such illogic is so insipid, yet the writer's audacity for writing it is even more so. Also, the claim that "if this article is deleted, then the article on Rosa Parks should also be deleted" could only logically be based on the premise that David Wong is more important than Rosa Parks...not only is this extreme vanity, but David Wong or a supporter deliberately chose a "racial icon", and the implication that he is at least as important as Rosa Parks because he "took a strong stand against discrimination" suggests that, in fact, Wong manufactured the discrimination claim to gain attention. I'm just sorry that weaker people are unable to stand up to these type of insidious attacks...doing evil in the pretext of doing good.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 07:36, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think it is logical to assume David Wong thinks he is more important than Rosa Parks. Logically, it is possible that they are not mutually orthogonal. In any event, there is a case at the Dept. of Education San Francisco Office that verifies there is indeed a complaint which existed prior to the deletion of this article. Therefore, I don't think the discrimination complaint was manufactured just to draw attention to himself in order to save the article. I agree with Ryoung's comments below that we shouldn't be attacking those who are trying to save this article, but rather look at the reasoning, content of what everyone is saying, including those who want this article deleted. Jamesw9 18:47, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> If this guy thinks he is more important than Rosa Parks and Condoleezza Rice, then clearly he has a "God complex." Maybe this has driven him to success in two fields, but one has to wonder if the discrimination claim was an attempt to gain attention for himself (and thus may have never happened). Also, it's not notable that Person X graduated from school and thanked his teachers.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 21:36, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't think Wong thinks he is more important than Rosa Parks or Condoleezza Rice, but the argument is that he is notable because he is both an attorney and a distinguished classical pianist, and that would be different from allowing an article about a person who likes golf, fishing, and what have you. I do wonder about the discrimination claim though because I don't believe racial discrimination still occurs. Can anyone follow up with the Department of Education to verify there was an actual complaint filed and can we have more facts? Jamesw9 21:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Of course racial discrimination still occurs, but that doesn't make Wong notable as a musician, nor does being discriminated against, by itself, make someone a historical figure. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETECannon_4144.html" title="User:TECannon">TECannon</a> 06:28, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It's not true that David Wong's next concert is in 2008. If you do a google search he is also playing in a concert this Sunday in Berkeley, CA. He meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7Emusic_156a.html" title="WP:music">WP:music</a> because he went on an international concert tour in Germany in 1999.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Save</b> Notable. David Wong's CD on Amazon has received almost 45 reviews, and almost all of them are positive. Plus, the tour in Germany should count for something. I don't believe allmusic.com should be the definitive guide to who is a notable artist and who is not. For example, allmusic.com does not contain a listing for Steve Swayne, SS King, or Natalie Merchant. Jamesw9 06:44, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

On a possibly related note, it's worth mentioning that both HBgoodrich and [[User::Genb2004|Genb2004]] had no contributions, prior to casting their votes for 'save'.

There also seems to be an attempt at sockpuppetry in influencing this review. Besides that, I also find the claims for notability completely unconvincing, and definitely not worthy of wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b> I don't see that being an attorney and a pianist is a cause for notability. Typically one would need to be wealthy in order to be either. Therefore one might readily be able to aquire the training for the other. En plus, would someone be notable if they were both a Teacher and Guitar player? I think not.

<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree. The barrier to entry to become an attorney and a classical pianist is a lot greater than guitar playing and teaching. Therefore these two comparisons are not equivalent. Jamesw9 18:51, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Marcus22 has a good argument that teachers and guitarists are common. If the guitarist wins a state-wide competition, then the common argument is defeated or if the teacher wins a state-wide competition for teaching could also defeat the argument too. If david won a state wide piano competition then that might defeat the common argument. Asian Pacific Islanders represented 49% of San Francisco's school system in 2005, surely Marcus22, ryoung122, TECcannon, and MissMarple can easily name some meritorious Asian replacements for David because their arguments built on top of a lack of novelty and an abundance of substitutes? They should simply name a few specific names and justify why those replacements subsume David's published contribution to society. I've been a substitute teacher before and I don't feel that being a teacher in any way diminishes the something else just because I know a lot of people teach.</li>

<dl>
<dd>The danger I see in enforcing the highest standard of notability is that it is a blunt censorship instrument that can be used to censor the early references to any new publication regardless of merit, delete young artists, and delete new referenced publications are starting to become notable. Arguably Time Magazine, Newsweek, and tabloid shows like Inside Edition, provide timely content at the expense of enforcing a looser checking standard than a refereed journal such as Nature or JAMA. I do not think we need to delete everything Matt Drudge blogged before Monica-gate because anyone could make the argument he was less notable when I first learned of it. The word blogged seemed like a good candidate for deletion because that was not a very notable word to me when I first learned it. I think notability rises and falls too quickly for an encyclopedia to track. If an author dies, does he become less worthy of a historical record? I think relying upon the references of publicized works is a much better standard. If the author, artist, comprose, or inventor has any published works that might have artistic, culturally, or other redeeming social value, I say let the readers decide for themselves.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>The alternative is to say that people like 'ryoung122' will improve my Wikipedia searches because 'ryoung122' can point to a more relevant artist to my search criteria in Wikipedia. If I am searching for a list of Hispanic civil rights figures who have persevered, I certainly don't need ryoung122 limiting my search to Rosa Parks when I'm looking for a less frequently cited person like Cesar Chavez. If I am searching for a recent list of Asian civil rights figures fighting the good fight, I am not expecting Missmarple, ryoung122, or TECcannon to offer better credentials or point to bigger folk heroes in the Asian American community. I personally believe David Wong was a short yellow musician being oppressed by elite establishment big shots who denied him the opportunity to rent a pearly white concert hall. Instead of suffering in silence like many angry Asian men, I almost admire that he persevered and became an attorney instead of a street performing musician with a picket sign. If David Wong is really not that notable, then why is it so important that his work needs to be censored in its entirety for lack of obscenity. I say if the argument is vanity then I recommend deleting any vain superlative adjective and allow the remnant truth to set us free. I am convinced that his lifelong battle with censorship is notable not because of his published works but on the basis of these public requests to delete him instead of limiting the discussion to what ought to be censored. Any request to delete in entirety without citing a search for a more meritorious replacement should be scrutinized as ignorant. If someone can name a more prominent Asian pianist and lawyer that subsumes all of David's contribution to society, I think we can replace David with another name but who are these shadowy figures who argue David should be replaced with a black hole? I challenge them to replace David on the merits and publish their full names and cities where they reside. I personally feel our society might be better off if we encouraged people to toil as patiently as David has behind the scenes to overcome a lifelong battle with censorship instead having to selectively celebrate the notoriety of the most visible act of civil disobedience. <small>(<i>preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment by</i> 67.174.226.42 (talk <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.174.226.42_441c.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.174.226.42">contribs</a>) 20:21, 29 October 2005 (UTC))</small></dd>

<li><b>COMMENT</b>. First, in regards to the above "impassioned plea." If you look at the vanity page, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vanity_page</a> we see Since we are all inherently biased towards ourselves, it is usually best to await the day when someone whom we have never met, might choose to write such an article about ourselves, thus proving beyond a doubt that such a neutral interest does indeed exist. The popular radio humorist, Garrison Keillor has a theory that "everyone has a story to tell", and this may very well be true. Still, Wikipedia is not meant to be the place where all stories get told. That you know so much about David Wong strongly suggests you are related to him, a friend, or perhaps David himself. As it says from the vanity page, there should be a proof of neutral interest. Writing articles about oneself or someone you know is NOT NEUTRAL INTEREST. As you said, "personally believe..." You're taking it personally, and making a mountain out of a molehill. Such a tactic sets off the VANITY alarms. Even your comment about Cesar Chavez is offensive. Others chose to include Cesar, not Cesar himself or just a bunch of friends. Further, Cesar's work made a real-life difference for millions of hugely disadvantagely minorities working in the fields. David Wong's life of piano-playing already bespeaks a life of privilege, such as that any comparison to working in the fields is ludicrous. Millions of Americans have not even had the opportunity of piano lessons, yet we see complaints because David feels he is not being treated fairly. In actually, it appears that David is not treating others fairly, insisting on special privileged that others have not had. Such a statement as "I am convinced that his lifelong battle with censorship is notable not because of his published works but on the basis of these public requests to delete him instead of limiting the discussion to what ought to be censored" is a circular argument: you are saying that David Wong's article should not be deleted, because others are trying to delete it. Despite your very good grammar, what is scary is your total lack of perspective or understanding of logic. Or, maybe you undestand logic very well, but hope enough people perusing the message board will be deceived by your fallacies...in which case, that makes the statements all the worse, if the motive is to deceive.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Second, the above user 67.174.226.42, instead of making arguments about David Wong, commits other clever fallacies, such as if we delete David Wong, then we should replace him with another Asian-American. First, I don't believe in quotas...quotas are inherently racist. (And if you can only be inspired by other Asian-Americans, that's racist, too). David Wong comes from a background of privilege. Chinese-Americans have a standard of living, education, and even life expectancy that exceeds that of the average American, even white Americans. To claim that David Wong is another "Rosa Parks" really means the poster has issues of resent toward African-Americans, feeling that perhaps African-Americans are getting "special treatment, so we should too." (Did David Wong ever have to sit at the back of the bus? Did Rosa Parks promote herself, or did others promote her?) Well, it doesn't take much looking at the damage from Hurricane Katrina to see the difference. Perhaps you need to go on a community service tour of the US South, to gain some perspective from your ethno-centric little world.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>But if I'm wrong and David Wong really is such a great "human rights activist," why not cite newspaper stories instead of committing non sequiturs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>As for me, I have known Chinese Christians all my life, yet the ones I know are not self-absorbed ego-maniacs,who put their self-promotion ahead of all else. If David Wong is deleted and he later acquires the stature of a star pianist, don't you think someone will notice and put him back on Wikipedia? The true measure of greatness is not what one thinks of oneself, but what others think of them. This is even more so for celebrities. And it's not just David Wong: to avoid the hype machine, I don't buy any popular music CD until I first hear the song and like it. Then I follow up to find out who sings the song, to make sure I'm not being brainwashed into buying the latest Ashlee Simpson junk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The bottom line for me, however, is that not only is David Wong not notable enough to warrant an encyclopedia entry, the campaign to add him to Wikipedia (and Amazon.com, for that matter) smacks of prickish self-absorption, misusing Wikipedia to advertise (to sell the CD and promote David Wong's attorney practice). Further, the Wong promoter's disdain of African-Americans smacks of racial arrogance.<a href="../../../r/y/o/User%7ERyoung122_c1da.html" title="User:Ryoung122">Ryoung122</a> 06:28, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p><br />
Keep. I think the admin referees are welcome to review undisclosed conflicts of interest that marcus22, ryoung122 and Bwithh neglected to disclose regarding their past, present, and future interests in other musician reputations or attorney reputations or that of other articles.</p>
<p>If litmus tests like the presence of any fallacy or contradiction can be used to delete content, we would either have to admit a lack of fairness by simply deleting the article about David or practice consistency by deleting many other "accepted" articles that possess the same issues as the article about David. marcus22, ryoung122, and Bwithh are conveniently silent about identifying sock puppet or comments in their favor that simply do not pass their own litmus tests.</p>
<p>I think if the "vanity" litmus test became the wildcard rule, we would not need a logical exception to review Hans Boepple who is chairing a department with some absolutely amazing credentials that scream vanity to any tenure reviewer at any university in the US. If David lacked a JD and was practicing law, I think someone would have reported vanity on that by now. I welcome ryoung122, marcus22, and Bwithh want to explain what happens when I apply their own vanity test to the article about Mr. Boepple, I will. I arrive at the same overreaching decision--DELETE. There seems to be a lack of balance, neutrality, and objectivity in the standards they are proposing. I want anyone to justify the declaring the position of a music chair with the "gravity" of his academic credentials. I hope has a good justification for participating in any tenure granting decisions and what kinds of credentials to the candidates have versus the reviewer or those might seem vain too.</p>
<p>I think if the information about David is available elsewhere then we can safely assume the censors want to single out this rated G article for other reasons. Even by pre-1991 noncommercial internet ettiquette, I do not see sponsorship branding, prices posted, binding offers to sell, credit card solicitations, no mention of his marital status, or dates of availability. The article appears to be factual, balanced, and fair which is a standard of objectivity that seems to exceed many other articles I have read. It appears the delete camp has failed so far in its bid to nominate a substitute for David thus the need to go ad hominem. There is a giant gap between proving that the article expresses David in a factually favorable light due versus proving a clear and present danger and national security harm by suppressing article about David. I fail to see any non-circular foundational argument for those wanting deletion given any established criteria of prior restraint for deleting this article now or pre-1991. At least not a long convoluted criteria that would save Mr. Boepple's article.</p>
<p>Toyotaboy ruled in favor of David because the advocates of delete have failed to bring arguments rising to the standards of prior restraint or substitution. Every argument submitted so far for delete can be used to go after established articles.</p>

<li><b>this page is fully justified</b>*. If you are aware of the situation in the balkans, then you would know why it is important that there is a page on this, for egsample there are plenty of Roma peoples in Kosovo that are calling themselves "Egyptians", as to avoid discrimination by the ethnic albanians, and serbs. if you knew anything, then you would know that there are no Egyptians (arab peoples) of the country Egypt in the balkans, but "Egyptians" are coming up on the cenuses of Kosovo and Montenegro. If you look on the wiki page of the republic of montengro, you will see in the demographics "Roma" &amp; "Egyptians" in the same category, as some roma people prefer to call themselves as Egyptians in the hope of not being discriminated against. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro</a>.

<p>I started to wikify this article until I realized that is was basically an ad. Although it is certainly possible to have an unbiased NPOV, non-advertisement, non-spam article on a university, this certainly isn't it. IMO, it needs to be either deleted or have all the text scrapped and entirely reworked. It is worth noting that as of right now, there are no pages that link to this page. --<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 16:54, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Googling for the name "Jorge Santana" gave me only(?) 69,800 hits. That by no way means that each and every one of those hits was for the Jorge Santana of the article. Jorge and Santana are quite common names in Spanish-speaking countries. Note: if this is the person of the "internationally released CD" PJM mentioned, I immediately withdraw my nomination. But then Jorge Santana should obviously have an article because of that cd, not for "being the brother of," which is not much of an achievement. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 17:03, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>comment* It would be one thing to say that Julie Winnifred Betrand is the "oldest living Canadian," but to say she is the "living longevity recordholder" is a tongue-tied mess. Canada's recordholder is Marie-Louise Meilleur, 117 years 230 days (died Apr 16 1998). Thus, Julie Winnifred Betrand is NOT a "recordholder," though she probably is the "oldest living Canadian."

<p><b>Dont Delete</b>apparently you don't understand. As is said in the artical "not in a insulting manner" this was not an insult to people like you who own the yugo. (if the yugo is a high performer, this is not under the definition of a loser car). I myself drive a Geo Metro which everyone calls a loser car. This is not directed at me, however, this is a comment used by other teenagers/young adults to describe this type of car in general. The term loser car is a used as an adjective to describe all cars that fit the definition I have given. Also if this term is put into Wiktionary (I would appreciate that), yes it is a slang term. Wiktionary is a tool that probably includes more words than any other dictionary. By putting this term into wiktionary misunderstandings (like that of the yugo owner) would clear up. People will understand that this is a term that is gaining popularity and means no insult to them or thier car but is a slang classification for a basic performance compact vehicle.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User:69.140.67.148">69.140.67.148</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.140.67.148.html" title="User talk:69.140.67.148">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions__69.140.67.148_aa51.html" title="Special:Contributions/ 69.140.67.148">contribs</a>) 21:13, 28 October 2005 (UTC).</small></p>

<p>You guys think im some stupid prank teenager. yes, im 18, but i have written many other good articles. My writing is just as valuble as yours.

Maybe 30 years ago you would have understood. This site is a free encyclopedia serving EVERYBODY including teenagers/young adults. Though YOU may have never heard this term this is a part of spoken language for people my age. It is an appropriate article for an encyclopedia. THIS ISN'T JUST ME. THIS ISN'T JUST WHAT THE NOMINATOR THINKS. and about what? I have nothing against geos, kias or yugos(yugos are not loser cars except for the low performance ones). IVE ALREADY SAID I DRIVE ONE!!! I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT MY CAR. I DONT HATE IT. This isn't my opinion. This is a fact. Facts belong in an encyclopedia (or dictionary). Next time someone criticizes my article i want FULL details. I dont want a brief criticism, I want a reason why you say something. This will be more helpful. I am open minded if you give me a good reason why you want me to remove this article i may agree with you and i will. I WANT <b>FULL</b> details.

<li>Hi, man, slow down. I don't believe anyone thinks you're being insulting, they just think that dictionary definitions belong in Wiktionary, not Wikipedia. I liked your article, I just don't think it's encyclopedic. I hope you'll keep writing lots of articles. Contributors like you are the heart and soul of Wiki. I also wish that people would refrain from harshing on one another's age. It's behaviour that counts, not years. I stand by my vote to delete, and I think if you slow down and take a look at it, you might still disagree with me, but you'll understand my reasoning.

<p><b>From the Writer</b> Thank you very much for your constructive and polite criticisms and the understanding. Im sorry for my rudeness in the last debate article i wrote. I was only responding to the rudeness in the other preceding criticisms. I agree with TECannon about this article being put in Wiktionary. Please, next person suggest it be put into Wiktionary by puting the template on the bottom(so it says on top that this article is being moved to Wiktionary and not this article is being recomended for deletion) I will then remove it from Wikipedia.

<p><b>Writer's Response</b>My past criticisms are right i must be more respectful to people like you. Yes I was having fun on Yonex. I was expirimenting you are right. Brenco however is real. I actually know about it by googling my own name. I share my name with a notable buisness man who tried to industrialize turkmenistan after the soviet collapse. Though his efforts failed I think his attempt to develop a third world country is deserving of an encyclopedia article. My "vandalism" to Geo is explainable to me saying the term loser car is real. If you find this offensive i will stop adding that to that page. Please keep googleing Brenco, you have to eventually come across something about the company. However, thank you for your suggestions i understand how you think I made such things as a prank.</p>

<dd>Don't worry, Zis, I am familiar with this and neither PME nor the application to statistical mechanics is OR in the sense you mean. There are in fact quite a few books on this stuff. One of the best is:

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The strict Bayesian interpretation of statistics is internally controversial, but one of the nice things about this book is that avoids philosophy and sticks to the main point: this is darned useful stuff. There is also a nice article by J. N. Kapur in an Indian journal giving one of the best short introductions to entropy, which uses the PME point of view. Also excellent is Guiasu's article in the Mathematical Intelligencer, which also uses the PME point of view. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:46, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> This AfD seems to be based upon a misunderstanding as noted above by Jheald and Denni; I guess everyone should use {{underconstruction}, at least until they have established a reputation for writing good articles in a given area. In any event, PME is of course a thoroughly legitimate (and important!) topic in applied math. I'd be inclined to agree that the thermodynamic applications are sufficiently important to warrant a separate article. BTW, historically, Jayne introduced PME in the context of statistical mechanics, although nowadays that is probably best viewed as just one application, albeit a very important one. ---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> <a href="../../../h/i/l/User_talk%7EHillman_8f8b.html" title="User talk:Hillman">(talk)</a> 19:29, 2 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think the author isn't claiming that protest stickers were invented in 2005, but that 2005 is when the term 'reality tagging' was coined for the use of protest stickers in a particular political context in Lithuania. Removing all articles that are not notable in the English-speaking world may tend to perpetuate the systematic bias in Wikipedia some folks are concerned about. Still, this might be more of a Wiktionary thing. <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETECannon_4144.html" title="User:TECannon">TECannon</a> 11:31, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> No need to worry about systemic bias: this is a dicdef and would still be a dicdef if it was talking about American stickers. If we want an article about protest stickers, it should be called protest stickers or be a section in the <a href="../../../p/r/o/Protest.html" title="Protest">protest</a> article or something, not called by a word that was invented well after the act it describes. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 14:15, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Reality tagging is a new concept original enough to deserve its own Wikipedia article. It is not suited for Wiktionary because it is related to several new and fast-changing concepts, firstly tagging. Tagging itself is a new and developing technology (only started to be used in mainstream web services - even Yahoo 360 is still in beta only). This and the term's use by a movement may mean that the term undergoes some changes in its meaning relatively quickly (I happen to be interested in electronic tagging - the technologies and uses are from mobile phones to shops - and moving ahead).</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it protest stickers? I think it's tagging, because there's a significant difference between protesting by slapping hate stickers on the doors like "Don't vote Bush" (unconstructively, almost by definition) or sticking stickers that give usual information to other users/consumers, suggestions on further human and political action, and carry a corrective/disciplining message? What if the movement adopts any of the new technologies (say, mobile phone tagging)? This will of course still be reality tagging - but only then the critics will consider it worthy of an article? So no chance of an Indian, African or Lithuanian concepts getting into Wikipedia - unless they use Western technology? Cool - what if the Chinese patented printing in the 12th century? I also support previous remarks on Wikipedia's (and Wikinews') bias. It's firsly a cultural bias. Also, just remembered following the links at the bottom of the article and reading that the concept (and presumably the term) has been featured in a major Lithuanian paper. Is it still a neologism, then? Should we wait for a book in English on that?</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, for starters, the first comment seems to be talking about something different to the actual article (*edit* Political stickers are certainly not a new concept). And the second one has already been addressed: this is a new term to describe an old form of protest. It's got nothing to do with the <b>place</b> the word came from, it's about the <b>time</b> it came from. If we are to have an article about protest stickers, it shouldn't be called by a neologism. At the most it should be a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stickers.html" title="Stickers">stickers</a>, which already notes their political significance. Thirdly, the second anon seems to have a rather weird pro-Bush POV. "Don't vote Bush" sounds very like a "suggestion on further human and political action" to me. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:06, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Dear Last Malthusian, from what I see I conclude that you avoided to address all the indirect questions and arguments found in my previous comments. Do you believe that the reality tagging (as described in the article) is closer to protest stickers (disregarding the several differences I pointed above) or to mobile tagging (like <a href="http://www.semapedia.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.semapedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.semapedia.org/</a>)? I believe that it's closer to Semapedia, Bango etc (because it has EVERYTHING to do with the concept of cellular or otherwise tagging and NOTHING to do with protest stickers except the <i>media</i> it uses in a certain country - presumably due to cost restraints. What you are saying is that Gandhi didn't invent the Freedom. But he achieved it a highly original way. You also advocate a very typical Anglo-American concept of "clear writing" - which refuses foreign (cough - French/European - cough) terms and prefers to use language as economically as possible, thus creating a formal speak stripped of most exitement and emotion, full of HOME-INVENTED neologisms ("folksonomy" comes to my mind; never heard of it in other languages; it's wikipedia site even states it's a neologism!) - just like your brief/non-existent response to my questions. Because it was you who didn't respond, please have another opportunity to do so - look at the 4 points bellow:</li>
</ul>
<p><b>reality tagging</b> <b>neologism</b>: refuted (used by mainstream media in the country of Lithuania) <b>similarity with historical meaning of "protest stickers"</b>: sticker media; other concepts bearing such similarity are price stickers (1,99), discount stickers (2 for 1), etc. <b>similarity with future meaning of "protest stickers"</b>: probably non-existent; mobile or RFID technologies will replace the use of sticker media in countries/by activists that can afford it. <b>time</b> (if you refuse to believe the 3 above arguments - for reasons that escape me): as a person said above, the term "reality tagging" was first used in 2005 in a Lithuanian context. Does anybody disagree?</p>
<p>To finish with - why is Flash Mob in Wikipedia? Isn't it just a good-old protest mob, or just mob? Does it's coordination with new technologies (mobile phones and the internet) make it a new concept, the (usual) political pointlessness of the act, or the attention of Anglo-American corporate media, like CNN and BBC? Or maybe a similarly titled book by an American author (Howard Rheingold)? Was it that an American invented "flashmobs" - or was he the first/the only one who cared to advertise them on CNN? Regards.</p>

<li><b>weak delete</b>. Their number one on the mp3.com.au download chart would make them notable under the music notability guidelines (I presume it includes download charts?). But other than that there really isn't enough notability here. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFrankh_e0f2.html" title="User:Frankh">frankh</a> 20:30, 30 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I personally dont think #1 on mp3.com.au makes them particularly notable -- I'm also confused as to how they got that ranking at all, considering the extremely low quality of the recording they made -- I'm not referring to the MUSIC specifically but to the production of their demo. -- While their music does seem amatuerish to me, i dont think that should particularly be criteria for deletion... I dunno it all points to "garage band". We dont have any info on how mp3.com.au does their rankings, like if it could be stuffed with a simple "vote" or "download" script. or anything. Yeah.... omglol... <a href="../../../t/a/s/User%7ETastemyhouse_e8e3.html" title="User:Tastemyhouse">TastemyHouse</a> 20:48, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I Think having them #1 on mp3.com.au makes them very notable. People on other charts, such as the overall chart... are bands such as 'Fall Out Boy', one of Australia's leading bands. I understand Mp3.com.au judge there ratings on per download, per cookie/IP Address, Therefor not to have people 'upping' themselfs by downloading excessively. Also, this is not the only avenue people will hear the song... people may here it at one of Reverie's Gig's and go home really liking the song, and download it. So the fact that this band, no matter how good they actually are, cannot afford time in a recording studio to preduce a perfect copy, is irrelavant, if people are downloading the song because they like it before they heard it on mp3.com.au.</li>

<li>Weak <b>Delete</b> - it appears to be a pet theory of a single journalist, per nom. I find the thesis not particularly credible, since only a tiny minority of women have terminations anyway, and people become more conservative with age; children of conservative parents are often very liberal as a reaction against those parents. Not that credibility is a criterion, but a hobby horse of one journalist / commentator with no evidential basis is decidely unencyclopaedic. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 21:49, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<p>1) the fact that the US census is over makes this much less notable, 2) it's just arbitraryly drawn district around Searsport and is not the same as the Searsport town lines 3) it makes for a confusing search when trying to find Searsport, Maine (the town) (evidenced by the history that categorized this as a town when it's not the town) and 4) it's just not adding anything useful to Wikiepdia when there is a good article with same statistics about the actual town in place. It's nothing more than a list of out of date statistics concerning an arbitrary ditrit (that no longer exists, because the census is over) that is better covered in another article. Even a merge would be a waste of time. Please delete this.Gator(talk) 19:51, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP</b> The nominator is committing a fallacy...first of all, the census information is legally valid until the next census. Second, the 2010 census likely will use the same lines as those for the 2000 census. Also, some census-designated places have been very large and significant, and some later became cities (such as Sandy Springs, GA, pop 85,781).

<li>KEEP* - My vote is to keep this article. It is well written and documents an incident (the AP story about 'Snowball' and the subsequent media fuery -- that prompted a change in US government policy relating to evacuees being allowed to take their pets with them. This change in FEMA policy would likly not have occured without the story of Snowball's plight. (left by 68.99.130.81)</li>

<li>Listcruft is shorthand for unmaintainable, arbitrary and unencyclopaedic lists. Cruft is essentially electronic flotsam. The problem with lists of this type is that unless they are studiously miantained they end up being misleading, either through absence of notable examples of which the author is personally unaware, or because the author loses interest, or whatever. This is distinct form categorisation, which is self-maintaining (many Wikipedians spend hours adding correct category tags to articles). So a category for music in triple metre would show notable songs in triple metre - that is good. A list of sings in triple metre is always going to be arbitrary (indeed, the selection of tripel metre is itself arbitrary), and <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 13:13, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am going to suggest that discussions here should be transparent. Contributors coming here should be able to understand what is being discussed even if they are not privy to the private short-hands of long-term followers of deletion discussions.</li>
<li>This is your personal definition of "listcruft"? It is not defined anywhere on the wikipedia? How can anyone have any confidence that the other people who use this term mean the same thing by it as you do?</li>
<li>The perceptions that an article is "unmaintainable", "arbitrary" or "unencyclopaedic" are not listed as valid criteria for deletion.</li>
<li>Other contributors have suggested that this should be a category, not an article containing a list. Categories can be, IMO, a very weak reed. Some categories work well. A lot dont. There are categories where you look at the items, and are mystified how anyone could ever think they were related. With a list, the list is prefaced with the criteria for inclusion. Take a look at a <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_rants_What_is_special_about_Holland__19d8.html" title="User:Geo Swan/rants/What is special about Holland?">short rant I wrote about non-obvious categorization</a>.</li>
<li>The design of the wikipedia software makes lists innately more maintainable than categories. You can put an article that contains a list on your watchlist. And, when someone modifies that article, you can examine how it changed, through the history mechanism, form your opinion as to whether the edit was questionable. But there are no watchlists for changes to categories. The interested person doesn't get advised when questionable entries are made, or when a vandal deletes the category from an article that does belong. -- <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeo_Swan_4edb.html" title="User:Geo Swan">Geo Swan</a> 15:54, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>- I started this song list with the intent that it mostly cover songs from the 1990s and later in an effort to show that 3/4 and 6/8 has had a resurgence in popularity and commercial vitality. It used to be more or less reserved for Honky Tonk, Country, Blues, Jazz, etc, but now it's quite popular in Metal (Tool, Perfect Circle, Chevelle), Indie (Quasi, Elliott Smith, Death Cab For Cutie) and even rap/ hip-hop (Camron, Outkast). And as far as List of songs in 5/4 time? List of songs in 7/4 time? goes, those songs are contained on <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_works_in_irregular_time_signatures.html" title="List of works in irregular time signatures">List of works in irregular time signatures</a>. I hope to convince y'all that this list is NOT trivial and if it becomes unmaintainable (i.e. too long) it can be separated into shorter lists covering shorter time spans. And it's a <i>time</i> signature, not a <i>key</i> signature. I think it's a real trend that is going on in modern American music right now, but I do realize that it's beneath most peoples' radars. Most people just don't think that way about music. Can anyone back me up here?

Imagine if we argued that way about Wikipedia itself -- "Well, it's so large, there will always be crappy articles around the edges that we can't get to." Does that mean we flush Wikipedia down the toilet because we don't want to maintain it?

Every day hundreds of new songs are written. And 3/4 is not new, I have songs going back centuries written in 3/4.

<li>Okay, cool. So we actually agree on something. I guess the part we disagree on is the process of actually supplementing the triple meter concept. I personally don't think this list needs to be deleted to do that, though I think we agree we may have to change it substantially -- rename it, change criteria, etc. Because wiki isn't paper, we don't have to <a href="../../../b/u/r/Burninate.html" title="Burninate">burninate</a> this one before making a new one.

<li>I think we always did agree fundamentally. And as to whether the solution is to scrap this page and create another one, or change this page in outline and concept then redirect it to a new name which more accurately reflects that new (and encyclopaedic) purpose - well, perhaps that is a difference which makes no difference&#160;:-) As soon as new content is added to the page to reflect the changed direction which, as far as I can tell, most of us seem to agree is worth having, I will change my vote. Since the songs listed are in genres with which I am largely unfamiliar, being more interested in opera, madrigals and oratorios, I cannot myself really contribute in that respect. I guess I'm always goign to have some problems with the kinds of things that get into Wiki, especially when fans pad out articles on bands with a fan base in the dozens to be longer than articles on the likes of Bryn Terfel, but there you go. It is the modern way, as documented by the numerous "x best y of all time" lists which, if voted by the publis, are always dominated by this year's entries. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 15:08, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wow. I was just making a list that is of interest to me and other musicians (as opposed to music fans...big difference...sorry if that seems snotty) and I've definitely sparked a debate about a larger issue. Articles don't have to be interesting to everyone to be deemed non-listcruft. I mean, I couldn't <i>personally</i> give a shit about a list of amino acids, microbials, etc., but I'm really glad that someone people do care. By the way, I think some people are voting to delete here based simply on the fact that it gives them an excuse to use a cool new nonce word. Yeah, listcruft, cool. Guys..don't knock what you don't understand. If 3/4 or 6/8 (or any signature but common, really) makes a splash in the music market, it's out of the ordinary. An article on my theory would be original research, but a list is verifiable (3/4 is not a theory) AND maintainable. I'm glkad that someone polices new article creation, but some of you are going overboard, as others have pointed out.70.226.157.116 17:45, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Don't knock what you don't understand?" How patronising is that? 3/4 time is not a brand which can "make a splash" on the music "market", it's a musical metre which has been around for at least 350 years. And yes,I am a musician and have spent may hundreds of hours around other, much better musicians. So, if the purpose of your article is to document a resurgence of interest in triple metre in a particular genre, then do just that. If it's to say why triple metre is interesting, cool. If (as at present) it's just a list of the songs you could think of at the time which are in 3/4, then I urge you to contribute to my "<a href="../../../c/r/u/Cruft.html" title="Cruft">list of things on the second shelf up at Waitrose, Caversham</a>". - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 17:58, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It sounds patronizing <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a>, because I figured if I can't make you see that you're over-policing based on your lack of interest in a given topic, then I might as well try to make you think that you don't understand the significance of the topic, which I still believe. Guess that didn't work because you're an award-winning musician. And why are you so hung up on 3/4 being old? I know that, I think we all do. You seem to not read what others have written on this page or choose not to respond because you're savoring the thought of deleting something. I mean, we're all slightly nerdy for being wikipedians, man, but get over yourself. And I saw nothing on <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> that applies to this list. I think you're stretching the rules to facilitate your deletion-happy view of what wiki should be. I'll be adding to this list and hopefully other people will too.

<li>Perhaps, then, you should make some effort to understand my objections rather than positng further patronising comments. Did I say I was not interested in songs in triple metre? No. Actually I am. I am a singer, I am interested in songs. I am interested in music of all kinds, and as a long-time Brubeck fan I am particularly interested in music in unusual time signatures. What I object to is a list which makes no attempt to set out why it should be any more interesting than the list of things on the second shelf up at Waitrose. An article on triple metre, noting why it is unusual in certain genres and pointing out notable examples, would be interesting. I'm not going to write that because I have little knowledge of songs written since about 1940, and insufficient knowledge of the various current genres to make an informed comment. I might well contribute to such an article in the areas about which I do have knowledge. But this is just a list of songs in an arbitrary metre <i>which makes no attempt to establish why such a list might be of any interest or relevance</i>. If it aims to be a complete list of all songs written in 3/4 since a given date, it is pointless as it will always be both incomplete and out of date. If it's a list of notable songs in that time, in some arbitrary genres, what defines the genres which are included or not included? Who is going to look for or read this article, and with what purpose in mind? <a href="../../../i/s/n/WP%7EISNOT_f5c2.html" title="WP:ISNOT">WP:ISNOT</a> an indiscriminate collection of information. And I am not "deletion happy", I have voted keep on several AfD votes. I have also voted delete on an article I contributed myself! I really cannot see that a list of some of the songs in a given metre, which fails to establish why being in that metre is itself notable, and which makes no retence to completeness, is a useful addition to Wikipedia. Far better to document <i>why</i> 3/4 is unusual, and give a list of interesting or notable examples. That would be encyclopaedic. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> 13:17, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A quick perusal of the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lists.html" title="List of lists">List of lists</a> pages shows many lists that make no attempt at completeness i.e. Czech writers, businesses, books- books for crying out loud! Would you say that since the list of books is always going to be incomplete that you might as well not have it at all? I hope not. This page here can be tagged with a "this list is incomplete, please add to it, etc" disclaimer that I see all over wiki. And there is nothing about this list that makes it inherently arbitrary. It willl be as inclusive or specific as users care to make it. I don't think that 'WP:ISNOT an indiscriminate collection of information' applies here. The criteria for inclusion (triple meter) might potentially (hopefully) lead to a huge number songs eventually being included, but it is not arbitrary. Now, if someone proposed making a list of songs in common time, I would be first in line to say that it was a horrible idea. But 3/4 and 6/8 combined make up only a drop in the ocean of common time. Being a musician <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a>, I hope you can understand that it might be nice for a fledgling musician to have a list with a wide variety of songs to choose from in order to master a fairly common, yet often much overlooked time signature. Please go to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lists.html" title="List of lists">List of lists</a> and start counting the number of lists (and all the thousands of hours of work that those lists represent) you would have to delete from wiki if you held them all to the same criteria that you're trying to hold this list to.144.92.184.55 00:45, 1 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Serious discussion of this is underway. Many man-hours worth of unencyclopedic content may go. If you know any list you think unencyclopedic, nominate it at AfD.

<li>Yes, good question "Would you say that since the list of books is always going to be incomplete that you might as well not have it at all?". Answer: yes. That list is even more unencyclopaedic than this one. The number of books is as close to infinite as makes no difference, so the list here is actually the list of books whichi people who could be bothered to update the page, have heard of and can be bothered to add to the list. Utterly pointless, unencyclopaedic and POV in that its selection criteria are completely arbitrary. I'm with Xoloz, these lists can go on user pages or some other place.

<p><b>Keep</b>! I have found this page very useful. It could be improved, but heck that's what's a Wiki is for. I've Googled for ages and found nothing as comprehensive. Since the distinction between 6/8 and 3/4 is rather subjective it makes sense to keep the 'triple meter' grouping but thbe page would be more useful if it at least attempted to tag songs to one or the other (or 12/8, another triple metre, for that matter, used in the massive hit Everybody Hurts by REM). So I've added that&#160;:-) <a href="../../../s/n/g/User%7ESNG_1794.html" title="User:SNG">SNG</a></p>

<li>I am pretty certain that 12/8 is not triple metre,it's a compound double, like 6/8. The score for Everybody Hurts starts with a two-in-a-bar bass (<a href="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0047368" class="external free" title="http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0047368" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=mn0047368</a>, requires free plugin), which also indicates a compound double metre.

<li>Someone has now linked this article from <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_metre.html" title="Triple metre">triple metre</a> - which rather misses the point. The problem with this article is that it makes no attempt to be encyclopaedic (for example, it does not state its inclusion criteria). I created <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triple_metre.html" title="Triple metre">triple metre</a> as a place where the fact of it being unusual could be discussed, and as a way of avoiding this unencyclopaedic list. Gaaah! - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> 08:20, 4 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This list now includes at least one example from every year between 1990 and the present and at least five people have contributed and I hope many more will start. I tagged this article with the dynamic list disclaimer, so now EVERYONE will know that it isn't complete, as if anyone with enough interest to read it wouldn't know that already. It DOES state its inclusion criteria (Songs in triple meter!) but <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis Guy, you know?</a> claims over and over again that it doesn't. The criteria could lead to a long list, but that doesn't mean that there are no criteria (and excessive length is a 'problem' easily dealt with). And if by unencyclopedic you mean it wouldn't be found in a paper dictionary then, so what. Go find <a href="../../../m/o/d/Modest_Mouse_5a84.html" title="Modest Mouse">Modest Mouse</a>, <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitol_Records_df10.html" title="Capitol Records">Capitol Records</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/i/Seinfeld.html" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>, <a href="../../../r/o/c/Rock%2C_Paper%2C_Scissors_c19c.html" title="Rock, Paper, Scissors">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a>, or <a href="../../../h/o/n/Honda.html" title="Honda">Honda</a> in a paper dictionary. I think these are all things worthy of inclusion, but you feel that the space limitations (not to mention hard editorial choices conderning space vs. inclusiveness) of a paper encyclopedia should apply to an electronic one. The inclusiveness is what most wikis love and you don't get it. I think this is a major flaw in your view of wiki. I know you're gonna have some super-smart reply with this, but I don't care...I'm done butting heads with you. It was fun for a while...no, it was fun for YOU...I was just trying to save a worthwhile list from being erased. I'll let wiki voters look at the article, see if they think it has merit, and decide from there. Ta Ta144.92.184.70 01:38, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The list is completely arbitrary. The wider the timescale you assign, the more incomplete and unencyclopaedic it becomes! We've already had one erroneously attributed (12/8 is comopund double metre not triple). I don't see any point to it.

<li>If this was an obscure quantum physics term or ethnic music group, maybe we could talk about systemic bias against certain subjects. But this is a pre-school playgroup, and childcare is hardly an obscure topic. There is a difference between a subject which most people don't know about, like quantum physics and ethnic music genres, and a subject which most people don't <i>want to</i> know about, like playgroups in a certain area. This falls into the latter category, being of no interest to anyone except parents in the playgroup's area (which places it even more firmly in the ad category). --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 10:25, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Sorry, but that argument's just not true. Plenty of vanity articles deleted on AfD are 'verifiable'. A small website, or a forum/Usenet posting, or even an article in the local paper can all 'verify' the existence of a non-notable person - all those apply to me just for starters. But we delete them anyway because we do, in fact, consider articles which are devoid of interest to anyone but the people concerned unfit for Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Don't be too harsh on yourself. Judging by some of the responses, there are actually people in favour of giving any group of snotlings automatic notability. So I guess there'll be some genuine playgroup articles on AfD pretty soon. Hell, if yours is to be deleted under WP:POINT instead of WP:NOT, then someone could just recreate it saying it was of genuine interest. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:52, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Please Keep</b> since, frankly, I find it one of the most interesting, enlightening, and complete article I see. Also, I don't see Zpb52 making any effort to save his own page. When I created my first page, I closely monitored it, and have edited it for content. Frankly, I want it to stay as it is. For one thing, it provides information for new clones, and helps them understand the show. Second, its detail is unsurpassed. Finally, participation is through the roof. If you're going to delete it, you'll have undone the work of literally dozens of readers and listeners. This isn't some obscure cartoon or late night show. This is 'the' place to learn about the show. You are going to kill your own baby without trying to fix it? Get a life.

<li>Well, since you brought that up, neither is nominating a perfectly valid article for deletion <i>not</i> because you want it deleted but because you want it cleaned up but can't be bothered to do it yourself or even use the existing Wikipedia tools, such as {{cleanup}} or submitting the article to the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_Taskforce_2cbb.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce">Cleanup Taskforce</a>.

<p>Kosovo is under United Nations control and there are 17,000 NATO troops and 2,000 international policemen. In presence of this international body Kosovo can not be a more appropriate place for crimes than a country like Serbia, where only Serbs rule.</p>
<p>I do not hold that there is no crime in Kosovo, but not in that stage that should occupy entire pages of an encyclopedia. I think it is more valuable to write about Serbian genocide in Kosovo rather than trying to discredit UN, NATO, USA and EU.</p>
<p>I think Wikipedia should consider the fact that pages that contain information about Kosovo are often out of NPV because of Slavic tendencies to present UNMIK as an dictatorship founder.--<a href="../../../g/e/t/User%7EGetoar_7871.html" title="User:Getoar">Epirus</a> 04:02, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article looks encyclopediac enough to my eyes. Does not seem to be much in need of even clean-up. Needs perhaps more content. Surprised to see it put up as Afd; perhaps needs to be expanded rather. However I don't know very much about her and am too lazy to research something to expand the article.

<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax (based on current content). Influential, critically acclaimed novelists who have touched the lives of many generally have at least one book in print, particularly if they are contemporary (the article says she was born in 1986). The only Victoria Escobar known to the book department at Amazon.com is the one found by Capitalistroadster, whose only book was published in 1995 (when our Victoria was 9 years old) and is now out of print. I doubt that the Victoria Escobar who wrote "El sexto hombre" is notable, but this article is not about her and I'm not calling her a hoax. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 00:13, 29 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
