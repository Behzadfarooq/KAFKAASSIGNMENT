<li>Having just read the entry for <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">Fancruft</a>, I reluctantly agree that a musical tour of a big name artist is an event large enough to justify its own page. However, I favour retaining information about future tours within the artist's main page and only forking off a separate page after the tour has occured and the level of detail has risen sufficiently for the separate page to be clearly larger than a stub (and for there to be no doubt that it's not promotional in nature). I'm not familiar with Wikipedia procedures; If it's deleted now can it come back later? <i>...at 08:33, 2005 Feb 16 <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrisjohn_8e7f.html" title="User:Krisjohn">Krisjohn</a> forgot the twiddles</i></li>

<li>Did we mention that it's supposed to be an encyclopedia, not an obsessed fanboy shrine? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 10:27, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Information about major tours by popular artists would fit nicely in a music encyclopedia, and I don't think it says anywhere that WP limits itself to being a "general" encyclopedia. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 10:44, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: I can't think of any music encyclopedia that has entire articles about individual tours by particular, ah, artistes.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I wouldn't mind a list of Ashlee Simpson tours with brief descriptions on each, but this is becoming too specific. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 11:04, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I guess that would be nice, but it doesn't excuse Wikipedia from the task of having a general article on the tour. I hear there's a music wiki now, but I don't see people running around deleting music articles left and right. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:44, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> this is getting absolutely ridiculous. Enough already. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:43, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as unnecessary detail for insufficiently notable performer; speculative, with no verifiable content except a schedule of future events; and for the not-quite-policy reason that WP has already VfD'ed other Ashlee-excess-detail breakout articles. This has already gotten into past rounds of Requests for Comment and I hope it ends instead of leading to feuding. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:51, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Speculative? Everything in the article is factual and verifiable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:56, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>And appealing to precedent doesn't make much sense. As I recall, four Ashlee articles have been kept (POM, Shadow, La La, Auto sales&amp;charts) and two have been deleted (Auto album design, Auto promo &amp; publicity). <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 14:59, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oops, what about the articles about Ashlee on SNL and Ashlee on Mad TV? Did those slip your mind? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:06, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. It might be acceptable to have one article with a list of all of her tours. This isn't Ashlipedia. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 15:04, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fine. We can consolidate all the information on her concerts past present and future onto this article if it gets kept. But there's no sense in deleting it. The fact is, people will find this article useful. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:09, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Wouldn't it be easier and more productive to create a new page such as List of Ashlee Simpson tours and use the existing information as a starting point? I'm not sure how keeping this article (US tour, 2005) would be helpful to readers or editors. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 15:15, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>We can always just move it to another title if we decide to do that. But keep in mind this is her first real tour <i>per se</i>, although I could still write some stuff about her 2004 concerts. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:22, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concur with Carrp, make one such list, under the most generic title (i.e. not one ending in US. 2005). If list happens to have only one tour, I believe we should <b>merge</b> with main A.S. article. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 15:26, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just as with all other musicians, and indeed all other articles in general, breaking out discographies/tour lists/biographies is only warranted when the size of the relevant section in the main article becomes unwieldy. This is most definitely <i>not</i> the case for a musician's <i>very first tour which hasn't even occurred yet</i>. <b>Delete</b> this groundless fork, and let the already existing tour section of <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> expand in the normal way. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:03, 2005 Feb 16 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, or <b>merge</b> back into the main article if more detail is required there. The tour hasn't even had its first performance yet. An article <i>may</i> be warranted if something particularly noteworthy (in the context of popular music, not just Ashlee Simpson) happens on the tour.

<li>Putting this specific VfD aside for a moment, I strongly disagree with the idea of creating an article with the intention of deleting it in the future. If an article's subject is encyclopedic today, it won't become unencyclopedic in the future. Even if it was no longer notable in the future, it would still be encyclopedic because it <i>was</i> notable at one time. Getting back to this VfD, I don't like the idea of such a specific article. Are there going to be separate articles if there are tours in 2006 or 2007? What about tours in countries other than the US? I support the creation of <b>one</b> article, such as List of Ashlee Simpson tours. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarrp_dc22.html" title="User:Carrp">Carrp</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/r/User_talk%7ECarrp_aa18.html" title="User talk:Carrp">Talk</a> 18:09, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>And if you vote keep, that's what we'll have. But if this deleted, then the precedent will be set not to have articles on tours, which I think is ridiculous. Think how many people will go to these shows, and how many of them there are. Not only that, but it's going to be featured on the reality show, which makes it even more notable. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 18:43, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, how many articles on tours do we currently have?

Nobody seems to have bothered to put up articles about any of the enormous single-artist insternational tours that have happened every year for decades. If major world tours don't get articles, then why should this single-country tour have one? If all tours should have articles, then we should focus on the major tours by the likes of Madonna, U2, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, etc. before we bother with Ashlee trivia. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:13, Feb 16, 2005 (UTC)

<li>We have a paltry stub on the <a href="../../../b/l/o/Blond_Ambition_Tour_45ad.html" title="Blond Ambition Tour">Blond Ambition Tour</a>.

<ul>
<li>See, you seem to be assuming that tours don't have articles simply because nobody has had time to create them yet. Instead, I'd say that tours don't have articles because most people feel they're not encyclopedic. Example: Madonna's Re-invention Tour was probably the most important tour of last year (certainly the highest-grossing) and the folks over at the <a href="../../../m/a/d/Madonna_%28entertainer%29.html" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna (entertainer)</a> article have discussed the tour in the main article, complete with two pictures, rather than spinning it off. If any recent tour should have an article, it should be that one, but it doesn't, because it's just plain not necessary. Think about it: imagine somebody really did want to use Wikipedia to research Ashlee's tour. Which is more logical... that they'd look for it on the Ashlee Simpson page, or that they'd type in "Ashlee Simpson U.S. tour, 2005"?

<li>According to the article it is indeed her <i>only</i> tour. It began <i>today</i>.<br />
We have a <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_writing_better_articles_3c0a.html#Long_article_layout" title="Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles">guide to writing better articles</a>, which recommends forking sections when they grow too big. We also have plenty of examples of this in action, such as <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>.<br />
<a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashlee_Simpson_fc55.html" title="Ashlee Simpson">Ashlee Simpson</a> <i>already has</i> a section for what she's intending to do in 2005. It hasn't grown anywhere near large enough to warrant a fork, given that this is an artist with exactly one tour ever that hasn't really happened yet. Indeed, the fork is barely longer than the section in the main article itself, and the main article already has nearly all of its content. This fork is groundless.<br />
In other cases where there has been an edit war in the main article, followed by one of the participants then forking off xyr own private articles on sub-sub-topics that are simultaneously being edited collaboratively in the main article, we stop them. The creationism/evolution, Zionism, eastern Europe, Pakistan, China, big bang, and other debates may be higher profile than a debate about a singer on MTV that most people have never heard of, but they are all the same when it comes to article forking.<br />

<li>Ooh, good point regarding a "throwaway" article. That would be a rather ugly precident. Still, the more I think about it, the more I feel this should stay as part of a larger list. I like the idea of a List of Ashlee Simpson tours beginning with the info in this article if this is her first tour. We have a lot more ephemeral info than this floating around this site and the info might be better served as part of a larger list.

It is an encyclopedia, not a dumping ground. That means we have a duty not to mindlessly compile facts but to present them in a consise and usable manner, making judgments about which facts are important and which are not. Concert tours even by notable artists are largely non-notable, and even when they are notable, a short summary in that artist's article will suffice. The profliferation of articles on this insignificant singer who will be largely forgotten in a couple of years shows that detached, objective judgment is not being applied to this matter. <a href="../../../g/a/m/User%7EGamaliel_c9b8.html" title="User:Gamaliel">Gamaliel</a> 19:06, 16 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>There's plenty of judgment and objectivity. I consider a tour which will involve thousands of spectators and will attract some media attention (at least from MTV) to be notable. I do not philosophically agree with you about summarizing and making things concise. Regardless of what you say, that philosophy is the very opposite of the "wiki is not paper" notion—it's the mentality of the editor of a paper encyclopedia. Things should exist in a concise format to suit the general reader, but there are also readers who will want detail who need to be satisfied as well. On the other hand, I am not trying to fill Wikipedia up with trivia. I believe non-notable content should be removed.

<li>The problem is, of course, almost nobody -- and I <i>do</i> mean almost nobody -- agrees that the unvarnished raw boosterism trivia you dump into any article connected with Ashlee Simpson qualifies as "notable content". That you haven't understood this, that your invariable reaction to it is to wave your hands and pout, "I guess we disagree about that" instead of trying to understand that, and that you treat the slightest disagreement about or distaste for Ashlee Simpson as if it were a personal attack leads me to say: get help.

<li>Personal attacks? For God's sake <b>read what I wrote</b>. Step back and compare your behavior with the analogous behavior I cited.

ArbCom made some findings on your behavior and imposed sanctions less than a month ago, and you've been blocked <b>three times</b> for violating them.

<ul>
<li>No, no, Calton, I've never said I'm 100% right or anybody else is 100% wrong. My "misbehavior" has been awfully mild—I haven't told anybody to "get help" yet, for one thing—but when I have reacted too strongly to things I have apologized. Behind all your demonization of me is a simple content dispute regarding inclusion and notability, and yes, I do think I'm <i>basically</i> (not 100%) right in my positions there: so sue me. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 09:39, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>More strawmen. Of course you've never <i>said</i> you're 100% right: you merely <b>behaved</b> as if you're 100% right, and offered thin rationalization after thin rationalization for it. That, coupled with mischaracterizations and distortions (both of people's postings and of the situations) so wild that they can only be either pathological or deliberate leads me to seriously say -- not as a horrible insult as your snide little passive-aggressive line above tries to make it out to be -- get help.

<li>If your misbehaviour has been so mild, then why did it lead to an Arbitration case and sanctions against you just last month? The fact is that you've been defying consensus (one of the central principles of WP) on just about everything Ashlee-related. The landslide victories of the last four VfDs against Ashlee articles surely must tell you something. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 14:52, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, it's just politics. I try not to let that get to me. Of course the accusation that I defy consensus is absurd, too absurd to even bother refuting. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:36, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Okay, that last statement is breathtaking in its audacity. And what political games would ArbCom be playing, exactly?

And have you therefore filed your appeal with Jimbo Wales? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 23:13, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Surely you would consider that the enormous landslide victories of the VfDs against the last four Ashlee spinoff articles represent a consensus that WP just doesn't need or want more of the same? <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 19:06, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)

Just another president, just another war, just another natural disaster, just another nation-state, just another chemical element, just another classic of world literature, etc. Every national tour by a platinum selling artist is different, but they are all alike in that unifying characteristic. In the same way, every U.S. president is different, but all alike in that they are U.S. presidents. So the question is whether you care enough about the differences to notice them or place a priority on them, right? How can that be a determining factor in notability? If I happen to think, well, they all held the same office and governed the same country, so we don't need these articles, would that make them any less notable? No, because they are <i>famous</i>. If two things are independently famous, then they are each notable in their own right, regardless of whether you think they are similar or not. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 07:45, 23 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment:</i> Try the "will anybody care about this 50 years from now" test. Fifty years from now, will anybody still care about World War Two? Yes. Will anybody care about the past Presidents of the USA? Yes (well, maybe not <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Buchanan_f59c.html" title="James Buchanan">Buchanan</a>). Will anybody care about a particular tour by a pop singer? No. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 00:34, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>By comparing Ashlee to presidents and the like, you've mostly proved everybody else's point... So far, you've created at least 10 or so Ashlee articles, all told. How many world leaders have that many articles on WP? How many literary classics? How many nobel laureates? How many philosophers? How many inventors, research scientists, chemists, mathematicians, professors? I don't care if you listen to me or not, but for your own sake, listen to consensus: the Ashleecruft has gotten way out of hand. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 00:43, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>It was a theoretical comparison. Most of the things you name deserve far more coverage than Ashlee and her music do, so if they're lacking, somebody needs to get to work. But that's not to say the subject of Ashlee doesn't still deserve comprehensive coverage. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 00:58, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
