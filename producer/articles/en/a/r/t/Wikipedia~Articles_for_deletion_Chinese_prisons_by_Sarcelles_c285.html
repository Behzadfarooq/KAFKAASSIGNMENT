<p>This is a nonnotable prison stub of no real importance, the only information I could find on it all came from <b>Falun Gong</b> websites such as www.clearwisdom.net and www.clearharmony.net <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 18:02, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a newly created article and I see no POV statements. I would have liked to see this tagged as needing references for a while before a nomination for deletion was brought forward. Something may have to be done with the title, unless that is the proper name for the prison. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/v/User_talk%7EMovementarian_393b.html" title="User talk:Movementarian">Talk</a>) 18:30, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Wouldn't be deleted if it was in the US or UK so this shouldn't be either.

<li><b>Comment</b> - You wrote "Wouldn't be deleted if it was in the US or UK so this shouldn't be either. It is probably a much more notable than average prison and the nominator has provided no evidence or arguments to the contrary."
<ul>
<li>1) I have already provided evidence why these articles were not notable in the first place, they generate no hits when searched for, in fact one of them generated a grand total of 6 hits! These are not notable articles by any means. I noticed you wrote <i><b>probably</b></i> meaning you yourself do not know if these articles in fact notable or non-notable. Perhaps you should check it out yourself before jumping to conclusions and making statements such as "...It is probably a much more notable ..." Please search for them and tell me what you can find on them.</li>
<li>2)If it is ok to write up meaningless articles about non notable prisons in China, then would it be ok for me to write up meaningless stubs on every prison in my state? In fact if <i>I</i> were to do so, every last one of my articles would be nominated for deletion.

I seem to have misplaced the BBC story (forgive me, I didn't come to the library tonight to research Chinese prisons) but there is an Agence France Presse story from December 6, 2003 titled "Divisive issues crowd agenda as China's Wen prepares to leave for US" by Peter Harmsen which reads in part, "Wang Bingzhang, who is serving a life term in a Chinese jail, was planning a hunger strike to coincide with Wen's US visit, a rights group said. Wang declared his intention Friday to his brother Wang Bingwu, who saw him for 30 minutes at Shaoguan prison in southern Guangdong province ..." -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 02:40, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>OK... but what about the "prison enterprises"? These articles are choke full of these unverifiable information. The creator has a track record of lopsided edits (such as creating 100 city stubs just to put the name of prisons there and decry commie brutality ie. <i>blahblah is a city in blahblah province. it's prison has this many people. the prisoners are treated brutally. enditem</i>) and was banned/rfced/rfared in FOUR wikipedias for inserting dubious and unverified information and persisting in spamming them. It simply isn't a case for AGF, <b>every word</b> that he writes need to be undoubtably tracable back to a reliable source, and here it isn't the case. -- <font color="#FF0000"><b>Миборовский</b></font> <sup><a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html" title="User:Miborovsky">U</a>|<a href="../../../m/i/b/User_talk%7EMiborovsky_4d3c.html" title="User talk:Miborovsky">T</a>|<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Miborovsky_ed69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Miborovsky">C</a>|<a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Miborovsky_bb8e.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Miborovsky">M</a>|<a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font color="green">E</font></a>|<a href="../../../m/i/b/User%7EMiborovsky_4682.html#Wiki-not-so-fun" title="User:Miborovsky">Chugoku Banzai</a>!</sup> 03:16, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>If there is a larger problem with an editor beyond just these articles, that sounds like less of an issue for AfD and more of an issue for <a href="../../../r/e/s/Wikipedia%7EResolving_disputes_9a93.html" title="Wikipedia:Resolving disputes">Wikipedia:Resolving disputes</a> (begining, of course, with discussing the issue with the other editor). As far as the "prison enterprises" and "so-and-so coal mine" go, the January 3, 1981 New York Times article "Hundreds of Thousands Toil in Chinese Labor Camps" by Fox Butterfield seems to describe the topic of the <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heiliushui_Reeducation_through_labor_7fc4.html" title="Heiliushui Reeducation through labor">Heiliushui Reeducation through labor</a> article: "A few months ago, a white-haired 70-year-old former Protestant minister was released from a labor camp near the city of Datong in Shanxi Province in northern China. He had worked there in a coal mine, along with 10,000 other prisoners, scraping up chunks of black rock with his bare hands for 23 years. He had been sentenced to laodong gaizao, or 'reform through labor.'" I find the topic of the Chinese prison system to be appropriate for Wikipedia. If the problem is that these articles on single prisons are unexpandable stubs, then any user can merge them together and redirect them to Chinese prison system without going through AfD. If the problem is verifiability, then slap a cleanup-verify tag on the article while you work on verifying it. And again, if the problem is a dispute with another user, try to resolve it. I'd also suggest everyone avoid the over-the-top "What's wrong with you people can't you read" stuff. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 06:05, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>There, you proved my point. Either the article you read or the Wikipedia entry is bogus. In this case, I'd trust the Wikipedia entry even less. "Reeducation through labour" is NOT Laogai or Laodong Gaizao, which is "Reform through labour". "Reeducation through labour" is actually Laojiao, or Laodong Jiaoyang. This is the sort of inaccuracy, and if I might say, sheer crap, that <a href="../../../s/a/r/User%7ESarcelles_6733.html" title="User:Sarcelles">User:Sarcelles</a> wants to get on Wikipedia - he has professed that he knows next to nothing about these things, but is just copying stuff over from pro Falungong sites.

Take out the unverified information, all you have left is "so and so Falun Gong practitioner was imprisoned at this particular prison". At this rate, Wikipedia is going to become a repository for numberous "Falun Gong" arrestees. Is that it?

<li>Since <b>you people</b> are all for non-notable stubs and me being a college student in a college town that's known to have clashes between students and police after basketball and football games, would be ok if I were to spam dozens of stubs about the various police incidents where students have been arrested and how they claim the students were wrongfully arrested and violent force was allegedly used by the police? -- <a href="../../../a/b/s/User%7EAbstrakt_0f40.html" title="User:Abstrakt">Abstrakt</a> 04:27, 10 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>You get my point, and 99% of these "specific hits" are off of POV pro-Falun Gong websites such as www.clearharmony.net and www.clearwisdom.net with articles about Falun Gong practitioners being jailed or allegedly brainwashed, no mention of "coal mines" or whatever "prison enterprises".</p>
<p>Another point I'd like to make, just because something gets hits, it does not necessarily mean they are specific hits, for example I could search for lets say Paris Hilton and I could get a mass of unrelated hits for Hilton Hotels or Paris, France.

<p>If I was to search for example for "Miami Dolphins" the NFL team and I get results that have both "Miami" and "dolphin" in it but not about the "Miami Dolphins", that is <b>NOT</b> a specific hit.

<li>The "Laogai Handbook" is published by a Falungong organisation, which the last time I checked was a religious group and not exactly a forerunner in research into Chinese criminology. Unless the said handbook can be construed as a verifiable and trustable source, it's not. It also is quite puzzling how the <i>Laogai</i> handbook suddenly is talking about <i>Laojiao</i>... which are two separate matters altogether.
