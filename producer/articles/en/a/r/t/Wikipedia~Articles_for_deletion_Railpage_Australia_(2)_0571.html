<li><b>Keep</b>I Disagree. The site has been quoted in a number of major metropolitan newspapers (check the talk page for references), and has been frequented by high-profile politicians, as well as a number of journalists. It is quoted and referenced in a number of print magazines and video media such as Newsrail. Furthermore, they serve as a portal and hosting service for a significant number of volunteer and tourist operations including a number that are supported by Federal Government. The site is also referenced a number of times for tourist information on various state government tourism websites. Also, a number of wikipedia articles take data from railpage, as well as link to it. Are these third-party sources?</li>

<li>Being quoted is not sufficient. Please remember the criteria for notability: "being the <b>subject</b> (and not mentioned in passing) of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.". A quote in an article, etc that mentions Railpage in a single sentence or paragraph does not constitute being the subject of that article, and hence you can't use these mentions (or quotes) to demonstrate notability.

<li><b>Keep:</b> Note that the <i>content</i> of the site is being used as the subject of these works, such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics one (used as a secondary source), and the many newspaper articles it has been referenced in (the content, not the fact that the site exists).

<li><b>Comment:</b> Railpage was also noted in the Fairfax (Print) Press with several quotes from it's administrator in an article about Railfandom. Among it was: "Morgan is one of the administrators of Railpage.com.au, Australia's biggest online rail community that dates back to the dawn of the internet in 1992." ... "There are many more than a few. With up to 20 new members a day, Railpage has 10,000 registered users and boasts more than 500,000 posted articles." among other mentions. It was considered first on the list of notable Rail websites in Australia.</li>

<dd>Note that the criteria for notability lies along the lines of being the <b>subject</b> (and not mentioned in passing) of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.

<dl>
<dd>Bear in mind we're talking GUIDELINES for notability. But still, look at the opening lines of Notability(Web) "Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance, which can be significantly more up-to-date than most reference sources since we can incorporate new developments and facts as they are made known. See current events for examples". The Railpage Australia article describes the nature, appearance, and services the website offers. It goes further to detail some of the site's achievements (which can be added to by the looks here), it looks at the site's impact on the Railfan community, and touches on its historical significance (which can also be added to looking at the talk page). This article clearly is in the spirit of Notability(Web). It has been shown that the site is of significance due to its historical significance of internet in Australia. It has also been proven to be used as sources for major news outlets as well as government and a variety of print and radio media. Contributors also remember a number of print articles (which are unfortunately no longer available online) where the site itself was the subject. So, we see that content from the site is being used in reliable, well-known third-party publications - which makes it fit Criteria 3 of Notability.</dd>

<li>Do you really think that you can make such a blatant mis-statement and get away with it? To be "quoted" or "mentioned" in a seniors site or a site of railway links does not constitute notability: note the criteria for notability - "being the <b>subject</b> (and not mentioned in passing) of multiple, non-trivial, reliable published works, whose sources are independent of the subject itself.". Please point to non-trivial, reliable published sources in which Railpage is the <b>subject</b> of an article, and not simply mentioned in a single line or paragraph. Your fondness for contributing things that are patently false is well-known, please refrain from this passion of yours in this case.</li>

<li>Wikipedia is not the place to advertise, and this article doesn't read like an advertisement. Notability(Web) says: "Internet guides. Wikipedia articles should not exist only to describe the nature, appearance or services a website offers, but should describe the site in an encyclopedic manner, offering detail on a website's achievements, impact or historical significance", which this article clearly does. If there are ciation problems, these are soemthing that need to be edited to fix (citations provided), not have the article deleted. In future, please refrain from trying to suggest NPOV violation when YOU don't like the site in question. Your campaign of vandalism of the article does little to improve your character. Your suggestions on the James Morgan section were irrelevant and poorly considered - and despite two administrators and countless others telling you so, you continued to persist with this petty smear campaign. I suggest that it may be time for you to take a step back from the article, for it is you that refuses to come to consensus, and you who is intent on defacing the article.

<p><b>Keep</b>. With a website the size of this one, it is very difficult to find "third party" sources that are not directly involved (as I am). It appears that the push for deletion is coming from a (?)small group of former or disaffected members. The simple truth is that Railpage is the first stop for almost everyone seeking information about Australian railways, and this is reason enough for keeping the entry live.Latrodectus 14:58, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Delete.</b> Correction, I think one arbitrator disagreed with the subject, the other approached it from a neutral point of view and locked discussion with the subject material in place.</p>
<p>The incident was newsworthy being printed in an article in the Herald Sun. His actions were never properly explained, and there were calls for him to be removed at the time. <a href="http://http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t8839-0-asc-s30+crawford+busted.htm" class="external text" title="http://http://www.railpage.com.au/f-t8839-0-asc-s30+crawford+busted.htm" rel="nofollow">crawford+busted</a></p>
<p>I'll again use the comparision, if an leading individual of a company that featured an article here on Wikipedia was accused or convicted of a crime associated with his role at the company, the company of course would not condone the crime, but mention of that accused actions (even if found not guilty) if it was recorded in the mainstream printed media and the boards subsequent refusal to sack or reprimand the individual or publicly distance itself would surely rate a mention within that wikipedia article on that company.</p>
<p>Even if some people find mentioning his name objectional, It is my opinion that there should be some mention of this "small" "social controversy". Wikipedia has allowed mention the mention of "controversies" elsewhere - see Post-match "handbag incident". <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Super_14_Final" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Super_14_Final" rel="nofollow">Super_14_Final</a>.</p>
<p>I fear there will never be any consensus to any proposed changes even if there is only just a passing mention in the article of the "incident".</p>
<p>I did propose Arbitration, however others have proposed for reasons already indicated (uncited material, etc) that the article is a candiate for deletion.</p>

<dd>That's one problem. There's been no evidence tendered here to show that his alleged crime had anything to do with his role with Railpage.</dd>
<dd><span style="background:#B0ffff;">His actions were never properly explained...</span></dd>
<dd>I presume that his actions were explained to the court, and I further presume that you are claiming that his actions were never properly explained on, say, Railpage. But you've never properly explained why they should be.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> - the site is one of the world's biggest rail enthusiast websites and the biggest in Australia, I should think; it has been up and running a long time as well. I did a Factiva search and it came up with only a couple of useful links, but RP has been involved in the production of a national rail map, etc; it hosts and helps run the websites of a number of notable rail heritage groups. It's even being quoted on rail incidents - an article in the West Australian newspaper about a prang between two railcars in <a href="../../../t/r/a/TransPerth_4367.html" title="TransPerth">TransPerth</a>'s depot quoted Railpage as a reliable source! The original versions of the page were quite bad and needed sourcing, but when I asked the contributors they did so and would probably be happy to source the page again if needed. The incident in question with the Railpage moderator was mentioned on Rove Live. <a href="../../../j/r/o/User%7EJROBBO_3b9a.html" title="User:JROBBO">JROBBO</a> 00:53, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Its history as an early Australian website makes it notable, and the reliable sources that have beeb provide <b>do</b> count, and more are being brought to this Afd. For example, the abc article is talking about the St Kilda Tramway Museum, which is hosted online by Railpage at <a href="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.railpage.org.au/aetmsa/" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. The article needs to move from a focus about the equipment to being about the "society", its history and relevance to the community; e.g. list its activities like previous meets. Also, from what I read on the aus.rail newsgroup, it seems like there have been server issues, so if <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> can be found, or it can be phrased carefully, I think it is worth mentioning. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 01:07, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
