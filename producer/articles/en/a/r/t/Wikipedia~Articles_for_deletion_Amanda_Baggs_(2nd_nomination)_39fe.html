<li><b>Comment</b>: I think that in cases of borderline notability, whether or not a person wants an article should be taken into consideration.

<li><b>Comment</b>: When I talked about people not used to being written about, I did was not referring to Amanda specifically, but I meant that I expect that it is common for non-public people to not be used to being written about and would be uncomfortable to have a Wikipedia article, and that therefore, it should be reasonable to take a person's preference to not have an article into consideration in cases of borderline notability. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> In April 2006, the CNN stuff didn't exist, nor (AFAIK) did any other good secondary source, so notability was at that time a valid concern. The article could have been created and deleted a thousand times between then and now, but the new mass media cites change everything. Now that the CNN article exists, the article passes WP's <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html#The_primary_notability_criterion" title="WP:N">primary notability criterion</a> in exactly the same way other activists like <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jim_Sinclair_13ab.html" title="Jim Sinclair">Jim Sinclair</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/e/Sue_Rubin_3957.html" title="Sue Rubin">Sue Rubin</a> do. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> says <i>A topic is notable if it has been the subject of at least one substantial or multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other. ...

<li><b>Comment</b> "Just being interviewed about your (disability)" -- please let's be clear about the facts here. She was interviewed on CNN, about a YouTube video she posted to raise awareness of her disability, and (per CNN and her linked self-published material) is a longtime activist and self-advocate in disability rights. That is pretty clear evidence of consent and cooperation toward getting her message into the public eye, and unambiguously meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

If Amanda Baggs has decided (recently, not in April 2006, before she did the YouTube and CNN thing) that she wants the article removed, then I'll go along with that, even though I believe the article is compliant. Perhaps what would be more appropriate than deleting would be concerned editors watching the article and helping keep it up to par. best regards, <a href="../../../j/i/m/User%7EJim_Butler_5a6c.html" title="User:Jim Butler">Jim Butler</a><sup>(<a href="../../../j/i/m/User_talk%7EJim_Butler_4c38.html" title="User talk:Jim Butler">talk</a>)</sup> 19:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, but how do you know that she didn't change her mind between then and now, especially since she so recently consented to go through all the interviews and Q&amp;A at CNN? Not meaning to be contentious, Q0, just trying to ask the right questions. I don't see how the article does harm, being based not in <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> but rather in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know if Amanda has changed her views since February, 27 2006 about not wanting a Wikipedia article. <s>Even though the current article is not based on original research, I'm not sure it could go beyond being a stub since there is only one CNN interview to base it on.</s> I'll try asking Amanda on her blog if she has changed her mind about not wanting an article, though since she said she won't be writing much in the near future due to disliking the media attention, I don't know if she will reply. Given that she considers the media attention as a necessary evil to getting the information out and wished she was not the messenger, I would not consider the fact that she consented to a CNN interview to be evidence that she has changed her mind about the wikipedia article. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Necessary evil" sums up the issue well; Amanda recognizes that it's inherently hard for self-advocates to convey their ideas without some degree of attention to the messenger. I agree that the message is more important than the messenger, and I believe we can get it across in WP with or without an article on Amanda herself, although having the article would be more helpful than not for this reason: the ability to cite <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html#Self-published_sources_used_as_primary_sources_about_themselves" title="Wp:rs">self-published sources by the article's subject</a>. That would allow greater dissemination of Amanda's ideas, which is kind of the whole point of her activism, right? Either way, the CNN articles (again, there are three of them<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/02/21/autism.amanda/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/02/21/autism.amanda/index.html" rel="nofollow">[6]</a><a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/blogs/paging.dr.gupta/2007/02/behind-veil-of-autism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/blogs/paging.dr.gupta/2007/02/behind-veil-of-autism.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a><a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, Q0, not one) have lots of great quotes from experts that can and should be included in WP. (Along those lines, the article could indeed grow beyond stub status, via CNN and her own non-pseudonymous, verifiably self-published work.) Amanda, if you're reading this, I hope you understand my rationale, and am sorry if you didn't want this article to appear. If it stays, I and other editors will keep it well within appropriate boundaries; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is very clear about those.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I did not intend to raise stress levels and did not realize that this AFD would generate this much debate. I apologize if anyone has been upset by this. I should say that I do <u>not</u> speak for Amanda and can only go by what I have read from her blog. If Amanda says that she has changed her mind about her previous preference to not have a Wikipedia article, then I will retract my delete vote, and if possible, I will retract the AFD (I'm not sure if nominators can retract an AFD). Also, I think Jim Butler has a point that Amanda's blog entries and other writings can be used as references so I guess the article can grow beyond a stub. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 06:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi, I'm the subject of this article. My main concerns in the past were that the article in Wikipedia contained some information about me that was unintentionally inaccurate (as I recall, it was someone saying that I'd been institutionalized my entire childhood, which is not true, I was institutionalized on and off throughout my adolescence), but since I was the only source of information otherwise or of most biographical information about me, it would constitute original research to correct it or for that matter to write a biographical article on me at all. I still don't think there's much out there (given that I've only been in CNN, for a very short amount of time, and doubt I'm really a public figure), but I'm indifferent at this point as long as Jim or someone keeps on top of it for inaccuracies, since I know we're not allowed to edit articles about ourselves. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentmiaow_ab11.html" title="User:Silentmiaow">Silentmiaow</a> 15:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Yes, you have my firm commitment that I'll keep close tabs on this article (it it's retained) for inaccurate or inappropriate material(and I'm sure I won't be the only one). I also wanted to say that your hands are not tied with respect to editing; see these two sections from <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>: <a href="../../../b/l/p/Wp%7Eblp.html#Dealing_with_edits_by_the_subject_of_the_article" title="Wp:blp">dealing with edits by the subject of the article</a>; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Using_the_subject_as_a_source" title="WP:BLP">using the subject as a source</a>. Not only can you correct inaccuracies if you choose, it's no longer <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> to do so since self-published material by the article's subject is considered an <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html#Self-published_sources_used_as_primary_sources_about_themselves" title="Wp:rs">acceptable primary source</a> (as I mentioned just above, and within the parameters of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>: not just any random quote can or should be used). So you may make such changes, or feel free to contact me or another editor.

<li><b>Keep</b> The subject's desire to be in or out of WP is irrelevant, per precedents. I see three respected journalists through one credible medium CNN; to me that provides the multiple; however, the multiple criterion is being disputed at <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> and consideration of one strong source is being acknowledged by many without clear consensus. Clearly this is above trivial notice; whether it is important or not is not required by WP. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 20:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
