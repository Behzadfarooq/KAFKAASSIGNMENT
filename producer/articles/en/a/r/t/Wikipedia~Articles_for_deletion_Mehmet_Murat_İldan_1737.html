<ul>
<li>This article and all the articles on his books are a part of an aggressive self (?)-pr covering a growing number of wp editions; whilst he has little notability in english and even less in all the other languages. Note also the previous intro statement "<i>Following his <a href="../../../e/p/i/Epistolary_novel.html" title="Epistolary novel">epistolary novel</a>, The First Sorrows of Young Werther, he is regarded as a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romantic.html" title="Romantic">romantic</a> writer</i>", when the book in question is due to be published in february this year (now corected to march). When the article also stated that this unpublished <i>Young Werther</i> is his <i>magnum opus</i>, we an easily assume that this author not notable, <i>yet</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though an anonymous newbee User:Melanicool (<small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Melanicool_2a5b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Melanicool">contrib</a></small>) has corrected this, the most obvious errors in the biography, this is still selfbiograhy, vanity and spamming. It remains to be explained why he (<i>or his advocates</i>) wishes to make the impression that all of his books have an english title, as if they have been translated. And it is still a fact the he (<i>or his advocates</i>) is abusing wikipedia worldwide (or, actually, languagewide) severly in order to self promote beyond notability.</p>
<p>Please also note that all his alleged "books" have their own articles; though several of his listed plays (such as Journey to God, Alchemist's Wife, Goddesses also Die and Master Moliere is Marrying etc) has no information about publishing or stage performances; they are merely <i>manuscripts</i>. <a href="../../../o/r/l/User%7EOrland_69db.html" title="User:Orland">Orland</a> 09:01, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> the article, and <b>speedy delete</b> for all the plays and books articles that he also created here. None of them has been published with more than 3 000 copies, and some are still to be published... No sources except himself or the editor. He might be close from matching the criteria, but his creation of articles on himself on 30 different WP (half have already deleted or started a deletion procedure) is an incredible attempt to use the limited resources of WP for a worldwide self promotion.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> I wanted to give this a chance. Sites like google have limited effectiveness in searching for people who only operate abroad. But its hard to see how the case for notability has been made. I don't know how reliable the NewAbsinthe link is, but if there were more like it, I guess I could give this a pass. One of the proponents seems to think that merely publishing a book makes one notable and lists sites that sell his books. That is not the case. In other cases, proponents have described him as an emerging writer. Perhaps he can wait until he has emerged? Right now the massive sock operation leaves a bad aftertaste.<a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMontco_3514.html" title="User:Montco">Montco</a> 03:39, 26 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If I'm the proponent cited as saying that a published book makes one notable (there's another one who does more, but I was the first one), I feel I should clarify my position. I'd misread the nomination as suggesting that the <i>books</i> were unpublished, rather than the <i>plays</i>, about which I can also find nothing online. Obviously if a book is available online, it's been published. That said, as I understand the nomination now I see that the mere existence of the books wasn't really in question - and neither does it automatically confer notability. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 04:35, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> for all ancillary articles on plays and books. For the BIO: <b>Delete</b> or, at the very least, rewrite by someone who isn't directly related to the author by virtue of being...the author. There may be a case for inclusion on local site, as there is a review of <b>one</b> book on the Turkish tourism board website <a href="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/EN/yonlendir.aspx?17A16AE30572D3137A2395174CFB32E19EDC603C979CEB01" class="external text" title="http://www.kulturturizm.gov.tr/EN/yonlendir.aspx?17A16AE30572D3137A2395174CFB32E19EDC603C979CEB01" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but half a thousand words of ego-massage it is not.

<dd>A 'review', as you define it, is essentially nothing but a de facto admission of a work's existence. A review of 'Animal Farm' saying: "I can confirm this book is real; is made primarily of paper; was written by a man originally called Eric and is mostly about pigs" would not have gained Orwell an admission, and the reviews you source review nothing but the size of the book. Useful only if you're looking to buy a paperweight or a draft excluder. I still say <b>weak keep</b> on the Author page (and not the individual play/novel pages) provided there's an agricultural scale cull of the pooterism &amp; puffery.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScandrett_b5f9.html" title="User:Scandrett">Scandrett</a> 02:32, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't know what other people think, but to me that is <i>NOT</i> a review, that is a directory/index listing.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>, although I'll admit to not quite following what's going on here. A brief Google using the Turkish dotted-I spelling throws up <a href="http://kitap.antoloji.com/kisi.asp?CAS=33853" class="external text" title="http://kitap.antoloji.com/kisi.asp?CAS=33853" rel="nofollow">this site</a>, which seems to verify the existence of "Roses under Paris" ("Paris'in Altındaki Güller", I believe, although my Turkish is pretty bad) and probably others as well, so he seems to have published something at least. Whether or not this is a vanity press is something I can't comment on, since it requires more language ability than I have. The fact that the article has claimed that an unpublished book is his magnum opus is neither here nor there, since it's a content issue which is curable by editing rather than deletion. In terms of the English titles, I'm not sure what the normal policy is regarding books with foreign language titles, although I'd point to <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_Search_of_Lost_Time_a227.html" title="In Search of Lost Time">this tome</a> as evidence that perhaps it's legitimate to keep the titles as is, as long as the books have been published. On the surface, though, he seems to qualify as notable enough in Turkey, which I'd say makes him sufficiently notable here as well. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 10:02, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the article,When we check the page <a href="http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essex.ac.uk/alumni/pubs/nineties.htm</a>, we can see that the author has Master and Doctorate degrees in Economics from the University of Essex. Therefore, in the infobox, it is fair to write "Economist" as one of his occupations along with novelist and playwright... So I am not agree with the user Melanicool to remove the "economist" label. That info was correct. If you also see the page <a href="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/browse?&amp;CategoryID=113181</a>, the page rank on the right, it is fair to say that author has certain notability. Also, as we all know that PEN Clubs are important and serious literary organisations. In Turkish PEN's official web site, <a href="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" class="external free" title="http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56" rel="nofollow">http://www.pen-tr.org/en/writes.asp?catid=1&amp;name=2&amp;id=56</a>, we see author's some works published expilicitly in English. I believe this gives us some opinion that though he is an emerging writer, he has already some notability. I know from a friend living in the USA that author's novel Roses Underneath Paris can be found in certain bookshops in New York. The novel is not in English, it seems to be a great paradox, but it is not, because the book is read by the Turkish community living in the USA. Same applies to London or Münich as well. So I believe we must be fair on judging about the notabilty... We should also bear in mind that, checking his life story, author has lived about 9 years in England and he writes books where the events pass in England. So he is pro-England or England-lover writer as well... even only for this reason, I believe that an article about him deserves to be kept, improved and enriched... 25 january 2007.</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> the article, I am totally surprised to see that some users doubt whether this writer has published something at all! I am half Turkish, because my mother is Turkish.

There is a famous Publishing house on plays in Istanbul. You can find his book on their site as well: <a href="http://www.mitosboyut.net/index.php?option=com_productbook&amp;func=detail&amp;Itemid=30&amp;id=135" class="external free" title="http://www.mitosboyut.net/index.php?option=com_productbook&amp;func=detail&amp;Itemid=30&amp;id=135" rel="nofollow">http://www.mitosboyut.net/index.php?option=com_productbook&amp;func=detail&amp;Itemid=30&amp;id=135</a>.

I think there exist a germen internet book site as well, wehere especially Turkish-Germans can buy his or other Turkisk books.<br />
I have also seen that all the information in the article is verifiable. For instance in the article it mentions Absinthe: New European Writing Journal. I made a search on it. You can see his name appears in <a href="http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.absinthenew.com/pages/issue2.html</a>. In the article it mentions about AQT competition. I found information in this web page: <a href="http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html" class="external free" title="http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://undergroundtransit.blogspot.com/2005_04_10_undergroundtransit_archive.html</a> that his play became finalist. In short, all the information in the article is surely verifiable. About Magnum Opus, I have not seen such a thing; if there was, most probably it was an editing mistake. As user BigHaz said, it's a content issue which is curable easily by editing rather than deletion. I am sure his books will soon be published in England as well. Wikipedia is a paradise of information; we must not delete, but we must verify and edit any kind of information if found wrong. We must also know that no one can ever promote himself through wikipedia, but only by the good quality of his or her works. I have read his book Antiquary Arago's Diary (original title Antikacı Arago'nun Günlüğü), I believe he is good quality writer and he knows England very well. So my vote is to keep the article strongly.Faydunnaway</li>

I believe that English wikipedia users can and should benefit from the information and literary material given in the article. We must also keep in mind the considerable effort made to create this article. I suggest we respect the effort and the work.

<li>I shall elaborate a bit myself. First of all, the person which is object of the article we are discussing shares 8 or 9 of the 10 features attributed to the average Wikipedian. Secondly, countering systemic bias means countering the tendency to consider a major Turkish (or Italian, or Somali, or...) writer de facto less important than a minor English-speaking one, not allowing a minor one (independently from his nationality) to advertise freely, should this be the case here. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 23:24, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - As a tr.wp admin and probably the first reader of the WP article on him, I would like to provide you guys some information about this issue. First of all, it is Mehmet Murat İldan himself, who has been writing all these articles. So it's an autobiography. I personally don't see WP:AUTO as a reason to delete an article, as long as the person in question is notable. In that case i think he is, even though i've never heard of him in my life before his Wikiactivity. He is definitely not famous in Turkey, that i can assure you. But as an author of several books, i personally would consider him as notable. He has several awards, books published by Ministry of Culture etc. He clearly speaks very highly of himself and all his contributions are about himself, but my tendency to stay neutral no matter what pushes me to accept this person as notable.

<li>An administrator at the Norwegian (bokmål) Wikipedia noticed the concerted effort of spreading this biographical article to a great number of Wikipedias, and believing the effort to be self-promotion from an artist who probably doesn't meet Wikipedia's requirements for notability in any language made an extra effort of countering the apparent spam in like fashion. I believe that is more or less the core of this issue. __<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMeco_a6d9.html" title="User:Meco">meco</a> 18:49, 27 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>After considering the case, it does appear to be a case of a) an unprecedentedly elaborate <a href="../../../v/s/c/WP%7EVSCA_4f2d.html" title="WP:VSCA">VSCA</a> attack and b) an equally elaborate and rather unprecedented response to it by AfDing the articles everywhere. So, right now, I'd say <b>Weak Delete</b> unless there's definite proof that these books are indeed published or something along those lines. If this is indeed a case of vanispam, the author must be strongly cautioned to not touch the article too much further, but if the article subject's merits are okay, then there's really no reason to delete the article anyway. User conduct is not grounds for article deletion. So, basically, improve or let it go. I do have to say that if this article creation gimmick is really as elaborate as it seems like at this point, this is <i>most</i> frown-worthy. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 20:58, 27 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I wonder if it is a coincidence that the last two, very indignant, remarks come from unregistered, unsigning editors with very similar IPs: in one case this is the unique contribution to Wikipedia, in the other there is also a minor editing to the İldan article. I won't comment about the racism accusations. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 16:14, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Are we deleting this article because it is self promotion or because he's not notable? I mean, if the article was created by an established user, would you want it to be deleted? If an established user re-creates the article two months after the closure of this Afd, would the article get deleted and why? (WP:CSD A7?) What i don't understand is, why would self promotion be a reason to delete an article. Why don't we focus on notability and just neutralize the article? Does notability refer to how famous the person in question is or does it refer to the work he/she has done to deserve an article? I simply don't understand why we keep an article about Prince Harry's girlfriend and delete this one (or recreations in the future)? Not that i support this guy just because he's from Turkey (i got so close to blocking him on tr.wp), but i don't see any reason to relinquish information, just because it's been used for self promotion. --<a href="../../../v/i/t/User%7EVito_Genovese_5339.html" title="User:Vito Genovese"><font color="#008000"><b>Vito Genovese</b></font></a> 19:04, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Things are actually getting muddled by several non-pertinent factors: the suspect of self-promotion, the sudden appearance of the articles in several wikipedias, the comments by possible sockpuppets, the accusations of racism... All of which heats the debate and distracts from the actual issues of possible non-notability and possible lack of reliable sources. Nevertheless, some good points have been made. For instance, somebody pointed out the "Encyclopedia of Turkish Authors" <a href="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313D4AF1EF75F7A7968AD2159C2926A9E50" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/BelgeGoster.aspx?17A16AE30572D313D4AF1EF75F7A7968AD2159C2926A9E50" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> of the Turkish Ministry of Culture, in which İldan does not appear. It allegedly includes the 2023 "owners of the most important works in Turkish language". So it appears that İldan is, at best, the 2024th most notable Turkish writer, which does not appear very notable among Turkish writers (we are not even thinking of comparing him with writers in other languages). This is just to exemplify some of the points made about his notability. Then again, these points must carefully be found amid other less relevant arguments. --<a href="../../../g/o/o/User%7EGoochelaar_237d.html" title="User:Goochelaar">Goochelaar</a> 20:44, 29 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

Özen Yula is not in the list, but Ahmet Önel is in the list. Özen Yula is a famous Playwright in İstanbul... I am saying to you that that list is definitely not correct, not complete, politically biased, since Fethullah Gülen's name is there!... Also it is not the list of the Famous Authors, but it is the list of Turkish Authors. Do you also know that Ministry of Culture is no longer printing theatre plays? Why? because the government does not like theatre!.. Oh, dear friend there are millions of things you don't know about Turkey, about what is going on in Turkey... any way, I will sleep now! But before sleep I will give you one more name, probably you may know him İsmail Cem, former Minister, died few days ago. he has many books, but he is not in the list! .

</li>
<li><i><b>COMMENT</b></i> - I have read some of the discussions above. First of all, there exists neither racism nor prejudice against the Turks or what so ever. I believe there is confusion here. If you see the notability criteria for people in the following page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_%28people%29" rel="nofollow">notability</a>], things will be clearer. It says that “The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person” From the above web sites we can see that he has at least 10 books published. He has published about Galileo Galilei, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei_%28play%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei_%28play%29" rel="nofollow">Galileo Galilei</a>] , since Bertolt Brecht this is the second play ever written on Galileo’s life. Can we call this a trivial publication? There exists no play on William Shakespeare’s life. See this page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_William_Shakespeare" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_William_Shakespeare" rel="nofollow">Master William Shakespeare</a>], are we going to call this publication trivial and rubbish? Has anybody tried to read the play? Why not? Do you think that high literature is something garbage? Please see the page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi_%28play%29" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi_%28play%29" rel="nofollow">Gandhi</a>], this is the only comprehensive Gandhi play in the world, no one can assert othervise; are we going to say that this Gandhi play is trivial publication? Another criteria says “Published authors who received multiple independent reviews of or awards for their work.” Büyünün Gözleri (Eyes of Magic) Play, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_of_Magic" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_of_Magic" rel="nofollow">Eyes of Magic</a>], obtained a National award in Istanbul. Do you think that it is easy to get a national award where hundreds of participants enter the competition? Is it something trivial? Now please see this page, [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabahattin_Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabahattin_Ey%C3%BCbo%C4%9Flu" rel="nofollow">Sabahattin Eyuboğlu</a>]. You will probably say who the hell this Sabahattin Eyuboğlu is. He is a very important Turkish writer, and when I read the artcile I have seen nothing about Shakespeare and I added that info, added Shakespeare link as well. He has translated Macbeth, Timon of Athens, Hamlet, Julius Caesar, most wonderful translations… We have loved Shakespeare through his incredibly beautiful translations. Now, if you look at his article, a very short article, so he means an unimportant writer? We can not get anything from the length of the article. It is not the length but the quality matters. Unfortunately we don’t have much time. We have works to do. There are hundreds of Turkish related articles to be improved. There are also so many misonformation as well. Now see this page, [<a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat ildan</a>] in Magyar language. It is clear that a Magyar guy translated this page. It probably says Murat ildan is a Turkish writer. And there is also Bibliografi. Where is the spam here? Is the play Master William Shakespeare spam? what is the spam here? I see only a very limited info on the writer. Are we going to call this a spam, a garbage? What is your knowledge about literature? Have you ever tried to read the writers one of the plays in English, available in different sites. See the page [<a href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat İldan</a>] in Latin language page. Do you call this a spam? It says Murat İldan is a Turkish writer. Galileo text is given there. So is it the play spam, or rubbish? Do you think that it is easy to be a writer in Turkey. Burhan Günel is a famous (and notable) writer in Turkey. His story books are printed in 2000 copies. May be you find it funny? Have you ever heard Burhan Günel? No! check the google now, you will see only 992! he is 60 years old. Now see this Turkish short CV: Ödülleri: Kültür Bakanlığı Çocuk Öyküleri Başarı</li>
</ul>
<p>Ödülü (1979), Türk Dil Kurumu Ödülü (1981), Mehmet Ali Yalçın Roman Ödülü (1981 ve 1982), Nevzat Üstün Öykü Birinci Başarı Ödülü (1983), Ömer Seyfettin Öykü Ödülü (1994), Yunus Nadi Roman Ödülü (1997), Yunus Nadi Öykü Ödülü (2000). He has at least 6 very important Literary Awards! But according to google he is 992! There are lots of important Turkish writers that even most Turkish people don't know because they are not advertised, because big publishing houses are supporting many trivial, magazinal type books and writers. I am avery disappointed and sad about the above discussions!.. They mentioned above writers dictionary. They are all biased dictionaries. There is another dictionary where 4000 writer names exist. We don't have 4000 writers, I am talking about literature! Turkish Playwrights number is not more than 100! You can check from the playwrights association in ıstanbul by sending them an e-mail. What about living novelists? May be 200, but not more!.. Being famous is something to do with advertisement, somethimg to do with money, not with quality. Not every good writer has money, or dark powers for advertisements... What is the conclusion? The writer in question is notable but not famous in Turkey! Who cares about being famous? are we going to be interested in the works or whether the person in question is famous? Ask 1000 people in the streets of Turkey, They will not know about Sabahattin Eyuboğlu... Some says His Hamlet is even better than the original language, it so poetical... goodnight. Tagorgora.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> "Now see this page, [Mehmet Murat ildan] in Magyar language [<a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat ildan</a>]. It is clear that a Magyar guy translated this page. It probably says Murat ildan is a Turkish writer" [User: Tagorgora] Now my Magyar may be a little rusty, but as someone with a little Latin left over from school I can assure you that while the latin page [<a href="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" class="external text" title="http://la.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_Murat_%C4%B0ldan" rel="nofollow">Mehmet Murat İldan</a>] does, sort of, say Ildan is a Turkish writer, it does it in a way that suspiciously reeks of someone running it through a Latin babelfish, since anyone with a little Latin left would have left the verb 'est', at the end of the sentence &amp; I get the same feeling about the other languages that Ildan (sorry, Ildan's 'biographer') is posting to. I know this is nitpicking, but the whole thing just stinks to high heaven of a concerted, and conceited, attempt to carpet bomb every wiki in existence into submission. First of all I thought this was just simple vanity, more and more I'm starting to think hoax. Surely no-one could be so self-regarding to need about 15 sock-puppets and daily postings on AfD just to prop up their insecurity? Also, accusations of racism are a very cheap shot &amp; need to be nipped in the bud right away.<a href="../../../s/c/a/User%7EScandrett_b5f9.html" title="User:Scandrett">Scandrett</a> 00:36, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> I have just added World Short Story Day article in the Wikipedia which was proposed by the Turkish Authors Association (TAA) in Ankara. About the article on Mehmet Murat İldan, I would like to give a brief info on him which is that the author is a member of TAA, <a href="http://www.edebiyatcilardernegi.org.tr/uyelerimiz2.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.edebiyatcilardernegi.org.tr/uyelerimiz2.asp" rel="nofollow">Turkish Authors Association in Ankara</a>. His name is written as Mehmet M. Ildan in the list. Membership number is 704. The association is a liberal sided organisation, some of his members prisioned in the past years. Another info that I know about the writer is that one of his plays, Tanrı'ya Yolculuk, Journey to God banned in Istanbul on the grounds that society is not ready for this play. The play considers the science as the sole Prophet. It is anti-religuous but pro-God play. In his theatre articles, this particular one <a href="http://www.tiyatrom.com/murat_ildan_57.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.tiyatrom.com/murat_ildan_57.htm" rel="nofollow">Thoughts on the banns in theatre</a> writer explains his opinions on such matters. but I don't know whether an english version of the article can be found on the web. I just wanted to give the wikipedia community these info. as far as notabilty, he is surely notable. this particular web site <a href="http://www.tiyatrom.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tiyatrom.com" rel="nofollow">Tiyatrom</a> is the most visited web site (among the theatre web sites) in Turkey. Please ellaborate on my new article World Short Story Day as well. Take care.

<li><b>Comment</b>: For god's sake, what's this longish debate about someone who has <b>10 books published</b>? Isn't that enough criteria for notability? Who cares about the writer of the article? even if he wrte it himself... it doesn't say he's the bigest turkish writer - to have POV in it. It says he has X number of books published. So why are we still debating about NOTABILITY? I speak turkish and read the turkish sources. He exists. he has those books published, he is a member of the PEN club. what else do you need for notability? I do say there IS racim against Turkish articles going on in enwiki, and quite frankly I don't really know why. what's your problem with turkish literature? that you can't read it? that's no excuse for deleting something, just because you <i>can't read it</i>. 100 million speakers of the Turkish language CAN. --<a href="../../../t/e/e/User%7ETeemeah_4db1.html" title="User:Teemeah">Teemeah</a> <a href="../../../t/e/e/User_talk%7ETeemeah_7a70.html" title="User talk:Teemeah"><small>Gül Bahçesi</small></a> 20:49, 2 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
