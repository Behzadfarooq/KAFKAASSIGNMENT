<dd><i>Sportspeople/athletes/competitors who have played in a fully professional league, or a competition of equivalent standing in a non-league sport such as swimming, or at the highest level in mainly amateur sports or other competitive activities that are themselves considered notable, including college sports in the United States. Articles about first team squad members who have not made a first team appearance may also be appropriate, but only if the individual is at a club of sufficient stature that most members of its squad are worthy of articles. <b>Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity should be provided to demonstrate that the subject is widely recognized—meeting the first criterion—as performing in a fully professional league or at the highest level.</b></i> (Emphasis inserted by me.) <a href="../../../d/j/m/User%7EDjma12_465a.html" title="User:Djma12">Djma12</a> 23:16, 22 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Not just an "Ordinary Korean who has done a bit of <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martial_arts.html" title="Martial arts">martial arts</a>", Bok Man Kim did more to spread Tae Kwon Do to south east Asia and the world then say Jhoon Rhee who has an article on wiki. He would not fall under the above category as he was never a competitor he was always an instructor and promoter of TKD who was instemental in the creation and development of what is TKD. when you ask for third party non-trivial publications he has had articles written about him in every major martial arts magazine I can think of including Black Belt, Budo, TKD &amp; Korean Martial Arts, TKD Times and FightSport. And as far as the links being to this indiduals schools they are not. They are to the Tae Kwon Do Hall of fame and the World Chun Kuhn Do websites.

As to the TKD Hall of Fame the Bio is what they took from his website yes but they also are in the process of scanning and uploading newspaper articles to support their info, here are some they have up now <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei1.html</a> <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei2.html</a> <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/brunei3.html</a> the first article is in english the second and third well I am not sure what is the official language of Brunei, more are suppossed to be posted during the next month or so.

<li>Please don't take this personally, as it is not meant as such, but <b>none of the sources you have provided fit the WP:Bio standards</b> as "Third-party verification from a non-trivial publication outside of publications by sponsors of the sport or activity." Here's why:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Http://www.chunkuhndo.com/ - Does not count b/c the site is an advertisement for his book. (See <a href="http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html" class="external free" title="http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chunkuhndo.com/book.html</a>)</li>
<li>The Taekwando Hall of Fame (<a href="http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/kimbokman.html</a>) - Also does not qualify as a 3rd party source b/c it is a) An advertisement (see <a href="http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html" class="external free" title="http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lacancha.com/tkdbanquet2006.html</a>) and b) Published by sponsors of the sport or activity.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.martialartsinprint.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.martialartsinprint.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.martialartsinprint.com/</a> - There is no information about Bok Man Kim on this site. Merely pointing to a "Site under Construction" page and saying that Bok Man Kim is in there is unsufficient.</li>
<li>The newspaper article on Taekwando Hall of Fame - Comes close to a 3rd party site. However: a) We need more information about the source (WP:Bio requirement for non-trivial sources, I have no idea what the "Daily Star" is) and b) The provided article does not state why Bok Man Kim is NOTABLE. It merely states that he went to Brunei.</li>
<li>Also of note, I don't think newspaper articles posted on a site classified as an advertisement or a sponsor of the sport count as 3rd Party Verification.</li>
<li>The Taekwando in Singapore Website (<a href="http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1" class="external free" title="http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.taekwondo.sg/modules/wfsection/article.php?articleid=1</a>) - Is this even a real website? Sure, the article on Bok Man Kim works, but every other link returns a database error.

<p><i>ONE of the founders of a Korean martial art is to visit Bristol to pass on his knowledge at an action-packed seminar. Grandmaster Kim Bok Man will conduct a series of classes for martial arts enthusiasts from around the country and beyond. The Tae Kwon Do expert, who is credited with founding the Korean sport, is one of the most important living names in martial arts circles. And organisers of the seminar believe Grandmaster Kim will attract people from as far afield as Romania, India, Nepal and the USA.</i></p>
