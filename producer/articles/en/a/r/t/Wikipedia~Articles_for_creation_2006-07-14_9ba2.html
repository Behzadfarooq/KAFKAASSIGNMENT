<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-14_9ba2.html" title="Edit section: AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../a/n/2F/AN_TPQ-37_Firefinder_radar_708a.html" title="AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar">AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar</a></span></h2>
<p>The AN/TPQ-37 FIREFINDER is a mobile radar system manufactured by the Hughes Aircraft Company, later acquired by Raytheon. The system is a long range version of "weapon-locating radar", designed to detect and track incoming artillery and rocket fire to determine the point of origin for counterbattery fire. It is currently in service at brigade and higher levels in the United States Army and by other countries. The radar is trailer mounted and towed by a 2 1/2 ton truck. A typical AN/TPQ-37 system consists of the Antenna-Transceiver Group, Command Shelter and 60KW Generator. [edit]</p>
<p><br />
<b>Operation</b></p>
<p>The AN/TPQ-37 is an electronically-steered radar, meaning the radar does not actually move while in operation. The radar scans a 90-degree sector for incoming rocket, artillery and mortar fire. Upon detecting a possible incoming round, the system verifies the contact before initiating a track sequence, continuing to search for new targets. The incoming round/rocket is tracked during it's initial upward/launch trajectory (i.e., the linear portion of it's flight path) prior to reaching apogee. A computer program analyzes the track data and then extrapolates the round's point of origin. This calculated point of origin is then reported to the operator with map coordinates, thus allowing friendly artillery to direct counterbattery fire towards the enemy artillery. The system has a reported range of up to 50 kilometers. The system may also be operated in a friendly fire mode to determine the accuracy of counterbattery return fire. [edit]</p>
<p><br />
<b>Nomenclature</b></p>
<p>Per the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), the nomenclature AN/TPQ-37 is derived thusly:</p>
<p>"AN/" indicating a system nomenclature derived from the JTEDS "T" for 'transportable', indicating it is carried by a vehicle but is not an integral part of said vehicle (compare with 'V' for vehicle-mounted). "P" indicating a RADAR. "Q" for a special-purpose radar, in this case counterbattery. "37" is an arbitrary numerical designator</p>

<p>two mice fell into a bucket full of cream. The first mouse fought for a short while but quickly gave up. the " 2ND MOUSE " struggled so furiously that he eventually churned the cream into butter, and crawled out.</p>
<p>Today , I am that 2nd mouse</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As soon as i heard this , i knew it was perfect symbolism for tenacity and determination , and a description of myself.</p>
<p>I've been seriously making music for about 4/5 years now, and I started with a Roland D-20 and started composing tracks with its 8 track onboard sequencer which was quite powerful at the time , but the sounds themselves were uninspiring bread and butter sounds , and even though I attempted to edit the sounds , I could never get the sounds and the arrangements that I heard in my head. When I got my little Pentium 3 , I found my true voice and the result is far better than I could ever have expected. The best , is yet to come.</p>
<p>I grew up being a big big fan of depeche mode. Then when the acid house explosion hit the charts , I came across Detroit Techno and discovered the likes of Juan Atkins / Model 500 , Derrick May , Blake Baxter , and then I was listening to the likes of Dan Curtin, Luke Slater, Jeff Mills , Polygon window/Aphex twin , and most recently Balil/Plaid , and Boards of Canada and a lot of independant IDM and electronica from M3RCK , John Tejada , Machine Drum , Plone , Frank Martiniq etc.....</p>
<p>occasionally ' when I'm not busy making my own , I'll listen to non-dance stuff like Crowded House , Kings of Leon and Cooper Temple Clause. I dont really listen to a lot of electronica and I find that keeps my ideas fresh and I'm getting water from my own well.</p>

<p>The rules of Crunk Masters Kings are as follows:</p>

Each card represents an action and is explained further below. Ace Never Ever: Make a statement starting with "Never have I ever..." Anyone who has ever performed the said action drinks. Each player says one statement in turn.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2 for You:</b> Pick someone to drink.</p>
<p><b>3 for Me:</b> Drink.</p>
<p><b>4 Social:</b> Everyone drinks.</p>
<p><b>5 for Guys:</b> All guys drink.</p>
<p><b>6 for Chicks:</b> All girls drink.</p>
<p><b>7 to Heaven:</b> Every player throws one hand up toward the sky. The last person to do so drinks.</p>
<p><b>8 Pick-A-Mate:</b> Drink with a partner of your choosing.</p>
<p><b>9 Bust-A-Rhyme:</b> Say a sentence. Each following player must say another sentence that rhymes with the last word in the first sentence. The first player that fails to rhyme drinks.</p>
<p><b>10 Waterfall:</b> Begin to drink, everyone at the table must drink in succession. The first player can stop whenever they please. Everyone else must continue drinking until the player to their right has stopped drinking. Good luck to the person at the bottom of the waterfall!</p>
<p><b>Jack Categories:</b> Name a category, such as "makes of automobiles." Each other player must name items in the category, such as "Ford." The first player that fails to name an item drinks.</p>
<p><b>Queen Question:</b> Ask a question to any random player. That player must respond by asking a question to another player. The first player to fail to ask a question (by making a statement) drinks.</p>
<p><b>Kings Make-A-Rule:</b> The first three times the King is drawn, the player pours some of their beverage into the cup in the center of the table. Additionally, that player is allowed to create a new gameplay rule. Each rule will have drinking consequences should players break them.</p>
<p><br />
<b>HOW IT ALL ENDS</b> The player to draw the fourth and final King card must drink the contents of the cup. Following this, another round of Crunk MastersTM Kings or another Crunk MastersTM Party Game may begin.</p>

<p>Robert Cremona was born in England but spent his school years in Malta. At a very young age he showed a talent for the piano and guitar. He was composing his first tunes at the age of six.</p>
<p>Despite suffering from kidney failure in 1977 at the age of twenty, Cremona went on to form a band called 'Strange Cargo' singing and performing his own songs.</p>
<p>In the 1990's he toured Europe and the UK promoting his solo albums "The Blue Bird", "All In The Mind" and "Reasons For All Seasons". After losing a second kidney transplant he concentrated on instrumental compositions and scored numerous pieces for television production companies.</p>
<p>He has won awards for some of his compositions and continues to play despite suffering a stroke in 2002 and being back on a kidney dialysis machine.</p>
<p>Today he spends most of his time as a Volunteer Tutor in the UK for the National Health Service's 'Expert Patients Programme' and lectures to medics, patients and their families about living with a long term chronic illness.</p>

<p>Knaphill Lower School (Woking)</p>
<p>Knaphill Lower School is a local education authority maintained school. The age range is 3-7. Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools lists this school as one of the 234 "best of best" schools in the U.K. The UK government has listed this as a <a href="../../../b/e/a/Beacon_school.html" title="Beacon school">beacon school</a>. About 90 students a year are accepted into the school. Applications for entrance are considered for the nursery at 3 years of age and again for reception and year 2 at 4 years of age. The applications for entrance vastly exceed the number of place available - and some children from the nursery find that they do not get a place for the reception year. The majority of the children graduate at 6/7 years of age to Knaphill Junior school and a small minority go to independent schools.</p>
<p>In national KS1 government national achievement targets and levels, the 2005 results for Reading, Writing and Mathematics indicated a very high level of achievement and value add compared to the Surrey council and national averages. In Mathematics, for example, pupils were in the top 5% in Surrey.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-07-14_9ba2.html" title="Edit section: Goodiepal">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Goodiepal</span></h2>
<p>Ok, I’m new on this Wikipedia thing so this will be my first contribution. Well, first of all, to try to describe some of Goodiepal/Gæoudjiparl’s music is a bit hard. He is not the electronic musician who has got the biggest output but quite frankly he is the one with the weirdest.</p>
<p>Goodiepal’s music always deals with subjects such as death and life, his output is a many-faceted object and by some described as chaotic, I prefer to use the word complex, which is why his music is so interesting for us fans and collectors.</p>
<p>I know for a fact from reliable sources that the Goodiepal is some character, which turns him into a very difficult person to be around. His lack of interest in communication with the media in general have left him somewhere outside the music bizz plate.</p>
<p>Goodiepal’s first full-length cd was released under the name Circulation of Events back in 1995 on a label I don’t know anything about called Spoof Records. The cd has the catalogue number 005 so I believe there have been other releases on the label though I can’t find any information about that on the Internet or anywhere else. This and the name Spoof blur some lines of authenticity here, but I can’t prove or disprove this information. All I know for sure, is that the cd was registered in 1995 at the library of the Danish National Radio called DR, so the release dates should be good enough, but I don’t know whether the label had already released other Goodiepal gems.</p>
<p>From the late 90’s Goodiepal was and still is connected to the English hardcore-vegan label and media manipulator V/Vm with whom he did the now famous Goodiebag/Demonbag 7” series, a series of over ten 7”s. On these discs he collected some of the finest and darkest of Scandinavian electronic oddities. Later a series of manipulated brand sounds appeared called, “Mainpal Inverted Brands” or something like that. The series was released with a code breaker, and did not have numbers or artist names but only some kind of colour coding. I still to this very day have no idea, which label to associate it with, maybe V/Vm? - At some point you could download the tracks from the V/Vm website, but there is a web address on the original code breaker which links it to the UK based Unbearable Recordings. Here on Discogs I can see they are filed under the label name Mainpal, which I believe is good enough.</p>
<p>In 2001 The French label Ski-pp, run by Dat Politics, released a compilation of the Goodiepal work called Narc Beacon, which for a Scandinavian artist got a tremendous amount of press and today is considered one of the most important releases in modern Scandinavian music.</p>
<p>Since 2002 we have not seen many releases from Goodiepal but rumours are he did move back to the Faroe Islands, a part of Denmark (where he is from?) but he has been playing a few live shows and made web advertising for a collection of stolen software and conspiracy theories called the “Hacker Pack”.</p>
<p>He also broke into the database of a company called Koblo which belongs under the American media giant Digidesign, and liberated some software for FREE on the internet. He quite literally ran autonomous support from their website until they finally found out about it after six months and removed him from the connection.</p>
<p>In 2004 he presented two mechanical birds he had been building over the past four years or so, very impressive craftsmanship indeed.</p>
<p>And finally in the October 2005 issue of the English music magazine The Wire, there was a full-page cover add for a synthesizer called Inet or something like that. A synthesizer which Goodiepal apparently was part of the development team behind until he broke out and made a one off version for sale, I have no idea who bought it, all I know is that it was there.</p>
<p>All in all a fellow Scandinavian without who my interest in music would not have been the same.</p>

<p>The term "cohort effect" is used to describe variations in the characteristics of an area of study (such as the incidence of a characteristic or the age at onset) over time among individuals who are defined by some shared temporal experience or common life experience, such as year of birth, or year of exposure to radiation.</p>
<p>Cohort effects are important to epidemiologists searching for patterns in illnesses. Certain illnesses may be socially affected via the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anticipation_phenomenon.html" title="Anticipation phenomenon">anticipation phenomenon</a>, and cohort effects can be an indicator of this sort of phenomenon.</p>
<p>Cohort effects are important to resource dependency and economics theorists when these groups affect structures of influence within their larger organizations.

For example, cohort effects are critical issues school enrollment.</p>

Not much is known for sure about St. Praxedes. According the Christian legend, St. Praxedes was a <a href="../../../r/o/m/Roman.html" title="Roman">Roman</a> woman who sought to help <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christians.html" title="Christians">Christians</a> when the Emperor Marcus Antoninus (a.k.a. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marcus_Aurelius_49af.html" title="Marcus Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>) was persecuting them. She did all she could to feed, care for, and even hide them in her own home and the homes of others (similar to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harriet_Tubman_fd00.html" title="Harriet Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a> and the <a href="../../../u/n/d/Underground_Railroad_7d7b.html" title="Underground Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>.) After many years of burying mutliated Christians, visiting the imprisoned, and seeing those she loved suffer, she died on July 21 of a disputed year, which is now her <a href="../../../f/e/a/Feast_day.html" title="Feast day">feast day</a> in the <a href="../../../c/a/t/Catholic_Church_2beb.html" title="Catholic Church">Catholic Church</a>.

A church was built in her honour, on the alleged site of her house, to which, when it was rebuilt by Pope St. Paschal I (the present <a href="../../../s/a/n/Santa_Prassede_68d5.html" title="Santa Prassede">Santa Prassede</a>) in c. 822, her <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relics.html" title="Relics">relics</a> were taken.</p>

<p>Off-line programming is a way of creating a machine program (i.e. for robots or CMMs) on a computer while not connected to the machine. (Normally these programs are created by moving the joints of a machine to a certain pose and "teaching" the location. With Off-line Programming (a.k.a. OLP) the process is performed in a simulation tool (e.g. Robcad or Valisys). This simulation can be downloaded to text file that can be run on the machine controller.</p>

<p>Mira Vasiljevic</p>
<p>Mira Vasiljevic is one of the most popular Serbian folk singers. Mira was born in Ripanj near Belgrade and grew up in very poor and difficult conditions. Her father died during World War II and she grew with her mother Milojka, brother Lale and sister Milica. She always liked music, but her mother wanted her to become a doctor. Mira secretly, attended music school and later became a music teacher. While near her studies, one of her professors, Dusan Kostic, knew that she was talented and took her to radio Belgrade to audition as a folk singer in front of one of the greatest violinists and toughest critics, Vlastimir Pavlovic Carevac. Mira was nervous during the audtion and never bothered to ask whether she had passed. A few weeks later she ran into her professor who asked her whether she is waiting for a lemon from radio Belgrade because she had passed the audtion is ready to start recording. That was 1961. She became a soloist of radio Belgrade and taught music during that whole time.</p>
<p>As a music teacher, Mira very often organized concerts and dances where her students and she performed. At one of those concerts she met Budimir Buca Jovanovic, one of the most famous composers and accordion players. He told Mira that he had heard her sing over the radio, loved her voice and asked her to make a record with him. Mira was thrilled and, of course, accepted. Her firt record, "Devojacka kletva" came out in 1965. Mira continued to teach music, make records and sing publicly. She became famous. She continued to record with Buca Jovanovic and also with other composers, such as Ilija Spasojevic, Tozovac, until 1970. At that time she decided to try her luck at composing, but her composer Buca was outraged when she asked him to accompony her with his orchestra and record four of her songs. She turned to Zarko Jospovic Skula and his orchestra and recorded her own four songs: Sini munjo, Nemoj da me kunes, Prazan medaljon and Kod druge uther trazi. The record became an instant hit and Mira left her teaching postion and became a full time singer. She became on of the most popular singners and musically educated. She continued her luck at writing songs until 1973 when she pefromed, Zri, zri tamnjanika at Beograski Sabor written by Petar Tanasijevic and won frist place for her permormance. That same year she performed as a special guest in Soko Banja during the famous accordian competition. While there, she saw twin sisters Dragica and Radica Jankovic perform, learned that their younger sister plays the guitar and their best friend also played the guitar. She had and idea. She approached their father, Dragoslav Jankovic Civra, also an accordian player and Mira's acquintance since she already made a record with him, a duet with Lepa Lukic. She told the father that she would like to form a vocal-instrumental group. Their father liked the idea. Upon her return to Belgrade she approched her good friends and famous singers Vera Ivkovic and Andjelka Govedarevic and told them about her plan. They were thrilled. They needed another singer and got young Gordana Lazarevic. They practiced for months before appearing in front of the audince. They picked the name Djerdan for the group. The critics and the public could not believe their eyes. They were beautiful for the eye and for the ear. Mira contines to manage her group until this day. Members keep changing occasinally, but are still popular as ever. Many members of Mira's group Djerdan went to become some of the most popular names in the music industry: Vera Ivkovic, Andjelka Govedarevic, Snezana Djurisic, Gordana Lazarevic, Jans Djokic, Biljana Trmcic, Gordana Stojicevic, Izvorinka Milosevic, Dragana Lazarevic...</p>
<p>Mira was always willing to help young talents even before she formed her group. Today she continues to perform with her group as well as solo. Some of her greatest hits:</p>
<p>-Sini munjo -Devojacka kletava -Aj, ja sam secer -Zri, zri, tamnjanika -Sumadija u jesenje dane -Zivot pise uspomene -Danas mi je dragom rodjendan -Jedinica -Godine su prolazile -Baka i unuk (Mira's favotire recorded with her grandson, Milos) -Pevam i pevacu jos -Zasto me ostavi -Momak za jedno vece -Kockar -Oci su mu kao kreme -Nikad necu voleti</p>
<p>When not performing Mira enjoys quility time with family; husband, Misa, daughters Natasa and Jasna and grandchildren Milos, Marko and Iskra.</p>

<p><b>Seven blasts</b> in seven locations within an 11-minute span rocked Mumbai on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p><b>Suburban trains</b> along the Western Line were targeted and at least 216 people were killed and nearly 700 were injured.</p>
<p><b>Here’s a brief timeline of the blasts:</b></p>
<p>The first blast occurred at 1820 hrs (IST) on a Slow Train at Jogeshwari that had halted at platform number one.</p>
<p>The second blast was at Bandra station at 1823 hrs (IST). The bomb placed in the first-class men's compartment of a Borivali Fast Train.</p>
<p>The third explosion happened a minute later at 1824 hrs (IST) at Mahim aboard a Fast Train going from Churchgate going to Borivali.</p>
<p>At 1827 hrs (IST) the fourth blast at Matunga on a Fast Train coming from Churchgate. At the same time a fifth blast occurred at Borivali on a Fast Train to Virar in a First-Class Men's Compartment.</p>
<p>The sixth explosion happened at 1830 hrs (IST) in a first-class compartment of a Borivali bound Slow Train at Khar.</p>
<p>The last blast was reported at 1840 hrs (IST) as the train neared Bhayandar station.</p>
<p>All the seven blasts were high-intensity explosions and took place when the trains were either entering or leaving the station, leading the police to suspect that the explosive devices were remote-controlled or fitted with timers.</p>
<p>Many of the passengers from adjoining compartments were injured while trying to jump out of moving trains.</p>
<p>Locals and rescue teams reached the stations before the police and used bedsheets, gunny-bags to remove the dead bodies and move the injured to nearby hospitals.</p>
<p>Bodies were strewn across the tracks and coaches torn apart. The injured were immediately rushed to nearby hospitals like Hinduja, Leelavati, Bhabha, KEM, Sion and Nanavati.</p>
<p>Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has announced a Rs 1 lakh compensation to the relatives of the dead and free treatment to the injured.</p>

Each release had a standard album cover, but with the addition of a stamp or sticker indicating the pressing, which stated 'Supercut. Mastered and pressed exclusively for readers of Hi-fi Today (or Practical Hi-fi) by Nimbus Records.

<p>Lux soap was first created in 1924. The soap was launched as a beauty soap that could be purchased by those wishing to avoid paying for expensive brands. The name was chosen because it reminds the ear of the word luxury.</p>
<p>It was Introduced in 1925 by the Lever Brothers. The soap eventually made its way to the UK in 1928.</p>
<p>During the soap's life, it has undergone many packaging changes in order to stick with the times and current fashions.</p>
<p>The soap was made in five colors, including pink, white, blue, green, and yellow. The colors allowed people to match their soap to the decorations in their bathrooms.</p>
<p>At one point Lux was even made into a laundry soap.</p>
<p>Although Lux is hard to find in the US, in the 90's the soap introduced shower gels, liquid sopas, and moisturizing bars. In the US you can find this soap at Big Lots and some dollar stores.</p>
<p>The UK saw new products in 2004 which included shower gels and bath products. Also in 2005, the UK was blessed by scented shower gels with "dreamy" names.</p>
<p>Many well known ladies have been featured in Lux soap adds as "Lux Girls". A few include Marilyn Monroe, Bette Davis, Demi Moore, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Elizabeth Taylor, and even Sarah Jessica Parker in 2004.</p>
<p>Lux is currently a product of Unilever.</p>

<p>Johnterryl Plumeri Johnterryl Plumeri has just completed recording the 4th, 5th and 6th symphonies of Tchaikovsky as conductor of the Moscow Philharmonic for a June 2006 release on the GMMC CD label. In the past, Johnterryl's recordings with the Moscow Philharmonic of his original compositions have received such words of praise from Fanfare Magazine as, "These well-prepared composer-conducted performances and recordings are both technically and esthetically stunning. The emotional curve of Plumeri's music has a dramatic inevitability that carries the listener along without questioning and leaves him fully gratified, very much like the best of Tchaikovsky's efforts." The Washington Post has said of these recordings, "Plumeri conducts the Moscow Philharmonic in a performance sensitive to the music's smallest nuances."</p>
<p>Johnterryl's innovative style of bowing jazz solos on the acoustic bass has garnered comments like "Stunning…a very high level of music" from the Washington Post. "Johnterryl Plumeri's bowed bass work is endlessly compelling" from allaboutjazz.com. "Extraordinary bowing facility" from Jazz Improv Magazine. In speaking about his latest jazz release Blue In Green, Jazz Improv Magazine has said "The performances and solo improvisations on the parts of Johnterryl Plumeri on bass, David Goldblatt on piano and Joe La Barbera on drums are outstanding. Blue In Green is an album bubbling with creativity, interactivity, magnificent improvisations, and the combined experience, sensitivity, and desire of three consummate musicians performing eight essential pieces from the jazz and standard repertoire. Go and listen."</p>
<p>While on scholarship to Manhattan School of Music in New York City, Johnterryl studied with Robert Brennand, principal bass of the New York Philharmonic. During his period as a bassist with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C., he studied composition and conducting with the Hungarian conductor/composer Antal Dorati, himself a student of the legendary Bela Bartok.</p>
<p>During the past 15 years he has written the music to 55 feature films, which includes the score to the award winning crime story One False Move, which has recently been added to the "New York Times List of the 1000 Best Films Ever Made". His score for One False Move was nominated for Best Score by the IFP Spirit Awards.</p>
<p>Johnterryl's lectures on music have been heard at the Smithsonian Institute, Georgetown University, Maryland Art Institute and University of Southern California as well as in his private classes in the Los Angeles area on the Vocabulary and Psychology of the Music of Bernard Herrmann in the Alfred Hitchcock thriller, Psycho.</p>
<p>Johnterryl has played with such jazz greats as Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Quincy Jones, Arthur Prysock, Frank Sinatra, Joe Williams, Les McCann, Yusef Lateef, John Abercrombie and Woody Herman. Notable performances include Carniegie Hall/New York City, Albert Hall/London, Herodicus Atticus Theater/Athens, Tchaikovsky Hall/Moscow, as well as the Newport, Monterey and Montreux jazz festivals.</p>

Best Seller "The Samson Option" Basically Stating that in the event of WMD attack against Israel, the response would be as such in return even upon itself. Such as the fate of Samson in the bible: "the divinely empowered Samson pushed apart the temple pillars - collapsing the roof and killing himself as well as his enemies."</p>

<p>DJ AND'y</p>
<p>Cidade: João Pessoa-PB Nucleo: GROOVETRONIK Estilo: Breakbeat</p>
<p>Seu contato com a Música Eletrônica aconteceu no início dos anos 90, época em que a "Italo House" estava em alta. O início da carreira foi como o de muitos DJs, tocando em pequenas festas na casa de amigos. Aos poucos, foi aprimorando as técnicas de discotecagem e obtendo o reconhecimento do público.</p>
<p>No ano 2001 criou, em parceria com o produtor Mark Schuwert, o projeto 2 MEKANIK. Consistia na produção de Música Eletrônica (faixas próprias e remixes), além de um website com informações diversas sobre e-music.</p>
<p>Nos anos seguintes passou a colaborar com algumas publicações eletrônicas: Clube Culturall e Eletrocena. Paralelamente ia desenvolvendo sua carreira como DJ, chegando inclusive a receber convites para tocar em festas no eixo Rio-São Paulo.</p>
<p>Em sua cidade natal, João Pessoa, participou dos programas de rádio "Turbo Mix" e "Na Cola da Pan", ambos da Jovem Pan FM. Em todas as ocasiões manteve-se fiel ao estilo UK Garage, que mistura a batida 2 Step, do Garage, com as quebradas do Breakbeat. Uma fusão contagiante, que agrada aos ouvidos mais apurados. No Brasil, era um dos poucos DJs que tocavam este estilo - muito conhecido na Europa, especialmente na Inglaterra.</p>
<p>A trajetória em 2004 foi marcada pela criação e participação em dois núcleos de Música Eletrônica: o Groovetronik (made in Paraíba) e o BreaK-Klan, que reúne DJs de Breakbeat de várias partes do Brasil. No mesmo ano, passou a incluir em suas apresentações (sets) o New Breakz, vertente mais progressiva do Breakbeat. Atualmente vem participando de forma ativa da cena eletrônica pessoense, tocando em várias festas e eventos.</p>

<p>Benjamins is a slang term referring to money. For example, "it's all about the benjamins" means "it's all about money." The term comes from the fact that Benjamin Franklin is featured on the United States one hundred dollar bill.</p>

"The Areality Show: Whose Reality?" Viridian Artists &amp; Friends Curated by Vernita Nemec September 5-23, 2006 Opening Reception: Wednesday September 6, 6-8pm</p>
<p>NYC: Viridian Artists at 530 West 25th Street in Chelsea is opening its fall 2006 season with a provocative group exhibit that explores artistic interpretations of reality and areality. Gallery artists and guests have been invited to create a reality with the madness of life and the unreality of reality in mind. The dictionary says reality is the fact of being real, existing or actual. If you put an A in front of a word, it means the opposite: not reality or without. Going to the web, the dictionary of the 21st Century, (as well as being many other things in life today) and looking up areality yielded fascinating results including numerous websites, "shared quirks &amp; ancient arealities". With the advent of "The Reality Show" phenomena on television, the concept of reality has begun to resemble a Luis Borges or Gabriel Marquis surreal novel more than it does everyday life and like areality, begins to embody two senses. To believe something to be real, if we weren’t there to see it, requires some kind of evidence and even then, it still might not be real or true. Even before electronic media that was true, but now, even more so. No longer is a photograph, or a document necessarily proof. Neither is the re-telling by an eye-witness necessarily proof, since each witness might, and usually does, see a different reality. Movies &amp; politics have made reality even more ambiguous than existential philosophers once thought it to be. Consider the "Spin" on news and reportage as it today. Artists now, more than ever, have the power to change their interpretation of or the appearance of reality. In the 19th century it was trompe l'oeil painters, in the 20th century, photo-realists. Now, digital photography can make a painting a photo and vise versa. For this opening show, No size, media or subject limits the artwork. Only thse artists' interpretation of what areality is, but in fact, what is that?</p>

<p>Back in the day, Trevor was often found shouting out obscenities from the front stage position of a historically notorious band called The Bolshoi, which released an EP plus two full LP's on Beggar's Banquet.</p>
<p>Today, Trevor is a member of a Celtic Rock ensemble called Rathkeltair, as well as a solo artist, releasing his sonic journeys via CD on Emperor Penguin Recordings. His latest release, a 41 song, 3 CD set - Bullish, Bellyache &amp; Belch - has received acclaim around the world. After a near fifteen year hiatus, one of the greatest guitar-lords on the planet had truly returned singing loud and clear for his supper.</p>
<p>Trevor's not only an amazing songwriter - he's also one of Earth's most interesting and profound characters. He likes obscure films, eclectic music and fancies artist Modigliani.</p>
<p>Trevor's music now can only be described as a kaleidoscopic pill which, once taken, will have you whirring around like a trapped waspy. There are moments within the music that you will wonder if Trevor has truly lost his mind (which he gleefully claims to have done on purpose). Fans of The Bolshoi will immediately recognize that elements of days past do still exist, however, Trevor Tanner has grown considerably as both a singer and a songwriter - Amplifier Magazine.</p>
<p>Trevor is constantly recording. The 41 songs on Bullish, Bellyache, and Belch were selected from over 100 songs. Trevor writes and records approximately three songs per month, which is a lot of music. However, David Paul Wyatt Perko, of Emperor Penguin Recordings, is Trevor's personal filter and only chooses to use a song for a CD if it is truly incredible. But alas! Trevor is such a songwriting master, chosing songs is almost as difficult as swimming across the ocean without drinking a drop of sea water. Although because of the large body of astonishing material to choose from, each Trevor Tanner CD release is nothing short of innovative perfection.</p>
<p>Eaten By The Sea - Trevor's next release is well underway with nine songs already completed and due for an Autumn 2006 release. At any given moment, Trevor is either in his recording studio laying down the next musical marvel or he is performing live with Rathkeltair, or he is simply somewhere between point A, B or C...Without a doubt though - wherever he is - he is swimming within the deep fathoms of his own mind and that's a scary place filled with ancient sea-diving outfits, ravenous sharks and worse...</p>

<b>Nicholas Bott</b> began painting at an early age at the knee of his grandfather. Born in Blokker, The Netherlands in 1941, Bott moved to Smithers British Columbia at the age of 17, where he fell in love with the scenic beauty of the British Columbian landscapes.</p>
<p><br />
"Bott's works reveal not only an ever-growing sense of lyricism and visual poetry in the interpretation of his variuos subjects. His paintings... show spontaneity and sureness of hand commensurate with his ability to distill and transform landscape and rural motifs into refined aesthetic visualizations." <i>Jacek Malec, Magazin D'art, fall 1999 issue,</i> <i>p.134</i>.</p>
<p>The Netherlands has produced many artists of renoun, and Bott is no exeption. He studies art at the University of British Columbia and holds a diploma from the Chicago School of Art. Inspired by the loose style of Vincent Van Gogh and the Canadian Group of Seven, his paintings are mainly renderings of the rugged British Columbian mountain ranges. He spends many days on remote mountain slopes, some locations accessable only by helicopter.</p>
<p><br />
"On the surface, one encounters magnificent mountains, trees, lakes, rivers, and valleys with the most dramatic colors -- beyond them the atmosphere and spirituality are overwhelming. It feels as though the terrain has been composed by the forces of nature into a unified and coherent whole."</p>
<p>Vancouver British Columbia is to where of most Nicholas bott paintings are shown auctioned and sold. Hung in the Harrison Galleries fine art galleries of vancouver, one of the oldest art galleries in all of Canada. Home to many other prestigious artists such as Ted Harrison , Francine Gravel and Kiff Holland.</p>

Retiming is an optimization technique for digital circuits invented by <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_E._Leiserson_1e0a.html" title="Charles E. Leiserson">Charles E. Leiserson</a> and refined by him and James B. Saxe. Retiming adds registers at some points in a circuit and removes them from others in such a way that the functional behavior of the circuit as a whole is preserved. Retiming can be used to transform a given synchronous circuit into a more efficient circuit.</p>
