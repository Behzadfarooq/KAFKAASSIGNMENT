<li><b>Do not delete</b>/<b>For retention</b>, i would just like to comment that mikee's entry would be viable for an article itself (stub), as a matter of fact, it just needs an overhaul or for it to be expanded, i think the notability of mikee stands not on whether he was runner up or something but because of the impression of being a housemate. Yes, the celebrities, they're notable, but i think lee is far more noted than the likes of Rudy, Budoy, gretchen or angelina for that matter, except for those who are celebrities already. I think a number of teen housemates deserve an entry and to be noted as STUBS. It's my point of view. Emerald 04:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per above or <b>redirect</b> if not possible. I personally know Mikee Lee; we met at a debate competition (he is an Atenean debater) but conceded that much of his popularity today stems from the current season of PBB and that I don't know him well enough to write a full-fledged article. If it is not possible to keep his article, we can redirect (or something to the extent), but that would mean we would have to do the same thing for <i>all</i> the other PBB Teen Edition housemates except Kim. --<a href="../../../a/k/i/User%7EAkira123323_37f1.html" title="User:Akira123323">Akira123323</a> <sup><small><a href="../../../a/k/i/User_talk%7EAkira123323_ba31.html" title="User talk:Akira123323">Say what?</a> |</small></sup> <sup><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Akira123323_f097.html" title="Special:Contributions/Akira123323">Track record</a></small></sup> 05:20, 6 June 2006 (UTC)

<p>as could stand as it is. Yes his popularity stems from PBB, yet we could definitely expand the article considering much of the many references available, i for a fact has gathered a number of references and would be very much into updating and expanding his article, i think he deserves an entry much as Jason Gainza (who doesnt have his own entry) who, like Lee, was a runner-up finish, it's a feat almost, yes almost, to the extent of winning and i think it should be given credit, just as other first-runner ups. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECane_crew_ccdd.html" title="User:Cane crew">User:Cane_crew</a> 05:30, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

Also if your reasoning will be applied, then we should do articles on Kwarta o Kahon contestants. Mikee's notability exclusively comes from Big Brother, and as such, should be deleted (for being not notable) or redirected to the Teen edition article. --<a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">Howard</a> <a href="../../../h/o/w/User_talk%7EHoward_the_Duck_380d.html" title="User talk:Howard the Duck"><font color="maroon">t</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">he Du</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Howard_the_Duck_47a4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Howard the Duck"><font color="purple">c</font></a><a href="../../../h/o/w/User%7EHoward_the_Duck_9612.html" title="User:Howard the Duck">k</a> 05:54, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I guess Kwarta o Kahon contestants seems a far-fetched cry from the notability of the housemates, i mean common, primetime viewing pleasure. And yes Jayson needs his own article, i could see he has come to be famous, or Sam or even Cass and Uma. They could stand their own entry. I would be very much willing to do that myself. I resent the fact that notability becomes such an issue whilst, they all have been quite notable ever since they entered the house, much more the Big Four. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cane_crew_55b6.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cane crew">Special:Contributions/Cane_crew</a> 05:58, 6 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

Instead of being deleted, they're merged there. Because, they are <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notable</a> only because of Big Brother, ergo, they're merged to the PBB1 article.
