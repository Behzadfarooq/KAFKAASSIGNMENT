<li>Can I politely encourage you to play the ball and not the man? Yes, I wrote about Edwin Taylor. He is notable as a Member of Parliament (all Members of Parliament are considered notable). The question I asked myself was whether Jackiey Budden has done something which makes her notable. She is not notable merely for being the mother of a notable person. She is not notable for her appearance in a television series. She is not notable for appearing in the newspapers quite often. I cannot find any reason why she is notable. If you can find one, then I will change my vote. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 22:29, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>A statement such as "all Members of Parliament are considered notable" is about as absurd as someone claiming that all Big Brother contestants are. Something that I would not advocate myself. However, in line with people such as Makosi, Nikki Grahame and Jon Tickle all having their own pages due to having done other stuff outside of the Big Brother house, Jackiey should ALSO have her own webpage for exactly the same reasons. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 00:21, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Perhaps it is absurd to say all MPs are notable, but it is Wikipedia policy: see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> where it says that "members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislature" is included in the class of notable people. In any case it is irrelevant - see the <a href="../../../o/t/h/WP%7EOTHERCRAPEXISTS_0be2.html#What_about_article_x.3F" title="WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS">WP:OTHERCRAPEXISTS#What about article x?</a> page! I would distinguish Jackiey Budden from the three examples you cite as they all have media careers developed independently after their appearance in Big Brother. Jackiey Budden has only a few scattered appearances on television before. If she becomes a more important personality, then we can reconsider, but based on what we know now, she is not notable for an entry in an encyclopaedia. <a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESam_Blacketer_4423.html" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> 00:31, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> She is notable in her own right. We have an article on Makosi, for example. Less of the intellectual snobbery, please. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 21:13, 16 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Makosi has managed a (sort of) career in the media, though her article is far to large imho. It's not snobbery - if there was an article for everyone who had ever been on TV game shows, it would all get silly. I was on a TV quiz once, and had my pictures in a few papers because of being in quiz teams - I'm not notable though. btw- Triangle E - you seem to be the only one making a serious case for the article to stay- most of the Keep comments are yours. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrenwith_53e5.html" title="User:Trenwith">Trenwith</a> 17:32, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>1. Jackiey's media appearances are about as numerous and notable as Makosi's. 2. I am NOT advocating that every gameshow contestant should get their own wikipedia page, I am saying that THIS wikipedia page satisfies guidelines for notability. 3. The votes to keep this article are not predominantly mine - I made one vote to keep the article and the others were comments highlighting the ridiculous nature of the votes for deletion. 4. I wrote the original article way back when and have put a lot of effort into it - of course my case for it staying would be stronger than that of the others. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Mild keep</b> It looks like she's been a contestant or notable guest on multiple reality shows. If she had only appeared on one show, I might suggest simply redirecting to that show. But as is we have someone that has appeared on multiple television series and no one article to place that information in. Maintaining this article seems to be the best way to preserve the information for anyone interested. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 22:26, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> per Dugwiki. Also, merging with <a href="../../../j/a/d/Jade_Goody_d2c9.html" title="Jade Goody">Jade Goody</a> is stupid since that article is about Jade Goody, not Jackiey Budden. — <a href="../../../a/n/e/User%7EAnemoneProjectors_565e.html" title="User:AnemoneProjectors">AnemoneProjectors</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/n/e/User_talk%7EAnemoneProjectors_b870.html" title="User talk:AnemoneProjectors">talk</a>)</small> 23:10, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>The above comment shows you are not familiar with the subject. Jackiey is Jade's mother. Jade got famous on a UK Gameshow (<a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_f5f8.html" title="Big Brother">Big Brother</a>). Jackiey is sort-of known because of the daughter and because she too, was on the same game show. The vast majority of people who are on that game show had their articles deleted and redirected to <a href="../../../b/i/g/Big_Brother_f5f8.html" title="Big Brother">Big Brother</a> once they left, as apart from being on TV, they had achieved nothing of note. The same applies to Ms Budden. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrenwith_53e5.html" title="User:Trenwith">Trenwith</a> 17:27, 17 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Although I am unable to speak for him personally, with all the edits that AnemoneProj has done to the Big Brother pages over the last few series, I can assure you that he is very familiar with the subkect matter. Since I have been following how wikipedia operates with regards to BB - the articles for each individual contestant were redirected to the BB page straight away and were only given their OWN pages if they did something notable outside the house - something that Jackiey has already done. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETriangle_e_0a5b.html" title="User:Triangle e">Triangle e</a> 19:06, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Though the article is in poor shape (for instance, where's the autobiography she was promoting?), there is an arguable claim to notability.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - I agree that this woman is a <a href="../../../n/o/b/Nobody.html" title="Nobody">nobody</a> and is quite possibly the most annoying person I've ever seen on TV. However, there are articles on a plethora of extremely obscure musical artists that very few people will ever have heard of, and they are not up for deletion. This woman has appeared on Big Brother and has instantly become known to several million people. That alone should be enough to warrant the inclusion of this article, not to mention the infamy she will gain from her part in the whole racism row. --<a href="../../../u/k/d/User%7EUkdan999_42ea.html" title="User:Ukdan999">Ukdan999</a> 16:20, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>redirect</b> to her daughter's page. she hasn't met any notability criteria- people like jon tickle and nikki grahame have pages because they've gone on and done other work, presenting shows etc. jackiey has never done a day's work in her life, from what i can see. she's mildy famous at the moment- in a month or so it will pass. she does not warrant her own article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.158.47.121 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.158.47.121_1ca0.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.158.47.121">contribs</a>) 13:07, 20 January 2007.</small></li>

<li><b>Merge</b> and <b>Redirect'</b> the relevant bits with Jade Goody - Seems to me that she has just made various one-off appearances on television shows, which doesnt make her notable. Neither does her participation in Big Brother apparently. All BB contestants make many appearances on televison after the series ends, but they are not allowed pages merely for this reason so I don't see why Jackiey is any different.<a href="../../../g/u/n/User%7EGungadin_4999.html" title="User:Gungadin">Gungadin</a> 17:02, 20 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- I had heard of her more than some of the other contestants who have their own page. Plus she only has one arm. <a href="../../../a/s/t/User%7EAstrotrain_5c9a.html" title="User:Astrotrain">Astrotrain</a> 11:41, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>What on earth has her number of arms have to do with her notability? <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon_Harald_S%C3%B8by_4866.html" title="User:Jon Harald Søby">Jon</a> <a href="../../../j/o/n/User_talk%7EJon_Harald_S%C3%B8by_2146.html" title="User talk:Jon Harald Søby">Harald</a> <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jon_Harald_S%C3%B8by" class="extiw" title="m:User:Jon_Harald_Søby">Søby</a> 19:25, 21 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Another contributor to this debate that has not read the article? She has one functioning arm, but both arms are still attached to her body. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrenwith_53e5.html" title="User:Trenwith">Trenwith</a> 20:02, 21 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep or Merge, BUT do not delete</b>. She is now definately more popular(or infamous)than many other BB contestants. <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPreetikapoor0_ca32.html" title="User:Preetikapoor0">Preetikapoor0</a> 04:16, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
