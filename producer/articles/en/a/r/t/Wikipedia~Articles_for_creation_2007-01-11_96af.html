<p>1) Make Mashed poetatoes with a potatoe masher that has wide holes and leave it lumpy.</p>
<p>2) Form into thick cylander and crisp tater-tot style</p>
<p>3) Wait to cool about 3min.</p>
<p>4) Fold inside-out and sprinkle parsley on top. Be light, and BE CAREFUL!!! THE STEAM WILL BE HOT!!!</p>
<p>Now I'm not a master chef, but that should be a delicious plate of good food!!</p>

Taylor Williams (<a href="../../../s/u/f/Suffield_Academy_c755.html" title="Suffield Academy">Suffield Academy</a>) played against Rakim Sanders (St. Andrew's), who many consider the number one shooting guard prospect in the country. Williams accumulated 18 points in 24 minutes and blocked Sanders a state record six times, earning the nickname "Dikembe." Sanders will be on his way to <a href="../../../b/o/s/Boston_College_ba3b.html" title="Boston College">Boston College</a> next year, while Williams, a junior, considers making the leap straight to the <a href="../../../n/b/a/NBA_52b6.html" title="NBA">NBA</a>, after a year at either <a href="../../../d/u/k/Duke.html" title="Duke">Duke</a> or <a href="../../../u/c/o/UCONN_0e0c.html" title="UCONN">Connecticut</a> (due to the new NBA rule). Expect him to go early in the draft in 2009 or 2010.</p>

<p>'Mute English' describes the common occurrence, notably in the People's Republic of China, where students can read and understand English but cannot speak it well. The phrase is a translation of the Chinese phrase, "哑巴英语" ("ya ba ying yu" in pinyin). This occurs due to the lack of native speakers to emulate or practice with, particularly in a country as large as China. The phenomenon is sometimes referred to as 'Dumb English'. Efforts to mitigate Mute English in China have resulted in numerous commercial products, international exchanges, and the propensity with which Chinese students wish to practice their English with foreigners.</p>
<p>Obviously, any language can have its form of 'Mute' speakers, e.g. 'Mute Polish'. However, the phenomenon of 'Mute English' in China is a massive, acknowledged problem, one which the school systems and students attempt to address.</p>
<p>A related concept is the less-common 'Deaf English'.</p>

Tarleton Perry Crawford (1821-1902) was a controversial Southern Baptist missionary to Shandong, China.</p>
<p>Posted initially to <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shanghai.html" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a> in 1852, the Crawfords moved to <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dengzhou.html" title="Dengzhou">Dengzhou</a> in <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shandong.html" title="Shandong">Shandong</a>, perhaps to gain more independence from mission oversight. His complex and domineering character caused much dissent and sometimes embarrassment, earning the rebuke of the American consul. He insisted on preaching as the sole duty of the missionary, and had been dismayed by the fiasco involving <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Gutzlaff_04e6.html" title="Charles Gutzlaff">Charles Gutzlaff</a>’s Chinese evangelists. He thereafter insisted Chinese should never be paid out of mission funds. His friend Dr. George Burton’s burnout due to excessive medical work in Shanghai reinforced his central conviction. Crawford itinerated widely around local villages (131 in 1875 alone). His singlemindedness even meant he closed down his wife’s school in 1879, perhaps out of jealousy at her success with <a href="../../../l/o/t/Lottie_Moon_488a.html" title="Lottie Moon">Lottie Moon</a> at Shating.</p>
<p>His attacks on the mission board, whom he thought should have no say on mission matters, meant he was finally struck off in 1892. Crawford formed the Gospel Mission, and eight (of fourteen) SBC missionaries joined him. By the turn of the century the mission had grown to nineteen missionaries, all wearing Chinese clothing, living in Chinese houses, and ‘solely preaching the gospel’. It took nearly a generation for SBC missionaries to overcome his ‘unattractive social philosophy and his refusal to give sensible leadership to the Christian Chinese.’ (Hyatt, 1976:59)</p>
<p>Martha Crawford remained loyal to her husband, though disagreed with several of his views. She formed a boys’ school in 1867 in her home. Several of the students became the backbone of pastors at the successful Huangxian and Pingdu stations. She also wrote <i>The Three Maidens</i> as a book for children, which was subsequently widely used throughout China. At the Second Missionary Conference (1877) she spoke on ‘Women’s Work for Women’, stressing house-to-house visitation, instructing local women and the preparation of suitable literature for them. Crawford's main work <i>The Patriarchal Dynasties</i>, announced his convication that the world was 14,376 years and the <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garden_of_Eden_033d.html" title="Garden of Eden">Garden of Eden</a> was a <a href="../../../t/h/e/Theocratic.html" title="Theocratic">theocratic</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Confederacy.html" title="Confederacy">confederacy</a>, with a population of 1,174,405,120.</p>

A(d)riana Nozeman (or Noseman or Nooseman), born Ariana van den Bergh (born 1626/28-died 7 December 1661), was the first actress in The Netherlands. She made her debut on stage in 1655 at the Amsterdam Schouwburg (Amsterdam Theater) in a play which accidentally bore her name ‘Onvergelijkelijke Ariana’ (‘Uncomparable Ariana’).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-11_96af.html" title="Edit section: Early life">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Early life</span></h2>
<p>The daughter of actor and playwright Adriaan van den Bergh, Ariana was born in Middelburg probably between 1626 and 1628. Her father had a travelling theatre company and translated and adapted several English dramas for the Dutch stage. Among them Thomas Kyds “the Spanish Tragedy”-renamed Don Jeronimo (1621) in Dutch. Ariana could possibly not write.</p>
<p>She may have learnt the craft at a very early age. It was quite common for women and children in travelling theatre companies to appear on stage as these groups often consisted of actors’ families. Later on, she possibly joined the troupe of Jan Baptist van Fornenbergh. This company took the tradition of Dutch theatre to distant corners of Europe touring the north of Germany and Scandinavia, performing at fairs as well as royal courts such as the one of Swedish Queen Christina (1653). While in Hamburg, the actress married her collegue, the actor Gillis Nozeman in the Reformed Church of nearby Altona, a free haven for dissenters and marginalized. Ariana and Gillis became known as the first actors’couple in Dutch theatre history.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-11_96af.html" title="Edit section: Opulent costumes">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Opulent costumes</span></h2>
<p>On June 30 1655, the name of Ariana Nozeman was recorded for the first time in the Amsterdam theatre archives. The actress was paid 76,50 Dutch florins for 17 performances. The amount was higher than most of her male contemporaries. She was even paid more than her husband, because she brought her own opulent costumes to the scene. Unlike Italy and France where women had already made their appearances on the public stage, women’s parts in the Dutch Republic were still generally being played by men in the first half of the 17th century. The resignation of six actors at the Amsterdam Schouwburg (Theatre) may have led to Ariana Nozeman’s debut.</p>
<p>Ariana Nozeman mostly played serious roles. She was the first actress who ever performed Badeloch in the historical play Gijsbrecht van Aemstel by Joost van den Vondel, Holland’s most famous poet of the 17th century. She was rarely seen in farces or comical acts. She also sang and is known as the first ballet dancer in The Netherlands. She was often seen on stage together with her husband Gillis Nozeman either as a couple or as antagonists. Their daughter Maria Nozeman (born 1652) followed in her mother’s footsteps; she entered the stage at the age of six years. The Nozemans supplemented their theatre incomes by running an inn called The Camel on one of the Amsterdam canals.</p>

<p>By putting herself on public show, Ariana Nozeman would surely not have had the approval of the stern Dutch Reformed Church. Simon Schama in The Embarassment of Riches says: “In 1655 the first actress appeared in the Amsterdam theater, strengthening the clergy’s view that it was the sink of the vilest iniquity. But Adriana Nozeman went on to make an illustrious career there nonetheless”. Holland – in spite of its Calvinist character- was a secular society and Amsterdam, the capital of the mighty Dutch Republic, known for its free and tolerant climate. Banned philosophers such as Locke and Descartes got their works published here. Pornography was printed here as well.</p>
<p>The stage curtain dropped for Ariana Nozeman when she was not even 35 years old. She died on 7 December 1661. Three months earlier she had lost her only 7-year old son Mathijs. Maybe she died of heartbreak or maybe she fell victim to the pest. She was buried in the Oude Kerk (Old Church), now in the heart of Amsterdam’s famous red light district. Her death meant a great loss for the Amsterdam Schouwburg. They contracted immediately four new actresses to replace her.</p>
<p>Three hundred years after her stage debut, in 1955, the first woman on the Dutch stage was commemorated. The city council of Amsterdam honoured her memory with a street named Ariana Nozemanstraat in the western part of the city.</p>

<p>In 1999, two guys got together, formed a band, joined by 6 others, and started the dream. That’s the basic story behind the Wust El Balad band. Eight talented guys from all across the country joined together in Downtown, i.e. Wust El Balad, Cairo, forming one of the most successful bands in Egypt now. Being from different musical backgrounds, each guy brought his own flavor to the group.</p>
<p>Their first appearance as Wust El Balad was at Al Mashrabeya Gallery, followed by their first paid performance at the Berlitz Language Center. Ever since that moment, Wust El Balad was a regular performer at all galleries, cultural centers, bars, special events and hotels, and even abroad.</p>
<p>Their vision then was to reach the average person that can't afford hearing them in bars or galleries. And so they were the first band to play in the Egyptian street, experiencing one of the most amazing concerts, playing in Al Alfi Street to the local community during the French festival "Les Francais aiment l'Egypte".</p>
<p>Wust El Balad, an amazing blend of sounds, combining traditional Arabic music with a modern and western twist, is successful in making their music as accessible as possible, not just in Cairo, but beyond. Wust El Balad means real world music in the best sense of the word.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2007-01-11_96af.html" title="Edit section: Band Members">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Band Members</span></h3>
<p>Adham El Saeid, (Born on April 6, 1969) Inspired by his grandmother's renditions of songs from the villages in Upper Egypt, and his uncle who engaged him in the country's oral traditions, Adham brings the traditional oriental sense to the group, counterbalancing the dominant western influence. History department graduate, Adham El Saeid knows how to sing a good “Mawal” that attracts all Wust El Balad Audience, Foreigners before Egyptians</p>
<p>Hany Adel, (Born on September 20, 1977) The "attractive one" as called in many occasions. It was Omran's and his idea to put together the group of Wust El Balad. Beside composing some of the songs, Hany is a whole show himself, his great presence combined with his lively guitar playing, and his energetic, sensitive voice brings the band to its maximum energy level.</p>
<p>Ahmed Omran, (Born on November 15, 1977) The Not-Always-Present member of Wust El Balad. Though being one of the two founders of the Group, Omran is not always available at all concerts, but when he is, you will listen to one of the best Oud players around. Omran is the only member in the band who has a formal musical background. Playing Oud and Flute, sometimes composing some of the songs, Omran completes the Wust el Balad image.</p>
<p>Mohammed Gamal Al Din, (Born on February 10, 1982) Kids, who grow up in families of musicians, always end up wanting to be musicians themselves, that's the case with Mohammed as he is the grandson of a very famous composer. As one of the most important percussion players in Cairo, Mizo always lightens up the stage with his conversational-like performance with Bob.</p>
<p>Ismail Fawzy, (Born on April 8, 1978) Off all the musicians in the band, the most interesting and intriguing is Ismail. Though the band is a group of extraordinary musicians, But Ismail's talent and attitude added a joyful taste. Always smiling, totally energetic, Ismail brings a lot of energy and strength to the band. He is a computer science graduate, who composes some of the songs for the band. Ismail pays great attention to the lyrics, his favorite song, Magnoun, is a pure evidence of a singer who believes in what he sings.</p>
<p>Asaad Nessim, (Born on November 20, 1966) Watching and listening how he masters the guitar, one would think that he started playing a long long time ago. In fact, Asaad first played the Piano for over 6 years, before figuring out that Spanish guitar is his main destiny.And it can be said, that he is now one of the best Spanish guitar players all over Egypt. Extremely calm, very sensitive andconcentrated, playing with a very difficult technique, Asaad knows how to get the attention while playing one of his brilliant Solos whithin his role as the lead guitarist of Wust el Balad.</p>
<p>Ehab Abdel Hameed, (Born on November 6, 1976) Ehab or Bob began his real career with the Wust el Balad band, after many rehearsals with Modo, the Senegalese singer, and Ismail Fawzy. Still a law student, but yet to be considered one of the most wanted percussion players in Egypt, Bob is one of the first who played with "Cajun", the famous Spanish instrument. No one can ever mistake the enthusiasm in which Bob always performs. Bob and Mizo are the most famous Percussion Duo in Egypt</p>
<p>Ahmed Omar, (Born on September 28, 1977) Born in Egypt to an Eriterian father, certainly affected his sense of music. Omar joined the music scene more than 4 years ago, starting with singing, playing guitar and then moving to his current instrument, bass guitar. Omar, believing that music is the most important issue in life, resigned from his former job as a teacher in german. His "Eritrean" melody reflects a true sense of imagination and creativity</p>

<p>Rory Dafoe was a average little boy, but little did he know that he would be playing the game of his life in "Stanley's Cup." This average person from Russel was a normal gent who wore yellow shirts. However one day while attending to some customers at the local gas station a fire started. Inside were three children and a cat. Rory ran into the house while the mother freaked out and saved all the children, the kat and the two hundread year old grand piano that was inside.</p>
<p>Rory became the newest hero in Russel for saving these people. He choose not to attend his cellibration for his heroic efforts because he felt he did what he had to do. He chooses to live his normal life like he did before because that makes him happy</p>

<p>David Fidess (birthdate unknown) is an actor and amateur boxer currently residing in and around the <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_River_Delta_5f7c.html" title="Pearl River Delta">Pearl River Delta</a> of southern <a href="../../../c/h/i/China.html" title="China">China</a>. In the past he has also worked as a doorman, an English teacher and as hired muscle.</p>
<p>"The Fidness" was born in <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vancouver.html" title="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_Columbia_90ec.html" title="British Columbia">British Columbia</a> little is known about his early life, except that his childhood was difficult and troubled, forcing him into a life of crime by his late teens. There are rumous that his grandfather was the founder of the Vancouver chapter of the <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freemasons.html" title="Freemasons">Freemasons</a>, yet it is unknown whether there is any truth in these claims. While there are few definite facts relating to this period of his life, unconfirmed reports tell of him having a reputation on the streets of Vancouver for extreme violence and humiliating those that crossed his path by beating them and then proceeding to defecate or excrete onto their faces.</p>
<p>In 1995, wanting to escape his tough life in Vancouver, Fiddes left Canada for Hong Kong in order to pursue his acting and boxing careers. He soon found work, starring alongside <a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Claude_van_Damme_9cd6.html" title="Jean-Claude van Damme">Jean-Claude van Damme</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Rob_Schneider_8dcb.html" title="Rob Schneider">Rob Schneider</a> in the film <a href="../../../k/n/o/Knock_Off_21fd.html" title="Knock Off">Knock Off</a><sup>1</sup>. In order to support himself whilst trying to further his acting career, Fidess found work as a bouncer at various establishments around Hong Kong, where his no-nonsense attitude made him many new enemies. Fiddes was particularly unpopular with the <a href="../../../s/o/u/South_Asian_47ff.html" title="South Asian">South Asian</a> population of Hong Kong, who viewed him as a threat. This problem was exacberated when he fell into difficulties with the <a href="../../../t/r/i/Triads.html" title="Triads">triads</a> in unclear circumstances (it is suspected that it was related to some kind of illegal boxing, although nothing has ever been proved).</p>
<p>Fidess's problems in Hong Kong culminated in a boxing match in Hong Kong against the a Hong Kong policeman, Joe Tsui Ho-yin(徐浩然), in which Fiddes was knocked out<sup>1</sup>. Fiddes claims that the "gloves were rigged", despite the fact that the two pairs came out equally in a weighing. Angered by, what he saw as preferential treatment for the policeman, Fidess left for Mainland China.</p>
<p>To this date, Fidess has been struggling to continue acting and boxing. He has had numerous offers to return to Hong Kong and start boxing competitively again, but is in locked in a battle of wills with the Hong Kong Boxing Association, as they refuse to admit that they were mistaken and the now semi-legendary gloves were rigged. He currently resides in <a href="../../../z/h/u/Zhuhai.html" title="Zhuhai">Zhuhai</a> , having lived in <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chaozhou.html" title="Chaozhou">Chaozhou</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shekou.html" title="Shekou">Shekou</a> in <a href="../../../s/h/e/Shenzhen.html" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a>, amongst other places and he teaches English and self-defence for a living.</p>
<p>Fidess is a keen linguist and in his spare time has mastered multiple <a href="../../../e/a/s/East_Asian_languages_30a3.html" title="East Asian languages">East Asian languages</a> through self-study. He attributes his sucess in this field to his self-designed technique of language learning, which he hopes to publish in the coming future. He also enjoys a deep spirituality and has made pilgrimages to many sites around China and maintains a healthy interest in the <a href="../../../p/e/o/People%27s_Police_e9dc.html" title="People's Police">People's Police</a> in China and their operations.</p>

<p>The Edwards Personality Inventory, revised edition, (EPI:R) was designed primarily for use in research and counselling. The inventory consists of 440 items and provides scores on 18 personality scales. Each scale is identified by a single name and a three-letter abbreviation.</p>
<p>Because scale names can easily mean different things to different people, abstract trait names such as "ego-strength," "rigidity," and "extraversion" have been avoided in assigning names to the scales in the EPI. Instead, an attempt has been made to assign names to the scales that imply nothing more than a summary of the content of the items in the scales.</p>
<p>There are no items in the EPI inquiring into an exam­inee's religious or political beliefs or family relationships. There are no items referring to delusions, hallucinations, health, or bodily function. Furthermore, almost all items that have extreme socially undesirable scale values have been eliminated, because of evidence (Walsh, Layton, &amp; Klieger, 1966) that college students regard being asked to respond True or False to such items as an invasion of privacy.

<p>On New Year's Day 2003 a North Carolinian family, heading home from their 3-day vacation to Nashville, TN, was pulled over after witnesses saw money fly from their car. James Smoak, the driver, had filled his car's gas tank at a Davidson County, TN gas station and left his wallet on the roof of his station wagon. When witnesses who saw the money contacted police, the police, instructed to make a felony stop of the vehicle, pulled the station wagon over on I-40 in Putnam County, TN at exit 287. Tennessee Highway Patrol, assisted by Cookevill Police, pulled the car over and handcuffed the family. Pamela Smoak, James' wife, and Brandon Hayden, Pamela's 17-year-old son, were also in the car. The family also had in tow with them two canines. After being handcuffed, the family pleaded with police to shut their car doors to keep their dogs from getting out. Moments later, Patton, a pitt-bull, jumped from the car and came towards police. The family pleaded again with police to let them secure their dog. As the dog came towards police with his tail wagging, Cookeville police officer Eric Hall shot the canine in the head with his 12-gauge shotgun. Hall later wrote in the report of the incident that he feared the animal would bite him. Officer Hall had been involved in another incident in 1998 where he shot a canine accused of aggression.</p>
<p>Cookeville police reviewed the police video and also had it reviewed, independently, by Maryland Police Chief Mary Ann Viverette. Cookeville Police originally decided that Hall's actions were justified since the officer feared the actions of the canine however, Viverette's review of the video and incident caused her to write about her concern that, after seeing there were no other individuals in the family's station wagon but seeing the dogs, the officers did not close the car doors. Cookeville Police Chief Bob Terry put Officer Hall on administrative duty for the duration of compiling report but afterwards stated the Officer Hall would be placed back in the field. Officer Hall was never the subject of any disciplinary action for this incident.</p>
<p>This incident led to the response of the ASPCA, who called for police officers be trained to read an animals' body language so that future, innocent pets would not die in similar events. The incident was also widly criticized by the public. Officer Hall and his family were the subject of many death threats and later Officer Hall sued the city on grounds of violation of privacy since they released his personnel file to the public.</p>
<p>Later analysis of the police footage shows discrepencies from what actually happened that New Year's Day and what officers recall in the report.</p>

<p><br />
<b>1988:</b> At the age of 17 in a warehouse located in Washington DC Daniel Bussius had his first experience in the electronic music scene. Immediately finding a love for the music and passion to become involved in the pursuit of expanding the electronic music scene Daniel began working as a promoter for one of the Washington DC area’s biggest underground rave promoters. With events drawing in 5,000+ attendees at secret locations Daniel realized the potential to launch a full scale marketing, promotions and production company. With college at his heels Daniel moved to San Diego, California and soon thereafter launched In The Mix Promotions (www.itmpromos.com). Taking his college grant money to start the company rather then buy books. Daniel’s first client was none other then a Fortune 100 client, Brown and Williamson. After producing a series of successful events in Arizona Daniel was awarded with managing their San Diego event production and management program. Within two years Daniel had taken over the San Francisco, Orange County, South Beach/Miami, Orlando and Los Angeles markets. Building his agency while maintaining a full-time status as a college student majoring in Economics Daniel quickly built In The Mix Promotions (www.itmpromos.com) into a six figure income nationwide agency. In The Mix Promotions has since produced Super Bowl parties, national tours and has worked with over 60% of the Fortune 100 companies.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2002:</b> Soon after graduating San Diego State University Daniel launched a second promotional marketing agency named Promotional Marketing Concepts which handled the Los Angeles launch of Stoli Citrona and Tequiza beer. Building on that business and adding new clients to the portfolio Promotional Marketing Concepts and In The Mix Promotions merged creating a powerhouse full service marketing firm. Soon after Daniel was approached by one of his clients and asked to manage the entire Southern California market producing music events with world class talent, manage over 120 nightlife venues and working with a budget in the excess of $500,000.00. Producing immediate success and being recognized as the company’s number one producer in cutting edge events, sponsorships and marketing initiatives. Within one year of that position Daniel was recruited by another Fortune 100 client RJ Reynolds (Camel) to build a multi-million dollar event marketing campaign.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2004:</b> Moving from his home base in Los Angeles Daniel worked closely with senior executives at RJ Reynolds producing a nationwide event marketing program, mansion parties, a national tour and ground up events incorporating world class talent from all musical genres. His event marketing campaign structure is still in use to this day by RJ Reynolds.</p>
<p><br />
<b>2005:</b> With a tremendous amount of momentum behind him, Daniel took on a larger role with a telecommunications company as the Director of International Events. He began crafting grass roots global programs with world famous artists, producers and charities. In conjunction with his marketing and event management roles Daniel developed an International telecommunications conference Global Mobile. Realizing again that working in the corporate world limited his abilities to produce innovative event concepts Daniel left his role as the Director of International Events and began to develop an idea he had been sitting on for two years – a West Coast based International music conference.</p>
<p><br />
In November of 2005 Daniel launched the Vegas Music Conference (www.lvmc.us) introducing a new twist on the currently diluted electronic music conference format based in Miami. Realizing that an undertaking of this magnitude would require more then just one person, Daniel brought in superstar industry professionals, record labels, world famous artists, management companies and financial investors. Stay tuned for the next venture Daniel embarks on as the Vegas Music Conference, in its first year, had over 20,000 attendees and broke 3 Las Vegas city records.</p>
