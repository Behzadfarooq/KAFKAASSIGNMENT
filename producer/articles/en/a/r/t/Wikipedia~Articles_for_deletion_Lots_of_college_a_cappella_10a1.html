<dd>I must have missed the Chorallaries. I don't think I nominated anyone else who reached the finals of the International Championship of College A Cappella (that's why I didn't nominate Resonance--the group from the discussion you cite). However, I still think we should delete Penn Masala. I could start the first a cappella group only for Econ majors, etc. It's not a claim to notability. <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 00:35, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li>I disagree. My point is that the list is arbitrary -- some have been deemed "notable," others not notable, but there's no real distinction between the notable un-listed and the not-notable listed. So, yes, I think the arbitrariness of the list is reason enough to keep all of these, insofar as the justification for deleting them is a lack of notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep, list individually.</b> I wholly agree that many college a cappella groups probably don't merit an article, but this shotgun approach is non-functional. Unfortunately, these simply have to be done one at a time. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorj</a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_Esperanza_93c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam/Esperanza"><font color="green">a</font></a><a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">m</a> <a href="../../../j/d/o/User_talk%7EJDoorjam_230c.html" title="User talk:JDoorjam">Talk</a> 05:24, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The contradiction between the two preceeding keeps is the reason for the group nom. If they were listed individually, people would point to other similar articles not on the chopping block. The objection to all of these articles is the same so there's really no reason to clog the AFD page, other than to allow AFD regulars to get 20 edits for the price of one! <a href="../../../s/a/v/User%7ESavidan_59ac.html" title="User:Savidan">savidan</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/v/User_talk%7ESavidan_3fd9.html" title="User talk:Savidan">(talk)</a> <a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><span style="color:#008000;">(e@)</span></a></sup> 06:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. As mentioned above, this is too broad a nomination. I may be biased, but the Din and Tonics are fairly major, and have been for years. Penn Masala is definitely notable; and the King's Singers? Has the nominator ever seen the choral shelf of their local HMV's classical section? When last I looked the King's Singers had a bit of a stranglehold there. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 06:16, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Good Lord, what a shockingly pointless reply. As I clearly should have made obvious, releasing several dozen major albums for one of the largest record companies in the UK (EMI) and completely dominating the choral music scene in terms of output for thirty years or so is what we look for on WP. A good indicator of those things: the choral shelf of your local HMV. A poor choice for someone to put choral groups up en masse for deletion: someone whose never even seen the choral shelf at their local HMV.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't comment on US College a cappella groups - but the King's Singers are something quite different. A major UK group, the original line-up featured prominently on UK national TV during the 1970s - including having several of their own national TV Shows. From a cultural point they popularised a style of music unfamiliar to many people, demonstrated the appeal of classically trained singers performing popular tunes, and arguably influenced the growth in "popular " classics, now a major part of the music industry. In addition, at least two of the original members are still high profile: Brian Kay is a well-known presenter and personality on BBC Radio 3 and Nigel Perrin a prominent classical choral conductor in the UK.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, unacceptably broad nomination. There may well be some of these groups that aren't sufficiently notable, but the presence of several obviously notable groups in the list, as highlighted by other comments above, suggests that the nominator has simply listed a capella groups en masse rather than considering each individual article in detail. --ⁿɡ͡b <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a><span style="padding: 0 0.1em;">\</span><sup style="font-size: 70%;"><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">talk</a></sup> 07:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These groups have albums that have sold more copies than many of the equally small time bands or authors (in terms of books) that are present on Wikipedia. Most of them have history and tradition that is an important part of their campus community, yet merging them into the campus articles would be a disservice to both. And I echo comments above that this looks like a sloppy deletionist event rather than a thought out AfD nom. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 13:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>- Has won or placed in a major music competition. (ICCA, the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.) The group has placed in several rounds of ICCA and group members have won individual awards. - Several alumni later joined a band that is otherwise notable. Alumni Micah Shapiro and Mike Libis were both members of Throwback. Throwback toured extensively in Canada and New England and had a large regional following (I can't think of an absolute indicator of their following, but Throwback does have 12,577 friends on their myspace page). Throwback was also mentioned in a recent McGill News article about McGill alumni bands (which also mentions such notables as Arcade Fire and Leonard Cohen): <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/" class="external free" title="http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/</a>.

<li>This is absurd. You're basically saying you want to delete the groups that a) don't compete in competitions or b) aren't good enough to win them. If a group has an official webpage on the school server they are legitimate, not that legitimacy is a requirement for being on Wikipedia. Point out in the deletion policy what infractions the pages made and I'm sure the various authors will be more than willing to change them accordingly. The nominator has unreliable criteria, as they are subjective.
