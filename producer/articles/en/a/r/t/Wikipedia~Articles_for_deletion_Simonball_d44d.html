<li>Just because this game has been largely invented by "kids" doesn't constitute a reason for deletion, it is infact a game devised many years ago by parents of the games inventers and recently adapted and given a new name. It is a fun game and definately worthy of a place in wikipedia. Chris_125</li>

<li>It is a fast growing sport I believe has a future. Wikipedia prides itself on providing information on a wide range of subject matter; many other subjects a lot smaller than Simonball have entries. I also do not appreciate your condescending tone especially since you know nothing about Simonball other than what I have written and you don't know anything about me or anyone else who plays it hence making your use of the term "kids" inappropriate since many adults as well as "kids" play it. I would accept constructive criticism as to how the article could be improved Chris_125</li>

<li>One of the rules is that Wikipedia is not a crystal ball. No one can predict the future.

<li>I cannot offer proof in the form of newspapers or websites that Simonball is widely played since it has only been played for a short period in recent times. I do know, however, all those who have played Simonball have enjoied the game immensly (hence having over 100 regular players as it has become an un-official college sport). This is the reason why I have spent my evening creating this article, in order to get publicity so that Simonball can spread and then maybe I can show you some proof in the form of newspapers or TV reports.

<p>My name is Adam and I feel it appropriate to concur with Chris_125. As a player of Simon ball myself I think it necessary that I put forward my judgment here. Chris has put foreword some very valid points, and I can confirm that many people at many different colleges in our area have discovered Simon ball and Staff are considering running it in schools. I don’t think you have enough evidence to disrespect the game in question as you do not know enough about the enjoyment that many "kids" AND adults get from playing it, therefore I think you should take back your criticism and put somewhere better deserved. As were on the subject of disrespect, the "Line of Tony" is named so because this is where a friend of Chris and I lost his life. This is another reason I feel it is appropriate for me to put my opinion foreword. I hope you will reconsider your words and let Simon ball takes its course.</p>

<li>Adam, I'm sure youre game is great fun, but it needs to be <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a> to deserve a Wikipedia article. When it's popular enough to be mentioned in the national press, then you can resubmit the article.

<p>I would like to refer to the comment made Mr Danny Lilithborne and say that over here in Harrisonburg, West Virginia, we also play a similar game to simonball and it has entertained the people of our community for generations. I would also like to say that this article has helped us due to the fact that we are now very clear on the different rules and regulations of the game known in england as Simonball!I think that this is a renowed sport and that it should be recognised on this most prestigious internet encyclopedia. Long Live America and SIMONBALL!</p>
<p>Howard. G. McNakey, Harrisonburg (HowardMcNackey123)</p>
<p>Hi I think that simon ball is one of the greatest sports of the modern era. There is no possiable way you can delete this. Simon ball is not just a sport played by kids in a small village but its an art. Art is not somthing you can simply just delete but is an important part of todays modern society. If you feel that it is appropriate to delete this article then mabye you should try the sport before you criticise it.</p>
<p>KEEP SIMON BALL!!!</p>
