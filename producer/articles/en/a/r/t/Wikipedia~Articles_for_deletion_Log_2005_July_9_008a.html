<dd>You don't have to merge the two articles because they don't talk about the same topic, one talks about people with African descent in <b>Mexico</b> the other one about people with African descent in <b>Latin America</b>.

<p>I would argue that the Afro-Latin American article needs the Mexican bit to make it a full article, otherwise it is too bitty.

<dd>SqueakBox, So, we must delete the article about US, and England because there is an article about anglo-saxon?. Of course not, We are speaking of very diferent things. Latin-american and hispanic are cultural terms, withouth regard of country or race. The history of black people in Mexico is very diferent from the history of Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Panama, or Brazil. Honestly i see to option, or have an article on the history of black people outside africa, that would include subchater regarding each contry.. or keep with indepndient articles, like afro-american, afro-cuban, afrom-exican , etc. I found the clasification of "afro-latinamerican" too artificial.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Wikipedia itself is only a few years old and articles are continuing to grow. There are far more obscure articles that Wikipedia is not considering for deletion. For example: Lepontic language is not considered for deletion. WHy then should a living group of people now be ignored on WIkipedia. Squeakbox, your logic is biased (not flawed, but biased). If the mere mention of "Afro" or "Black" people, or culture, or identity even raises the possibility of you considering it to be racist, then it's obvious that your point of view is far from objective. The Black experience in the world has been stratified since the European focus on stratifing Blacks (for discrimination, slavery, etc) began. Therefore the end result is real, and we should not pretend to have a polarized comparison to "whites" or "others". The Black experience in mexico is worth expanding as for merely academic use this particular stratified group of people are being characterized right now on a silly postage stamp to look like gorillas. Memin Penguin should be enough reason for you to realize that it's necessary to keep the article.</li>

<p>It was certainly Menim that made me aware of this series of articles on Afro Latinos. I haven't actually read Menim, though I have fears (perhaps misplaced) that it is an example of the US accusing Mexico of rascism. Which seems a bit off to me. Who are the Americans (or Brits) to criticise other cultures. I think the name Afro is very patronising as the Afro-American concept is purely American.

<li>Agree with <a href="../../../i/n/s/User%7EInstantnood_f6c2.html" title="User:Instantnood">Instantnood</a>. <b>Keep</b> the article <b>if someone can expand it</b> to include further analysis of the cultural origins, usage, and ramifications of the insult. Translations of the term, usually as "turtle egg", appear frequently in English-language texts about China. Googling "turtle egg Chinese insult" alone generates 36700 hits. However, many of the references on- and off-line fail to give any direct explanations of the meaning, etymology, connotations of illegitimacy ("hatching" from a turtle's egg), and what this divulges about the paramount importance of family and ancestral lineage in Chinese culture. For an example, if I remember correctly, <a href="../../../a/d/e/Adeline_Yen_Mah_3d9a.html" title="Adeline Yen Mah">Adeline Yen Mah</a>'s bestselling memoir "Falling Leaves" recalls how the Red Guards called her Aunt "turtle egg" while ransacking her house but only indicates to the English-language reader that this is a grave insult and does not discuss the baggage attached to the term. Future editors of the article should mention notorious public incidents (and political fallout thereof) in which the insult has been deployed, for instance, media entrepreneur <a href="../../../j/i/m/Jimmy_Lai_b4bd.html" title="Jimmy Lai">Jimmy Lai</a>'s denunciation of Chinese Premier <a href="../../../l/i/_/Li_Peng_5a39.html" title="Li Peng">Li Peng</a> as a "turtle's egg with zero IQ." <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/030197hong-kong-media.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/hongkong/archive/030197hong-kong-media.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>.--<a href="../../../d/e/f/User%7EDefrosted_5367.html" title="User:Defrosted">Defrosted</a> 06:46, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Please note <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> just aired the pilot. OTHER television stations requested the series. I also beg to differ on the comments made regarding Channel 31 and community television in general. I believe the comments made probably come from people who aren't invloved in the television industry (neither am I BTW), have never had a show on TV and have probably not seen the series mentioned or the television station in question (BTW I have at least seen both). In general, a lot of programming on community TV comes from shows previously aired on commercial networks (e.g. look at Channel 31 in Melbourne). There are numerous articles throughout Wikipedia mentioning community stations all over the world. I also do not believe that it can be that easy to get a show on TV (I can't say I know anyone who has a show on TV). I personally think a 12 part series that has been shown across a country as big as Australia is very noteworthy. BTW, Magic Dudes are now listed under M.MagicFan 9 July 2005 08:51 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I reviewed all the info I could find on the subject, unfortunately, it's mostly self-promotion, that I found on the web, links on shopping sites pointing to their "unused" website. If at some time in the future, these guys become syndicated, then it may warrant an article. There is not enough information or content to support an article for a public broadcast channel show.

<li>If they truly had such a wide fan base, someone (a contributing wikipedia member that has shown good edits) would have heard of this group. Not to mention it needs press coverage. Plus, these sockpuppets ARE NOT helping your cause. I am not saying new wikipedians should not comment, but the fact that they got DIRECTLY to this VFD page suggest there is something fishy.

<li><b>COMMENT: Incl notes on precedent supporting article</b> As The Magic Dudes was my first entry to Wikipedia, I am really miffed at what is going on here. I had had other "edits" on Wikipedia and added other magicians and acts etc. to the Magic entries. As you can no doubt guess, I am a huge fan of magic. I am really angry to see my hard work of adding links etc. has been deleted by people who have nothing to do with my entries and maybe aren't even magic fans at all (so how would they know anything about the topic). My thought in putting the post up in the first place was that these guys have been on TV, had their own series etc etc. It wasn't just a guest appearance on someone elses show... they had their OWN show. I thought that was pretty noteworthy as I haven't seen any other magicians on TV in Australia apart from the old favourites such as Copperfield and the arch enemy of magicians, The Masked Magician. When I put the entry up, I obviously told other magic fans about my entry so they could see what I had done. Before all I have ever been able to do is add information on magicians already named. This was my first new entry. To see it be called into question is turning me off the whole Wikipedia experience. I cannot be held responsible for some fans of the Magic Dudes going over board in their support of this entry and doing things they shouldn't be doing. I am thrilled however that word is spreading that people are trying to destroy my post and people are taking the time to not only come and look at my post but also to register to try and stop its destruction. To abuse them by calling them sockpuppets is just not warranted and I agree with Mr Douglas that new comers should be given the benefit of the doubt. They obviously new enough about the Magic Dudes to spend the time to register and vote and I think that speaks volumes as I found the whole process of learning Wikipedia less than easy. I have done my best to change the post to answer its criticisms, but just because you people from overseas haven't heard of some Australian magicians makes their achievements no less notable than of they had been Canadians... outside of the magic community, I doubt very much people in Australia have heard of <b><a href="../../../j/a/y/Jay_Sankey_bbc6.html" title="Jay Sankey">Jay Sankey</a></b>, but it makes him none the less a very notable magician. I am sure many more Canadians have heard of him, just as I suspect many laymen in Australia are familiar with the Magic Dudes, having seen them on TV. The Magic Dudes meet the requirements to be considered <b>notable</b> by <b>precedent</b>. Wikipedia states that an author is considered notable if they have had a book published. The Magic Dudes have had a TV show broadcast. Some people in their delete comments have stated that Channel 31 is not noteworthy, but for a television or radio station to be notable, Wikipedia says that it should have broadcast "at least regionally". Considering Channel 31 is established in most Australian states, I would think that is pretty notable. I therefore think there is <b>precedent</b> for my post. As an <b>indication on the quality of talent</b> shown on <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a>, see the Wikipedia post on <b><a href="../../../r/o/v/Rove_McManus_ffb9.html" title="Rove McManus">Rove McManus</a></b>. If you look at his offical biography at <a href="http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp" class="external free" title="http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.rovelive.com/rove/current/bio.asp</a>, you will see that he had a show on Channel 31 and sees it as important enough to include in his bio. And Rove is no light weight. In no less than 2002, 2003 and 2004 he won the <b>Gold Logie award</b> for the most popular personality on Australian television! Hardly a goldfish swimming in a bowl!!MagicFan 9 July 2005 12:43 (UTC)

<li>I can see why you might be miffed. <b>However</b> to carry out your miffed-ness by shameless repeat voting on your own article (or encouraging friends to) is an <i><b>extremely</b></i> good way to make the community want to delete it. Go back, retract the false votes (by striking them out with &lt;s&gt; and &lt;/s&gt; and prove their notability in what remains of the 5 day VfD procedure. Otherwise be sure it will go down in flames. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 9 July 2005 14:04 (UTC)</li>
<li>Note that rove has had national recognition and extends FAR beyond Channel 31 whilst the Magic Dudes seem limited to a very very local prespective. Also, anon IP's are allowed to vote on VFD and their votes are counted. But think about it, what are the chances that ALL these new users would come to this VfD first? Its really hard not to suspect sockpuppetry.... Plus, i'm not saying their votes don't count, in the end, it will be weighted by an admin who will close this vote. Again, please read <a href="../../../i/m/p/WP%7EImportance_ffbd.html" title="WP:Importance">WP:Importance</a> and brush up on policy a little. Also, <a href="../../../c/h/a/Channel_31.html" title="Channel 31">Channel 31</a> is not as notable as the major networks as it IS public access. Heck, there are lots of shows on my local public access station, most of which DO NOT deserve an article in an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a> eg. <a href="http://www.thegeekshow.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.thegeekshow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thegeekshow.com/</a> its only syndicated in Alberta on Access. and Channel 31 broadcasts different things in different locations unlike nationally syndicated networks. That's a big difference, ultimately, public access focuses on local audiences and locally produced shows for most of their shows. Of this time, The Magic Dudes do not meet the WP criterion for notability. Until further press coverage/show expansion is achieved, they do not deserve a encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 19:52, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>On channel 31 right now is "On The Couch" and they are doing a special on the Espy Hotel. Never heard of it? That's because it's about two kilometers away from my house and it is a (really bloody fantastic) pub where mostly unsigned (but really bloody fantastic) bands play. After that is "Vasili's Garden", another good show, I like that Vasili, He sold me some good tomatoes this year, his nursery is like four blocks from my house. Who is he interviewing tonight? Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, that's Cosimo, he <b>literally</b> lives right across the street from me! Small world, man. (This, by the way is all completely true, I was watching it before I decided to come in here and write this.)</li>
<li>I watched Rove on 31 back when dinosaurs roamed the earth. I thought his show was great on then and it's shite now that Dave is gone. But if someone had put a Rove article up then, I'd have nominated it for VfD. Rove, you may have noticed, went on from channel 31 to <i>do something else</i>. And no one found his "31" roots important enough to add to his page until your edit of 12:57, 9 July 2005.</li>
<li>So when <s>you guys</s> sorry, those guys, go on to win a Gold Logie (as voted on by the reader of <a href="http://www.isubscribe.com.au/title_info.cfm?prodID=5508" class="external text" title="http://www.isubscribe.com.au/title_info.cfm?prodID=5508" rel="nofollow">TV Week</a> magazine) I'll vote <i>keep</i>.</li>

<li>I went and followed the Rove link. Why would you want to delete Australia's most popular TV talent of three years running (I thought he had won in 2005 too, but maybe we haven't had that award yet)? Anyway, I followed all the links including the one to Rove's biography. Turns out that Rove actually mentions Channel 31 himself. I think this has more to do with you hating magicians than anything else. I read an article by Jay Sankey once (yes, I've heard of him even though he is Canadian) and he mentioned the "magician haters". IMHO, if you aren't into magic as an art form, then why are you commenting on the noteworthiness or otherwise of a particular magician (or in this case two?). Have you heard of Jay Sankey, or Brad Christian, Oz Perlman, Darwin Ortiz???? I can well understand why fans of magic are getting upset on here. Michael Douglas 01:26, 10 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Aaron was saying that IF there was an article on Rove back when he was ONLY on Channel 31, he would have VFDed that page, but Rove has had much more noteriety than that. And we are not "hating magicians" as you put it. We are simply following the set Wikipedia policy. It doesn't matter if they're magicians, or artist, or scientist or CEOs, we still apply the same standards. Jay Sankey shows notability as his trick was performed by Copperfield, an OBVIOUS credit to his talents and meaning he has achieved a degree of notability to be noticed in the magic world and general public. The Magic Dudes have put their own show on public TV (heck, gimme a couple hundred bucks and i can do the same thing) and produced their OWN DVD thats not mass distributed. Doesn't quite make the cut. And it doesn't matter if we've heard of them or not, we're judging on the basis of the article. That's a fair judgement for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../s/a/s/User%7ESasquatch_97db.html" title="User:Sasquatch">Sasquatch<span class="Unicode">′</span></a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../s/a/s/User_talk%7ESasquatch_36e0.html" title="User talk:Sasquatch">Talk</a><span class="Unicode">↔</span><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sasquatch_3b68.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sasquatch">Contributions</a> 22:54, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment: Sasquatch, thank you for you feedback regarding "Anyone can contribute to the discussion and vote, anonymous users as well as pseudonymous users". and advice that "If you are contributing your first article, or are a newly pseudonymous user, please state this clearly and up-front" which none of these users have done and that "Unsigned contributions may be discounted." I didn't know this (being new to Wikipedia) and I'm sure other people voting didn't either. Good to see some constructive comments for a change rather than the newby bashing that has gone on before. I must comment on Fur Experts comments. Access TV in North Amercia must be different to community TV in Australia. My understanding is that the shows are programmed by a programme director. You can't just "plug in" and transmit stuff. The fact that The Magic Dudes had a pilot on C31 before OTHER stations asked for the series seems to indicate to me that it is more complex than what you make out. Also, can you confirm your source that the DVD was self produced? Do you have a copy? There seems to be so much emphasis on the fact that these people made a START on C31. I don't see other people who STARTED on C31 being deleted. Furthermore, can someone please explain to me why THESE magicians are different to all the other magicians on Wikipedia? Is this a North American thing? If having their own TV series in multiple states of a country of 20 million isn't noteable, what is? Do they have to be North American? I have edited articles on other North American magicians before (both before and after registering) and none of these magicians has come up for deletion.MagicFan 02:58, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</b>
<ul>
<li>Let me show you something from this very article itself: "While the series continues to be shown on television, the Magic Dudes have not been seen performing together since producing their television series and DVD. It is hard to find out much more information on the Magic Dudes as they protect their actual identities closely. Their real names have never appeared on any advertising material for their shows or as credits on their TV series and at present their existing web site is under renovation after the announcement they are working on a stage show." To me, that sounds like this article is mostly used for promotion, which was why it was even put on here in the first place. I tried to look up information about these guys, I found nothing (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+Magic+Dudes" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=The+Magic+Dudes" rel="nofollow">[18]</a>). <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 03:03, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yea, I have to take Zscout's side on this one. Even though they have been on TV, it just doesn't seem enough. For a couple of reasons a) Channel 31 is public access (even if threre is a program manager, it is signifangantly easier to get your own locally produced programs on air) b) they have done nothing else BEYOND just going on TV to indicate a level of notability and c) <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> due to the lack of outside media coverage and public knowledge of the issue. This all seems to point that these guys do not deserve an article <b>as of yet</b>. I sincerely hope you guys luck in promoting yourselves and making a name for yourselves, but right now, you have to remember Wikipedia is not an advertising agency, its an encyclopedia, and The Magic Dudes just isn't encyclopedic yet.

<li><b>Message for Sasquatch</b> Sasquatch, not sure how to send you a message, but sure you'll be revisting this one again... you seem to understand the whole Wikipedia thing. I noticed that a VERY notable Canadian magician does not have an article in Wikipedia, but there is already an article on someone with the same name. How do you add an article on a different person with same name as someone who already has an article? Also, I getting really sick of the bullshit name slinging going on here (sockpuppetry, vanity, puffery etc etc). As you have actually made some constructive comments, as opposed to some other butt wipes who have posted here, could you make any suggestions as to what I need to do to improve this particular article for it to stay? I am a HUGE Magic Fan and I think any magician that has been on TV or is known more than regionally is worthy of an article (for example, lay people in Australia wouldn't have heard of Jay Sankey, but most magic fans I know know who he is... maybe he is more well known in Canada, but in the magic community, he is certainly WELL known and I notice the article on him has no such hassles as mine on the Magic Dudes). There are really notable magicians in Australia I would like to add, but I don't want to waste my team if I get abuse like I have on here.MagicFan 03:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Calling people "butt wipes" isn't constructive either. Accusations of sockpuppetry and vanity are meaningful in this forum. Grade-school insults are not. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 03:17, July 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>First, let me clarify sock puppet accusations, they arise from the INFLUX (you can go look at other VFDs and compare) of new user accounts suddenly being drawn to this page and voting keep. This tends to indicate <b>EITHER</b> a) someone is setting up multiple user accounts and voting repeatedly or b) that someone has told all their friends and family to come here and vote keep. Either way, a) means sockpuppet votes and shouldn't be counted and b) suggests that they have no notability outside people who know them personally. This would make those votes relatively meaningless compared to the others who have judged the article. Hope that makes sense? Anyways, I'll leave you a message on your talk page on how to create pages like that. And a vanity page just implies that The Magic Dudes was either written by the Magic Dudes themselves or someone really close to the Magic Dudes.

<li>For Zscout... I got most of my info from their website... I was able to find it at www.magicdudes.com. I had it saved in my favourites. It used to have more than one page, but looks like it is down for reno at this time as the links from the page have gone. Also in Google, I got four other sites referencing this site.MagicFan 03:12, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>From the four references, if we are even talking about the same thing, could be mirrors of Wikipedia. Many have popped up, so looking for stuff is hard.

<li>For Zscout again... no, I didn't get those Wikipedia links you mentioned? Does Google give different things in different countries? The references I got were from other web sites to the Magic Dudes web site. I can almost see what you are saying re the vanity if I cut and pasted from the Dudes web site. Do you have an constructive suggestions as to what I could change in my article to remove that aspect? I only added them because I was online doing Google searches for them and came across Wikipedia links to magicians, but couldn't find them there. I've seen them on TV, so I thought they deserved an article. There are a few other Australian magicians I have noticed that are also not in Wikipedia, as well as some North American ones, all of whom have had TV series. I am quite happy to take constructive criticisms of my article, just getting a little tired of the allegations made against people who have actually heard of the Magic Dudes. I obviosuly think the article should stay, so I am happy to make changes that people suggest (already took out some rumours and also fixed the caps etc etc as mentioned by other people). You will also note I have asked Sasquatch for his input.MagicFan 03:33, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>ARTICLE REWRITTEN</b>: Hope nobody minds, but I read all the comments, read the cries for help and looked at all the links. All rumour, promotional type material and awkward history has now been completely rewritten. The article now only talks about what the Magic Dudes HAVE achieved, deletes reference to any potential vanity material (i.e. their DVD which they may or may not have produced themselves) and diminishes the emphasis on their starting role on Channel 31 and instead emphasises that this was were they started, not where they are now. I hope that this appeases both camps (i.e. KEEP and DELETE). I don't know why anyone else didn't think of this before they tried to discourage all the newbies.</p>

<li>Hi Madchester, they were definitely on TV as I've seen their show too. I also did a Google search and I think the links you are talking about are old. There must have been a previous owner of the URL as the Magic Dudes aren't a shop, they are an act. If they were a shop, it would be a pretty crud shop as they don't sell anything.

<li><b>Comment</b> Proof that the delete voters don't know their notable from not notable magicians. The same guys delted Richard Sanders from Wikipedia. Richard Sanders has had TV shows in North America, appears with Jay Sankey, delvelops magic with Jay Sankey and gives lectures on magic. The same people trying to delete the Magic Dudes say Jay Sankey is notable, but delete Richard Sanders. By the same token, they leave Magic Joe in Wikipedia. It is becoming very apparant that certain individuals here just go around deleting other peoples articles without doing any research into what is notable and what isn't.

<li>They didn't look like a shop on TV or DVD either. First time I've seen a shop do magic&#160;:-) They look like two blokes to me. I put their photo up now. Hope that doesn't break any rules.

<li>I did a scan back through edits to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Magicians_77e4.html" title="List of Magicians">List of Magicians</a> and Richard Sanders was deleted twice. Once by Postdlf and once by Android79, both of whom feature as negative voters on this page and both of whom obviously know nothing about the magic community.
<ul>
<li>Two different things. Just because someone was removed from the list does not mean their article was whacked. As stated above, we do have an article on Richard Sanders, the actor.

<li>Google hits are not an exact indicator of notability. For example, I bet, for example, Paris Hilton gets more Google hits than someone like John Quincy Adams or just about any other American president, even though Ms. Hilton was not the one to make the significant impact on history. A central theme of the LaRouche movement is in the same sense more notable than some comic book character. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 9 July 2005 07:47 (UTC)

<li>The more apt comparison is that [Paris Hilton] gets over nine million hits, while [Paris Hilton Suffren] gets only 28k. Therefore our article on Paris Hilton is not about the hotel on avenue de Suffren in Paris. -<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWillmcw_1a7f.html" title="User:Willmcw">Willmcw</a> July 9, 2005 08:53 (UTC)

<li>Okay. So are you saying that we disregard holistic, qualitative assessments of notability and just use number of Google hits as an ironclad rule? <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 9 July 2005 09:00 (UTC)</li>
<li>To further the point, Pres. Washington is about 2.5 times more popular on the web than Ms. Hilton (thank whatever higher power!) Also, Mr. LaRouche, despite many attempts, has never been elected to high office, so comparing his movement to any American President (even the current very foolish one) probably appears unreasonable to most people who are not a part of the LaRouche movement. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 9 July 2005 08:55 (UTC)

<li>Very foolish indeed... I respect your opinion on the VfD here, but his presidential bids are hardly the only facet of his movement. <a href="../../../c/o/g/User%7ECognition_c8b2.html" title="User:Cognition">Cognition</a> 9 July 2005 09:01 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. Political success, however, is the only achievement which might put Mr. LaRouche on par with J. Q. Adams, et. al. As a philosopher, his following is devoted and notable, but not so extensive that every "term of art" he employs deserves notice, to the exclusion of other uses. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 9 July 2005 10:09 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a grammar article on a dictionary definition linked to no other pages. I created this article in response to a protest that <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mann_%28military_rank%29.html" title="Mann (military rank)">Mann (military rank)</a> didnt speak of the origin of the word. The disambig page <a href="../../../m/a/n/Mann.html" title="Mann">Mann</a> now deals with this issue.

<p><b>New rationale for deletion</b>: As there seems to have been some confusion as to what valid criteria for deletion are, I think it only appropriate to lay out some legitimate reasons the article should be deleted that are not given in the initial nomination:</p>
<ol>
<li>While some of the article's contents deserve to be in Wikipedia, the attempted consolidation of a wide range of concepts from normal astrophysics to crank science is plainly <a href="../../../o/r/i/Original_research.html" title="Original research">original research</a>. There is no single "Electric universe model" that exists. Rather there are a lot of ideas about electricity in the universe that the article claims to be about.</li>
<li>There is a book called "The Electric Universe" that was published and arguably could have a page in Wikipedia. But this is not a page about this book.</li>
<li>Nor is this a page about <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> or the various Electric star ideas of <a href="../../../v/e/l/Velikovsky.html" title="Velikovsky">Velikovsky</a>. Instead it is a clearinghouse of these and other pretty much unrelated topics -- a disambiguation page that was made up.</li>
<li>The page is basically a <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">POV fork</a> that organizes information culled from the internet to push an agenda of attacking <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_consensus.html" title="Scientific consensus">mainstream science</a> while keeping a lot of uncontroversial material that is unrelated to the agenda (a type of <a href="../../../i/g/n/Ignoratio_elenchi.html" title="Ignoratio elenchi">Ignoratio elenchi</a>)</li>
<li>There is precendent for deleting such original research articles. See, for example <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Creation_anthropology_c68b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Arguments about whether the idea is <a href="../../../p/s/e/Pseudoscience.html" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, whether this is the "cutting edge", or whether the present <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientific_paradigm.html" title="Scientific paradigm">paradigms</a> are wrong should have no bearing on whether any article is in an encyclopedia or not. We're here to describe ideas that exist, not to judge them. Individuals' feelings about a particular subject are irrelevent. That's the essence of <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> as I see it.</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>As the author of the article, I feel I should respond to the New Rationale, corresponding to the numbered points above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>As far as I know, while I have included "normal" astrophysics, I have not included any crank science. Sure some consider Velikovsky a crank, but all the article mentions is that he believed electromagnetic forces were more significant in the universe, as did Birkeland, Juergens, and others.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Whether there is or isn't crank science included is beside the point. The problem is that the article is original research and a new conglomeration. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a></dd>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is that while there may be justification for the book to have a page, the "model", being something that doesn't exist except in the mind of the author, doesn't have any justification for a page. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>
<ol>
<li>The page is very much about plasma cosmology since it is the foundation of the Electric Universe model, in the same way that the Big Bang theory is "about" astronomy. Velikovsky never had an electric star theory, though Ralph Jeurgens did; it was based on the astrophysics of Hannes Alfvén, which makes it a directly related topic, as are all the others.</li>

</li>
</ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not a correct argument as pointed out by Joke on the plasma cosmology page, serious advocates of plasma cosmology do not have any relationship or hold to the ideas of Velikobsky and electric star proponents. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:27, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The article does not attack mainstream science, in the same way that the Big Bang theory page does not "attack" religous, or non-standard cosmological points of view. Indeed, the article criiticises no-one, and no other theories.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I am the author of this article. I have added the Controversial boilerplate to the Discussion page. I would suggest that although the article may be considered controversial, and you may not agree with its position, this does not necessarily make it pseudoscience. Please check the article for its interest, and whether it is well constructed, and presents a good case. Arguably, all new ideas can be considered pseudoscience until they are more fully evaluated and peer reviewed.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> A few centuries ago, most of the statements of today's science, as well as their authors' heads, would have been granted a Strong Delete, for the simple reason that they attempted to understand questions unanswered by the paradigm of those times. There are questions - many questions - which today's science cannot answer, and it is reasonable to assume that some of the reasons lie in the paradigms which underlie it. The concept of an electric universe, which I have looked into for quite a while, is a truly scientific theory in that it asks the kind of questions that other scientific views (those views which happen to dominate the trends of our century) are paradigmatically blind to. I see Wikipedia as the true Encyclopedia (Diderot's, that is) of our time; "mutatis mutandis", I do not think that it is Wikipedia's role in history to inflict on Ian Tresman what was inflicted on Galileo -- 83.94.159.146 9 July 2005 14:47 (UTC)

It's not that he said "the Earth goes around the Sun", it's that he said "the Earth goes around the Sun, and the Pope (who is paying for all this) is an idiot". Galileo's problem wasn't that he was right, it was that he was an asshole. Even more important, though, he <i>was</i> right.

The 1994 apology from <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Paul_II_18b2.html" title="John Paul II">John Paul II</a> was not merely an admission of the scientific truth of Galileo's work, but also a recognition that his prosecution was unjust under <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canon_law.html" title="Canon law">canon law</a> of the time. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 06:31, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As an example, one can find more articles relating to Electric Universe topics in the journals of plasma physics, than in the journals of cosmoslogy or astrophysics, where one would assume they would be extremely relevant. I believe this is due to the fact that there are some very powerful scientists with a vested interest in protecting the theories which they themselves have contributed to building up. And these people are exactly those who typically form a peer review board. People like <a href="http://www.hydro.com/en/about/history/1900_1917/1910.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hydro.com/en/about/history/1900_1917/1910.html" rel="nofollow">Kristian Birkeland</a> and <a href="http://www.haltonarp.com" class="external text" title="http://www.haltonarp.com" rel="nofollow">Halton Arp</a> are often viewed as heretics by cosmologists that perhaps find electrical forces an unwelcome element in their elegant equations.</dd>

<dd>Scientists <i>will</i>, and <i>do</i>, admit that their entire theoretical framework has been based on a flawed premise <i><b>if you show them a good reason</b></i>. There's a story about an old scientist attending a conference, listening to a speaker, and then approaching the man afterwards and saying "Thank you! I have been wrong these past twenty years!" To quote Carl Sagan, "In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know, that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion." Give us a <b>good</b> reason to accept the Electric Universe model, and <i>then</i> we'll see. Also, "very powerful scientists"? What planet are you living on? And <i>"heretics"</i>? Do you think people are going to get burned at the stake for this?

<dd>I trust people can still remember the response Alfred Wegener received from the eminent Lord Kelvin and Sir Harold Jeffreys regarding <a href="http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/mill_6.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.phy6.org/earthmag/mill_6.htm" rel="nofollow">Wegener's hypothese</a> of continental drift. Wegener perhaps hadn't been able to postulate a workable mechanism, but the experts of the time were more than happy, often through vehement ridicule of Wegner, to throw the baby (idea of continental drift) out with the bathwater (lack of a workable mechanism) instead of taking the time to consider the matter with any seriousness, delaying the paradigm shift until Vine and Matthews landmark 1963 paper unleashed the floodgates.</dd>

<dd>And you know what? Although mocking him may have been cruel, as long as Wegener had no idea of how <a href="../../../c/o/n/Continental_drift.html" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> could work, rejecting it was <i>right</i>. The mere fact that the maps fit together nicely <i>wasn't enough</i>. He later turned out to be correct, a mechanism was suggested for how it could happen, various other consequences were predicted which were tested and proven right, and once <i>those'</i> things were done, Wegner was vindicated. And remember - just because Wegner was mocked, and later turned out to be right, <i><b>that doesn't mean that other people who are mocked will turn out to be right also</b></i>. 17:47, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

(b) Wikipedia Articles are not peer reviewed submissions, they do not even present a case. They are merely an overview of the subject, including how viewpoints may have <i>rightly</i> or <i>wrongly</i> come about. (c) That people have considered an Electric Universe (in various forms) is clear from the historic references provided, from Birkeland onwards. Again it does not matter whether any of these people were right or wrong. What is important, is to provide an accurate record of the whos and whys. (d) The Electric Universe is distinct from Plasma Cosmology in that it (i) pre-dates it (ii) suggests more radical proposals, eg. electric stars, (iii) Has interdisciplinary connections with ancient history and other sciences.

<dd>The above comment says it all for the rationale as to why this article should be deleted. "That people have considered the Electric Universe" doesn't make sense as an argument. People "consider" a lot of things. and it isn't suprising that they consider electricity and the universe together. That does not mean that there is such a thing as the "Electric Universe model". See, for example, the <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Creation_anthropology_c68b.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Creation anthropology">VfD on creation anthropology</a>. This article was deleted because the author developed it as an amalgamation project from a number of different people who "considered" creationism and anthropology. The same standard should be applied here. This is an article that was developed as a clearinghouse of a whole slew of ideas that relate "electricity" and the universe. Many are unrelated to each other. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 15:41, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Judging from comments here I should probably begin by saying I am a "total newcomer" - I'm also an undergraduate physics student, so my grasp of these fields is not large. However, I think that this artice should stay on Wikipedia for a number of reasons.
<ul>
<li>Firstly, even though this stuff does not have the necessary recognition to avoid the "original research" flag, I feel that both the age of the theory, and the considerable body of seemingly scientific research that relates to it, should preclude it from this rule. The "Electric Universe" model represents a collection of ideas being developed by a number of people from different backgrounds over many years. I feel that the spread of the work saves it from being original research in the sense that is intended by Wikipedia's reviewing policies.</li>
<li>Secondly, although the "model" may be pseudo-scientific in it's overall structure it seems to contain in it much that is scientific, and I would tend to agree that its "pseudo-" stems from its "proto-".</li>
<li>As to positive reasons to keep it:
<ul>
<li>The electric universe ideas represent a compelling counter voice in an area of science where the accepted theory stands largely alone. To add to this, the area of science is one which is significantly unfalsifiable. This combination is a very unhealthy position for a science to be in, and we should welcome opposing ideas simply for the sake of scientific integrity. In this vein, electric universe is a good candidate simply because it is so different from the accepted model - even if it turns out to be complete nonsense, it's nonsensical richness may inspire newer better theories. Someone should remember dissident voices such as these, and I think Wikipedia should be that someone.</li>
<li>The model is also compelling because it <b>does</b> exhibit worthwhile traits: it focuses on the problems of the accepted theories, and also seeks balance and revision - the Newtonian hegemony in cosmology should make us uncomfortable. A cosmos governed by mechanics alone does seem primitive; simplity is not always a good thing but may indicate that we have ignored to much detail.</li>
<li>Finally, there is a quiet revolution going on in physics which I feel may disturb the very foundations of many theories. As we come to understand non-equilibrium dynamics more and more, and we begin to acept that large effects can have small causes I think we may find that we have been looking at many problems in entirely the wrong way. Our current ideas have as their ancestors two body problems, analytical systems. But the universe is vast and contains innumerable components, to look only on the small scale and fail to appreciate the entirety of the system could be disastrous - what I like most about the electric model is it tries to engage the universe wholistically, rather than by reductionism, and is itself based in a non-equilibrium science (electric plasmas).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not saying keep it because I like it. I'm saying keep it because it represents <b>worthwhile</b> counter-voice to an entrenched and often conservative orthodoxy.-Hayimd 18:16, 11 July 2005 (UTC) &lt;-- user's first edit is this VfD.</li>

<dd>The article makes it seem as though the theory is old simply because it refers to well-respected scientists who happened to do research in plasma physics. Birkeland, Spitzer and Langmuir did not advocate for an "electric universe" in the sense implied in the article, notwithstanding a quote where Birkeland muses about the possibility of electrical stars. The current theory of stellar fusion is more a part of their legacy.</dd>
<dd>I would vote to keep the article if it were to be an article about a historically interesting, discredited and disowned theory of Velikovsky. As it is, it is more of a catalog of electromagnetic phenomena in the universe, many of which are widely agreed on by mainstream physicists, and no description, except in the introduction, of how the electric universe "theory" differs from mainstream physics. I think that is because there is no theory, other than the primitive one advocated by Velikovsky and his acolytes. The rest is mainstream physics or <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> is at least a genuine alternative cosmology, albeit one that is not generally seen as coherent or well-supported. –<a href="../../../j/o/k/User%7EJoke137_8677.html" title="User:Joke137">Joke137</a> 19:00, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

The "Electric Universe" is advocated by a large number of nonscientists and there are a number of scientists listed in the article itself which do not actually believe that Velikovsky is worth anything (see <a href="../../../p/l/a/Plasma_cosmology.html" title="Plasma cosmology">plasma cosmology</a> for example). Where there is new information, it can be included in other articles. If I recall correctly there was a book entitled "The Electric Universe". We should make a page about that book but this page that is trying to be a clearinghouse needs to be deleted because, frankly, there is <b>no such thing</b> as an "electric universe model".

<dd>I have dealt quite a bit with people who advocate various ends of plasma cosmology in my work with cosmology. There are a few in the fringes of this group who are so far out there that anything that sounds like plasma cosmology gets included in the Electric Universe including legitimate research and fanciful meanderings of Velikovsky. As I have said, the Electric Universe itself is a book and one that basically follows the same line as this page (that is to attack mainstream cosmology), but this is not an "Electric Universe model" by any strech of the imagination -- it's only a book. Nevertheless, there are those people who follow this line of pseudoscience rather closely and do have the deliberate intention of attacking physical cosmology for whatever reason (mostly because they hate the Big Bang model). The content of the article speaks to this motivation as it states very radical conclusions from some very mundane observations and some very strung-out descriptors of Velikovsky, etc. to tie the whole thing together. The article is written from the perspective of a person from this internet community of "Big Bang skeptics" who likes to think that if they can attack from as many "points of view" as possible, it will lend credence to their ideas. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaschroeder_9392.html" title="User:Joshuaschroeder">Joshuaschroeder</a> 21:12, 19 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>After several recounts I think we can acertain about 5 merge votes, 5 non-puppet keeps, and 39 deletes.

<li>That is nice, but you should add something meaningful to the discussion particularly as it relates to how encyclopedic the article is as this is potentially weighed most heavily around here in determining the outcome rather than just the raw count of Keep or Delete, as votes are not necessarily treated as numerical.

<li>Your forum misunderstands the procedures of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../v/f/d/WP%7EVFD_b820.html" title="WP:VFD">This page</a> makes clear that admins can and will discount votes of brand new users . This is uniformly done in such clear cases of new users coming along <i>specifically</i> to support/oppose a particular page. Even if your keep votes overwhelm the delete votes, it will still go if you are all brand new, or fairly new users (or anon IP addresses) with such a clear agenda. You would do better to spend your time establishing the notability of your forum in the article in legitimate ways. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a> 9 July 2005 15:46 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and Redirect to Mushroom Kingdom</b> - This looks like vanity/self-promotion/spam. <i>11,100,000</i> internet references to IMDB, V.S. <i>5,750</i> to this site in google. It does not appear that, and I do not believe that the <i>Mushroom Kingdom</i> is anywhere near the level of notability or utility of IMDB, which is a large project of broad scope and broad recognition, and I believe that the article overstates the importance of the site: even if it were true in a limited scope, the comparison hurts the article, because the web site. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Mario.html" title="Mario">Mario</a> is notable and encyclopedic, but in general, there may be many fansites, but they are not notable, and I have visited many Mario-related websites and sites which document or list Mario games in the past, but never this one. The Mario equivalent to IMDB is just IGN, Gamespot, et al, note that <b>those</b> are considered notable enough sites and do have articles. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 15:33 (UTC)

<li>The article makes this specific claim "Recently, it was the crown feature among the multitudes of booths in E3 and G4." It seems doubtful, I have checked E3's list of exhibitioners and been unable to find any listing for TMK, is there somewhere else that should be checked before concluding that this claim is probably not so? --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 16:27 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Fansites have a <i>very</i> high bar to clear to be encyclopedic. Give them an external link on the Mario Brothers page, but no article.

<li>By the way, <i>The Mushroom Kingdom</i> already has external links from several of the Mario-related articles on Wikipedia, and I agree, that is fine, TMK has content that merits linking from those articles, even if the site is not noted widely enough to merit a separate article on it. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 03:57, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for that endorsement. To all TMK members: You heard that ringing endorsement, so it's a giant free for all. If it's Mario related, add our site to it. Remember, try to get every article that is remotely related Mario linking to our site. We want all this site's Mario-related articles linking to our site. The deadline for the second lottery will even be extended for two months to make sure we get every Mario related article linked to our site. Tigerz 04:45, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. You guys know that the lottery prize will only be awarded if the article survives, right? I don't think this "discounting" stuff is just a scare tactic, what if they actually discount votes? Well, at least I'll try to make an effort to save this article. To reiterate some of the arguments in keeping our article - we are notable and not "vanity". Our website is the first site to be listed on Google when you search for "Mushroom Kingdom". That should be good enough because security is important to Google, not even the atom bomb can skew its results. Any site that shows up as the first listing on Google deserves an article on your Wikipedia. Also, we have very unique content that other sites don't have. For example, compare our cartoon episode guide with the one found on TVTome. When you compare the two, you will definitely see that we are the superior guide. I bet my total manhood that nobody that can counter these points. There, that should get me at least ten extra entries into the lottery, pretty please. Tigerz 23:24, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>To TMK users welcome to Wikipedia. From looking over the site it looks frequently updated and visited by a regular crowd. Your site may be of significant value for those looking for information related to the topic, but Wikipedia has a threshold of inclusion that is not yet satisfied. Real world or virtual, no matter what, Wikipedia seeks entries on topics that are verifiable (i.e. Externally commented upon). We maintain this standard to help preserve the integrity of information. If the article is made of original research then only insiders will be able to work on it. At its foundation, Wikipedia fuctions by the ability of visitors to verify and challenge the info published. I hope you understand why we editors seek to remove this entry.</p>

<dd>Hi, the entry asserts only basic claims, and the Google evidence convincingly verifies the site's coverage as comprehensive, however, there is no mechanism by which Wikipedia can approve of only limited development of an entry. If editors agree to keep this entry, then like all other entries, there is the expectation it should eventually be expanded out of stub status, which will undoubtedly spill insider knowledge into the article. Against the Wikipedia inclusion standard this is a largely unverifiable subject matter.</dd>
<dd>And - This is just an online encyclopedia - there's no great value in being an article and there's no need to equate removal as an insult to your site's pride.</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. What can I say that hasn't already been said with more eloquence? Well, let's try this...: You're #1 on Google? OK then, let's do a test. Mushroom Kingdom&#160;: 670,000 Googles. <a href="../../../g/o/l/Golden_Axe_7fd0.html" title="Golden Axe">Golden Axe</a>&#160;: 751,000 Googles. Now according to those stats <i>alone</i> (alone, mind), that would make "Death Adder's Castle" the "more popular" site than yours because it beats back a greater number of other hits to become the #1. But does that mean it's deserving of an article here? Of course not! And another test, let's try Mario. Are you on the first search page? Nope! Try Zelda. Is there a fansite on the first page? Yep, Zelda Universe. Does that mean they deserve an article here? NO! Now look, I'm sure your fansite is awesome, and complete, and detailed, and the bees-knees of Mario... but Wikipedia is an encyclopedia of knowledge, not a directory of cool. And as for this tactic of offering adminship to encourage flood voting, I am shocked. You are completely perverting the purpose of our Vfd system, that is that unbiased people vote based on their will to make Wikipedia a better place and uphold our high standards, not provide votes that basically boil down to "OMG dey gonna delet my favrite site ONO!!!11!!

My friend <a href="../../../e/c/l/User%7EEclipsed_Moon_d109.html" title="User:Eclipsed Moon">User:Eclipsed Moon</a> added some already and are still present in some of the articles. Or does each link need to be a different account? I do see why it needs to be a different account, but can she get some "bonus" in the lottery because some of the links are still there. Or does she need to start over? Anyways, if not, at least this second lottery is much better than the first one. Whoever came up with the first lottery needs to be silenced for a week.&#160;:P Sandy M 03:08, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm the owner of The Mushroom Kingdom website, IRC channel, and message boards. I did not endorse this article about my site, so I must vote in favor of deletion. Talk of "spamming links" in order to "become a mod" is nonsense, because only TMK staff get operator status in the chatroom. In addition, I do not recognize any users posting on this VFD except for Phred and Vid. It appears to me that some people who don't like our website are causing a ruckus, hoping to get every link to our website removed from Wikipedia.

<li>Seriously, I put every damned link up, a while before this page was an issue. It's no more spam than IMDB; I'm just putting up relative page links up. People don't do it, <b>I</b> do it. I know nothing about Deezer, other than the fact that he's working on Paper Mario TTYD Mariopedia information. I've no reason to spam, because I'm not even a member. I'm being bold (I believe that's a Wikipedia guideline), and adding them because I feel them relevant to the page. I don't wanna be a mod on TMK; I'm not even that big of a Mario fan.

<p>Same reasons as all the other lists I've nominated, but this one is even worse in that it makes arbitrary exceptions and makes up an arbitrary definition for "music."

<li><b>Delete</b> - unmaintainable, essentially POV. And if you want to begin an argument of what kind of chords are music or not, prepare for a humongous edit war (though not from me). Rap is superficially speaking against the background of music. There is singing outside the pop and rock. Not to mention the fact that there is modern music that is far from melodic, composed of everyday objects banking each other (ie. sound effects), composed of words from nonexistent languages or are complete silence - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 12:22, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>If this is somehow unencyclopedic, then what about List of songs featuring slap-bass? Or List of songs with scat-singing? Shouldn't we be putting them up for deletion too? Badly written definition or not, I think most people understand, especially after reading the song list, what this list is about, and indeed it has continued to be added to despite the VfD notice.<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 06:08, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I understand, the first would be something made with a musical instrument and the second should be List of scat songs or equivalent. And VFD notice does not stop editing. What I was trying to say that any part of music is music, regardless of its form, and categorizing "songs with non-music" is superfluous. Article about, say, music that includes <i>certain kind of effect</i> (say, <a href="../../../r/e/v/Reverb.html" title="Reverb">reverb</a>), included in the article about that effect (not as a separate list) would be better option - <a href="../../../s/k/y/User%7ESkysmith_c555.html" title="User:Skysmith">Skysmith</a> 09:20, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. The statements aren't based on objective information since the political views are different, also the user Samrolken is degrading the members of the group and predisposing other voters by saying non verified information. <small><i>- Vote by User:Guille1719, user's first edit.</i></small></li>
<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. It seems that this site is a recognised anarchy group and is a firm part of larger organisations within the indymedia group, it is worthy of an entry even if the political views are not necessarily shared by some editors, myself included. <small><i>- Vote by User:81.174.132.207, user's first edit.</i></small></li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b>. From the evidence of the research I have done myself through querying friends of "those sort" it appears they have been heard of and have been active for many years in the "underground," many groups have lost members to this certain "organization" apparently. According to some programmers I know, the actual site is for "recruitement," as some sort of analysing thing or something. They've past ties with IndyMedia, as that guy said above... noteworthy. On a last point, from what i have seen on their website. I cannot find many problems with their spelling and Grammar as Samrolken has suggested. Although i can notice straight he has problems spelling. For one he spelt recognised as "Regognized" and organisation as "Organization". <small><i>- Vote by <a href="../../../6/2/2E/User%7E62.255.64.6.html" title="User:62.255.64.6">User:62.255.64.6</a>.</i></small></li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Admittedly the page does need to be cleaned up, however, one cannot deny that the organisation itself exists, can one? I refer one to the dictionary definition of; organisation (www.dictionary.com). a&#160;: the act or process of organizing or of being organized b&#160;: the condition of being organized. It does seem that a group of persons have come together through shared political views, therefore they have organised to become the afore mentioned organisation. Tupence added. Eris</li>

<dd>At first the article was titled <i>nose hook</i>. It was on nose hooks and had also some information on mouth hooks and the general term <i>face hook</i>. When I added the rest it seemed that separate articles for all of them would have made the articles very short. They also seemed to be easier to explain as a whole.

<li><b>Cleanup</b>. It's entirely valid, and i'm sure there's a history for the term going back a decade or two; which is enough to put it in the OED, at least.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Planned events can be written about - and even if it is abandoned we still would want to explain why.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are a few very basic problems with that argument:
<ul>
<li>If it were cancelled and we explained why, that would be after the fact. This is not.</li>
<li>The existence of other dubious articles should have no effect on the VfD of this one.
<ul>
<li>If your article were titled <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">Preparations for the 2012 Summer Olympics</a> there would be no problem with that one. That is actually what it is about, after all!</li>
<li>Changing the title of <i>this</i> article to <a href="../../../a/s/i/Asian_Cup_2007_5658.html" title="Asian Cup 2007">Preparations for the Asian Cup 2007</a> would not unfortunately avoid the problem. Is there currently construction of new stadiums happening? Are governments pushing through legislation to get ready for the Asia Cup?</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am voting mostly to insure that some other admin gets to sort this vote out. Beyond that, the text of the New Testament contains too much information and has developed too much scholarly analysis over the centuries to be reasonably contained in articles broken at the book or even chapter level. As the traditional division by verse is the de-facto standard for subdividing bible text below the chapter level, it seems like the most reasonable way to organize Wikipedia's articles on this very important religious, literary, and historical work. --<i><a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllen3_f7ae.html" title="User:Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#160;<sup><a href="../../../a/l/l/User_talk%7EAllen3_35fb.html" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a></sup> July 9, 2005 17:37 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge, Transwiki, or Delete</b> (and I'd prefer one of the second two--no, I have not carefully evaluated each particular element of the proposal). Every time 'what's encyclopedic' gets expanded (most recently elementary schools) recent changes and newpages patrol gets even more overtaxed. I'm finding much more weeks- or even months-old vandalism and crap edits than I did a year ago. I firmly believe this inclusionism is a serious threat to the integrity of Wikipedia. If everyone voting "keep" commits to spending at least an additional 10 hours per week on recent changes patrol, I'll consider changing my vote. Also, what JIP, Wetman, Aaron Brenneman, Ril, Dcarrano, and Scimitar said. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 9 July 2005 17:43 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> them all; there has been an enormous amount of commentary on individual Bible verses in the last two thousand years, much of it of encyclopedic value, and I think it's best organized at the verse level.

<li><b>Keep</b> - this is too many changes to reasonably evaluate all at once, each merge/deletion needs to be considered on its own merits, and I think many of these verses are notable enough that they should have be organized as separate articles. --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 9 July 2005 18:09 (UTC)</li>

<li>Merge, but let's slow down. Our naming conventions require that articles be at their most common names, and most of the episodes in the life of Christ have standard names.

<li>"Jesus' Escape to Egypt" = "The flight of the Holy Family"</li>
<li>"The Baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist" = "The commission" and "Baptism of Christ"</li>

<li>"The Ressurrection of Jesus" = "The Resurrection" (capital letter because it is a pronominal event)</li>

<li>Hmm. Those are not precisely the "common names" that I would have chosen. I don't have any of my books with me at the moment to look them up, but I suspect that we'll find that there are some differences in common usage in different Christian traditions (for example, those that don't use KJV). If we end up going with names like this, we'll probably want to find some source that can be agreed to be reasonably authoritative and go with that for consistency. -<a href="../../../a/r/a/User%7EAranel_6303.html" title="User:Aranel">Aranel</a> ("<font color="#BA0000"><u>Sarah</u></font>") 21:53, 9 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The Bible is the single most important document in the history of western civilization. There has been more commentary on the Bible that any other work.

I can, upon request, provide bibliographic information on commentary of every book of the bible from every century since the 3rd century and from every country in the west. Of no other dococument can such a claim be made.)

<li><b>Strong keep</b> after looking at a few of these articles, it seems that there is enough to say that's encylopedic about many individual Bible verses.

<li><b>Merge</b>. This would make a great commentary (I'm not sure that it's at all encyclopedic, but whatever). Even most print commentaries will have more than one verse per section. It makes more sense to discuss a passage as a whole (or even a significant portion of a passage) than to isolate individual verses, anyway. You can then say things that are more interesting and relevant.

<dd>I am not a sockpuppet (and had to look up what the accusation meant). I just joined as a member, although I have been doing minor edits anonymously for a while. I found these verses on a random article link, voted on a previous VfD on this topic (my first vote), and was sent a message asking me to vote on this VfD. (I don't know how to send a message to another User, hence this edit back to <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">User:-Ril-</a>). I am not opposed to merging in some other manner (say by blocks of like verses in a given book) or transwikiing them to an annotated Bible, I just think Uncle G's suggestion is too crude an instrument for merging these as they currently stand. If there were a Geneaolgy of Jesus article established, for example, I can see a later vote to split it in two, into a Matthew version and a Luke version. <a href="../../../r/u/h/User%7ERuhrfisch_d1a4.html" title="User:Ruhrfisch">Ruhrfisch</a> 17:21, July 12, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I am aware that I sent you a message to vote, but I did that to everyone else as well whose vote may have indicated that they supported Uncle G's proposal, of which only part covered the previous VfD, and thus they had to vote again, here, for it to cover all of his proposal,, and I wasn't paying careful attention to sockpuppetry at the time.

<dd>Basically, I asked everyone to vote here who had voted a certain way on the other VfD simply because their vote appeared to be for a suggestion (Uncle G's) that actually covered more than just that VfD, so if they wished their indicated wishes at that VFD to be carried out in full, it would be necessary for them to vote here as well. I.e. everyone whose vote was technically, or appeared to be, for a wider vfd than existed at that point, but was covered by this vfd. This included Ruhrfisch. Since issues touching on ideology like this one are intrinsically liable to attract sockpuppet votes by people of that ideology, I have been checking out votes that could be such sockpuppets, discovering Ruhrfisch to be amongst them. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 19:24, 14 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

For consistency, I also would merge or delete or Transwiki all individual TV show epidodes, individual characters in video games, individual characters in LOTR, individual chapters in any other book, individual anything that isn't an important individual. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 22:53, July 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am not sure that accurately represents my view: I think it is very hard to determine <i>a priori</i> which Bible verses merit articles. For example, a seemingly trivial verse might merit an article on the basis of controversy over its translation, or Kabbalistic significance, or for being the sole occurrence of particular Hebrew or Greek words in the Bible, or for alluding to a person or event for which we have non-biblical evidence. I personally am not interested in looking at the list of individual verses listed above to see if any of them merit inclusion. I think we need to form a policy on this, and I think VfD is a blunt instrument with which to do so. With respect to such a policy: I doubt that every verse of the Bible merits an article (though probably every chapter does); I think there would be a range of sane policy here. Certainly, though, not every verse deserves a standalone article: at most, some should be redirects to larger, more useful articles. I think that making them redirects has the merit of making less likely the re-creation of trivial articles in the future. As a vote, any <b>keep</b> or <b>merge with redirect</b> will satisfy me. I am opposed to deletion of the <i>material</i>, open to its consolidation, and—in the event of such consolidation—weakly inclined to support the retention of the existing titles as redirects. If this is too complicated to count as a vote in this VfD, so be it. As I said, I think we need to form a policy on this, and I think VfD is a blunt instrument with which to do so. -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmabel_8e8d.html" title="User:Jmabel">Jmabel</a> | <a href="../../../j/m/a/User_talk%7EJmabel_f2c3.html" title="User talk:Jmabel">Talk</a> 16:59, July 18, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>(I second the above objection). This proposal is also too crude. I agree that <i>All Individual Bible verses are <b>not</b> automatically noteworthy enough to have seperate articles</i>. But some are - and I might argue some of these are. I also think that some of these verses should be merged into articles on the passage or chapter they concern rather into Ungle G's suggestions. This proposal is too detailed for a yes/no vote. Unfortunately I can't see any way round considering each verse (or group of verses) individually on their merits. So, although, I'm broadly in favour of merging - I will oppose this --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">(?)</a> 9 July 2005 15:54 (UTC)</p>

<li>I've changed my vote from the weak-kneed <i><b>Merge</b></i> I gave them before to the <i><b>Delete</b></i> I reckon they actually deserve. If a particular verse has encyclopedic merit, write a nice fat article about <b>that verse</b>. Lists are bad for Wikipedia. Have a look at <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Nokia_1100_170f.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nokia 1100">this</a> to see the kind of vacuous content lists eventually get filled with. Strike them all out. I'm trying to avoid wikistress over this, but barely succeeding. Try and imagine that this was a list of (for example) Buddhist scriptures. A very long and detailed list, with each paragraph having its own article.

<li>I take it that all those voting merge have considered each of the specific merge proposals before them and agree that in each and every instance this is the most appropriate merge??

<li>Some of these deserve merging; no question. Some of them don't, so I oppose the proposal as a whole. Each scripture article should stand or fall on its own merits, and although scriptures aren't automatically notable, some have had an impact <b>as a single verse</b> that implies that they are. If an encyclopedic articles can be written about a verse, it should be. For instance, much theory about the trinity rests on <a href="../../../1/_/_/John_1%7E1.html" title="John 1:1">John 1:1</a> (though I notice it doesn't have an article). Obviously, though, some of these need to be merged. --<a href="../../../s/c/i/User%7EScimitar_bbe8.html" title="User:Scimitar">Scimitar</a> 9 July 2005 16:48 (UTC)</li>

This is so clearly an annotation project! What it's going to do is reproduce the text, and discuss various interpretations of it. That's exactly what an annotation project is, and there is a section of Wikibooks called <i>THE ANNOTATED NEW TESTAMENT</i> that no one is using!! I really don't get it. Another big issue is that, although <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">UncleG</a> has done a good job of dividing the first couple of books of Matthew into subject headings... is he, or anyone else, prepared to do that work for <i>every book in the Bible</i>??

<dd>This is a tough call. Certainly Wikibooks would do well to have an annotation project, especially since their current "The New Testament" is up for speedy deletion. However, I'm not sure that I see how or why that would preclude WP having an entry for the verses which have been influential (just to pick a random example, let's say <a href="../../../1/_/_/Matthew_3%7E1.html" title="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3:1</a>, introduces <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_the_Baptist_0931.html" title="John the Baptist">John the Baptist</a>, and has some interestingly controvercial wording). WP might xfer to the Wikibooks articles as authoritative (if they were), but ultimately, I think the major verses need to have encyclopedic coverage. -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 9 July 2005 17:23 (UTC)

<dd>Point taken. After the transwikifying, I would then not object to Wikipedia-appropriate articles -- concentrating on the historical significance of those relatively few notable verses, rather than reproducing the text and giving religious interpretations of every verse -- being re-created over here.

<dd>SimonP, the major difference being that there is a huge body of factual information to be presented about biological entities.

</li>
<li><b>Comment and alternate proposal</b> Here's an alternate proposal. It's more work, but a) I'm willing to help and b) it would eliminate complaints over major VfDs like this
<ul>
<li>Categorize all verse pages into:
<ul>
<li>Notable verses that have encyclopedic information in their articles (define criteria up-front)</li>
<li>Non-notable verses that simply describe the language of the verse</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create category pages (as suggested by this proposal) for major events and storylines, referencing the notable verse articles where appropriate, but otherwise providing simple capsule synopses of the previous content.</li>
<li>Find all pages that reference non-notable verses and, where appropriate, move the reference to the category pages.</li>
<li>For all non-notable articles with no remaining references, put up individual VfDs, referencing the project article, which should describe the whole process, and the criteria for non-notable biblical verses.
<ul>
<li>The above VfDs may be too numerous. An alternate way to do this would be to group them into related verses and VfD 10 or so at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The end result would be roughly the same, but would leave notable articles like <a href="../../../1/_/_/Matthew_3%7E1.html" title="Matthew 3:1">Matthew 3:1</a> intact. My first-pass approximation of criteria for notability would be: a) there is substantial disagreement among scholars about the importance, wording or meaning of the particular verse b) the verse introduces an important person or place for the first time c) the verse involves a direct quotation from a major person or entity d) there is any sect which bases its differentiation on the verse e) the verse's text is commonly (or was historically) used outside of biblical context (e.g. "eye for an eye", "turn the other cheek", etc.) -<a href="../../../h/a/r/User%7EHarmil_7a19.html" title="User:Harmil">Harmil</a> 17:04, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Merge</b>. Should not have to discuss the merge on each individual verse article's talk page, that's part of the problem. It's not that the verses aren't noteworthy, but that in most cases they are better dealt with in groups of verses rather individually. Notice the huge amount of duplication among the John 20: verse articles for instance, because they're discussing the same passage. I do think that Ungle G's merge plan should be tweaked slightly; for instance, <i>Temptation of Jesus</i> could refer to the Matthew 4 temptation in the wilderness, or to the much later temptation of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane when Jesus was tempted not to accept crucifixion. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesley_19bf.html" title="User:Wesley">Wesley</a> 16:37, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The problem with the English wikipedia that others do not suffer is that there is a large systemic bias favouring the views of fundamentalist Christianity. This is merely because a large population of the English speaking world, and particularly of en-wikipedia is from the US, a very large % of which (compared to the remainder of the world) is composed of fundamentalist Christians. Since the other Wikipedias are mainly composed of people who do not edit the en-wikipedia, it is difficult to balance this systemic problem. The only real solution is to take questions like this to all wikipedias at once, and consider only the total vote over all of them (admittedly this has problems with duplicate accounts), however, there is not <b>yet</b> such a procedure for issues stemming from systemic bias predominantly affecting only one wikipedia. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 22:50, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>There is truth in what you say. Not that all supporters of "keep" on this VFD are American or evangelical or even Christian. But we are at a time, especially here in America, when a loud minority feel compelled to insert the Bible, prayer, and religious symbolism into absolutely everything. We can't have science without the Bible, we can't have politics without prayer, we can't have courthouses and public squares without the Ten Commandments. It's obvious that these articles are questionably encyclopedic and could be perfectly handled in Wikibooks or the previously mentioned annotation project, but some people won't rest until Wikipedia is thoroughly innoculated with every word of the Bible. Their Bible, that is. I'd like to see them fight as hard for all the holy books of every other important world religion, but I won't hold my breath. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavidH_d410.html" title="User:DavidH">DavidH</a> 02:09, July 15, 2005 (UTC)

<li>-Ril-, you haven't made a credible case for Christian fundamentalism in any way influencing the keep voters, and you misrepresent not only the voters who disagree with you but the whole issue by implying that fundamentalists would even like to keep these articles, which are based on works by scholars representing a historical-critical and philological interpretation.

<li>My reason for putting "systemic bias" in scare quotes is that I don't think any systemic bias exists that is relevant to this vote.</li>
<li>Systemic bias probably accounts for the lack of comparable articles on the Koran or other similar books. Commentaries on the Koran are less likely to be understood or read by English speakers, because they are not in the language and because fewer English speakers are Muslim. This is what I would describe as systemic bias, stemming from exogenous factors like the allocation of research by languages, etc. For the enwiki, creating articles on the Koran is simply harder. The Wikiproject, by advertising and finding qualified people, can help remedy this problem.</li>
<li>On the other hand, here we are trying to determine whether these articles are encyclopedic (or propertly organized). You are claiming that because many of us are Christians, we somehow cannot do this well. But there's no clear reason why this would be the case. Christians, like anyone else, are fully capable of rationally assessing an article and determining if it should be kept or deleted or merged.</li>

<dd>While the result is fairly clear, the result that is clear is that there is <b>no consensus</b>. I have added up the votes, and the amount of votes to keep the articles is slightly less than those to do something else with them. The difference is negligable, however, thus requiring the VFD to remain open to gain consensus. A result of no-consensus, would just cause the VFD to be re-opened immediately after closing, to determine consensus. It will be re-listed on VFD if it fails to achieve consensus in the next 4 days (as it will drop off the VFD backlog at that point). N.b. consensus is generally regarded as 2/3 majority, or at least a noticable (as opposed to by 1/2 votes out of 60) majority. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 06:58, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I'm going to go out on a limb and disagree with you. The vote is CLEARLY opposed to deletion, therefore the VfD should be closed. There is a great deal of support for transwikiing to a currently non-existent project, but that does <i>not</i> minimize the fact that there is a grand total of FOUR patently "delete" votes. I move that the nominator be assigned with the task of removing the VfD notifications, and that interested parties be invited to constructively commence formation of the widely supported biblewiki project. My guess is that most of those who voted in favor of transwikiing thereto lack the technical expertise to actually accomplish such a transwikiing (myself included), but that once the project were up and running, that the superfluous material would happily disappear from the WP project to its more appropriate home. Meanwhile, stalling in order to try to gain more and more votes is patently ridiculous. How long do y'all plan to leave this open? It's already going on 2 weeks. A month? 2 months? 3? 4? 18???! Close this already, and let's move on to constructively address the clear consensi: (a) do not delete and (b) start biblewiki (or whatever). <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 07:20, July 21, 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know if you noticed, but this VFD was primarily about merging the articles rather than deleting them. The vote is required to determine whether consensus is to keep the articles as individuals or to merge them together or move them somewhere else. What is being VFD'd is their individuality. I.e. I put their individuality up for deletion. Merge, transwiki, and delete votes are all agreeing that they should not be individual. There needs to be consensus as to whether they should exist seperately in wikipedia (rather than eslewhere - e.g. WikiBooks) or not. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 07:50, 21 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>N.b. The technical expertise required to transwiki is to add a {{move to WikiBooks}} tag to the article. Someone who is able to transwiki it will them perform the transwiki after a week or so. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 07:50, 21 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Nah...I noticed that it's more about merging that deleting...I still think the whole kit 'n caboodle should be transwikied—but it would be inappropriate to send it to wikibooks or wikisource. If someone knows how to make wikibible, I'll be more than happy to help remove the VfD tags on the articles. That said, I still think it's ridiculous that the VfD is <i><b>still</b></i> open. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 17:28, July 21, 2005 (UTC)

<li>This second count - "overlapping totals" - includes each part of such votes, i.e. they overlap. A "transwiki or keep" vote is here converted to a "transwiki" vote and a "keep" vote, etc. Note that, as mentioned, some people's votes are thus counted in two locations.</li>
<li>The value of this is simply to see which of those alternative votes is the favoured outcome. I.e. in the event of the merge/transwiki/keep/delete votes not having a clear consensus, which is favoured by these more ambiguous votes. From the above, it is clear that, after keep, it is merge, and the second favourite is transwiki. <a href="../../../-/r/i/User%7E-Ril-_5014.html" title="User:-Ril-">~~~~</a> 08:02, 22 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>The article describes a steering effect due to friction on hurricanes that I can't verify. <a href="../../../n/o/a/NOAA_ccf4.html" title="NOAA">NOAA</a> certainly hasn't put anything about it online. The Hurricane Dennis example is <i>completely</i> wrong as its track past Cuba was <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/at200504.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.wunderground.com/hurricane/at200504.asp" rel="nofollow">about as straight a line</a> as one ever sees with tropical systems.</p>
<p>A combination of original research and incorrect factual statements that can't be salvaged. Delete. -- <a href="../../../c/y/r/User%7ECyrius_3685.html" title="User:Cyrius">Cyrius</a>|<a href="../../../c/y/r/User_talk%7ECyrius_ef50.html" title="User talk:Cyrius">✎</a> 9 July 2005 16:33 (UTC)</p>

According to Wikipedia, this article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">does not even qualify for being up for a Deletion vote.</a> If one does not know the issue, they are (as the above Wikipedia link calls most of the voters here) voting on something which, <i>"involves a topic of which {they} are ignorant"</i>. As explained in the segment below, the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article is open to both sides of the debate for true NPOV. It frees up the neutral anthropological <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article from the repeatad <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> agenda and POV. Actually, it is the vast amounts of one-sided POV anti-polygamy arguments that get added to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article frequently which do not actually inform the user about <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a>, they are the edits which do not actually apply to the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> page, yet would more appropriately apply in a two-sided agenda/debate <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. Instead of this profoundly hasty call for voting for deletion from a visibly hostile POV, voters should be, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia explains,</a> <i>"If you can improve the article instead, do so."</i> Voters here have not even attempted that Wikipedia-directed option based on their own biased POV. There is no fair basis for calling or voting for this page to be deleted. Doing so is only biased POV. This <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article should be left alone, and any informed Wikipedians should follow Wikipedia's guidelines to simply build upon it instead of seeking to destroy it. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 14:30, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To my great frustaration, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is caught here lying yet again. What they have just said here is simply not true, and they know it. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is totally out to oppress as shown in this post they made on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19097386&amp;oldid=19092333" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19097386&amp;oldid=19092333" rel="nofollow">19:12, 18 July 2005</a> and I pointed out their extreme aggressiveness this very day in my subsequent post <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19099356&amp;oldid=19097386" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=19099356&amp;oldid=19097386" rel="nofollow">19:42, 18 July 2005</a>. Not only was <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> caught lying in those other posts, but they are clearly lying here too about their supposed concern for the oppression they are doing against me and their supposed desire for anything "fair." It is my hope that people will not further assist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis's</a> hostile anti-polygamy POV and agenda. The current dispute with that anti-polygamist should not be exploited to hastily delete the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. That article was offered as an NPOV solution to end the abuse and solve that other dispute. (See the other section here about that.) So deleting the article interferes with a possible resolution of that dispute. If the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article does get deleted because of such false exploitation, there will be nothing "fair" about that whatsoever. Despite their little game of suggesting an "extention" of the vote another week, and the admission of expecting no more votes to change the current vote-tally to "Kept," the revealed lie in the linked-posts also reveals how aggressive they plan to be to exploit that deletion in furthering their abuse. So, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> knows there is nothing really "fair" about deleting this article at all and that they have no desire to stop oppressing me or stop preventing all my obviously-valid edits. To say otherwise is clearly just another lie. It is my hope that the abuse will come to an end and that valid posts can once again be made to the polygamy and anti-polygamy articles in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 20:25, 18 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I appreciate your input. The article is a brand-new work-in-progress. Only one day after the article was originally created, hostile anti-polygamist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> made a post on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> TALK page there <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-polygamy&amp;diff=17965452&amp;oldid=17965399" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anti-polygamy&amp;diff=17965452&amp;oldid=17965399" rel="nofollow">hinting for someone to call for it to be deleted.</a> This call for deletion was way too quickly and suspiciously made. Regarding size of the article, it could very easily and quickly be filled up to a large article. If anti-polygamists would spend their time <i>building up</i> the anti-article instead of craftily trying to hide their agenda by trying to destroy it, they could quickly help it reach that size. Pro-polygamy responses would then further add to its size. (Plus, the current <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article so already too large. When you try to edit that whole <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, the red-font warning tells you it is alrady too large. So, the time really is now to make that separation to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResearcher99_f233.html" title="User:Researcher99">Researcher</a> 02:32, 20 July 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> himself called for the extension on the vote - do you think further extension would be a fair compromise? I would change my vote to "keep" if this were a bit more in-depth and fit in better alongside the main article, and from what you say, all that needs is time and effort. In the meantime, I don't think we have consensus to resolve the issue. <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplodicle_f7f9.html" title="User:Explodicle">Explodicle</a> 04:18, July 20, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I very much appreciate your input, <a href="../../../e/x/p/User%7EExplodicle_f7f9.html" title="User:Explodicle">Explodicle</a>. Actually, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is not being honest about that.

A couple months ago, I had had to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Polygamy/Archive_2#Sneaky_Vandals.27_Anti-Polygamy_Destruction_of_Polygamy_Wiki" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Polygamy/Archive_2#Sneaky_Vandals.27_Anti-Polygamy_Destruction_of_Polygamy_Wiki" rel="nofollow">"out"</a> <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> as the anti-polygamist they are. At that time, they were pretending to be "pro-polygamist" as they were committing sneaky vandalisms to actually destroy the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article. They also frequently make obfuscatory claims that are obviously untrue, as seen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;diff=18440736&amp;oldid=18409264" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Polygamy&amp;diff=18440736&amp;oldid=18409264" rel="nofollow">here</a> where they claimed that a clearly obvious NPOV statement is somehow POV. regarding enlargement, I would be glad to enlarge the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. But <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> aggressively removed the link to <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> from the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article a day after its creation, so no one else knows it exists in order to build it further. When I tried to restore the link, the rv'ed it again. Lately, <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> has been plotting daily with new ways to destroy the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, so much so and are not giving me a chance to even catch my breath. Lastly, there are some things on the currently too-large <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> atricle that could be moved to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. But considering that <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> rv's every edit I make, no matter what, I can only expect to see my edits to build up the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article rv'ed too. As shown at the top of this page here, the very call for this "Vote for Deletion" is, itself, highly suspect. That suspect person who created this call for VfD has not posted anything in Wikipedia since last year. All of a sudden they make this call for VfD and only this call? Very suspect. So, with all that, I do not really believe that any extension is all that much of a fair compromise. This suspect call is just another abuse being heaped toward me in a not-yet-resolved problem with <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis.</a> (I was actually trying to help resolve the problem by creating the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article in thefirst place.) I would certainly be glad to enlarge the article over time, with help from others who can find the article. But that will take time. I need <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> and their hostile anti-polygamy POV to be prevented from destroying every work I do and every single edit I make. They now aggressively act as if they "own" the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article and have created numerous problems indeed. That last issue is really the heart of the problem here. I am hoping to have it resolved so normal editing can resume. I also hope my response here has been helpful for you.

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Anti-polygamy_46e5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Anti-polygamy">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">For NPOV, the difference between neutral term vs. non-neutral POV agenda/debate MUST be Separated</span></h4>
<p>When I started the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, I did so with the full invitation for anti-polygamists to add their views there as well. That was the point, actually. So, I had only started the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, but fully expected others, including anti-polygamists, to bring their views there too. If anti-polygamists thought it was too POV there, they were welcome to <i>build upon</i> the article (not delete or destroy) and to simultaneously await any pro-polygamous response too. Instead, however, anti-polygamists who are afraid of their agenda being so exposed in such an open debate of their itemized presented arguments and tactics like that have responded by trying to hide and undermine that altogether. This very "vote for deletion" page is a pure example of that, anti-polygamists trying to prevent their agenda from being so exposed because they are not confident enough that their views and exposed tactics will be able to "win" their debate. Instead, they want to hide behind the seeming "authoritativeness" of directly infesting the neutral anthropological <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article with their POV and mis-information.</p>
<p>It is, of course, fully expected that anti-polygamists would oppress a minority by wanting to prevent Wikipedia readers from learning about the tactics and debate about anti-polygamy. Like I just said, they want the "freedom" to misrepresent polygamy as if authoritative rather than have their debates exposed for what they are.</p>
<p>Again, it must be understood that <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> is a neutral term but anti-polygamists continue to infest the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> article with their POV. <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> has repeatedly been outed as a hostile anti-polygamist on the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> TALK pages. (Anti-polygamists have further tried to hide those "outings" by "archiving" all the evidence about the "outings." As well, an ANON editor deliberately tried to hide the evidence I had recently presented about what anti-polygamists did to my original version of the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=18468386&amp;oldid=18442033" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Polygamy&amp;diff=18468386&amp;oldid=18442033" rel="nofollow">removing the specific segment of evidence from the TALK altogether!</a>]) Therefore the outed anti-polygamist <a href="../../../n/e/r/User%7ENereocystis_fdac.html" title="User:Nereocystis">Nereocystis</a> is here attempting to appeal to a hostile anti-polygamy POV majority in order to prevent the real issues from being exposed.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">Anti-polygamy</a> is obviously a non-neutral agenda. To obtain true NPOV in Wikipedia, <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> should not be infested with the obvious POV of anti-polygamists as has been happening.</p>
<p>Instead, for true NPOV throughout the issue, anti-polygamists can have a place at the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article to itemize their agenda points and views by putting them in the more appropriate <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article. Then pro-polygamists can also list their refutations of those items. That way, both articles are truly NPOV.</p>
<p>In that way, the neutral anthropoligical <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article can teach Wikipedia readers what polygamy <i>really</i> is about without the distraction of the agenda of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> POV. If the Wikipedia readers want to also see the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> view and debate, then they can go to the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article and get that information too. (When I created the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, I created an immediate explanation and link to it on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article.) Wikipredia readers should not be distracted with the agenda of the anti-polygamy POV and propaganda, unless they seek it directly.</p>
<p>What I have created with all this also allows true NPOV on the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article too. As already explained, anti-polygamists can place their reasons for their agenda and pro-polygamists can respond. Balance, NPOV. In the same way, pro-polygamists can point out the tactics of anti-polygamists and anti-polygamists can respond. True NPOV.</p>
<p><a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> is the neutral anthropological term. <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">Anti-polygamy</a> is the non-neutral agenda and debate. True NPOV accross the board.</p>
<p>In addition to the NPOV issue, the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article itself is already too long. Whenever one makes an edit to the full <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, they get the red-font "too long" message. The reason that the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article is too long is because it is too infested with <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> agenda. So, by moving the agenda and debate to its own <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, the length can be kept within Guidelines.</p>
<p>Lastly, the POV of those wanting to delete or prevent this solution is easily observable as hostile anti-polygamy POV itself. To refuse to allow the <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a> article, as the needed solution to the anti-polygamists destroying the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> article, is the same thing as a KKK majority refusing fairness and NPOV to African Americans on a Wikipedia article about African Americans. It is the same thing as contining to allow KKK editors to imply all the worst ideas against African Americans as if authoritative rather than allow their POV agenda and debate be openly exposed for review of all Wikipedia readers.</p>
<p>So, for true NPOV, article-length, and true fairness to an oppressed minority, a legitimate encyclopedia <b>must</b> separate the neutral anthropological term of <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polygamy.html" title="Polygamy">polygamy</a> from the non-neutral agenda and debate of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-polygamy.html" title="Anti-polygamy">anti-polygamy</a>. Anything less than that is bigoted POV and has no place in a legitimate Wikipedia.</p>

<li>It is defensible in that it has a meaning beyond its original one. It is an idiom, or a figure of speech, as well as a gambling term. Also, it would be good to have a list of gambling terms of a glossary associated with that article, as many of them are not in most standard dictionaries. (Such as list would be as least as perteinent as "List of professional wrestling terms".) A good projectro someone IMO.207.69.51.151 23:35, 2 Jul 2004 (UTC)User:Rlquall\Rlquall</li>

<li><i>Comment:</i> You can check my contributions list if you want to know what I've done. Incidentaly, Googling "gwalla" gets about 265 hits, but it hardly matters because there is no wikipedia article about me, and I have never claimed to merit one. My nomination has nothing to do with how well the article is written, but whether the <i>subject</i> merits an article. The paucity of google hits (particularly for something that is entirely Internet-based) and complete lack of Alexa data suggests that any following it has is not large. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 01:19, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment:</i> Well, more people will know about it and create a larger following if they know about it. And this is definitly the place for them to find out about it. Have you even read it Gwalla? I wouldn't have created an article on it if I didn't feel it deserved an article. I even put this up to a vote: I only went with what the people wanted. If they didn't want an article on this site, I wouldn't have taken the time and effort to make the article.

<li><i>Suggestion to Mr. Rubin:</i> Try to keep replies to comments directly under the message they are intended to reply to, not with votes in between. That having been said, I have never even heard of the comic in question until I saw it on VfD. That having been said, if comics were excluded just because they were defunct, we should nail Absurd Notions, <a href="../../../a/v/a/Avalon_%28web_comic%29.html" title="Avalon (web comic)">Avalon</a> ?, and several others. <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 03:22, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i>Comment:</i> I'm not trying to advertise Brent Bowser's work. (He can do that on his own if he'd like.) Carried by the Wind has as much a right to be here as any other web comic. You wouldn't delete Tales of the Questor, would you? Have you even read Carried by the Wind? It meets a majority of the requirements for web comics. REPEAT: I AM NOT TRYING TO ADVERTISE THE COMIC!!!! I am only giving people the oppourtunity to find out about it. Every article on this site attempts to acheive this purpose. If they have never read the web comic, and want to know what it's about, they can find out. I wouldn't recommend any of your articles for deletion because of low search engine hits, and neither should you. <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a>
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I'm going to have to play Devil's Advocate here and point out that "giving people the opportunity to find out about" something <i>is</i> advertising. Having said that, one of my own webcomic articles (<i>By The Saints</i>) has also been nominated for deletion...by the same User, I might add...leading me to suggest that the deletion policy for webcomics may be overzealous. <s>Unfortunately I'm not sufficiently familiar with CbtW to vote for inclusion on merit, so I must <b>Abstain</b></s>. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 19:45, 15 July 2005 (UTC) Change to <b>Weak Keep</b>, having read the Archive.

<ul>
<li><i>Comment:</i> Okay, I could have phrased that better. A LOT better. You all know what I'm trying to say. Say for example, you see a referance to CbtW somewhere and you don't know what it is. Where do you go? Wikipedia. This site has articles so that people can find information on a subject. Don't you think that CbtW is a subject? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIan_Rubin_a08c.html" title="User:Ian Rubin">Ian Rubin</a> 21:53, 15 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>Comment</i> I think the point here is that webcomics are considered for deletion on the grounds of obscurity. There must be thousands of articles on obscure towns, movies, songs, politicians, buildings, TV shows, books, mathematical formulae and subatomic particles. None of those articles ever seem to get deleted on the grounds that nobody's ever heard of them, and yet that is precisely the policy that is being followed in the case of webcomics. I definitely think the Alexa rule on webcomics should be rethought. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 01:09, 16 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><i>Comment</i> Songs (as well as albums and bands) have to pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> first, which is about one order of magnitude more stringent than most webcomic inclusion proposals. While I do agree that the Alexa test should definitely not be the be-all and end-all concerning webcomics, there are few ways to determine the notability of a webcomic (the other is longevity, which is what the second proposal covers). <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENifboy_11a5.html" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> 02:28, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>High quality artwork, backed up by detailed historical research.</li>
<li>Good script, plotting and characterisation. The author also has a good ear for dialects.</li>
<li>Labour of love. This comic is obviously its creator's pet project, therefore he's certain to stick it out to the end no matter what. <a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 17:37, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> When I began this article I was well aware of the fact that this particular title was borderline for inclusion. OTOH I was also mindful of the following: <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html#These_are_guidelines" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">"These guidelines are primaily designed to prevent the multitude of new or unencyclopedic web comics from using Wikipedia as free promotion."</a>. Well, the reason I wrote the article was that I did not consider <i>By The Saints</i> to be just one of the multitude. I was impressed with the quality of its art and storytelling, and in my considered opinion the author had and has a genuine commitment to telling this story. In other words, this is <i>not</i> some johnny-come-lately strip that's going to disappear overnight. Under the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Webcomics_Notability_and_inclusion_guidelines_dc06.html#Alternate_proposal" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines">Wikipedia:WikiProject Webcomics/Notability and inclusion guidelines#Alternate proposal</a> BTS is just short of the 33-week rule - the 33rd weekly page not including fillers is scheduled for July 25, meaning that it's just a fortnight short. If we assume that the 100-strip rule applies to single strips, then 33 full pages should be the equivalent. Finally, despite the above suggestion of self-aggrandizement, I am certainly <i>not</i> the webcartoonist. I'm going to stick my neck out here and predict that BTS <i>is</i> going to grow in size and increase its readership and that five years from now it will easily pass every guideline for inclusion. If the article is deleted now then I would suggest that the deletion policy is in serious need of revision.<a href="../../../l/e/e/User%7ELee_M_8833.html" title="User:Lee M">Lee M</a> 10:52, 11 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I interpret "100 strips" as "100 individual installments". Trying to determine how many strips a page is equivalent to in terms of effort seems highly subjective. I should also point out that the "alternative guidelines" are controversial, as they were added with little discussion beforehand; there is currently discussion on that talkpage as to whether they should be kept, amended, or thrown out entirely. Furthermore, we're not in the business of predicting <i>future</i> notability here: <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a crystal ball</a>. Deletion is not permanent: <i>if</i> the comic does become notable later, a new article may be written about it. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 18:58, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> In addition to what I consider outstanding artwork, this webcomic is unique for its attention to historical detail. The artist has created a detailed world and crafted an interesting storyline.

<li>At best, this belongs at Wikinews. Aside from the blog aspect of this story, this guy is really just a run-of-the-mill sex offender, AFAICT. (It sucks that sex offenders are common enough for there to be "run-of-the-mill" ones, but I digress.) <i>If</i> and <i>when</i> this guy's case and his blog have a serious impact on the study of sex offenders, he might deserve an article in an <i>encyclopedia</i>, but right now, he's not particularly notable, and this content is much more appropriate for a news site. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="#00A86B"><small>A</small>и<small>D</small>я<small>01D</small></font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="#B87333"><small>TALK</small></font></a><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Android79_a162.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Android79"><font color="#0047AB"><small>EMAIL</small></font></a> 07:00, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Author's Comment</b>: I went back and worked to clean up the article, corrections were made in the sequence of events. Spelling errors and grammatical issues were cleaned up. I added more recent information as knowledge of the case has developed. I placed a greater emphasis on the blog, "The Fifth Nail" as this is what sets this case apart from the, "run-of-the-mill" status of other similar articles. I next removed a link to my own website that lists proposed litigation aimed at controlling or governing sex offenders before the US Congress. Please let me know if I can do more to improve this article. I really would like to see it remain as there are people interested in learning more about sex offenders and studying this landmark case that includes evidence in the form of online websites maintained by the accused.

<li><b>Keep.</b> But an extensive cleanup that infuses more NPOV and relayouts the article is needed. All psychopaths/criminals showing a notable particularirty have to be kept in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Pletal is a brand name for Cilostazol, which gets another 705 google hits using your criteria. I think the product itself should be in Wikipedia.

<li>Neutral. The person's article certainly has a ways to go to indicate notability (any books, works published in journals or other third parties, etc.)--is this the same person that has a bunch of poetry hits? Also, it should link to the WP mind-brain article, rather than the external link. mind-brain.com is at the top of the alexa.com category "Subjects &gt; Society &gt; Philosophy &gt; Philosophy of Mind &gt; Consciousness Studies".<strike>, but it would be a better article if it gave more details about <i>accomplishments</i> than <i>objectives</i>.</strike><u>Both articles should focus more on detailing notable accomplishments/works, instead of airy jargo-babble about intentions/beliefs.</u> Keep if improved, I guess is what I'm trying to say. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 00:14, 15 May 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: self promotion, nonnotable. A few journal and conference publications is, sadly, no sign of notability, and neither is a vanity web site. I looked at the abstracts for a couple of his papers and it looks like pretty typical academic journal material -- solid work, I'm sure, but not distinguished.
