<p>Dating website which claims to be <i>"Largest and most popular English-language Singles Events website in the world"</i>, which is why I bumped this from speedy A7. However this claim is unsourced and may be original research per the talk page. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 03:53, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>This research is original as i am writting a paper for my university on singles events and speed dating. you will note that i have also edited a couple of other pages on wiki in relation to the origins and legal complications of speed dating and singles events.</p>
<p>My research has led me to search through msn, yahoo and google the three major search engines on the internet all of which have confirmed that ticket4one is the largest online both in bandwidth / indexed pages and viewable members.</p>
<p>i have spent a lot of time researching this industry so far and have found no other website to contradict my research.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rocky4885 (<a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERocky4885_4f79.html" title="User talk:Rocky4885">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rocky4885_6bf4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rocky4885">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>ok so i have removed the title "largest in the world" to comprimise with wiki standards. However i have left the stats on the article for further researchers to establish their own conclusion.</p>
<p>Is this sufficiant&#160;?<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Rocky4885 (<a href="../../../r/o/c/User_talk%7ERocky4885_4f79.html" title="User talk:Rocky4885">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Rocky4885_6bf4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Rocky4885">contribs</a>).</small></p>
<dl>
<dd>If you remove that part then the article doesn't assert the notability of the website, which makes it delete-worthy as well. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 04:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> ticket4one gets 126 ghits. For an online dating website, that's death. NN. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosh_Parris_7b8b.html" title="User talk:Josh Parris">Josh Parris</a> 04:42, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks Josh but ticket4one is not a dating site or they would be listed with DATING SITES. This is relation to Singles Events! PLEASE NOTE THE DIFFERENCE IN SPELLING</p>
<dl>
<dd>Either way it's a website. A non-notable one. Changing the description doesn't change the fact it's a website. <tt><a href="../../../a/w/y/User_talk%7EAwyong_Jeffrey_Mordecai_Salleh_3248.html" title="User talk:Awyong Jeffrey Mordecai Salleh">Kimchi</a>.<a href="../../../s/g/%21/WP%7ESG%21_e9d9.html" title="WP:SG!">sg</a></tt> 04:58, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Either way it may not be notable to you, But clearly the amount of members in the first nine months makes it notable for someone else.Compared to the numbers indicated for members in the social networking website list Dont you think&#160;?</p>
<p>As for it being a website "a non notable one" does that mean seeing as though you want to compare numbers that we should go and delete sites such as advogato, babbello, consumating, studybreakers,vietspace and zaadz from wikipedia&#160;?</p>
<p>After all the term " social networking site" is searched 50 -60 times greater then that of the term " Singles Events yet the memberships of these sites is as you like to put it "death"</p>

Google hits are not reliable sources, and just for the record, 2280 google hits is a <i>very</i> small number anyway. —&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/e/User%7ECoelacan_3233.html" title="User:Coelacan">coe<span style="font-variant:small-caps">l</span>acan</a> <a href="../../../c/o/e/User_talk%7ECoelacan_3858.html" title="User talk:Coelacan"><span style="font-variant:small-caps">t</span>a<span style="font-variant:small-caps">lk</span></a> — 07:17, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>for a start it is NOT my website. secondly it is not "2280 hits" they are press releaase/news articles.As i mentioned earlier to compare these results to our social networking list the following can be seen. ticket4one 2280 articles babbello 974 articles studybreakers 918 vietspace 1040</p>
<p>I believe 2280 is no longer a "very" small number when compared to other wikipedia content.</p>

Admittedly, it used to be higher - their traffic has dropped 43% in the last 3 months, according to Alexa. Basically, this is NO WAY the largest or most popular speed dating site.

<p>May i point out that the article does state " it may not have the highest amount of unique visitors.</p>
<p>In regards to 8minutedating, hurrydate, offlinespeeddating only one of these websites seems to have members profiles being hurrydate, To which anyone of you can compare the search results to ticket4one. It seems Ticket4one actually has approx 3 times the amount of members. (which is what the article is stating)</p>
<p>wow sounds like rocky4885 has rubbed some people the wrong way. or do you just have invested interests within that industry?</p>
<p>i have read <b>ALL</b> the facts submitted by rocky4885 " (which i strongly suggest some of you do) in discussion and talks all of which i cannot help but find the exact results to which this article proclaims are true.
