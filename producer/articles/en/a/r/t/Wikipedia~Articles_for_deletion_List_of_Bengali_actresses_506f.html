<p>The result was The question of whether the ability of lists to annotated is worth the cost of list/category duplication is old one, thoroughly argued. Ultimately, the weight given to the benefits of annotation is a subjective one: some will find this feature more useful than others. On a question of subjective cost/benefit analysis, recourse to a simple tally may be helpful: this is a rough, but fair, way to estimate the community's judgment of the subjective merit of these list. Here, 9d/4k = 69%. There is previous precedent also supporting deletion here in List of British Actors.</p>
<p>That said, there is one special concern regarding these lists. For at least some of them (Iran, Vietnam, Bengal), the community should evaluate the question of systematic bias; for others (particularly Jewish American, or anything-American), systemic bias is less a concern. Since these list vary with respect to a key factor, and since the raw margin favoring deletion is barely sufficient to invoke admin discretion, I will invoke admin discretion to call this discussion <b>No consensus</b>/default keep. Especially given concerns of systemic bias in covering the developing world, these lists should <i>not</i> be considered en masse, but separately. <a href="../../../x/o/l/User%7EXoloz_aa62.html" title="User:Xoloz">Xoloz</a> 17:40, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Until the AfD discussion on the List of British Actors, no consideration had been given to the encyclopedic value of these lists. All of these lists have categories. I believe that all of these articles are redundant as that is what categories are for. Furthermore, some lists provide an ostensible criteria for inclusion, but others do not. For consistency, these should all be deleted. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:15, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - duplicates category. Further, the criteria for inclusion is too vague. e.g. for Italy 'who reside in Italy or those who have appeared largely in Italy film productions.'. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 23:48, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Wikipedia doesn't have to follow precedents, but the discussion with the previous article proved how redundant these lists are when we already have a category for the topic. - <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorne_N._Melcher_ba8b.html" title="User:Thorne N.

<li><b>Keep</b>-Lists can provide information categories can't. They also provide an opportunity for expansion of the rather sucky coverage Wikipedia has on the developping world.

<li><b>Comment</b>-there was a comment in the original AfD that suggested the lists with lots of redlinks be preserved because they can't be represented by categories.

<li><b>Keep</b>. It makes me very sad to see that yet another useful list—the List of German actors (from 1895 to the present)—is going to be deleted, but I know from experience that there are too many willing executioners for me to efficiently oppose such a plan. Cui bono? I also believe the kind of bulk nomination practised here is illegitimate and inappropriate.

<dd>BlueValour is right. If all actor pages were nominated at once more people would complain about the bulk nomination. Voting <i>keep</i> at this point just slows down the process pointlessly. It won't bring back List of Canadian actors or List of British actors so I don't see why <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Iranian_actors_11ca.html" title="List of Iranian actors">List of Iranian actors</a> should survive but not them. For one thing, actor listing have become a "craze" that needs to die down. Everyone complains about "Red links! What about the red links?!" A User on another afd put "As WP:NOT says, "Wikipedia is not a directory of everything that exists or has existed."" Just because an actor exists, doesn't mean they automatically deserve a wikipedia article. Furthermore, it's a sad fact that red links don't attract anyone to make articles. If someone is devoted enough to set time aside to make an article for an actor that isn't vanity, it's good evidence that article is worth being here. Can't use that self-pruning method on red links. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:11, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You're asking for something that will never happen, Yuckfoo. Categories are maintainable. Once an actor article is created and checked for legitimacy, you simply add a note for a category. Lists can go on infinitely with anonymous users adding unmaintainable names on a daily basis. Nobody in the right mind will plan on spending their months preparing the red links in List of German actors (from 1895 to the present)..especially when its very likely that bundles of translations will be needed. <a href="../../../2E/2E/2E/User%7E...And_Beyond%21_c96c.html" title="User:...And Beyond!">...And Beyond!</a> 17:29, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
