<li>I might have lower standards than other contributors here, but the fact that there are now sources added (on the Talk page, which is a start towards incorporating them in the article) is good enough for me. <b>Keep</b> therefore, and with any luck it'll start to look better soon. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 06:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think you've misinterpreted me. The citations in this article at the moment are from the Qur'an and that's perfectly ok, since we need the text there as it is. There are also explanations of the scientific processes involved. What the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_the_Bible_23d4.html" title="Science and the Bible">Science and the Bible</a> article has as well as these is a collection of sources where scientists and theologians have examined the compatibility of the two things. This article (at the moment), <i>doesn't</i>. I'm not saying that such sources don't exist, I'm just saying that they're not here at the moment. Without them, it looks more like original research. For example, which "Scientists say that before the galaxies in the Universe were formed, celestial matter was initially in the form of huge gaseous matter or clouds." Likewise, I was under the distinct impression that some planets orbit the sun in an elliptical manner rather than the "rounded course", so a citation would need to be provided here, and so on. In relation to the argument that there are other articles which don't cite sources, the fact that a series of articles of a certain type exist isn't a reason in favour of keeping any particular article of that type. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_BigHaz_4c1e.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/BigHaz">Review me</a>) 22:03, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>About <b>science I am copying most of the things from wikipedia other articles</b>. BTW rounded does not mean perfext circle or ellipse. In rounded both are covered. It is just commonly known fact. I know because it is about Islam so I have to find references about commonly known fact. I also know that you cannot even wait for references for few hours or days. TELL ME that if "Science and the Bible" was in its current shape during <b>very first few hours</b>? <i>Go and see its history</i>.

<li>First of all, please understand that no one is attacking you nor the Islamic faith. Secondly, I believe you are still mistaken as to BigHaz's meaning: it is not the science that needs citations, but the <i>correlations</i> between science and the Qur'ān. I could go through the <a href="../../../u/p/a/Upanishads.html" title="Upanishads">Upanishads</a> and correlate sections of it to scientific thought, but that would be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. Unless you have evidence that people <i>other than yourself</i> have made these correllations, it fails one of WP's primary guidelines. If you read the <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_the_Bible_23d4.html" title="Science and the Bible">Science and the Bible</a> article, all the arguments presented have been published in scholarly works, not contributed by Wikipedia editors.

<dd>As a further addition to my thoughts on the matter, I do have to note that there's quite too much original research in this at the moment.

Firstly, I will ask some other people in wikipedia to contribute (as they are good in this subject). Secondly, I will issue books from library. However, it depends that when I will have free time again (may be after a week). Lastly, I think when more people will know about the article then it will improve significantly. Because few will add criticism and other will defend it with references at the end we will have a healthy article (that what is wikipedia about).

<dd><b>Comment:</b> As it stands now the article <i>is</i> an apology of Islam. It's a good thing that you invite other people to work on it, and the work already done is a good basis. However, you know (or by now you should know) what the rules are. There's nothing forbidding you from working on a preliminary acceptable version of the article outside Wikipedia, or in your own userspace. I'd be happy to help, but the article is original research (your own ellaboration) and I'm not familiar with any reference works that could be used in this case. For now, <b>no vote</b>, but I'm afraid the article cannot stand as it is now, as it violates policies that are at the core of Wikipedia. If it does get deleted, you still have the right to ask that a copy of the text be restored <i>outside of article space</i> for your own use, so you can eventually make it conformant to WP policies and re-create it.</dd>
<dd><b>Comment 2:</b> The above observation by Danny Lilithborne is simply not a valid argument. "If you delete this, why don't you delete that" is possibly the single most posted opinion in AfD, but it never works, and it only messes up the process. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I'm very aware of that. However, I think it works in this case. Deleting an article that just needs citations and clean-up to be encyclopedic is not appropriate, and deleting this but leaving the Bible article conveys a clear double-standard. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanny_Lilithborne_247d.html" title="User:Danny Lilithborne">Danny Lilithborne</a> 01:59, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment.</b> There is a very clear difference between the two articles, though: one examines the relationship between science and scripture (both correllations and discrepencies), and one selectively interprets passages in scripture to show that they are in agreement with scientific thought. If we were drawing analogies, this would be similar to an article about Creationism that only listed verses that could be interpreted to agree with scientific finding. The fact that the creator has stated within this AFD that the article "claims that everything in Quran is scientific or correct scientifically" further adds to the article's underlying POViness. -- <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMerope_5bcb.html" title="User:Merope">Merope</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../m/e/r/User_talk%7EMerope_f738.html" title="User talk:Merope">Talk</a></sup></small> 02:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

However, it is not necessarily impossible to do so, and I'd prefer to wait at least a month, see if it gets anywhere close to the Bible article. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 02:03, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The subject matter is very interesting, and it need not be an apology of religion, as long as it shows divergences as well as consistencies. At present, the article only mentions consistencies (with the macroscopic exception that I added), so I do agree there is a big POV going on here, and quite a lot of original research too. --<a href="../../../n/e/h/User%7ENehwyn_e0df.html" title="User:Nehwyn">Nehwyn</a> 13:22, 3 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>In the last few AfD's I have participated in this same argument is put forward "the other side is just having his friends come and help him". First I think there should be more faith in the WP Community. Lots of people contribute to these debates, many people who just want to help improve WP and have no connection what so ever to the article in question. Furthermore it is an ad hoc attack to focus on the personalities of the contributors rather than the substance of the debate. I personally peruse the AfD's and participate at on anything that catches my eye. When generalities are made about the contributors of a debate that do not apply to me at all, I feel a bit insulted. <a href="../../../r/a/t/User%7ERatherhaveaheart_e6da.html" title="User:Ratherhaveaheart">Ratherhaveaheart</a> 16:21, 4 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>* Comment: I only asked them to contribute in the article and not asked them to vote here. I even continue asking same people to contributing in the article even after their vote here. Only <i>three people</i> vote here after I ask them to contribute (you can find their ratio from total votes). I even ask <b>Pablo-flores</b> to contribute. I never know him before here; he is not my old friend. Furthermore, it makes no sense to ask people to vote because it will inform those people too who will vote against you.

I can't say how Mr. Naik feels about this, but it looks like plagiarism if not also a copyright violation. A check at the creators' contribution history shows that several of the votes above were indeed solicited from editors who had no prior involvement with the article, but which Ibrahimfaisal had reason to believe would be favorable to the notion advanced in the article. It is not only uncited, but essentially false in its exegesis (and, in a few cases, translation) of the passages in question.Observation Post 05:13, 4 October 2006 (UTC) <small>— Observation Post (<a href="../../../o/b/s/User_talk%7EObservation_Post_31e7.html" title="User talk:Observation Post">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Observation_Post_0621.html" title="Special:Contributions/Observation Post">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

There are a number of related articles WRT the bible e.g, <a href="../../../b/i/b/Bible_scientific_foreknowledge.html" title="Bible scientific foreknowledge">Bible_scientific_foreknowledge</a> and <a href="../../../b/i/b/Biblical_inerrancy.html" title="Biblical inerrancy">Biblical_inerrancy</a> both of which should be templates for any similar examination of Islamic doctrine (or rather Islamic apologetics). I've looked at the article and I'm really worried it'll just keep poping up as an AfD if the edits taking place stay in the same style. Though I may seem anti- my first approach to arguments are through reason. It should also be renamed to <a href="../../../s/c/i/Science_and_the_Quran_255e.html" title="Science and the Quran">Science and the Quran</a> to be consistent with the approach taken with the Bible.

<li><b>Move</b> This article should be moved to a book page <i>The Bible, The Qur'an and Science</i> as the article gives "French born Saudi royal physician" Maurice Bucaille 's book as a source for these theories. I might mention that the arguments listed on the page as so preposterous as to hardly be worth refuting, for example the line where it says the "heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them" allegedly refering to the Big Bang.
