<li><b>Do not Delete</b> - Everything needs a definition even if it’s the strangest term more the reason for it to be defined, therefore it is encyclopaedic and seeing that its popularity is increasing people should be made more aware of what it is.

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> Only the people who don't want this page to be deleted have any <i>valid reason</i>. The claim that it is nonsense might just as well be said about God, but there's an article on Him. Herodotus never referenced anything and he's called the Father of History. This is a work based on living memory and does not therefore require references. Those who want to delete this page are contributing to the destruction of the memory of a cultural phenomenon. It's the ugly side of globalistion. Comparable to the loss of a little-spoken African language. What richness it may hold for historians of the future! Do not delete this page, vikings!</li>
<li><b>Do not Delete</b> This is obviously a new slang term developing in 'adolescent society'. The secondary definition for nugget according to www.dictionary.com is: A small compact portion or unit. It is clear that an inverted case fits this description quite well. As the creator points out, wikipedia is not just your average conventional encyclopedia; Wikipedia is a site made by the people, for the people, which is perhaps the best system for an up-to-date reference. It is for these reasons that i feel the term should stand. I am also puzzled as to how the creator would go about collecting citations? picture evidence has been given, what other sources would be available?</li>

<li>Uncle G has let me know that we have proof that the term exists and that what the article discusses actually happens.

Now I hope the "nugget" phenomenon never reaches this level, but I'd probably vote to keep if this became a political issue in Australia and New Zealand. If leading newspapers carried stories about a "nugget" epidemic, if concerned parents stormed town council meetings, if local laws were passed to ban "nuggets". Obviously it stops being fun long before that point. So move your content over to a Geocities. It's amusing.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> "Nuggeting" is a term which dates back to the late 18th century. The imperial powers who colonised this nation used the term "Nuggeting" when they referred to the action of inversing somebodys sack. Nuggeting is genuine, informative and factual. It is an important aspect of Australian venacular. Moreover it is a common practice in Australian society. These reasons alone make the term "Nuggeting" encyclopedic. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 211.30.107.19 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.30.107.19_fa12.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.30.107.19">contribs</a>) 06:37, 21 November 2005 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>The thing is, Wikipedia is a community that works on consensus. Consensus is made up from the opinions of the people who actually contribute to Wikipedia. If just any random guy pops in here and writes "Do not delete! Nuggeting is awesome d00dz!" as his only edit, and then leaves forever, it's not contributing to Wikipedia, and it's not from a member of our community. It's just a random, off-the-wall comment. On the other hand, if someone who has been here for a few days or weeks, preferably months, and has made valid edits to many articles, writes "Delete. This is a neologism that is not widespread enough." then it's a much more valued opinion. If we just counted all votes and didn't pay attention to who they are by, we'd be no better than some poor webpage's guestbook with 200 pages full of "HOT 18-YEAR-OLD TEENS LIVE!!!" written over and over again.</li>
<li>About the terminology: A sock puppet is an account used by a person who already has an account, to create the impression that he's two people.

<li>I'll admit that I have never edited a single article here on Wikipedia... (Although I probably could fix up a few of the sub par ones which are in my areas of interest...) But I'm not just some "Random Person" who was "recruited to save NUGGETS". I love this site dearly and visit it often and there has been no recruiting what-so-ever. All of our comments are our own separate opinion. I believe that this article belongs here as it contains factual information on a current occurence. I know there are people who want this article deleted and that's ok... But you can't go claiming something "Bullshit" when there are actual occurences. "NUGGETING" is similar to "<a href="../../../k/a/n/Kancho.html" title="Kancho">Kancho</a>" in that it is an activity that occurs in the schoolyard... However NUGGETTING isn't quite as... gross... as Kancho. I'm not trying to cause any trouble here, I am simply telling the truth. If you people can't accept that, then I don't care... Flame me all you want, but it does not change your maturity (or lack thereof). Also, if what we were saying was indeed "Do not delete! Nuggeting is awesome d00dz!" I would see why you would want it delete it. As anyone who uses a "0" in place of an "o" or a "z" in place of a "s" is automatically able to be considered a complete and utter idiot. My vote of "Do not Delete" stands.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well, there's a difference between Kancho and Nuggeting. Kancho is a widely known aspect of young Japanese kids' culture. It has been well documented by a number of sources, a quick Google search can show you that. However, this Nuggeting phenomena has yet to be picked up by any larger publications (the reference cited is just one school district). Therefore, if for that reason alone, this article should be deleted. --<a href="../../../m/d/d/User%7EMdd4696_2098.html" title="User:Mdd4696">mdd4696</a> 16:02, 22 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> As a student at a Sydney school, NUGGETING is part and parcel of daily life. Whether or not the Wikipedia literati deem this article 'non-encyclopaedic' is irrelevant. It is a reference to today's changing social scene, and is the essence of what Wikipedia stands for. If we want a free, web-based encyclopedia which deals with the real issues, then NUGGETING surely must be included. <i>-- Unsigned vote by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_138.130.60.157_92d3.html" title="Special:Contributions/138.130.60.157">138.130.60.157</a> 2005-11-22 09:57:03</i></li>
<li><b>Do not delete</b> As to the reasons why John Howards would declare a war against NUGGETING, I'm yet to be convinced.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> Unfortunately due to the extrmely large amount of OLD FARTS who use wikipedia, it is neccessary to get other people who know the term to support it. I believe a post on here was even made by a school teacher who has had to deal with the issue.

<p><b>DONT DELETE</b>Why are all of you ignorant people making such knee-jerk comments. The fact is that Nuggeting is a legitimate term which derives from ancient roots. It is a term which is very apt in our society. Your arguments are creating a host of paradox's. You all claim to be such highly intellectual Wikipedia nerds, yet all you do is display an array of contradictions and a low level of common sense. Nuggeting will remain and will grow in understanding with the fullness of time. And at the appropriate juncture you will all claim to have first cited the meaning of the word. Nuggeting is encyclopedic! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 211.30.107.19 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_211.30.107.19_fa12.html" title="Special:Contributions/211.30.107.19">contribs</a>) 09:25, 24 November 2005 (UTC).</small> <small>This users only edits have been to this discussion and it's talk page.</small></p>
<p><b>DONT DELETE</b> as for us all being sockpuppets this website states "Suspicion of such sock puppets is often harder to verify though, as there are often people who naturally behave in such a manner with the same effects." is it too hard to believe that there are more than one person who agree with the same argument, or should we accuse all the "delete" arguments as being sock puppetry as well???</p>
<p>also, of course the method section is all original research, the only websites you would accept as a source are just as conservative as yourself. maybe if you would accept this article then others would see it as acceptible too. please someone help me out here, tell me how that anecdote isn't written from NPOV</p>
<p>if you're going to delete this article for it being a neologism may i direct you to delete also the terms "wikipedia", "Wiktionary", "Wikibooks", and "Wikinews". These terms make even less sense, have no origin and no sources that could be deemed verifiable by your standards!</p>
<p>BTW you have suggested we look at "testosterone poisoning" as an example. here is a quote from that page: "The earliest printed reference appears to be the 1985 book A Feminist Dictionary. It is unclear whether this refers to existing slang or is the editors' humorous neologism." need i point out that the origin of this is also shady AND it is a neologism - you've said it yourself!</p>
<p>im sick and tired of people saying its unencyclopedic, at least our arguments have substance! we are saying why it should stay and we are giving damn good reasons too. "unencyclopedic" is not an argument without some sort of elaboration and sockpuppetry is an opinion NO FACT whatsoever.</p>
<p>you know what, you all seem to know so much that we know longer need "wikipedia - an encyclopedia by the people for the peple" i think "wikipedia - by conservative autocratic fools who know everything to tell everyone else what is and what isnt."</p>
<p>ill finish (for now) by saying this. you're all rather misinformed. the term you're looking for is not "sockpuppet" its "minority group" <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 203.45.127.4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_203.45.127.4_58d1.html" title="Special:Contributions/203.45.127.4">contribs</a>) 11:07, 24 November 2005 (UTC).</small> <small>This users only edits have been to this discussion.</small></p>
<p><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Delete, unverifiable was a comment left by one of the disgruntled users of wikipedia. If we were to define "contradiction" there would be this caption next to it, how about you VERIFY your opinion with evidence, you accuse them of using unverified information and then you dont even verify your arguements. Furthermore, if your going to leave a comment make sure it is a COMMENT and not "reasons given above". If thats all you have to contribute to this debate keep your uninformed opinions to yourself you unoriginal fool. At least write a valid reason as to why you should think it should be deleted instead of "dido".</p>
<p>I totally agree with the previous comment, sockpuppetry is an excuse thrown around to destroy this credible article and if that is the strongst arguement you have then your in trouble. Sockpuppetry is an arguement against a small number of the supporters not the article itself, it is irrelevant to the legitmacy of the article and therefore an arguement which mentions it should be disregarded.</p>
