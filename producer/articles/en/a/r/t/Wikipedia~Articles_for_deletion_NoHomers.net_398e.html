<dd><b>Comment</b> Yeah, sockpuppet is a slight misnomer here for the policy, but the spirit of it that the raw number of comments by recently registered or anonymous editors carries little weight here needs some name, and it's most typically used in the "sockpuppet" sense of somebody inventing myriad personas to agree with them. If users of nohomers.net want to save this article, use logic and reason, persuade other wikipedians why it should be kept. Just a lot of votes saying "keep" when you are new here aren't going to go far, that's part of why the name of this process was recently changed from "Votes for Deletion" to "Articles for Deletion", to clarify that it's not a simple vote, it's a discussion to come to a consensus of the community. --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 08:01, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Alexa rank does not suggest notability, however much arm-waving might go on.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The site does not claim to have 10,000 members or over 1,200,000 posts. That is listed right on the site. That is besides the point. In this case, the notability has not been gained because it's huge (however, the size is quite decent), but because of different things that have already been listed. Those reasons are relevant.</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>&#160;: sorry, but this (soon-to-be) deletion seems to be entirely unreasonable. just because the site has decided to flood wikipedia with sockpuppets does not mean it is not notable. it has been mentioned by the writers and voice actors of the Simpsons on the DVD commentaries, twice. it has held personal, direct question and answer sessions with three other Simpsons executive producers (different ones from those who mentioned it on the commentaries). both current executive producer Al Jean and former executive producer Mike Reiss have submitted public statements to the board. It has been referenced directly on the show itself. It has at least three Simpsons animators registered as members. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.tv.simpsons.html" title="Alt.tv.simpsons">Alt.tv.simpsons</a>, which has an article, has had less direct interaction with writers/actors/animators of the show, has never been referenced on the show's DVD commentaries, and has never been referenced on the show itself. And no, its numbers are not enormous, but considering it's a unofficial, privately-run forum with a specific topic, it's pretty large. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieli_47f3.html" title="User:Jamieli">Jamieli</a> 12:26, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I think this just barely makes it under the wire of <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> (if the claims of commentary on dvd and other evidentiary claims supporting notability are true). I note that if you parse the language of the WP:WEB section, a case can be made for both keep and delete. Criterion: "The content itself has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the site itself." Is the DVD commentary a fit? First we have to look at all claims and decide whether that's "multiple." Fairly easy to say the DVD is non-trivial. But does <i>mention</i> in the dvd render nohomer "the subject" of this published work? I would say no. As stated in the exclusion section immediately following, this does not include "a brief summary of the nature of the content." I vote weak keep because of the (possibly trivial brief summary) mention of nohomer, but nevertheless in apparently <i>multiple</i> non-trivial published works. --<a href="../../../f/u/h/User%7EFuhghettaboutit_b1ab.html" title="User:Fuhghettaboutit">Fuhghettaboutit</a> 15:24, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> If a fan site can be major enough to have an influence on the show itself, than it should be worthy enough to be a Wikipedia article. I have actually heard the NoHomers mention on the DVD, and the way the staff talk about it, it's clear that it's an influential site. --DVD Smith 21:33, 6 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think this is notable enough to have a Wikipedia entry, but it does need to be cleaned up. Although many of these comments are by users of the forum, some do make valid points (AlJeanRules particularly), which is what we ask them to do. With one or two exceptions, I don't have any complaints about the discourse of those members that have contributed to this discussion. - <a href="../../../n/z/d/User%7ENzd_f455.html" title="User:Nzd">N</a> <a href="../../../n/z/d/User_talk%7ENzd_a287.html" title="User talk:Nzd">(talk)</a> 01:20, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would say the DVDs/episodes themselves are perfectly acceptable, very easily verifiable sources. The main mention of the website on the commentaries is on "Homer The Great", in the season six box set. The mention of the site in an actual episode is in the episode "Sleeping With The Enemy", during the bowling alley scene. --<a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamieli_47f3.html" title="User:Jamieli">Jamieli</a> 17:55, 7 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> <s>There are so many other sites out there that are much larger and more successful that do not have their own site. It seems that this site was created by members only for the publicity, internet sites should not be given wikipedia articles because of their instability. Who knows how much longer that this site will be around anyway? Sure, it was mentioned by the Simpsons creators, but only because it's one of the few large simpsons forums out there. I can understand why Alt.tv.Simpsons has it's own article, because it was a pioneer and is still well known after 15+ plus years. Only the initials of nohomersclub were used on the show, and in the background so only members would get the reference. If the members REALLY must have an entry, why not just give them a small mention in the main article? --Scorpion0422</s></li>
