<p>Huuuuge batch nomination for a number of articles all purporting incorrectly to be items from Polynesian mythology. All seem to originate on the same (extremely dodgy) website, which has caused problems with Polynesian mythology articles in the past.

<li><b>Keep and re-nominate</b>. I'm pretty uneasy about a block-delete this large. I'm sure that Kahuroa knows more about all this stuff than I do, but it is against my nature to accept this many deletions on someone's say-so. I think before we can delete an article we need a specific problem. In this case, I'd like something like 'Ahoeitu' is not in the Oxford Dictionary of Polynesian Mythology, etc. But that's something that has to be done one entry at a time. (Is there a wiki-policy about multiple deletions? If not, should there be?) <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 02:03, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have no objection to you splitting it up into smaller batches if you wish, but I've just spent the last hour merging them all together into one, so I don't want to do that myself! All the articles do have the same failing, however (they are false), so a batch nomination seemed the logical way to go. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 02:06, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>In which case don't get involved in the debate and vote at all. I sure wouldn't vote to delete in an area about which I knew nothing, but likewise I damn well better not be voting to keep in an area about which I know nothing. <a href="../../../r/g/t/User%7ERGTraynor_8dbd.html" title="User:RGTraynor">RGTraynor</a> 19:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b>. The majority of these articles were added by user TUF-KAT over a day or two in late September 2002. He tells me that they derive from a dubious source - <a href="http://pantheon.org/" class="external text" title="http://pantheon.org/" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Mythica</a>. Some of these so-called gods are in fact the names of natural elements (like <a href="../../../u/a/_/Ua.html" title="Ua">Ua</a>, which means simply 'rain'. They often do not tell you which Polynesian culture the so-called god came from. There was no such thing as a unified 'Polynesian mythology' anyway - altho there were themes that were shared, each island, each tribe had its own tradition and its own stories and if the article does not tell you where the story came from it is meaningless. This causes confusion between the various cultures and languages - often the names in the story are obviously from different cultures yet they are presented as if they were a cohesive whole. Consider the article Kahomovailahi which purports to deal with a Samoan myth. This is impossible because there is no K or H in the Samoan language. Others purport to be Māori yet the names contain letters not found in that language. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 02:07, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>comment</b>. Thanks for the clarification of your reasoning. On the other hand, if one googles 'Whatu', one finds lots of references to a Polynesian hail god. Maybe they're all based on that one bad website, or (as is often the case now) on Wikipedia's article. But if we need verifiability to keep articles, don't we also need it to delete them? <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 02:28, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You're right - they derive from the sources you suggest. Polynesian HAIL GOD??? How much hail do you think you get on a tropical atoll at the equator? <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 02:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But Whatu is a Polynesian word for hail, no? And as a natural phenomenon it is not impossible to imagine a divinity associated with it. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 02:59, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Read the entry above for <a href="../../../u/a/_/Ua.html" title="Ua">Ua</a>, I think it explains what's going on with Whatu. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:31, 28 March 2006 (UTC) Oh, and by the way, it does hail in Hawaii (though not often).

<dd>No offence, but it does seem to me that you're asking us to do the equivalent of proving the null hypothesis in scientific method.

<li><b>No vote</b> at the moment. As noted, I wrote these (most of them? maybe all?) based on a source that is now proven to be unreliable, especially for some reason in the area of Polynesian mythology. (I used the same source for some bits in Celtic and other kinds of mythology, with no significant problems with errors that I know of) The source wasn't cited and is perhaps inherently dubious, but none of that was really considered very important in 2002.

<dd>Valid point - but nor should something be called Polynesian when it can only possibly occur in one Polynesian culture - Anderson maybe generalised where today we would be specific - sounds like he labels as Polynesian anything that occurs in any culture within Polynesia. Tongan words aren't usually spelt with a B, so that should probably be Polutu anyway.

The ones I looked into seem rife with inaccuracies (e.g. <a href="../../../p/a/l/Paliuli.html" title="Paliuli">Paliuli</a> referenced above). Bottom line: the nominator has identified a corpus of material whose source is highly dubious, a point which I think has been fairly made above and which gives this mass nomination credibility. He's done his homework, seems knowledgeable about the subject and raised a serious set of issues about articles that have all been authored by a single source.

<li>I don't have your Bastian source, but the linked creation chant has Paliuli as a place, not a person. I think you are being thrown off by the line: <i>"Paliuli names an ever verdant land of the gods where abundant food grows without labor. The name is given to fertile spots in deep mountain valleys where in old days children of high chiefs were taken to be reared."</i> It is an odd sentence construction. It doesn't mean someone named Paliuli gave a name to something, it means "Paluilui" is the name of something. If you keep reading, you get to the sentence, <i>"Some say that each district had its Paliuli. Perhaps the name was given to whatever secluded spot was chosen in the district for the rearing of taboo chiefs from infancy without any form of labor on their own part."</i> And then the translated chant itself: <i>"A sea of coral like the green heights of Paliuli . . ."</i>; and <i>"the impenetrable land of Kuaihealani in Paliuli . . ."</i> <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 13:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC) Also, refer to the references in the article itself, including the recent U. of Hawaii Press dictionary of Hawaiian place names. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 14:45, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most if not all of these are of questionable validity. However, from the discussion some of these appear to have verifiable sources. Perhaps the best process would be to put a prod notice on them all. Those which lack any verifiable evidence from reliable sources should be deleted. The editors who claim that there is evidence supporting some of these articles can add verifiable sources and remove the prod notice which may lead to these coming back here. They should not be merged into Polynesian mythology unless we have verifiable evidence that the relevant gods exist. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 23:43, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<p>"<b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> with the goal of improving the encyclopedia I suggest removing the AfD tag from those articles that can be sourced per discussion above and allow the rest to be deleted. Listing all the articles as separate AfD's will take more time and effort and end up with the same result. Keep per rewrite and merge are terrible ideas given the acknowledged factual problems with some of these articles.

<p>Given the length and complexity of the above debate, I propose the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>to pull the batch nomination;</li>
<li>to re-submit these items individually, over the course of the next few days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, withdrawal of a nomination would entail a wait of a considerable time before re-nomination, but in these circumstances I doubt that that is necessary. I'll wait a day or two in case there are any objections to this proposal (which should be lodged here). <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrutness_4a2f.html" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i><small><a href="../../../g/r/u/User_talk%7EGrutness_ff60.html" title="User talk:Grutness"><font color="#008822">wha?</font></a></small></i> 03:41, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>agree</b>. I've been working through some of these articles to see if they are worth saving. Quite a few of them should be simple deletions. There are some, however, that are salvageable. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 03:50, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Heartily agree</b>. Though I think you might get away with <i>small</i> batches in some cases where the entries are of similar quality and are logically related. For example, <a href="../../../n/g/a/Ngaru.html" title="Ngaru">Ngaru</a>, <a href="../../../t/u/m/Tumuitearetoka.html" title="Tumuitearetoka">Tumuitearetoka</a>, and <a href="../../../t/o/n/Tongatea.html" title="Tongatea">Tongatea</a> all seem to be part of the same story. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 03:56, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>agree</b>. The issues are complex in some cases - and require an in depth understanding of Polynesian language, culture, and history, as well as of the mechanics of the oral transmission of traditions. Which is why someone can say 'Avaiki-Tautau is a Polynesian name for New Zealand' without realising why that is impossible given the geography involved and the nature of the oral tradition. And I don't think this kind of mass deletion was the right way to go. My main aim is to guard against Wikipedia becoming another source of 'tradition feedback' where incorrect printed information ends up being incorporated in the traditions of the peoples involved - like the 'Great Fleet' hypothesis - made up by European researchers in the case of us New Zealand Polynesians. <a href="../../../k/a/h/User%7EKahuroa_d2ad.html" title="User:Kahuroa">Kahuroa</a> 06:55, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Agree</b> - merge is a terrible idea given that these articles are not merely stubs but have multiple levels of factual defects as well. The suggestion to <b>prod</b> the articles and allow thost that can be sourced to be rescued should also work in principle, however as there is no requirement that the "deprodding" editor actually improve the article, we'd just end up here anyway. <a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 16:31, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
