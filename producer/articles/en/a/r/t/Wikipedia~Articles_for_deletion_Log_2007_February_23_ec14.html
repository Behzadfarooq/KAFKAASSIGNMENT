<p>POV-essay. There is no references to any Information campaign of Russian government at all.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Horribly POV starting from the title itself. I could see a potential for the News coverage of Ukraine in Russia after the Orange Revolution article but this would have to be written from scratch and the current text would have been totally useless for it. This so called article looks to me as a plainly ax-grinding exercise by someone. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 00:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep for now</b> New-ish user. Article should be tagged for the issues it has and some time given to fix them and perhaps fix the name etc. Obviously it is mostly rubbish but should at least be given some time (more than 1 day!) for the aurthor to fix it and provide sources in the media (which do apparently exist)--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 04:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Are you saying that an encyclopedic NPOV article can be made under <i>this</i> title? In general it is possible to have an article about Ukraine's coverage in Russia but that's gotta be under a neutral title (see above) and would have been written from scratch. --<a href="../../../i/r/p/User%7EIrpen_a72e.html" title="User:Irpen">Irpen</a> 04:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>, as far as I can see the worse thing about this article is the title. With the given sources (and most of them from Prawda), one could construct a conspiracy theory. The question of debate is whether it should be included in a encyclopedia. Hitting a new editor with the whole book after one day of editing is certainly not the way to make him understand why we don't see room for a certain article. Instead someone should have started by leaving a message indicating the relevant guidelines. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman">Alf photoman</a> 15:32, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep but rename,</b> and renominate in a week.

<li><b>Delete</b> and salt. Usalvageably POV. No way to make an NPOV article under this name.

<li><b>ÝOU SHOULD LIVE NOW IN UKRAINE TO UNDERSTAND THIS VERY PROBLEM</b> the same way as you should live in Poland to see how the joint forces of Nazi and Communists in 1939 ripped the country. USSR denied that for 70 years. The article has the full right for existence as there is a real problem! If you did not see it, or just don't want to pay attention to it, it does not mean there is no problem! I agree that probably the name in not that OK. As well as if you live in UK, Germany, Canada and don't know that people in Africa die from hunger because they don't have 1$ a day does not mean that there is not such a problem. <a href="../../../o/l/g/User%7EOlgerd_4053.html" title="User:Olgerd">Olgerd</a> 10:39, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand that article is controversial from different points of view, as many articles here. However there is no argumentation - just DELETE and POV?! I have made some amendments and complitely changed the Title, while I have added a list of references and links to the mass-media sources and opinions of the government officials. I still need your balanced &amp; argumented (!) comments in order to improve the article.

<p><b>Comment</b> Despite the current status of this nomination, I suggest that whoever closes this debate seek out more Swedish speakers. None of those arguing for deletion speak Swedish, or at least their user pages do not declare it. In fact, the only editor who speaks Swedish in the debate has said it was notable, I think if we get confirmation on this, it would be reasonable to keep it. —<a href="../../../s/i/r/User%7ESiroxo_bc18.html" title="User:Siroxo">siro</a><a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESiroxo_a930.html" title="User talk:Siroxo"><i>χ</i></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Siroxo_49da.html" title="Special:Contributions/Siroxo">o</a> 01:48, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>These articles have been nominated 3 times for <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Gallery_of_banknotes_%283rd_nomination%29_b6a5.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gallery of banknotes (3rd nomination)">deletion in 2006</a>; the previous discussion missed an important point. Unlike flags, banknotes and coins are not used to identify countries, these large gallery of fair use media are not an acceptable fair use; all of the images seem to exist in the corresponding country currency article so these are unnecessary galleries of FU material and should be deleted. <b>Delete</b> --<a href="../../../p/d/h/User%7EPDH_bc7b.html" title="User:PDH">Peta</a> 00:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>, for reasons mentioned in the previous three AFDs. Sorry Peta, but I fail to see anything you've introduced that has changed the discussion, the images of banknotes are to identify banknotes. The subjects are the banknotes themselves, not the issuing country. Fair use rights should be asserted. <i><a href="../../../h/a/t/User%7EHateless_dd29.html" title="User:Hateless">hateless</a></i> 00:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I would suggest the burden of proof is on the accuser. Besides, {{<a href="../../../m/o/n/Template%7EMoney_d4e0.html" title="Template:Money">money</a>}} seems to indicate banknotes may or may not be copyrighted depending on the laws of the issuing state.

<dd>Beside the 4 points (usefulness, policy, format, cost) I gave in previous AfD, I'd like to raise some new perspective.
<ul>
<li><b>Partition</b> and <b>caption</b></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is work in progress, examples include <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_Belarusian_banknotes_0454.html" title="Gallery of Belarusian banknotes">Gallery of Belarusian banknotes</a> and <a href="../../../g/a/l/Gallery_of_Kyrgyz_banknotes_d0ac.html" title="Gallery of Kyrgyz banknotes">Gallery of Kyrgyz banknotes</a>. They meet the requirement of gallery. And there are even templates for captioning them: <a href="../../../n/u/m/Template%7ENumismatic_banknote_gallery_caption_94a7.html" title="Template:Numismatic banknote gallery caption">Template:Numismatic banknote gallery caption</a> and <a href="../../../n/u/m/Template%7ENumismatic_coin_gallery_caption_2c7d.html" title="Template:Numismatic coin gallery caption">Template:Numismatic coin gallery caption</a>. What is taking me so long? I am the only one doing it. There are duplicate images, some not exactly identical. Forking off a national gallery requires looking up data from catalog for captions. I have real life responsibility too.</dd>

They can be useful, interesting, encyclopaedic, etc., but if copyright is being violated, they need to go. No actual opinion as I'm not well-versed enough with such things to determine the status of these images. GassyGuy 19:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> With all due respect, I disagree. If fair use were the primary concern, then the choice of action would be to show the image, or to provide a text link from the gallery. This is an AfD, that means the choice of action is to delete the whole article, or to keep it (and possibly to edit it). If we really want to discuss fair use, then as I said before, some images are not even entitled for copyright according to their national laws. For other images, see DGG's comment. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChochopk_5bb4.html" title="User:Chochopk">ChoChoPK</a> (球球PK) (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChochopk_8218.html" title="User talk:Chochopk">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chochopk_7d37.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chochopk">contrib</a>) 23:28, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why do I need to enumerate that for 61 countries? I don't. Here is a series of logical deduction on why it is not necessary, and why I gave these 4 examples
<ul>
<li>As I said before, fair use is not the primary issue here. This is an AfD, it discusses the article as a whole, not individual images.</li>
<li>When Denny raised the issue of copyright, and you, Geni, said the U.S. is about the only country doing so and so, the focus has already diverged from the main focus of the AfD.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, your statement is false regardless what the focus is. I must correct that so that other readers are well informed. --<a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChochopk_5bb4.html" title="User:Chochopk">ChoChoPK</a> (球球PK) (<a href="../../../c/h/o/User_talk%7EChochopk_8218.html" title="User talk:Chochopk">talk</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Chochopk_7d37.html" title="Special:Contributions/Chochopk">contrib</a>) 00:28, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Fair use is the main issue. See if the images are free this kind of thing goes to commons. 4 is a very small number of countries and in any case the NZ one at least is a no derivatives lisence (I assume it in some way comes from uk style crown copyright) which these days is an automtic delete. See the <a href="http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/currency/Money/0114307.html" class="external text" title="http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/currency/Money/0114307.html" rel="nofollow">astrisked section here</a>.<a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGeni_1ef9.html" title="User:Geni">Geni</a> 04:53, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If fair use were <i>the primary</i> issue, then we should discuss the images case by case, or at least, country by country. The result would be to <b>keep, remove the inclusion of the images, or convert to text links, like <a href="../../../e/x/a/Image%7EExample.png_8cd0.html" title="Image:Example.png">Image:Example.png</a></b>. This is an AfD. Therefore, we are discussing whether to <b>keep, or delete <u>the entire article</u></b>.

<li><b>Keep all</b> seems encyclopedic enough; if there's a copyvio suspected send it to the copyvio folks, but I assume that because WP's servers are in the US, that US fair use rules will apply and the biggest gist is whether the use if commercial or displaces the market for the original; now if all these countries started trading images of their coins and bills instead of the real ones perhaps that's an issue, but hasn't made the news that I've heard of. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 06:42, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It has also received very good reviews form various sources. www.rapreviews.com, <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" class="external free" title="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" rel="nofollow">http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006</a>, this one is from the Onion. If artists aren't notable because of low record sales we would have a lot less articles, take a look at the Pixies, Meat Puppets, Ratatat all have smaller record sales (around the time they began) they are all obviously notable. --HiphopisNOTdead 27:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This artist was also apart of Binary Star, who, aside from having album listings on iTunes, have received recognition for their work. S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. is also able to be purchased via iTunes (that is where I bought it from). The deletion of this article would be promoting and justifying the deletion of several other articles on Wikipedia, as is written in the above comments. Also, keep in mind that this article is relatively well put-together. There is an accurate listing of all of the producers, artists, singles etc. Keep this article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Delaguerra09 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Delaguerra09_c857.html" title="Special:Contributions/Delaguerra09">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Reluctant Delete</b> I guess I've appointed myself mother hen of these little, unsourced, Japanese pornograpic actress stubs, and made it a large part of my editing activity to regularly go through the list improving and sourcing them as best I can. When I came across Ms. Kimura last week, I held my breath, hoping to find adequate sourcing and evidence of notability before she got put up for deletion. My own policy is not to start an article on a subject until it is already fairly interesting and adequately-sourced. But, since I usually favor improving over deleting, I do what I can when I find these unsourced stubs started on Japanese erotic actresses.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I like that you've made the criteria <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">human</a>, rather than <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28pornographic_actors%29_a726.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (pornographic actors)">Porn</a>, Aaron. One thing that rubs me the wrong way about so many of these Japanese AV idol AfDs is that they are often strictly held to standards built to conform to the Western (i.e. American) porn culture, which is very different from that in Japan. The clear barrier between "Adult" entertainment and entertainment in general, which exists over here is much less present over there. Simply as Adult Video stars, these AV idols are multi-media celebrities in Japan because of the much higher visibility these videos have in Japan compared to their American counterparts. Additionally, an AV model will sometimes already have mainstream media name recognition before she appears in AVs. And often a model who made her name in AVs will cross into mainstream media.</dd>
<dd>Ms. Kimura appears to be just such a subject. She was originally a ballerina. She is a very new AV star, and 5 DVDs listed on Amazon in such a short time is indicative of the beginnings of a notable AV career in Japan. Of these 5 DVDs released, 1 appears not to be "adult," <s>and I suspect (but this is just a guess) that the 4 "Adult" ones only contain nude modeling.</s> The fact that Takeshi Kitano-- a very major Japanese celebrity, and a celebrity in world cinema-- has chosen her to be in his next film suggests that evidence notability will come. The fact that she has an article started at Japanese Wikipedia is another indication that she has some notability in the country. On the other hand, that article is an unsourced stub.</dd>
<dd>(Also, concerning the Google test-- This has been ruled out as a proof of notability, but since it has been brought up, I will point out that the Google search on her name in Japanese (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%E6%9C%A8%E6%9D%91%E4%BD%B3%E9%A6%99" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%E6%9C%A8%E6%9D%91%E4%BD%B3%E9%A6%99" rel="nofollow">木村佳香</a>) gives "Results 1 - 10 of about 192,000 for 木村佳香")</dd>
<dd>But, all the above taken into consideration, Wikipedia's primary criterion for establishing the notability of humans is, "The person has been a primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works the source of which is independent of the person." I tried, but could find not find this for Ms. Kimura. (The Japanese search did lead me to her homepage, which I've added to the article, as well as several fan/porn sites, but nothing useful as a source.) I strongly suspect that if I were in Japan, I <i>could</i> find evidence of mainstream notability, and I also strongly suspect that such notability standards <i>will</i> be met by Ms. Kimura eventually. Because of this, I will probably save the article in my user space and work on it till it is worth putting on Wikipedia. But, for now, I'll have to reluctantly join in the recommendation for <b>Delete.</b> <a href="../../../d/e/k/User%7EDekkappai_ea03.html" title="User:Dekkappai">Dekkappai</a> 18:51, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I made this article when I still didn't know most of the rules of Wikipedia, so I understand if you delete it, but it is a commonly used term/act of some cultural significance (notice the edits other than my own.) I'm not sure where those of you that say "Delete" are from, or how old you are, but Dip Snap is a generally understood term amongst DC area teens (obviously not the best argument, but it's true.) One thing I can't seem to understand is why this isn't culturally significant enough and individual high schools, subway stations, etc. are... Perhaps I'd change my vote if I could understand this paradox. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines an encyclopedia (the thing which we are all trying to create here) as "a work that contains information on all branches of knowledge." How can we claim to be making an encyclopedia if we leave out certain branches of knowledge? Let it be Science, History or Greater Washington, DC area vernacular, they all have a place in this collection of all the world's knowledge. I apologize for not citing this, but I can't see how I could... To my knowledge, there aren't a whole lot of Doctoral Dissertations written about chewing tobacco culture. Perhaps I could have some help finding citations, rather than just deleting my work without first attempting to help me work on it? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Man13_c397.html" title="User:The Man13">Vint</a> 02:58, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Adding on to my last comment, I have found mention of this action here [<a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/45825/Booyakasha|Metafilter" class="external autonumber" title="http://ask.metafilter.com/45825/Booyakasha|Metafilter" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. Obviously this is just other people, not a citation, but it proves the cultural significance. I also found a passing mention on the description of a portable spittoon here [<a href="http://www.mudjug.com/CopenhagenSmokelessTobacco.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mudjug.com/CopenhagenSmokelessTobacco.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>], will this work as a citation? <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Man13_c397.html" title="User:The Man13">Vint</a> 03:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>You don't have to be a jerk about it, this is supposed to be a civil discussion, and being snooty about it isn't helping anyone. Did you even look at the links I put in the last comment? The article is not about the term Dip Snap, which I admit is a neologism, it is about the act of packing the snuff, the motion and act of which is widely called the dip snap. While the term for it may not be the apt term, I intended to write an article about packing the dip, not the actual term Dip Snap. Urban Dictionary is intended for neologisms, like "STFU" or something like that, not for a description of an act. While I'm not going to change my vote just yet, could we at least agree on an alternative, perhaps moving it to Packing (snuff) or something along those lines? PS There is already a perfectly good entry on Urban Dictionary. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Man13_c397.html" title="User:The Man13">Vint</a> 04:35, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I apologize if you took offense. It wasn't my intent to be insulting. I was merely trying tomake the point that since dip snapping wasn't covered in reliable sources, WP couldn't do an article about it but that you could <a href="../../../t/r/y/WP%7ETRY_d88b.html" title="WP:TRY">write about it elsewhere</a>.

<li>How can one source something like this? In the way that the article is <i>now</i> sourced. There is almost certainly no need even for a merger. Yes, as exemplified by Aviation joke (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Aviation_joke_4ccd.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Aviation joke">AfD discussion</a>), a collection of jokes does not make an encyclopaedia article. The cure for that is to take the serious documentation and discussion of the jokes concerned (which doesn't exist for aviation jokes), and <a href="../../../c/l/e/Wikipedia%7ECleanup_89e0.html" title="Wikipedia:Cleanup">cleanup</a> the article. As with <a href="../../../e/l/e/Elephant_joke.html" title="Elephant joke">Elephant joke</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Elephant_joke_%282nd_nomination%29_5ef0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Elephant joke (2nd nomination)">AfD discussion</a>), this riddle has been studied in detail by both linguists and folklorists, and there is plenty to say on the subject. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 20:09, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but possibly modify, maybe merge into the category. While certainly a film that merely has Nascar playing in the background isn't something that belongs on this list, the genre of auto-racing films is reasonably distinct enough that I would recommend keeping it. There's at least one channel dedicated to automobile racing and it frequently features films that involve racing so I'm satisfied that the genre exists enough to warrant some coverage. See for example: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0760307555&amp;id=nAORx03oRqkC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=uwpbULvSH1&amp;dq=%22Racing+films%22&amp;sig=wgLfm139YvjYTqeDnVe40_89Ais" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0760307555&amp;id=nAORx03oRqkC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;ots=uwpbULvSH1&amp;dq=%22Racing+films%22&amp;sig=wgLfm139YvjYTqeDnVe40_89Ais" rel="nofollow">this book</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, certainly adding a film just for having a biker in it would be a problem, but there are such things as biker movies just as there are movies about auto racing. Take a look at <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Biker+Films%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=%22Biker+Films%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">this</a>. I think that's more than enough to establish that the genre is generally accepted.

<li><b>Keep</b> This is not "loosely-associated". The biker film genre is a well-recognized though small genre. Admittedly, it would be nice to see the article expanded with more info on the genre in general (which I was hoping to get around to myself, though I've been quite busy), but "needs expansion" isn't a good enough reason to delete by itself either. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 05:20, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> The "biker movie" is certainly a genre that deserves an article, but this isn't it. Just because <i>at least one biker appears as a significant plot element</i> in a film doesn't make it a biker movie. Several of the films listed are not biker movies. Probably better to delete this and create a new article about the actual "biker movie" genre.

<p>While I agree that the article is weak, I am finding it difficult to find references to this information. I do believe that Dr. Boraas is one of the leading experts of the Dena'ina language, but am not sure how to prove this. I have added more references, a book which he edited, and included the fact that he is an honorary member of the Kenaitze Indian Tribe. I will create a page for the Kenaitze Indian Tribe if I have time.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Hopefully the article can be kept and the added material may support that.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This seems to be heading for a keep, but I cannot really see the valid distinction between this and other "List of Films involving X, Y or Z" which seem to be heading more readily for deletion. Computers play a central role in our everyday lives these days, whether real or apparent, unlike 20 years ago. By the same token, computers are frequently involved in the plot of films. Films remain "modern" by becoming futuristic. The protagonist and villain in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Terminator_9e8e.html" title="The Terminator">The Terminator</a> series are cyborgs. Gone are the Bank heists by artillery (replaced by cybercrime), break-ins (now replaced by hacking), facial recognition software and wiretapping (replacing dumb security guards' surveillance), communications are now largely electronic (email, chat, blog). I think that arguably, a film such as "<a href="../../../y/o/u/You%27ve_Got_Mail_1c54.html" title="You've Got Mail">You've Got Mail</a>" would also qualify, because there's no email without computers; "<a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrapment_%28film%29.html" title="Entrapment (film)">Entrapment</a>" as it involves hacking into the computer security at the Petronas Tower.... Defined any more precisely, the list would be caught by "loose association". <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 09:53, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think "play a central role in the development of the plot" is pretty tight. Cyborgs are not computers. A movie about a bank heist where the robbers have to get past a computerized security system would not qualify as it is incidental to the plot. I think "You got mail" belongs on this list as it deals with the impact of anonymous e-mail on the protagonist's lives.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 12:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree that the criteria for inclusion are tight, not loose. There are a lot of things that play a role in everyday life (cars, computers, politics, romance, weather) but it is also quite possible to have a film focused on one of these things as a main theme. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:16, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I still maintain that the technology is used in most cases just to set the modern or futuristic context, and is not central to the plot in but a few cases. Let's take the <b>Matrix series</b>, which are arguably about political freedom. The Matrix is a substitute for "Big Brother" in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984_%28film%29.html" title="1984 (film)">1984</a> - the computer therein defines the context because the explosive power of computers was not imaginable by <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">Orwell</a> when he wrote his book. <b><a href="../../../a/2E/i/A.I._%28film%29_613e.html" title="A.I. (film)">A. I.</a></b> is a modern-day <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio.html" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>, and is not really about computers at all, but about human adoptions/emotions, and the dilemma which is posed when a supposedly inanimate object becomes a sentient being. By my recollection, the central subjects of <b><a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurassic_Park_d14a.html" title="Jurassic Park">Jurassic Park</a></b> are genetic engineered dinosaurs, with computers being only a tool in that show, a bit like the computerized security system bank heisters have to get past. I think we may be caught in a debate where it is still possible to confuse the medium with the central subject. Either that, or there may still be some debate as to whether all the films included actually belong on the list. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 02:09, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I don't follow your reasoning. Why would the political symbolic elements of a film like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> totally negate its strong focus on technology? That would be like arguing that <a href="../../../t/e/e/Teen_Wolf_8a30.html" title="Teen Wolf">Teen Wolf</a> doesn't really count as a werewolf film because it really symbolizes puberty. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 04:15, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Au contraire, mon ami. It's the other way around: Why would the setting and context of a film like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> totally negate its central theme, which is political freedom? What about the other films I named as examples? I contend that the problem lies not within the Matrix films, but the whold scope of this list, IMHO. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 06:26, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Plot devices in most fiction are employed to create situations where basic human conditions are explored. Jurassic Park is not about dinosaurs, it's about hubris and greed. It's central subjects are people. <a href="../../../m/o/b/Moby_Dick_3f81.html" title="Moby Dick">Moby Dick</a> is not about whales. Still plot devices are important and it is interesting and appropriate to use them to group fictional works. --<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 11:57, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a>: I'm not saying that <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_9295.html" title="The Matrix">The Matrix</a> couldn't belong on a list of political films too. I'm just saying that having a symbolic theme (politics) doesn't negate the fact that there's a really strong focus on technology throughout the film. In other words, symbolic plot elements are not the only reason to group similar films together. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:36, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> I was torn between the two sides of delete or keep on this one - but you only have to look in the history of the page to note that msot of it is craeted by anonymous users.

<dd>On the other hand if the information is true its an interesting article on race relations in the UK going back to the 1960s.</dd>
<dd>But to be honest its a lot of work to be done in such a short space of time and some of the phrases used are a little inappropriate for an encyclopedia even if they were used in that context. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 12:18, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. This article has potential, but as it stands I don't find it adequately sourced/referenced, and there is that nasty smell of OR.

<li><b>Keep</b>, the Devil has appearead in fiction for thousands of years, and his appearances through the years could be used as a source to understanding religion and literature.

<li><s><b>Keep</b> with some massive reworking of the article. As it stands it reads more like a list of movies/songs/etc that feature the Devil, this should probably be pared down to those that are specifically about the Devil or feature him in a prominent fashion, not those that merely mention him. Additional information from someone knowledgable on the subject should be added to address the topic of the Devil in fiction itself so that this is something more than a mere list.

<li><b>Keep</b> - That the protagonist is disabled is an important thematic element for the films in this list. It's not "trivial" information. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayHenry_e450.html" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> 21:41, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I maintain that the arguments above stating a film with a disabled protagonist implies a common, important thematic element are inherently flawed. <i>IFF</i> the assertion could be made that a disabled protagonist meant that the film would make use of the disability as a major plot element, then I would be willing to concede the point and vote for a keep. However, that kind of assumption cannot be made - just because the protagonist suffers a disability does NOT universally imply that the disability will play an important, or even passing, role in the film. As a case in point, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Matrix_Revolutions_ff92.html" title="The Matrix Revolutions">The Matrix Revolutions</a> is included in this list because the protagonist, Neo, is blinded during the film. Thus this film fits the criteria in that the protagonist is disabled. However the movie does not focus on his blindness, nor does it take a central role in the plot. At best, it only serves to introduce his pseudo-magic powers, and is henceforth a discarded element in the plot. I am not familiar with all the movies in that list, but it is not unreasonable to imagine a movie in which a protagonist suffers some sort of disability that does not however figure prominently, or perhaps at all, in the film's plot. Therefore this list becomes about as useful as a List of films with male protagonists - it is simply an arbitrary list of films with an arbitrary inclusion criterion. I am not at all opposed to a merge with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_about_disability.html" title="List of films about disability">List of films about disability</a>, however, I have to strongly argue against the case for keeping this list as it stants. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 15:46, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> - How people with disabilities are portrayed in literature is certainly a legitimate matter of interest. The Matrix trilogy poses problems for any study since it questions the very meaning of reality. That said, the notion that a blind or deaf person is endowed with compensating superior powers in other realms is a common disability stereotype and The Matrix is arguable a good example. Why, we might ask, did the writer choose that particular injury for a character in a savior role? Anyway, a few difficult cases should not invalidate the validity of a list.--<a href="../../../a/r/n/User%7EArnoldReinhold_8f4c.html" title="User:ArnoldReinhold">agr</a> 16:53, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> - Thank you for elaborating on your position. I'm sure your comparison of this list to List of films with male protagonists must be intended as an exaggeration, but I understand your concern about the inclusion of outliers. Nevertheless, I would argue that while it is <i>possible</i> that a film with a disabled protagonist would not address disability in any way, one would expect that such films would be less usual. Repectfully, I must still disagree. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 01:33, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>&#160;: Regardless of the result of this AfD, our aim should be to turn this and many other film lists into informative articles, with an explanation (or "summary") for each entry, with merges wherever this would help us organize the matterial better and with a cleanup or expansion to justify the title. A mere "Keep" shouldn't indicate that we should have lists that are just substitutes to categories. During this massive AfD, the US Marines list was transformed into a good example of what we could do here too. <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 09:15, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Discounting the single-purpose account comments, and those based on <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> arguments, there seems to be a consensus to keep.

There is no context or sourced analysis offered in the article explaining why 100 or more uses of the word "fuck" in a film is significant either within the works of fiction or in the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:14, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Hmm. It's far better sourced and more strictly defined than most of these "List of movies" articles showing up, so it has that in its favor. However I have to question the usefuless of such an article in an encyclopedia. In spite of the sourcing and rigorous definition it still smacks of arbitrary inclusion rules as well as being nothing more than a list of loosely related topics - those movies really have little in common other than prolific use of the word. Perhaps the top few could warrant a section on the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck.html" title="Fuck">fuck</a> article (if it isn't already, I've not looked).

<li><b>Keep</b>. I see the objections, but the page is well referenced and non-arbitrary (as JuJube indicates).

<ul>
<li>It is arbitrary, because it sets a standard for inclusion with no explanation. Only films with 100 or more uses may be included and the article makes no case for why 100 uses of the word "fuck" is notable enough for inclusion while a film with even one less usage is not. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:34, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, that particular criterion is arbitrary — but that's not an argument for deletion, it's an argument for reconsidering the criterion within the article. The main issue is whether "films that use the word 'fuck' a lot" are noteworthy as a category, and the answer — as indicated by the cited sources in the article — is yes. It's true that 100 uses is an arbitrary line — you could just as easily list the "100 films that use the word 'fuck' most frequently" or something — but the core concept is one that's not arbitrary and even, dare I say it, encyclopedic. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 04:53, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>While I disagree with your conclusion, even if the arbitrariness of inclusion based on the number of uses were not an issue, the article still lacks sourced analysis explaining why the use of the word a great many times is significant and it still amounts to a <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIRdirectory" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIRdirectory</a> tying together films which have no thematic similarity and have nothing in common other than having the word "fuck" in them a lot.

<ul>
<li>No, it's substantially different — because reliable external sources have categorized films by the frequency of their use of the word "fuck". If the article were not sourced, or if the sources were not reliable, your argument might hold water. But the fact that the Family Media Guide and Screen It! Entertainment Reviews have chosen to record this data indicates that it is a meaningful criterion. If there were a noteworthy and reliable index of films with the word "The" in the title, there would be an argument for having Wikipedia articles on those topics as well. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:22, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If it is arbitrary, it isn't very arbitrary, and limiting it to 100 uses within a film is probably based on what can be verified (that is, when it is enough times to make <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> sources count and document the number of uses).

<li>Let me summarize your argument: (1) "a high frequency of 'fuck' is a loose association" (assumption); (2) WP excludes loosely-associated lists (policy); (3) therefore a list of films with a high frequency of 'fuck' should be excluded (conclusion). That's a very nice argument <i>iff</i> you can support the first assumption, which I'm pretty sure WP policy says nothing about. That assumption is you personal opinion and it does no good to keep repeating it <i>over and over</i> again without providing an explanation that justifies the claim that that is indeed a loose association. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>That is the exact definition of "loose association". But what I'm disputing is your assumption that having a high frequency of a certain word use is equivalent to having "little or nothing in common". That's still an assumption, which you have not justified. Also note please that there is a lot more similarity between the top 10 films on thist list than between the top 10 on this list and <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Little_Mermaid_cead.html" title="The Little Mermaid">The Little Mermaid</a></i>. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Where is your rebuttal of the presumption? "No it isn't" is not an argument anywhere outside a Monty Python sketch. As for the top ten films having more in common with each other than with Disney flicks, that's a nonsense argument. The question is not whether the films more closely resemble each other than they do other films. The question is whether they are closely associated enough amongst themselves. And the top ten films are a documentary about the word "fuck," a mockumentary about two beer-drinking headbangers, a drama about an abusive husband, a Mafia crime drama, a fictionalized account of a drug-dealing kidnapper, an adaptation of an Iraqi marine's memoir, a comedy about a pair of hooligan twins, the story of the Son of Sam killings, a Martin Lawrence concert film and the true story of a mob informer. Of those films, exactly two of them share any commonality of theme or plot with each other. Where exactly is the vast reach of commonality that connects these films outside the word "fuck"? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My rebuttal is this: Why do they need to share anything else? There's plenty of published sources on <i>that alone</i>. We should, as WP editors, <i>try</i> to avoid (I realize that sometimes it's inevitable and/or necessary) setting our own (subjective) standards on such things as the strength of association or notability. There are articles about the usage of the word 'fuck' in film (<a href="http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.erenkrantz.com/Humor/SevenDirtyWords.shtml" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), sources whose sole purpose is to document the frequency of usage of various "profane" words (<a href="http://www.familymediaguide.com/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.familymediaguide.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) or who otherwise gather/present such information (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/1998/nil_by_mouth.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.screenit.com/movies/1998/nil_by_mouth.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>)--although why "God", "Jesus", and "Christ" are included as profane words by "<a href="http://www.familymediaguide.com" class="external free" title="http://www.familymediaguide.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.familymediaguide.com</a>" is beyond me. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why do they need to share anything else? Because things that are not in loose association with each other tend to have more than one point of commonality. As for avoiding subjective standards, I agree that's a good thing. Which is why the entirely arbitrary and subjective standard set by this article (100 or more "fuck"s for inclusion) are yet one more insurmountable problem with the article. As for there existing websites and organizations that bean-count dirty words, I have not disputed that such sites exist. The <i>still unanswered</i> point is that within the article there is no <i>sourced analysis</i>. Counting up the number of a specific word in a movie is not <i>sourced analysis</i>. I've asked any number of times for the <i>sourced analysis</i> of the multiple use of the word "fuck" in a movie and you have yet to provide any. Are you conceding that there isn't any? Are you ignoring this repeated request? Is there something else going on? Where is the <i>sourced analysis</i>? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Otto, if reliable sources external to Wikipedia indicate that a single criterion is noteworthy, then it's sufficiently noteworthy for our purposes. Just because there is no sourced analysis of that criterion's significance does not mean that the criterion is arbitrary. If sourced analysis of <i>why</i> a statistic is important were a requirement for all Wikipedia lists, we'd have to delete every page in <a href="../../../s/p/o/Category%7ESports-related_lists_86b3.html" title="Category:Sports-related lists">Category:Sports-related lists</a>.

Similarly, this page has links to organizations that categorize films by the frequency of use of the word "fuck". It may seem arbitrary to <i>you</i>, but the existence of the reliable external sources proves that it's not arbitrary by the standards set by Wikipedia. It might be <i>nice</i> if we had some analysis of <i>why</i> a particular criterion is noteworthy, but the absence of that analysis is not a sufficient justification for deletion. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 05:17, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sports-related lists are not about works of fiction, therefore fall under different guidelines, therefore are not germane to this discussion. And I dispute the notion that because a bean-counting website or two tots up the raw number of f-bombs in a film that makes it notable for our purposes. If a website totaled up the number of ceiling tiles that appeared in a bunch of films, would that confer notability? If it totaled up the number of paper clips in a chain in a bunch of films, would that conver notability? If it totalled up the number of times the word "blue" or "sailboat" or "President Bush" appeared in a film, would that confer notability? No. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:23, 27 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I said elsewhere, I don't see any evidence that the writers of <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> were thinking about almanac-style lists when they called for "sourced analysis". Also, please notice that some of the films on this list, including the <a href="../../../f/u/c/Fuck_%28film%29.html" title="Fuck (film)">#1 entry</a>, are documentaries, not works of fiction, making your attempt at applying <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> even more absurd.<br />
As for notability: notability on Wikipedia is established by what external reliable sources say. So, yes, if a reliable source counted ceiling tiles or the word "sailboat" in films, that might make it notable for Wikipedia's purposes. This seems absurd, but that's because our culture considers ceiling tiles and the word "sailboat" much less notable than the word "fuck" in the context of films. The MPAA doesn't rate films based on the number of ceiling tiles or the word "sailboat", but the use of the word "fuck" is one of their criteria for film ratings. In part because of that criterion, reliable external sources have taken to tallying up the frequency of its use. If it were not notable, the "bean-counting websites" would not exist.

<ul>
<li>Hmm. So counting "sailboats" or "President Bushes" don't get counted because our culture (and which culture is that, exactly? The phrase "Our culture" seems to have systemic bias issues) doesn't consider it the same as "fuck." Yet the lack of cultural context in the article is OK? That seems...flawed as an argument somehow. And, bean counting websites count the word because it's notable, but notability is established by the existence of the bean-counting websites? <a href="../../../c/i/r/Circular_logic.html" title="Circular logic">Circular logic</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:17, 28 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, it's not circular. The beginning is the culture-at-large (and since we're talking about English-language films, it's not systemic bias for us to speak of the common culture of Anglophone nations). As individuals at Wikipedia we cannot and should not attempt to determine what is and is not notable by merely using our own judgments. We can only judge notability based on external criteria, the most important of which is whether notable external sources have written on the subject. Notability flows from the culture (primary source) to external sources (secondary sources) to Wikipedia (tertiary source). POV problems arise when we attempt to judge the culture-at-large directly, unmediated by secondary sources. But if the secondary sources exist and are considered reliable by a consensus of Wikipedians, then they may be interpreted as a reasonable measure of the culture-at-large.<br />
In the context of a <i>list</i>, the question is not "Have notable external sources written essays about <i>why</i> this is important?", but "Have notable external sources catalogued this information?" If we were discussing a hypothetical article on profanity in film, you would be correct in calling for sources analyzing the cultural context. But since this is merely a <b>list</b>, all that is needed to establish notability is the <i>existence</i> of reliable external sources cataloguing the data. —<a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJosiah_Rowe_4f72.html" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> <small>(<a href="../../../j/o/s/User_talk%7EJosiah_Rowe_ba00.html" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Josiah_Rowe_5f31.html" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)</small> 22:40, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Where is the sourced analysis? Simple, it's not there. This is not a concession on my part, as I never asserted that there was any sourced analysis. But consider this. First, lack of analysis is not an inherent flaw of this article, but rather an editing issue. Second, it's a list. How much "sourced analysis" should we really expect?

<li>Please do not misrepresent (or misunderstand if it was in good faith) my words. I didn't question the need to source the article.

<li>And I am not suggesting that these films are not associated by the high frequency of the word "fuck."

I am saying that in the absence of sourced third-party analysis attesting to the significance of the word fuck <i>in the context either of the films, the films in relation to each other or the real world</i> the list is untenable. I have asked a number of times how various films on this list are rendered similar by the repeated "fuck"s. No answer to that question. I've offered examples of several other potential lists of films and of other objects which would not stand under Wikipedia guidelines and asked how this list differs from those. No answer. I've asked for a source which offers analysis of the repetition of the word within the films, between the films or in the real world. None has been offered beyond bean-counting profanity watchdog sites who count words but don't analyze them. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>How they've been "rendered similar by the repeated 'fuck's"? That itself is one similarity! Also, as I just noted above, these films are much more similar to each other than any one of them is to, for instance, <i><a href="../../../b/e/a/Beauty_and_the_Beast_7278.html" title="Beauty and the Beast">Beauty and the Beast</a></i> or <i><a href="../../../c/i/n/Cinderella.html" title="Cinderella">Cinderella</a></i> (unless they've put out a new version that I'm unaware of). How could this be significant to anyone? How about considering it in the context of the increasing commonality/acceptance of profanity on televsion? Given that there are multiple sources which document this, I don't see what the problem is <i>in terms of policy</i>. Yes, you view this as a "loose" association.

<li>OK, let's consider the topic in terms of the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television. What does the article say about the number of times the word fuck is in a <i>theatrical</i> film and the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television... Huh. The article doesn't seem to say <i>anything</i> about the use of the word fuck in theatrical films and the increasing commonality and acceptance of profanity on television! In fact, the article doesn't say <i>anything at all</i> about the use of the word "fuck" <i>anywhere</i>, other than listing off times that it happens. Well, you know, all sorts of things happen. They happen even more frequently than "fuck" does in a film and there aren't Wikipedia articles about them. Which, even if you somehow can't grasp number of "fuck"s in a film is a loose association, the article, as I have noted a number of times with no rebuttal, is completely free of any context as to why "fuck" in a film is important. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:36, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>That Wikipedia might never be finished is not an excuse for retaining articles which do not meet Wikipedia policies or guidelines.

<li>I agree with your first sentence, but find it irrelevant in this case. Just because I don't agree with you does not mean my refutation is a "nuh uh!" (please see <a href="../../../t/r/u/WP%7ETRUTH_309e.html" title="WP:TRUTH">WP:TRUTH</a>). My refutation of your charge of violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> has been to demand proof that this constitutes a "loose association", which you have not furnished to my satisfaction (I ask again: how does a <i>list</i> whose subject has been extensively covered in outside sources and which 2 commonalities--films and frequency of 'fuck's--qualify as "loose association"?). As for <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, huh?? Exactly what is the POV that is being advanced? Pro-100ism vs. Anti-99ism?

Lastly, regarding <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a>. I read through the guideline and it does not seem to say anything that would be applicable in this case. This article does not deal with "Major characters", "Minor characters", or "Plot summaries". In addiiton, while the plot of the films is fictional and the characters are fictional (usually), the frequency of the use of a word in the dialogue (a published text) is not factual. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 05:23, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The POV that's being advanced is that 100 uses of the word is significant while fewer uses of the word is not. There is no rational basis for that assertion (unless you can point to some reliable source that supports the notion that triple digits is significant but double digits isn't). And your constant "proveitproveitproveit" which in my opinion (which under the humorous essay <a href="../../../t/r/u/WP%7ETRUTH_309e.html" title="WP:TRUTH">WP:TRUTH</a> is every bit as true as yours) amounts to little more than "nuh uh." I have explained by analogy. I have explained that the films share no elements of plot, style or setting in the majority of cases. I have shown that these items have nothing in common other than the presence of a word (and yes, that they are films, which, duh, it's a list of films). I'm at a loss as to how much looser an association between these items can possibly be.</li>
<li>I agree with Black Falcon — there's nothing at <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> that applies to an almanac-style list of this type. Also, Otto's repitition of "100 is an arbitrary number" is becoming tiresome — the same could be said of <i>any</i> almanac-style list with an arbitrary cut-off point, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_highest-grossing_films.html" title="List of highest-grossing films">List of highest-grossing films</a> (why the top 50?) or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_National_Football_League_quarterbacks_who_have_thrown_at_least_100_career_touchdowns_f2c6.html" title="List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns">List of National Football League quarterbacks who have thrown at least 100 career touchdowns</a> (it's right there in the title).

<li>True, but how has it so far been established that the list "does not conform to policy"? That's a rhetorical question, by the way. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:59, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well, so far I've offered examples of films from the list that have no relation to each other besides using the word a lot and there's been no refutation of it other than your saying "that doesn't prove anything" without offering up the slightest counter-argument. I've offered several examples of lists both concerning films and things outside of films which are as loose of an association as this list is and there's been no refutation of that at all. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:49, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You have reiterated your opinion that the frequency of the word's usage is a "loose" association without actually justifying this opinion. Your statements assume <i>a priori</i> that this is a loose association, whereas what they should do is <i>reach this conclusion</i> (which justifies deletion) based on an initial set of premises. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:37, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The premise is, <i>look at the articles for the films</i>. Look at the plots, the themes, the settings. Do they share anything in common outside the word "fuck"? Your own top ten challenge shows exactly how loose the association is. Of the top ten films on the list, exactly two of them share any measure of plot, setting or theme, Goodfellas and Casino. None of the others bear any resemblance to those films or to each other. The films are the premise and the conclusion is they are not related to each other. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:27, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I ask again: why do they need to share anything besides the frequent of use the word 'fuck'? There is plenty of published material on that narrow subject alone. Please see my response above. Also, for the sake of brevity, I suggest we confine any further comments to one place as it's somewhat pointless to repeat similar points in three separate places in the article (and also out of consideration for the closing admin). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And I answer again, because the fact that the films have the word "fuck" in them a lot tells us nothing about the films, their relationship to each other, the use of the word "fuck" in films, or the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:24, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Of course this word is more notable than words such as "bathroom" or even "shit" given its controversial status and its unofficial classification as one of the worst swear words out there. Also, I'm constantly hearing about how "blank film has the most f-words ever" in the media and its useful to have an actual list to reference these claims. Furthermore, this list is <i>much</i> better organized and sourced then the majority of movie-related lists on Wikipedia.

<li>Everyone knows what "most frequently" means as it pertains to the top film in the list. Now extend the list, and these are obviously the films that most frequently use "fuck". "Most frequently" has nothing to do with the cut-off number, which is 100 in this case, because anyone would rightly say that these are the films that most frequently use "fuck". The cut-off number does require POV established by consensus, but it's not a problem with this particular list; it's a problem inherent in all unbounded lists in general.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. As someone who watches and recommends movies to other people, the use of the word "fuck" seems to have gotten into ridiculous levels. I find this list extremely useful as a tool to inform people who would like to know about a certain movie. I can explain to them that this movie has X number times using the term and let them have a good reason to see or not see this movie. I frequently hear about how one movie has the most f words in it but this list does well with sources to actually back it up. I think Otto is just a little too hardcore here and needs to take a vacation. I also like it as a monument to the illiteracy of Hollywood screenwriters these days. -- A S Williams</li>

<li>Obviously, the word <i>fuck</i> is different from random other words (including other swearing and sexual slang), given the controversy that surrounds it.</li>
<li>Excessive usage of the word <i>fuck</i> in specific movies is often mentioned in reviews/reports, showing the notability of the subject.</li>
<li>A clearly defined cut-off (100 in this case) narrows the scope of the article, making it easier to maintain and sets it apart from what are often called "indiscriminate lists". As also explained above, many lists naming the top XXXX of something on Wikipedia use an arbitrary cut-off. This is not original research, but only a way to keep the maintenance and size of such articles under control.</li>
<li>The main argument in all previous AfDs was sourcing. It is properly sourced now for a long time, making all information verifiable.</li>
<li>Articles likes this are <i>exactly</i> what makes Wikipedia different from other encyclopedias (NOT:PAPER).</li>

<li>Loosely-associated topics are ones which are connected through incidental similarities. Apples, fire trucks and red giant suns are all red, but beyond the coincidence of color they share no similarities which would warrant including them together on an encyclopedic list. A film about the French Revolution has nothing in common with Friday the 13th just because both involve scenes of decapitation, but this list would lump such films together based solely on that one commonality.

<li>I think you answered your own question. The fashion of death they portray is something they have in common.

<li>Yes, the manner of death of a character is what they have in common. That is <i>all</i> they have in common. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Evil_Dead_77ff.html" title="The Evil Dead">The Evil Dead</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/Mighty_Morphin%27_Power_Rangers%7E_The_Movie_2372.html" title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie">Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: The Movie</a> other than they both have a death scene involving dismemberment (which, by the way, I question that MMPR has any "gory" death scenes at all) and this one trivial intersection makes the list an improper loose association. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gremlins_2.html" title="Gremlins 2">Gremlins 2</a> and <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Soldier_3195.html" title="Universal Soldier">Universal Soldier</a> other than a "death by blendering" (which, U.S. was a "wood chippering" so that's even less commonality) which makes the list an improper loose association. There is no commonality between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a> and <a href="../../../j/a/w/Jaws_2.html" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a> beyond that each has a character who burns to death, making listing them together an improper loose association.

<li>You are taking a very broad interpretation of <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a>. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> is for lists of loosely-associated "quotations, aphorisms, or persons", phonebooks, and business directories. Only the first one <i>might</i> (note my emphasis) be applicable. Note that all of your examples are of the type "no commonality ... other than". Other than suggests that there is a commonality. Whether that commonality is sufficient is a different matter. You believe it's not; I believe it is. Obviously those editors who created and edited this article believe it is. You or I may not find the association interesting enough so that it isn't "loose", but that does not imply that it is an inherently loose association. Rather it is a reflection of our personal preferences. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 23:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The exact wording is "<b>Lists or repositories of loosely associated topics</b> <i>such as</i> quotations, aphorisms, or persons (real or fictional)." (italics added, bold in original). These are <i>examples</i> of loosely-associated topics, not an exhaustive list of them. This is a list of loosely-associated topics, and if you don't think that the association of the <i>films</i> qualifies under the policy then it certainly does as a losse association of fictional characters who have nothing in common but mode of death. And the strength of the association has nothing to do with whether the associated items are "interesting." I have not said one word about whether this list is "interesting" or not as <a href="../../../i/n/t/WP%7EINTERESTING_6e23.html" title="WP:INTERESTING">WP:INTERESTING</a> is not a valid argument for inclusion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:25, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

How can you prove it? My point is that the fact that you think it is "loose" is only your interpretation resulting, in my opinion, from your lack of interest in the association. "Interesting" is not a valid reason for inclusion, but "Uninteresting" is not a valid reason for deletion. If the consensus view is that the association is indeed "loose", then alright. But as long as it is the opinion of just a few editors, I think it ought to be kept and improved. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:02, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have offered a number of examples of how this is a loose association. I have offered multiple combinations of films included on the list and asked what they have in common other than a character dying a certain way. No one has offered up anything to refute the notion that the examples are anything other than loosely associated. And I have not suggested either that this list is uninterested or that the level of interest in the list is a reason for deleting it. Now. Can you explain how the films listed here are not a loose association or not? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:06, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You have offered multiple combinations of films that are associated only by a character dying a certain way. You asked what they have in common other than this? The simple answer is: nothing (at least that I know of)! However, this is not proof of "loose association". You are assuming <i>a priori</i> that "a character dying a certain way" is a loose association. That is only an assumption. Only once that assumption is accepted, is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> applicable. However, I dispute that assumption, and thus think it should be kept. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:56, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

There is an association/commonality between the films, which you (for whatever reason) don't like and don't seem to think is sufficient.

Anyway, yes, things on a list should generally have more than one thing in common to be retained here. Bananas, canaries, some diamonds and the Sun are all yellow, but List of yellow things would be deleted as a loose association. Films that share no elements of plot, theme, setting, time period or style, but have in common a particular method of killing a character (but even that's not really a common feature since even within the subsets of death types there is a wide variety of implements and manners of death), are similarly lossely associated. I don't think it's the slightest bit unreasonable to expect that a listing of films have something more in common than a few feet of footage depicting a similar thing. We would not have List of films with shoes in them or List of films that show bunny rabbits or any other of a wide variety of unrelated loose associations and this one is no better. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:32, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

As for my argument, they blend together, do they? I have a hard time seeing how one object can blend "together" with itself. My argument from the start has been that the association is not "loose", thus rejecting the basis of your nomination. The number of associations is not as relevant as the <i>nature</i> of the association(s). List of yellow things that are round, weigh less than 1kg, edible, and can be penetrated by a butter knife is not an improvement over List of yellow things even though the former has 5 associations versus the latter's 1. You think this association is loose? Fine, that's your personal preference. I don't consider it loose. Yes, the article needs significant improvement (specific criteria, additional information on the films, better sourcing, etc.), but I disagree that the concept itself is fundamentally flawed. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:51, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Resetting indent.</b> Fine, even if you reject the idea of the number of associations in favor of the quality, which is a mistake, the quality ofg the associations here is also poor, as I've pointed out several times. <a href="../../../a/p/o/Apocalypto.html" title="Apocalypto">Apocalypto</a> and <a href="../../../i/_/s/I_Spit_on_Your_Grave_653e.html" title="I Spit on Your Grave">I Spit on Your Grave</a>. They are associated only by the "death by violent organe removal" scene. But what does knowing that both of these films have "violent organ removal" tell us about either film or about the films in relation to each other? The former is a high-budget prestige project about the final days of the Mayan civilization. The other is a low-budget exploitation-style film about a woman avenging her rape. What kind of quality association do these films have with each other? <a href="../../../f/a/r/Fargo_%28film%29.html" title="Fargo (film)">Fargo</a> is a critically-acclaimed Academy Award-winning black comedy about a heavily pregnant sheriff investigating murder and blackmail. <a href="../../../u/n/i/Universal_Soldier_%281992_film%29_ad02.html" title="Universal Soldier (1992 film)">Universal Soldier</a> is a science fiction/action film about Vietnam soldiers who are cryonically frozen, mindwiped and unleashed as super-cyborgs. Where is the high-quality association between those films, despite each having a scene where a man gets fed through a woodchipper? <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Day_After_e65b.html" title="The Day After">The Day After</a> has a scene of unnamed extras burning to death in a nuclear explosion in Kansas in the 1980s. The quality association with <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Sherlock_Holmes_8470.html" title="Young Sherlock Holmes">Young Sherlock Holmes</a>, in which young women are burned to death by hot wax or oil during the Victorian era, is what exactly? None. None of these films has any association with each other, from either a quantitative or a qualitative standpoint, beyond a death by a similar method, and even that one similarity in many or most cases don't even match up. No similarities, no commonalities, loose association, bad list. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 23:05, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><small>I hope you don't mind--I'm capitalizing the "Resetting indent" part of your comment so that it's easier to find and distinguish.</small> I understand your points and will readily admit that the association that exists between the movies is not among the <i>most</i> relevant or significant (I disagree, however, with the idea that it is irrelevant or insiginificant). However, consider this. <a href="../../../h/e/n/Henry_Antchouet_da7b.html" title="Henry Antchouet">Henry Antchouet</a> is a Gabonese football attacker. <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jono_Bacon_6fbd.html" title="Jono Bacon">Jono Bacon</a> is a writer and software developer based in the United Kingdom.

Does this mean that the "by birth" categories are based on a "loose association"? Of course not. You ask for sources that demonstrate the cultural significance of "gory deaths".

<li>Well, if there are so many other indexes of gory deaths on the web, this one is hardly necessary, is it? And a cursory look at a few of the things your google searches turned up doesn't seem to indicate that they are analyses of the cultural significance of gory death scenes in films. But since I never suggested that there wasn't interest in the topic, your point isn't really that relevant. As far as the "by birth" categories, my understanding is that they are maintined in some measure for legal reasons because of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. But of course you know that the existence of that series of <i>categories</i> has absolutely nothing to do with the existence of this <i>article</i> so I'm not sure why you even brought them up. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 01:44, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I brought in the analogy to illustrate the point that two entries can be categorized/listed together even if they share only <i>one</i> commonality. As regards your first point about the necessity of the list, I will give three replies. First, the online directors of gory deaths are indexes of deaths by movie or deaths by actress (not deaths by type, which is the case here). Second, in addition to indexes of gory deaths, there are <i>articles</i> which address the subject. Third, ... almost everything on Wikipedia is taken from online sources. If we follow the principle of "why write on it if it's already on the web?", we'd need to eliminate all but a few hundred or few thousand WP articles which exclusively use book sources. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 02:55, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Categories and lists serve different purposes and are subject to different rules and guidelines. Things that would not survive as lists routinely exist as categories because of the differences in the two organizationsl systems. Citing a category tree as support for a list article, especially when the category tree may be maintained for specific legal reasons, is a poor analogy. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:06, 26 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>OK, granted, the analogy may not have been a particularly good one (I thought it applicable because the basic purpose of categories and lists is essentially the same--to organize information/entries), especially if what you say about issues of legality is true (I'm not doubting your honesty, it just is obvious from your comment that you yourself are not entirely certain). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 04:31, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> With a cleanup and proper guidelines.--Tenka Muteki 08:32, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, maybe split, definitely rename to something more accurate and more encyclopedic (like List of films categorized by unnatural methods of death). <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_a828.html" title="User:BD2412"><font style="background:gold"><i><b>bd2412</b></i></font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_4cc0.html" title="User talk:BD2412"><b>T</b></a> 12:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> per all the reasons already given, plus this is a highly-detailed, information-packed, well-organized list that could not easily be replaced with a category. Gore-hounds are extremely interested in just this information, making it of cultural significance. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article is useful for categorising and/or listing films notable for gory and cruel death scenes. This, coupled with the manner of death in question, speeds research into various modes of violence used the splatter/horror/ultra violent genre. However I agree the article needs some guidelines in the nature of what to include and where -- it is too easy to degenerate into a "cool list of splatter scenes". --<a href="../../../j/q/u/User%7EJquarry_fa2e.html" title="User:Jquarry">Jquarry</a> 05:08, 27 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Possibly split, criteria would be useful too.

<li>I never said that something involving film theory can't be encyclopedic. Please stop making things up. Clearly, film theory is an encyclopedic topic; however, Wikipedia editors should not be the ones theorizing.

<li>You're missing the point. Whether or not the age difference is significant to the plot is not the point of contention. The point of contention is that the listed movies have nothing in common with each other beyond the inclusion of a relationship with a difference in ages, and that the article contains no information to suggest why the difference in ages is significant or what standard is used to determine whether an age difference is wide enough to warrant inclusion. Is a relationship between a 60 year old and a 40 year old likely to be met with the same societal reaction as a relationship between a 35 year old and a 15 year old? If not, then what do films involving such age gaps have in common with each other that warrants listing them together? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:11, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Yes, for example, when the film's plot is based around that societal dissaproval.

<li>Take a look at some of the articles for <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_%28TV_series%29_e274.html" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a> episodes and then tell me again about how it's so "totally obvious" that editors watching TV shows or films can conclude what happened simply from watching. Two people watching the same exact film or TV episode can come to diametrically opposite conclusions about what happened and what it means when it's a question of supposed pure fact. I am flummoxed that you would suggest that on a matter of subjective interpretation that editors observing the primary source and concluding that the source illustrates a "May-December romance" can be done across the board without involving POV judgment calls. I've already offered one such example (which you have not answered), the film Maurice. Someone added it to the list based on the supposed (unsourced) age difference between Maurice and Alec; however, I don't recall a single suggestion from the book or the film that either the characters or the author thought that anyone outside the relationship would look at it and disapprove because of the age difference. What one editor decides that in her mind is "totally obvious" is not necessarily so "totally obvious" to another editor, and including something in an article with the source of "totally obvious" can't be anything but POV and OR. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 21:54, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>What you are saying isn't what I meant. "Totally obvious" plot points are ones that don't start edit wars. Furthermore, those controversies on the <a href="../../../h/e/r/Heroes_%28TV_series%29_e274.html" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a> episodes all involve interpreted elements such as whether <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Mendez_2543.html" title="Isaac Mendez">Isaac Mendez</a> truly needed heroin in order to paint the future, not obvious plot points such as <a href="../../../m/a/t/Matt_Parkman_907a.html" title="Matt Parkman">Matt Parkman</a> being a police officer. If it provokes a lot of argument, then it isn't obvious. If it doesn't provoke much argument, then it is obvious. Disputes can and do arise when books are being interpreted instead of cited too, but that doesn't mean that books aren't suitable sources on articles about themselves. Fixing problems with an article can and should be done instead of deletion. On these many film lists you've nominated, I'm tired of hearing that the film list can never be verified because you found a few errors in it. By that reasoning, every article in Wikipedia that gets vandalized should immediately be put in AfD. Please try to argue according to the <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a>. When so many people think your reasoning is flawed on about three-fourths of these AfDs you've started, mainly its because you tend to bring up all sorts of small flaws and nitpicky issues that are editing concerns more than deletion concerns. It would really help if you read <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> and applied it when you argue in AfDs. More people would likely see your points that way, and also you'd recognize more easily when an AfD nomination would get seen as frivolous, and avoid all this arguing. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 00:29, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Well actually, one of the recent edit wars that broke out was over whether Peter used TK to stop a taser dart or whether he slowed time. Right there on the screen and both sides believed that their interpretation was "totally obvious." And of course books can be cited for factual answers from the text. They can't be cited to support an editor's <i>interpretation</i> of the text. Saying that "it's totally obvious" that an age gap in a film is likely to risk societal disapproval by citing the film itself rather than a reliable secondary source is POV and OR and is not allowed. I'm sorry to hear that you're tired of hearing that the film list can't be verified, but since that has not been my argument I can't imagine where you've been hearing it. You might do better to criticise things that I've <i>actually</i> said rather than making things up and decrying me for them. Your claim that I am not citing Wikipedia policy is a lie. I have cited policy. And it's not really my problem if you or some other editor decide to look upon this as a frivolous nomination, and it's not really my problem if you decide to dismiss <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> and other policies and guidelines as "nitpicky." I see your responses to my arguments as frivolous, not to mention patronizing, and perhaps motivated by something other than a desire to discuss the actual issues, but then I suppose that's not your problem either. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:44, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The first sentence in your above statement doesn't prove your point, because it is a debatable issue. That the dart was stopped is an obvious plot point, but how it was stopped (unless a narrator or character actually says how) is inherently open to interpretation. Furthermore, I'm not claiming that you never cite Wikipedia policy. You usually have some sort of nod to policy in the canned phrase that you typically used on most of these mass AfD nominations, but then (except on those articles where the policy concern cited really applied) you typically have a flood of editors who agree that the policy you've cited simply doesn't apply to that article, at which point you tend to bring up every little flaw the article has or could have in the future, flaws that are not deletion criteria themselves, and then you try to argue that the article should be deleted on the basis of those flaws. The most obvious point raised in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> is that normal editing concerns are not deletion criteria. That's why I keep telling you to stick to deletion criteria and use <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia deletion policy</a> instead of your personal dislikes. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 18:10, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, you can <i>say</i> that I'm not quoting policy as many times as you want, and it doesn't become any more true for saying it. As for the dart stoppage, that it was stopped is observable. <i>How</i> it was stopped (absent a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a>) is POV and OR. Similarly, that an age gap exists may be (although is not always) observable. The <i>risk of societal disapproval</i> of the couple because of that age gap, absent a reliable source, is POV and OR. And in any number of cases the age gap is itself a matter of POV or OR. Very few films give ages for their characters. Deciding that the creators of the film intended an age gap absent a reliable source may itself constitute POV or OR. As for your misrepresentation of my actions during these nominations, well, I've already advised you of the regard in ahich I hold your distortions so there's not much need to repeat that here. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:07, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>In this case, though, I think Mermaid is speaking in terms of the movies in which ages <i>are</i> given, and the gap is brought into question or at least mentioned. In this case, it's neither POV nor OR, since it's a part of the plot. Just saying that it's rare doesn't say to me that it's negligible. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKing_Zeal_c0bd.html" title="User:King Zeal">King Zeal</a> 20:19, 1 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>If the age gap is never mentioned in the film, and the risk of societal disapproval is never mentioned, then it's not going to be obvious and my point about cases in which it was obvious wouldn't apply, of course. If it's a matter of any controversy, then people will be required to introduce citations from movie reviews and film theory books, or their additions will get deleted. That process is called cleanup, and it happens with nearly every Wikipedia article.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Well-defined list, useful for a discussion of the perception of mental illness in society. And because it is divided by disorder, it would be difficult to duplicate with a category. However, the list should be limited to situations where mental illness is a major part of the story, not just films that have a mentally ill character somewhere in them. The other option would be for someone to move each sub-list to the article on each type of mental disorder. <a href="../../../c/r/y/User%7ECrypticfirefly_6711.html" title="User:Crypticfirefly">Crypticfirefly</a> 06:03, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Although I have edited the list numerous times myself, I must vote to delete. It is not maintainable. People will always insert POV and OR into the list. The list is not well defined at all. Inclusion criteria have not been clearly established and really cannot be. Most films have some characters who appear to qualify for a mental illness. Does the article define mental illness? Does it say it should only include characters presented as having been diagnosed with specific mental illnesses? Not at all. <a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoczilla_1c36.html" title="User:Doczilla">Doczilla</a> 08:48, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The list looks better than most of these "List of movies" articles, as the movies listed actually seem to deal with mental illnesses as a major theme, at least as far as I am familiar with the films listed.

<li><b>Comment</b> to those who want this list kept because it is "well-defined": How well-defined the list is is not under contention. The list could be the most perfectly-defined list in the world and that definition does not address the assertion of the nomination that the subjects of the list are too loosely associated. Yes, all of the listed films have a mentally ill character. That is <i>all</i> that the listed films have in common. They do not otherwise share sufficient similarity to warrant being listed together. There has been no refutation of that assertion. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:39, 25 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply/Rebuttal</b>. Actually, if you look more closely at the list, that is not what they have in common. What they have in common is mental illness as a major plot theme or plot device. These are not movies that feature a mentally ill person in a bed while the camera is panning through a hospital hallway. In all of these movies, at least one of the main characters is mentally ill and the storyline is largely driven by the presence and/or characteristics of this mental illness. Your assertion "they do not ... share sufficient similarity to warrant being listed together" is your opinion, but I respectfully disagree. That a film's plot focuses on and/or revolves around the presence/characteristics of a mental illness is <i>more than enough</i> association. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 03:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Just looking at one subset of the list, that of AIDS-related dementia. I haven't seen The Hours so I can't comment on it, but "Philadelphia" does not hinge on any character's having AIDS-related dementia. The character doesn't get fired for having AIDS-related dementia, the plot is not advanced by his having AIDS-related dementia, there is IIRC no mention of AIDS-related dementia until very late in the film. "Angels in America" similarly does not feature a charatcer with AIDS-related dementia. The character has what are apparently divinely-inspired visions. Even if, though, both characters did indeed have AIDS-related dementia, the films are so diverse that listed them together as "films featuring mental illness" is ludicrous. Neither film features mental illness. They aren't about the characters dealing with mental illness. The stories are completely divergent in plot, development and tone. One is about a lawyer suing over AIDS discrimination. The other is about a man being used as an instrument of the Almighty. An article on how AIDS has been presented on film would be very encyclopedic and I would be very interested in reading it. A mishmash list of films thrown together because they's got the AIDS in 'em or any other illness (mental or otherwise) is garbage. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 14:52, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> if one film (or a few films) have been listed erroneously, then delete them from the list!

<li><b>Comment</b>. If there are films on the list that do not belong, please go ahead and remove them. However, you make a <a href="../../../h/a/s/Hasty_generalization.html" title="Hasty generalization">hasty generalization</a> to condem the whole list. Consider the films: <i>Rain Man</i>, <i>50 First Dates</i>, and <i>Radio</i>. Do you really intend to argue that these films don't feature mental illness? That they aren't about characters dealing with mental illness? That the entire storyline is based on the existence and/or characteristics of the illness? That the plots of those films could exist in the absence of the illness? If it will satisfy your concerns, I can modify the list as per User:Saberwyn/Films featuring the United States Marine Corps (adding additional information to the list, imposing stringent inclusion guidelines--actually, the latter should be done in any case if the list is kept). However, I suspect that you object to the entire premise of the list itself and are not willing to accept any modification or improvement as sufficient. I would be most happy to discover myself in error in this case, so please correct me if I'm wrong. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 18:57, 25 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The problem is that you are looking it from the point of view of the movies - look at it from the point of view of the car. If you are a classic car owner/enthusiast/restorer then it's very relevent to be able to find a list of movies where these cars can be found. It's at least as relevent as a list of all of the movies a particular actor has appeared in. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 18:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>You bring up a valid point in that it's no worse than the lists of movies by a particular actor. I would contend that those too are arbitrary lists of loosely related topics. In any case, it might be relevant to a Mini enthusiast to find a list of movies that show a Mini in them, but that's not what Wikipedia is for - it's an encyclopedia, not an almanac or catch-all reference guide. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 19:02, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I object to this mass nomination, but support deletion of this list. <i>This</i> is what I would call a loose association. The mere fact that the protagonist dies says nothing about the movie. It could be a comedy, it could be a tragedy. It could be a biography of a long and happy life.

<dd>It is not my intention, in nominating these sorts of garbage dump articles, to make life more dificult for people who monitor articles which attract this kind of pop culture crap. However, unless the culture of Wikipedia changes so that both indiscriminate "in pop culture" sections in articles and "in pop culture" articles are both consdered unacceptable, this sort of crap will be perpetuated. If you don;t want this crap in its own article or in the main article, then take a stand in this and similar AFDs to send the message that it is not wanted anywhere on WP. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> This is a widely used icon in fiction, so there is nothing indiscriminate about listing those works where it plays a part. The article is well referenced. And I am not imporessed to agree with you by your arguing with each person who disagrees with you. You just keep repeating the same arguments. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 14:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't you think that scope makes it indiscriminate? Look at the example for <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Treasure_%28film%29_a425.html" title="National Treasure (film)">National Treasure</a></i>: "Brief view in an intro shot of New York City." This implies that the Statue plays as insignificant a part as it can in the movie, merely because it happens to be in the city it is set. The article is not well-referenced. Look how many {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}'s there are. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 19:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> with improvements. I'm certain more could be said about the topic itself - the use of the Statue in pop culture - and less emphasis on an exhaustive list of appearances. In particular the summary descriptions of each appearance creates a bloated article and those should be heavily pared down. But again, more work on making this an article <i>about</i> the Statue in pop culture and less a list of appearances, and this will be a much more encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I have noted in at least two other of these AFDs in response to similar comments, a mass nomination of these articles would have been extremely impractical. Trying to talk about 20-some articles nominated together would result in chaos and confusion and would undoubtedly lead to a closure with instruction to re-nominate individually. These nominations seem to be going smoothly enough, not sure what the grounds for complaint about them is. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do agree that a mass nomination of &gt;20 articles would be confusing, but nomination of 3-5 related articles (as the arguments against all are essentially the same) would cut down on the number of separate debates where separate and/or distinct points may be raised. In any case, my main complaint is not the separate nominations, but the blanket application of the "indiscriminate" criticism (that is, of course, your prerogative and I don't think it was in bad-faith; I simply disagree). I voted to delete in a number of cases based on "loose association", voted to delete in a number of cases based on other reasons, and voted to keep in a number of cases because I did not think the criticisms were applicable and/or grounds for deletion (vs. improvement). -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:33, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Indiscriminate" was not blanket-applied to all of the nominations. No single criterion was applied to every one of the nominations, as various of the articles present different issues. I recently mass-nominated around seven or eight articles for million-dollar winners from Who Wants to be a Millionaire and the nomination was shut down because it was a group nom. I can't think of a group of articles that are much more closely related than those, but they were considered too diverse to consider together. I did not want to go through the hassle of mass-nominating the articles only to have to repeat the work after it got shut down. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:41, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can certainly understand your desire to avoid a mass nom. In all fairness, you <i>did</i> provide different comments for each nomination. However, there was also a significant degree of similarity between a number of the nominations (for example, a dozen of them (+/- a few) started out by citing <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#DIR" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#DIR</a> and then stating that "a list of every time X has appeared in a film is indiscriminate"). In any case, I agree that <i>this</i> article deserves to be deleted; my comment was to express my frustration with some of the other nominations. However, it is still your prerogative as the nominator whether you do them together or separately.

<li>I don't mind that they were nominated for deletion separately - I actually prefer it that way. However, the canned statements at the beginning made it look like <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> hadn't considered each article's problems and merits individually, and had just been impatient to sweep them all out of the way. However, it only looked like that to people who knew how many substantially identical AfDs were being launched with that same canned statement. To the casual debate participant, it might have appeared as if <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s canned statement was not canned.

<li>I agree that ad hominem arguments are inappropriate, but that comment was not the gist of Docu's argument. Rather, it was an afternote to his main argument. It does, however, raise some concern that you nominated this for AfD <i>two minutes</i> after the "twist ending" article. That is hardly enough time to consider the merits of an article. Granted, maybe you looked them all over beforehand and then proceeded to nominate them for deletion. However, if the same criticism(s) are going to be applied to all of the articles, then a bundled nomination (or at least, a few bundled nominations of a couple articles each) would have been appropriate. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 22:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>As I noted in other AFDs, a mass nomination of 20-some articles would create chaos and would result in no consensus being reached and the nomination being closed with an instruction to renominate individually. Even smaller groupings are likely to be shut down, as recent grouped nominations of Amazing Race contestants and Millionaire contestants were shut down for being too unrelated to each other. And frankly it's not like any of these articles are so in-depth that they require vast amounts of time to consider. This article is a list of about 40 names. How long does it take to read that and come to a conclusion about it? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:50, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It doesn't take long to read and judge this list as being of high/low quality (seconds at most), but it does take more time to consider whether the topic itself has merit or if the article can potentially be refocused/improved. Perhaps you consider such lists/articles (no matter how they're written) to be <i>inherently</i> unencyclopedic (even if its, for example, "films about the USMC"). If that is the case, then I understand your fast-paced nominations, but I disagree strongly with that notion. It is not indiscriminate to group films by their primary subject of focus or the use of an object or characteristic as a major plot theme. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 01:07, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>And while I do respect that a single mass nomination would have been even worse, so many nominations at once is still a concern to me.

<li>I am a very concerned WP Films member, especially on film lists issues. I am not a "deletionist" as such. However, Otto4711's move is having a very positive effect. Our lists have to be developed into useful articles, or should give their place to some category. The current AfD has brought out this issue and already solutions are being worked out. Please note that the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_years_in_film.html" title="List of years in film">List of years in film</a>, which was innitially just a navigation to a series of lists, had grown into an indiscriminate POV collection of films. So at one point it was nominated for AfD. During the AfD discussion, an editor was motivated to start developing it into something very useful. It's still under development, so please notice how it evolved (up to the 1930s) and how it looked berofe (1940s on). <a href="../../../h/o/v/User%7EHoverfish_6f42.html" title="User:Hoverfish">Hoverfish</a> <small><a href="../../../h/o/v/User_talk%7EHoverfish_2aee.html" title="User talk:Hoverfish">Talk</a></small> 14:36, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>At this point in the discussion, I took it upon myself to <b>rewrite</b> the article, which can be found at User:Saberwyn/Films featuring the United States Marine Corps. The top half of the article is a table displaying title and director, summary, date of release, and awards (a field which in hindsight should really be replaced with something else). The bottom half is an annotated version of the current article, saying why a particluar movie is or isn't included in the table (there are borderline cases in this section).

<li>I find the draft quite acceptable. I would recommend it as an example for several other film lists in need of cleanup/inclusion-explanations under the current AfD nomination.

<li><b>Excellent</b> I like the improvements to the page, and I believe this is the concept that should be used in improving this page. I don't know that it should be explicitly limited to films (though another page could cover other media appearances), and I might modify the criteria to include former marine characters if they're still central to the plot.

<p><b>Delete</b> - normally I would just redirect this per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> but since the charatcer apparently figures in two different films it's unclear what redirect would be prefereable.

<li>Yes it is an essay. An essay about arguments to avoid in trying to keep an article. "There's no harm in it" is an argument to avoid in trying to keep an article.

<li>My point is that it is an essay reflecting the views of one or more editors, not a policy or guideline supported by consensus. You wrote "No harm is not a valid argument for inclusion". Well, not valid according to whose authority? It's just an essay--it would take me two minutes to create another essay according to which <a href="../../../n/o/h/WP%7ENOHARM_b472.html" title="WP:NOHARM">WP:NOHARM</a> is the only legitimate argument that can be brought forth in an AfD. According to <a href="../../../b/a/s/WP%7EBASH_32b5.html" title="WP:BASH">WP:BASH</a> (an existing essay), such arguments are perfectly "valid". My point, in short, is: please don't cite essays as authoritative policies. You may write that <a href="../../../n/o/h/WP%7ENOHARM_b472.html" title="WP:NOHARM">WP:NOHARM</a> is not a <i>good</i> argument for inclusion or that it's not an <i>informative</i> or <i>constructive</i> argument for inclusion, but it's misleading to say that it's not a <i>valid</i> argument. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 19:03, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Article was originally created as a laundry list for the ever growing amount of pop culture trivia accumulating on the main <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Self-Defense_Force_2e31.html" title="Japan Self-Defense Force">Japan Self-Defense Force</a> article, which I felt detracted from the main point of the article. Several months later I fail to see how including every tangential reference to the JSDF in any game/anime/manga provides any additional insight into the JSDF or its place in society (there's already <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japan_Self-Defense_Forces_11c8.html#Role_in_national_life" title="Japan Self-Defense Forces">a section</a> in the JSDF article for that). The list is fancruft at best and internal linkspamming at worst. <a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoren36_6ebe.html" title="User:Loren36">Loren</a> 04:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Actually, I think you missed my point, which was that the articles should be made like the FBI one. Believe it or not, there's quite a bit of good information on the NYPD in the media. For example <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19990421/ai_n10526043" class="external text" title="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4196/is_19990421/ai_n10526043" rel="nofollow">this</a> article tells quite an interesting story. And there are others. So, I would say this is information that should be on Wikipedia, just presented in a different form. At least for the NYPD. I have no idea about the JSDF, but I'm not Japanese so...I leave it to people who know better than I do. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 07:19, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I totally agree the FBI article is fine. This is what the NYPD and JSDF articles should be. Not merely lists that could be categories.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 08:07, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, I think a navigational list, like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_fictional_portrayals_of_the_NYPD_9c09.html" title="List of fictional portrayals of the NYPD">List of fictional portrayals of the NYPD</a> (I moved it, since it's really a list) is fine.

<li>The better solution is to exercise basic editorial vigilance and, when this kind of crap turns up in a main article, get rid of it instead of throwing up one's hands, sighing that there can't possibly be any way for it not to happen, and sluffing it off into a separate article to make it someone else's problem. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 22:56, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I once held the same opinion expressed by Pavel Vozenilek and DDG, that trivia articles helped by keeping fancruft out of serious articles. However, I now believe that the presence of such trivia lists only serves to encourage the adition of even more trivia, most of it only tangentially related. I believe the solution to this problem is not the creation of fancruft magnents like this one, but through the vigilance of editors watching the main article who can nip these things off at the bud. -<a href="../../../l/o/r/User%7ELoren36_6ebe.html" title="User:Loren36">Loren</a> 23:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I agree with Loren. Bad stuff is bad stuff: if it doesn't belong, it doesn't belong, and trash heaps like this article tend to collect junk without being monitored.

<ul>
<li><i>if it was never screened then it isn't notable either.</i> Well, I disagree with this part at least; depending on the cast and crew attached to a particular planned show, or if it excited some controversy which led to it being pulled, it may be notable despite never coming to air. See <i><a href="../../../p/h/a/Star_Trek%7E_Phase_II_be93.html" title="Star Trek: Phase II">Star Trek: Phase II</a></i>, <i><a href="../../../m/r/2E/Mr._Dugan_e259.html" title="Mr. Dugan">Mr. Dugan</a></i>, and <i><a href="../../../w/e/l/Welcome_to_the_Neighborhood_%28TV_series%29_7239.html" title="Welcome to the Neighborhood (TV series)">Welcome to the Neighborhood (TV series)</a></i> for examples.

The overwhelming majority of the text must have been created from someone with a COI, how the details could be known without a published source is unbelievable.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 07:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Conditional Keep</b> I would say keep only if the authors were to cite the specifics of the TV and news coverage in the reference section, and limit the text of the article to the verifiable source material, with limited autobiographic information to fill-in the blanks (e.g., subject's webpage). This is now a vanity/promotional for the subject's products and POV, which does not belong at WP. --<a href="../../../k/e/v/User%7EKevin_Murray_cbe1.html" title="User:Kevin Murray">Kevin Murray</a> 19:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep it</b> - I don't see what the problem is with the sources. The list of links goes to his confirmed myspace page and to his own page at tripod.com. Other websites such as other small press authors also link to his websites. Vanity presses charge for payment. As PublishAmerica does not charge fees they can not be considered a VANITY press by definition, therefore this argument is moot. Small press publisher, yes. Author Mill, absolutely. But not a vanity press. Deleting it on this criteria is false and in bad faith. The author has received recognition from Midwest Book Review on amazon.com And has also won a contest sponsored by writer's digest.com in 2004 (<a href="http://www.writersdigest.com/contests/your_chronicle_previous.asp?id=153" class="external free" title="http://www.writersdigest.com/contests/your_chronicle_previous.asp?id=153" rel="nofollow">http://www.writersdigest.com/contests/your_chronicle_previous.asp?id=153</a>) Rankings on amazon.com are subjective and unverifiably changing all the time. I have personally seen Edward's amazon.com ranking break past 100,000, which is not an easy feat for a virtual unknown. A ranking of 3,000,000 now simply means his book has been out for over a year and sales are slowing down. His rank on barnes and noble's website is still higher than many of Dean Koontz's books. Are we going to delete Dean Koontz now? His association with a publisher of ill repute (Publish America) does not reflect on his talent. Unless we have personally read his works (and I have. I enjoy it!) We should not assume he lacks talent simply by the association with his publisher. Most of the stuff in his "bio" comes from his own webpage, a link for which appears on this page. We can confirm he has spina bifida and has struggled with pituitary cancer. We can confirm he's the writer of the books as it lays out on this page. We can also confirm he currently lives in the East Texas area because there are several press releases from PRWEB.COM that cite book signings in the East Texas towns of Longview and Tyler. He has also recently started a blog on his amazon.com listing for In The Breath of God. And I have heard he's on blogger.com. (<a href="http://edwardhancockii.blogspot.com/" class="external free" title="http://edwardhancockii.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://edwardhancockii.blogspot.com/</a>) I can't confirm this is him though. We have an article on Michelle Shocked who is also from the town of Gilmer, TX. I have never heard of her. Don't know who she is. She's not a celebrity to me. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Just because he's not known in your circles doesn't make him not known. Obviously some fan out there thought he was worth writing a story about. Maybe the story isn't in his books but in all he's overcome to write those books. As a trained investigative journalist, I believe in looking deeper. And my cousin is a technician for Channel 56 and confirmed meeting Edward on the day of his interview. If you go to KETK's website, you will see a listing for Edward's book. They only put a listing up after the author has been interviewed. Everyone started out small. Even Stephen King wasn't born a prolific writer. The Eagles were once a "band" of misfits hanging out on the college campus of UNT. Country Music Legend Neil McCoy once played bars and clubs all across Longview, Tyler and Carthage. Encyclopedias aren't supposed to contain knowledge about things people know about. Encyclopedias are meant to INCREASE one's knowledge. I learned about Michelle Shocked. Maybe some of the naysayers can learn about Edward Hancock II. Maybe someone looking for a way to inspire their disabled child to do better in school can point to this article and say "Look at what he's overcome." Anyone that votes to delete this article simply because they haven't heard of this man might as well delete half of the encyclopedia. Because apparently you only want to share knowledge you've already acquired. I say leave it up so that people can learn about a very strong person who continues to overcome adversity after adversity and is creating quite a buzz on the internet. So what if most of it's local. Throw a pebble in a pond. How do the ripples form? First small, locally. Then wider and wider until they reach the far edges of the pond. Perhaps Wikipedia will be somewhat responsible for the ripples of Edward Hancock II reaching farther and wider. Is that not a great thing?</li>

<dd>I think you have some misunderstandings of our objections to this article. First of all, <a href="../../../p/u/b/PublishAmerica_23f8.html" title="PublishAmerica">PublishAmerica</a> may or may not be a vanity press - although <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity_press.html#Some_vanity_presses" title="Vanity press">our article on vanity presses suggests it is</a>, as does PublishAmerica's article itself. Either way though, the only reason I mentioned that was because some Wikipedians might consider publication by a well-known traditional publisher acceptable grounds for inclusion, and I was pointing out that this was not the case. As far as verifiability, sites like MySpace and pages by the author himself aren't considered <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. And the reliable sources you do list, the two sites from local TV stations, do verify that he exists and did write these books, but not really that he is <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notable</a>. And "I have personally seen Edward's amazon.com ranking break past 100,000, which is not an easy feat for a virtual unknown" is a perfect example of why this should be deleted - Hancock is a "virtual unknown." <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not</a> a promotional tool, and as long as he is an "unknown," he is not notable enough for an article. You cite other famous authors who started out as unknowns - they, too, would not have been notable enough for Wikipedia articles until they wrote the works that made them famous. If Hancock follows their paths and one day becomes a famous writer, <i>then</i> a Wikipedia article would be in order. Until he reaches the point where he meets the criteria at <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a>, though, the community is very unlikely to support his inclusion. A lot of your comment sounds like you disagree with having a notability requirement at all - if this is so, the right place to voice those objections is at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_71e3.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability">Wikipedia talk:Notability</a>, although you're very likely to receive much support as the notability criteria are widely accepted by the community.</dd>

<li><b>Keep it</b> So because he's not currently as known as Dean Koontz you would just delete him? I have to agree with the person who said that Encyclopedias are supposed to be about furthering knowledge. About gaining new knowledge. PublishAmerica's own article suggests it's a vanity press? It's own article where? Here on Wikipedia? So the OPINION Of Wikipedia means more than factual definition of what a VANITY press is? VANITY presses charge money. PublishAmerica does not charge money. Therefore it can not be labeled a vanity press! It is not a traditional publisher. AT MOST I would call it a "small press" but yes I admit even THAT is pushing it. But the person above makes a great point. We shouldn't judge this person based on the reputation of his publisher but on the quality of his work. The links above (If you go to them) credit Hancock with a REPUTABLE win for a writer's digest contest. What other reputable sources does it take? You can't LINK an interview with his aunt Martha or his sister suzie. You can't link telephone calls unless you post the audio. I searched YOUTUBE but there's nothing I could find to link. You've had news organizations such as KETK and KSLA (Both of which HAVE articles on Wikipedia) cite Edward as being reputable. The person makes an excellent point. He must be a celebrity to somebody because SOMEBODY posted an article on him. Who is Michele Shocked anyway? Heck I read the article on Edward and I learned who the heck Abel Upshur and Thomas Gilmer were in the process. I didn't even come here looking for that, but I increased my knowledge. If you're going to take down everybody who is of local fame your list is going to be very short.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also agree that there's more to this story than the content of his writing or the resume therein. Who among the objecting parties has conquered Spina Bifida, and Pituitary Cancer? Who among you was the only disabled person in an otherwise "normal" school? I believe his story is one that should be left for all to see. It's inspiring.</p>
<p>If you're going to wait until you feel like he's good enough to be in your elitist club of "I'm good enough to be here" You should change the name of Wikipedia to "The encyclopedia anyone can edit, so long as you're on the short list of people we think are cool enough to be in our clique."</p>
<p>He's written three books, overcome spina bifida and pituitary cancer and he's a giving and generous person who is busily involved in charity work. In a world where there are so many tabloid articles of Britney's Bald Head and Anna Nicole's Baby dispute, why are we even debating the inclusion of such a bright spot in this universe? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 63.215.28.83 03:57, 27 February 2007 (UTC) Eric (I'm not sure how to sign these things.

<dd>Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>. Surviving a disease or donating to charity in no way makes one notable, unless, perhaps, he donated a record amount or was the only survivor of some horrible plague. And the argument that "even though he's not famous, he should be kept because he is a great guy" isn't likely to hold much weight I'm afraid. And winning a monthly Reader's Digest contest isn't much of a notability claim either.

<p>Here's the funny part. It's not noteworthy that he's survived spina bifida and pituitary cancer. He won 125 dollars in the Writer's Digest contest (Writer's Digest being THE pinnacle of any writer's success prior to a "book deal" with a major publisher.)His book has been REFERERNCED here at wikiquote.com!! He's part of a growing trend of self-publishers and is using his money to fund the American Heart Association and various other charities, which is not a notable contribution to society... but if he'd sucked the president's wiener we wouldn't even be having this discussion.</p>

<p>Apparently having sex with a politician would give him more clout in the wikipedia community. If I were Edward, that notion would almost have me begging for deletion.</p>
<p>And for those who argue there are no links, please use your eyes and your computers to explore the links to WRITERS DIGEST, to KSLA Channel 7 and to KETK Channel 56 as well as Edward's own MYSPACE PAGE. these are links to reputable organizations and credible sources all. You can't link CONVERSATIONS or personal knowledge. If someone who KNOWS Edward writes or edits this article, they can't link their own exposure to Edward.</p>
<p>and if you delete this article, you're going to have to change the articles on Kilgore College, Sabine ISD (Edward's high school) and Gilmer, TX itself. ALL of these articles link back to Edward and reference him in some way. Apparently SOMEBODY thinks Edward is noteworthy.</p>

<li>My understanding is that the core Wikipedia official policies are <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No Original Research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Neutral Point of View</a>, along with <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">what Wikipedia is not</a>.</li>
<li>You would struggle to write an article on yourself without breaking these policies - it may not be so easy for someone who lives far away to verify your existence from a trusted web site like Amazon? If you made your own article based on your own memories you would be performing original research (from unverifiable sources), and the act of you (or any of your friends/family) writing the article would make it too biased and entirely unneutral point of view? You would struggle to create the article without either using original research or not using original research but having to rely on unverifiable sources. That's why these are the official policies.</li>
<li>I can see it does not meet criteria at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28books%29_a961.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (books)">Wikipedia:Notability (books)</a>, but that is not an "official policy", it is only a "guideline" and until several months ago Notability pages were classified as an "essay" that "expresses the opinions and ideas of some Wikipedians".</li>
<li>When an article containing someone's efforts is being stood up for deletion, I do think it is relevant if at least one person talks about whether the article meets criteria laid out in the official policies. - <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 23:04, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>So you would support the inclusion of articles on all 2,935,993 books with a higher SalesRank than this one? They're also verifiable by the same method. This kind of problem is the basis for notability requirements, and while they aren't core policy, the existance of SOME kind of notability policy is overwhelmingly supported. I can't imagine any notability critera this book would meet. -<a href="../../../e/l/m/User%7EElmer_Clark_37e1.html" title="User:Elmer Clark">Elmer Clark</a> 01:23, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Many other fictional books low in the sales rank will be works of original fiction <i>not</i> related to television series that drew millions of viewers across the world. I agree the novel is still not very notable, but I think it gets just enough notability (by the skin of its teeth) from being the <i>only</i> unofficial published novel relating to hugely notable <i>Buffy/Angel</i>. -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 03:31, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b></s>, sources are insufficient, but then, from what I know about GmbHs (Corporation with limited liability) they only have to disclose information to the Internal Revenue Department (secret) and to their shareholders.

<li><b>weak keep</b> The key N considerations are the unsupported claims that "Nearly 90% of all steam power plants in the world are equipped with Taprogge tube cleaning systems and debris filters, and there is a similar market penetration in the industrial sector" Their web site contains "TAPROGGE generated several hundreds of international patents" The basic invention was in 1949, now long out of patent protection, so they have been presumably patenting improved versions on a regular basis.. They do cite a German text on the general subject, which is possible adequate if it were available. If it is in use worldwide it should be possible to source in English. I am not about to do it, as it would be too much work, but at the same time, I am not comfortable deleting it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The illustrations and most of the text are a clear copy of various parts of their website, but at least some of the images have been given permission in Wikicommons, and I think permission wold be given for the text as well. Someone who actually knows about civil engineering is really needed to edit this. I think it likely that it is indeed N and our problems with it are the style in which it is written, and our unfamiliarity with the appropriate sources.

<li><b>Keep</b> The intro paragraph needs to be rewritten though. This is just another example of what bull dung the "primary notability criterion" is. This is a mid-sized German engineering company, active since the 1950s. Does anyone actually think it has never been covered by neutral sources? The point of creating specialized notability criteria was to establish cases where notability is not in doubt, even though secondary sources might not be easily accessible. Clearly this is given here (and btw, there are 29 English language sources in Factiva). Abtw, the German version is considered "Lesenswerter Artikel" (cf. "Good article"), so much for G11. <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:26, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Tagging after/at AfD gives no change for authors to respond who might not be aware of the full requirements of notibility and verifiability. I think the nomination should be revoked.--<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDacium_36db.html" title="User:Dacium">Dacium</a> 08:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - the article asserts that he's written a number of books and received honours, which might make him notable, but reliable independent sources are needed to back up this assertion.

<li>Then I ask this - What about other radio stations that are web based on here? Or Online games? Or anything for that matter? This article has been up for at most 1-2 weeks and is still in the process of editing, which is being hampered by users on here seemingly wanting to delete it before it can get off the ground.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I think that in cases of borderline notability, whether or not a person wants an article should be taken into consideration.

<li><b>Comment</b>: When I talked about people not used to being written about, I did was not referring to Amanda specifically, but I meant that I expect that it is common for non-public people to not be used to being written about and would be uncomfortable to have a Wikipedia article, and that therefore, it should be reasonable to take a person's preference to not have an article into consideration in cases of borderline notability. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> In April 2006, the CNN stuff didn't exist, nor (AFAIK) did any other good secondary source, so notability was at that time a valid concern.

<li><b>Comment</b> "Just being interviewed about your (disability)" -- please let's be clear about the facts here. She was interviewed on CNN, about a YouTube video she posted to raise awareness of her disability, and (per CNN and her linked self-published material) is a longtime activist and self-advocate in disability rights. That is pretty clear evidence of consent and cooperation toward getting her message into the public eye, and unambiguously meets <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I don't know if Amanda has changed her views since February, 27 2006 about not wanting a Wikipedia article. <s>Even though the current article is not based on original research, I'm not sure it could go beyond being a stub since there is only one CNN interview to base it on.</s> I'll try asking Amanda on her blog if she has changed her mind about not wanting an article, though since she said she won't be writing much in the near future due to disliking the media attention, I don't know if she will reply. Given that she considers the media attention as a necessary evil to getting the information out and wished she was not the messenger, I would not consider the fact that she consented to a CNN interview to be evidence that she has changed her mind about the wikipedia article. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 02:59, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Necessary evil" sums up the issue well; Amanda recognizes that it's inherently hard for self-advocates to convey their ideas without some degree of attention to the messenger. I agree that the message is more important than the messenger, and I believe we can get it across in WP with or without an article on Amanda herself, although having the article would be more helpful than not for this reason: the ability to cite <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html#Self-published_sources_used_as_primary_sources_about_themselves" title="Wp:rs">self-published sources by the article's subject</a>. That would allow greater dissemination of Amanda's ideas, which is kind of the whole point of her activism, right? Either way, the CNN articles (again, there are three of them<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/02/21/autism.amanda/index.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/02/21/autism.amanda/index.html" rel="nofollow">[24]</a><a href="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/blogs/paging.dr.gupta/2007/02/behind-veil-of-autism.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/blogs/paging.dr.gupta/2007/02/behind-veil-of-autism.html" rel="nofollow">[25]</a><a href="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/anderson.cooper.360/blog/" rel="nofollow">[26]</a>, Q0, not one) have lots of great quotes from experts that can and should be included in WP. (Along those lines, the article could indeed grow beyond stub status, via CNN and her own non-pseudonymous, verifiably self-published work.) Amanda, if you're reading this, I hope you understand my rationale, and am sorry if you didn't want this article to appear. If it stays, I and other editors will keep it well within appropriate boundaries; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> is very clear about those.

I should say that I do <u>not</u> speak for Amanda and can only go by what I have read from her blog. If Amanda says that she has changed her mind about her previous preference to not have a Wikipedia article, then I will retract my delete vote, and if possible, I will retract the AFD (I'm not sure if nominators can retract an AFD). Also, I think Jim Butler has a point that Amanda's blog entries and other writings can be used as references so I guess the article can grow beyond a stub. <a href="../../../q/0/_/User%7EQ0_7d33.html" title="User:Q0">Q0</a> 06:36, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi, I'm the subject of this article. My main concerns in the past were that the article in Wikipedia contained some information about me that was unintentionally inaccurate (as I recall, it was someone saying that I'd been institutionalized my entire childhood, which is not true, I was institutionalized on and off throughout my adolescence), but since I was the only source of information otherwise or of most biographical information about me, it would constitute original research to correct it or for that matter to write a biographical article on me at all. I still don't think there's much out there (given that I've only been in CNN, for a very short amount of time, and doubt I'm really a public figure), but I'm indifferent at this point as long as Jim or someone keeps on top of it for inaccuracies, since I know we're not allowed to edit articles about ourselves. <a href="../../../s/i/l/User%7ESilentmiaow_ab11.html" title="User:Silentmiaow">Silentmiaow</a> 15:51, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

Yes, you have my firm commitment that I'll keep close tabs on this article (it it's retained) for inaccurate or inappropriate material(and I'm sure I won't be the only one). I also wanted to say that your hands are not tied with respect to editing; see these two sections from <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>: <a href="../../../b/l/p/Wp%7Eblp.html#Dealing_with_edits_by_the_subject_of_the_article" title="Wp:blp">dealing with edits by the subject of the article</a>; <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html#Using_the_subject_as_a_source" title="WP:BLP">using the subject as a source</a>. Not only can you correct inaccuracies if you choose, it's no longer <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> to do so since self-published material by the article's subject is considered an <a href="../../../r/s/_/Wp%7Ers.html#Self-published_sources_used_as_primary_sources_about_themselves" title="Wp:rs">acceptable primary source</a> (as I mentioned just above, and within the parameters of <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>: not just any random quote can or should be used).

<p>The article written here is a very obscure topic in Islamic theology with little details about it. I usually am cautious about recommending things for deletion but this topic is not well known and has little basis. Even the name "Salaami" in Arabic doesn't make sense for this term as it just means "My peace" which isn't the point. It seems like part of a campaign to put references to <a href="../../../a/h/m/Ahmed_Rida_Khan_bd9a.html" title="Ahmed Rida Khan">Ahmed Rida Khan</a> in as many articles as possible. <a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZaydHammoudeh_3b03.html" title="User:ZaydHammoudeh">ZaydHammoudeh</a> 09:39, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article was created by me. The original name used for this poetry in India &amp; Pakistan is <b>Salaam</b> or <b>Durood o Salaam</b>. The link I followed about <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salaam.html" title="Salaam">salaam</a> had an entry about it being called <b>salaami</b> (I personally havent heard that ever). I just created the article and moved the text there. Alternative name is <b>Darood-e-pak</b> found at <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darood.html" title="Darood">Darood</a>.

<dd>I can not really understand at all what this article is talking about. The group "Mujahid Centre" is not well known nor deserving of an article on Wikipedia. When you put the search in Google, you only get 86 hits. This article seems more an advertisement for these groups. <a href="../../../z/a/y/User%7EZaydHammoudeh_3b03.html" title="User:ZaydHammoudeh">ZaydHammoudeh</a> 09:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Unfortunately, mixed martial arts (MMA) have only hit the mainstream in the last two or three years.

<li><b>Keep</b> Claim to fame is not so much that he lost to Matt Hughes because of a cut, but the fact that he was contesting for the UFC Welterweight Championship.

<dd>No, there is none. That is what makes it a problem for an encyclopedic entry.

<dd>There doesn't have to a news article about a case of terrorism in Kazakhstan, the fact is, Terrorism and Kazakhstan are not unrelated concepts, and the subject does exist. It is not a concept without some information to be found.

<p><b>STRONG DELETE</b>I tend to agree with <b>delete</b> considering that there is not a single incident of terrorism in kazakhstan, so the whole article could be seen as a red-herring, or a sensationalisation of a phenomena that barely exists in this country.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 There has not been a single terrorist bombing in Kazakhstan</li>
<li>2 The title says terrorism <b>IN</b> Kazakhstan, assuming there is terrorism IN the country when there isn't any recorded incident of it</li>
<li>3 The article is so littered with use of the words "terrorist", "terror cell", and "terrorist literature" used in the narrative voice violating <a href="../../../w/t/a/WP%7EWTA_2564.html" title="WP:WTA">WP:WTA</a> it will be difficult to fix</li>
<li>4 The article assumes all groups that are banned by the government, are done so for terrorism, or accused of terrorism by the government, when actually the government itself in the source says that e.g. Hizb ut-tahrir is not banned for terrorism, but banned for <i>"extremism"</i>. This article is well beyond repair.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. KazakhPol does almost nothing on Wikipedia but push the POV that certain Islamic groups and political parties are terrorists, some of whom are not on the usual designated terrorist lists, which he has been told a thousand times. It seems that, for KazakhPol, if you're Islamic, you're <i>ipso facto</i> a terrorist. This article is an example of his extreme POV, and it will be very hard to fix it given the amount of work that would need to be done to find out which parts, if any, are accurately written up and cited. How many actual terrorist attacks have there been in Kazakhstan? Another editor has told me there have been none. It would be best to delete this and start from scratch with a new title and an entirely neutral approach. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESlimVirgin_b3d3.html" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/l/i/User_talk%7ESlimVirgin_2efd.html" title="User talk:SlimVirgin"><font color="purple">(talk)</font></a></sup> 16:19, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nice attempt to cover up your incivility with a smiley face. Regretting your earlier post? Not surprising. I do not have to present proof of a terrorist act, I only have to present proof that is a valid, encyclopedia concept. The fact that has been discussed, that they arrest and deport suspects, that the government has been accused of sponsoring terrorism, makes this a valid entry as those all fall under the umbrella topic of terrorism in kazakhstan. This was already explained above by other users. <a href="../../../k/a/z/User%7EKazakhPol_c9da.html" title="User:KazakhPol">KazakhPol</a> 18:43, 28 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>This is an article about a Lebanese family. The article has a fairly long history of problems: it was deleted once as a copyright violation but recreated in good faith by the holder of the copyright. However, the tone of the article is clearly unencyclopedic and requests for sources have been systematically removed. The article is full of peacock terms and sentences (for example: "<i>Throughout history, the El Douaihys endowed the community with a whole host of illustrious men of swords and cassock</i>". I've tagged it a few times for NPOV (this version and the one previously deleted), tried removing the more ludicrously positive sentences, added requests for citations, engaged in dialog with the creator to explain my concerns. Once again, all tags have been removed by Douaihy (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDouaihy_2774.html" title="User talk:Douaihy">talk</a> <small>•</small> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Douaihy_5aad.html" title="Special:Contributions/Douaihy">contribs</a>) so I think it's time to just shut down the page. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 14:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The article does need significant improvement and POV hunting, but I think information on Lebanese feudal families is good to have on Wikipedia. I don't think issues with the editor are sufficient justification to delete the article. If Douaihy continues his/her disruptive editing there are other venues to persue.—<span style="font: 11pt 'palatino linotype'"><i><b><a href="../../../l/e/s/User%7ELestatdeLioncourt_7069.html" title="User:LestatdeLioncourt"><font color="green">Lestat</font><font color="black">deLioncour</font></a><a href="../../../l/e/s/User_talk%7ELestatdeLioncourt_59fb.html" title="User talk:LestatdeLioncourt"><font color="black">t</font></a></b></i></span> <small>11:46, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</small></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I see what you mean but I'd like to clear something up: I'm not nominating the article for AfD solely on the basis of POV concerns although that's what tipped the scale for me. The article is unsourced and there's no indication that it can be properly sourced from reference material that would be independent of the El Douaihy family. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 12:28, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The article is a collection of speculation and vanity. Nowhere does it make a claim to why the entire family is notable or provide any sources. If someone can create properly sourced articles for individuals fair enough. <a href="../../../n/u/t/User%7ENuttah68_2daa.html" title="User:Nuttah68">Nuttah68</a> 11:48, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

That is not to say that we should never have articles about families or clans, but, like Nuttah, I think it's usually better to have individual articles about notable persons in the family. An article about the family requires independant notability of the family, and there is none cited in the article.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Greatest claim to notability is being <u>acting</u> director of a (very) notable college. The "acting" label troubles me, as he likely spent a short time in the role, and likely only because someone vacated the position unexpectedly.

<p><a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.</p>
<p>OK, allow me to give some background of this whole matter. Once upon a time, there was a man named Wallace Ward. He decided to call himself Frank R. Wallace, and then started a publishing company called I &amp; O Publishing, later called <a href="../../../i/n/t/Integrated_Management_Associates_87e9.html" title="Integrated Management Associates">Integrated Management Associates</a> (IMA). This company sells books expounding a philosophical doctrine called Neo-Tech. So we have 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <b>person</b> — Frank R. Wallace;</li>
<li>the <b>company</b> — I &amp; O Publishing a.k.a. Neo-Tech Publishing a.k.a. IMA;</li>
<li>the <b>philosophical doctrine</b> — Neo-Tech.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, here's the thing: there are something like 0.000 reliable sources — as in, peer-reviewed journals or news sources with editorial oversight — which specifically discuss Wallace the <i>person</i>. Where news sources discuss Wallace, their stories are about his <i>company</i>, i.e. IMA: see</p>
<ul>
<li>2005. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Mystical-letter-scam-warning/2005/05/03/1114886348579.html" class="external text" title="http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Mystical-letter-scam-warning/2005/05/03/1114886348579.html" rel="nofollow">'Mystical' letter scam warning</a>. <i>The Age Online</i>.</li>

</ul>
<p><a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> has tried to show that Wallace the <i>person</i> is "notable" by appealing to the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friedman, Stan (2006). <i>Dogs Playing Poker: Poker Kit</i>. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1402734484</a>.</li>
<li>Schreiber, Lee Robert (2005). <i>Poker as Life: 101 Lessons from the World's Greatest Game. Hearst Books</i>. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 1588164616</a>.</li>

</ul>
<p>However, as far as I can tell, these sources hadn't undergone any rigorous fact-checking or peer-review process, they weren't written by known authorities on the subject at hand (i.e. Frank R. Wallace, the <i>person</i>), and neither do they devote significant amount of space to discussing Wallace the man.</p>
<p>Also, although this article was marked with the {{Notability}} tag only this month, it had already been in an unreliable state as long as it existed (since 2005 Dec 22).</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Of course "Bi" above left out some sources like the law textook "Laws of Evidence" which discusses Wallace's legal escapades. It devotes over a page to the matter and entitled the section "Can 'Truth' By Replaced with 'Fully Integrated Honesty?'" And he neglected to mention that the New York Times had an article about it <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610FD3D5E0C708EDDA10894DA494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fIncome%20Tax" class="external autonumber" title="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10610FD3D5E0C708EDDA10894DA494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fI%2fIncome%20Tax" rel="nofollow">[29]</a>. And he left out the fact that DC Comics issued a comic book series based on Wallace's philosophy of Neo-Tech called <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarky.html" title="Anarky">Anarky</a>. And he neglected to mention that Wallace is a prolific author.

<dd>The law textbook and the New York Times article are about a specific court case. This means that the <i>court case</i> is notable, but says nothing about the notability of Wallace the <i>person</i>. (Besides, even if one admits these sources, all they say is that Wallace changed "truth" to "fully-integrated honesty" in his oath. Certainly not enough to justify having an entire article on the man.) And Anarky certainly isn't a peer-reviewed source by any stretch.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Also, Wallace being a prolific author has nothing to do with notability. Again, the issue is whether any <i>peer-reviewed</i> sources by <i>other people</i> have mentioned Wallace the <i>person</i>.</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - although the nominator's point is valid about the distinction between the person and his idea/philosophical doctrine, the long list of external sources does demonstrate some notability for both the man and the concept. Bear in mind also that <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neo-Tech_71c3.html" title="Neo-Tech">Neo-Tech</a> redirects to this article, so if the concept of Neo-Tech is notable (which it seems to be, owing to the wide number of external sources quoted in the article) then this article can't be deleted. Alternatively, <b>rename</b> to Neo-Tech to reflect the fact that the concept is more notable than the person. <a href="../../../w/a/l/User%7EWalton_monarchist89_24d9.html" title="User:Walton monarchist89">Walton monarchist89</a> 17:27, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that the philosophy Neo-Tech is more notable than the person, but the person is still notable. If someone's books and philosophy are then by default the author of those is notable. Besides his classic court cases which are cited in legal studies books make him notable too. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> 17:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC) <small>— <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_0efc.html" title="User:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">Bridge &amp; Tunnel</a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBridge_%26_Tunnel_7686.html" title="User talk:Bridge &amp; Tunnel">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bridge_%26_Tunnel_38ba.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bridge &amp; Tunnel">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></dd>

<dd>As I've pointed out above, most of this "long list of external sources" isn't anywhere near reliable.

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Keep</b> The nominator lost me when he started talking about peer reviewed articles etc, and the sarcastic 0.000 references.

If it's not notable then why would he devote so much energy to it? I suspect he wants to delete it simply because someone has added material to it recently that he doesn't like. <a href="../../../j/o/e/User%7EJoeMystical_c76d.html" title="User:JoeMystical">JoeMystical</a> 03:10, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Abstain</b>. At present there is only one independent reference; our guidelines require more. I am, as it happens, confident that a suitable reference can be found, but this needs to be done before this debate terminates. My own view is that the assertion about Mrs Dewitty is not per se notable, unless she was also the first black teacher hired in the entire state: otherwise, we are setting a very low bar for notability as every other school district in the country presumably has a "first black teacher", as well as a "first female", "first jewish", "first openly gay", and so on. If the school district or city had a particular history of treating black people notably badly this would be more notable. <a href="../../../w/m/m/User%7EWMMartin_1d16.html" title="User:WMMartin">WMMartin</a> 14:35, 26 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> how can we have an AfD on a red link? For one thing, it's hard for me to make up my mind if I can't read what I'm voting on; I have read the article before, but it's been quite a while. This was done very poorly; unilateral deletion was absolutely the wrong way to go about this. It should have gone to AfD <i>first</i>, while it still existed, not deleted outside of process, then put on DRV, then put on AfD as a red link. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 16:57, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Regardless, I refuse to vote on it as a matter of principle. It is for the community to decide whether we should have the article, and then for an admin to follow through on that decision; in this case an admin has already made the decision, and the community is just being told to rubber-stamp it.

<li><b>Overturn deletion and keep article.</b> I agree in principle with the notion that borderline bios may be deleted on the subject's request. As someone who was familiar with Brandt's work before I ever saw his article on Wikipedia, I simply do not agree that he meets those criteria -- even less so now that his activism (inluding, whether we like it or not, his Wikipedia criticism) has been covered in many notable publications with wide circulation, online and offline (the article had 33 references, many of them to reliable secondary sources). Whatever criteria we define for "borderline" notability, they need to be fairly and consistently applied. If this article is supposed to be the measure of such a set of criteria, too many other articles will be deleted. Moreover, the abuse of process in this particular case will embolden those who confuse self-righteousness with reason. This deletion seems more like an emotional backlash than a rational evaluation of the facts to me, and as such, brings us dangerously close to <a href="../../../o/c/h/Ochlocracy.html" title="Ochlocracy">ochlocracy</a> as an editorial principle. This article should be undeleted so a proper deletion debate can take place rather than an angry shouting match.--<a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_6468.html" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="../../../e/l/o/User%7EEloquence_CP_164f.html" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 17:12, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. If not, however, since this article was deleted in order to get Brandt to stop "troubling" Wikipedia I say we check back after a bit and see whether he actually has stopped.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - I would say her family connection to Queen Sonja of Norway counts as an assertion of notability, but there is only one external source.

<ul>
<li>Exactly. She does appear to have some celebrity status in Norway (as there are lots of hits in Norwegian), and she does have some family ties... but she really hasn't <i>done</i> anything notable. That's my motivation for this AfD. I would vote "weak delete" personally, but I certainly understand your "weak keep." I'm hoping we can get someone in-the-know here to help make a good case in one direction or the other. - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 17:53, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am a Norwegian myself and I am quite sure most Norwegians know who she is. The fact that she will appear on the "Rikets røst" show (as mentioned in the article) makes her more noteable, as that is a popular show here. The fact that she hasn't done anything to deserve fame (not as far as I know) doesn't make her less famous.<a href="../../../9/6/t/User%7E96T_8b06.html" title="User:96T">96T</a> 18:30, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well it's good to get your perspective, because many of the links in the article are red. For example, the show you mention is red-linked. I am completely ignorant of Norwegian pop-culture, so I would (naively) assume that the show isnt notable enough for an article, so neither is her appearance. It's hard to judge whether WP just doesn't have an article <i>yet</i> or whether the redlink is due to un-notability in general. It's clear she's notable in Norway. My question to you: Would she be considered notable to the English-speaking world? Is she worthy of an entry in the English WP? Thanks for you comments! - <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGrubber_bcf9.html" title="User:Grubber">grubber</a> 18:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Rikets røst" is a notable show that IMO should have an article, yes. If being a national celebrity, appearing on a notable TV show and being connected to the royal family in a country with 4.5 million people qualifies for notability, then Pia Haraldsen stays in the English Wikipedia. If that is not enough, she doesn't. [to say my personal opinion, I think the article should be kept, although I dislike that trivial Norwegian celebrities such as her have articles in Wikipedia while truly great Norwegians such as writer <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigurd_Hoel_5419.html" title="Sigurd Hoel">Sigurd Hoel</a> haven't.] <a href="../../../9/6/t/User%7E96T_8b06.html" title="User:96T">96T</a> 22:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Just because it might someday be notable doesn't mean it should have an article today. Let's have a nice for instance: I am currently working on a book with a couple colleagues about the impact of the Vice Presidency on Presidential elections. This book will most likely be nothing more than a nice addition to my CV and a required text in a couple courses at my home University. If, however, it becomes wildly popular and I go on the lecture circuit, both myself and the book would probably be notable enough for an article. Right now, I'm not. I guess the basic point is this: Everything, and I do mean <i>everything</i> has the potential to be notable. It doesn't get written about, however, until it actually <i>is</i> notable. <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESoltak_9893.html" title="User:Soltak">Soltak</a> | <a href="../../../s/o/l/User_talk%7ESoltak_c9f0.html" title="User talk:Soltak">Talk</a> 22:53, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>Topic of article is completely undefined. What does it mean to "use quotation"? Yes, many compositions prominently quote other compositions, but sometimes its unintentional, and sometimes its just similar use of stock material. Who's to say when it is and isn't notable? In fact, what is a "piece"? Does pop music count here? What about mix tapes? The poorly thought-out topic has doomed this article to having no content, and it's looked like this since 2004. <a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 18:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - the page history is rather bizarre but telling. This article has only ever been made up of original research, which various editors have diligently tried to remove or ameliorate. The answer, I think, is to delete the article unless someone comes up with actual sources that can move this article beyond simply stating "WWIII is the hypothetical next world war." -<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 18:08, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Yes it needs improving but so do various other articles. The concept of WWIII is well known within popular culture and the public psyc. This is deserving of an article.

<dd>None of the above comments has any relation to wikipedia policy. "I Like it" or "it's interesting" is not a valid reason to keep. "I hear this phrase a lot" is not a reason to keep.

<dd>I agree the history contains a lot of vandalism and pure OR but Wikipedia needs an article on WWIII. If I had the time I would go ahead and find sources and all, but I am at work.

<p>Also the World War IV article mentions that world war IV as the War on Terrorism, and the World War 3 as the Cold War.</p>

<p>Articles that present extrapolation, speculation, and "future history" are original research and therefore inappropriate. Of course, we do and should have articles about notable artistic works, essays, or credible research that embody predictions. An article on Star Trek is appropriate; an article on "Weapons to be used in World War III" is not.</p>

<dd>I consider that somewhat in error myself (in that future weapons development is possibly a topic of some encyclopedic value, for example the recent Air Force ray gun). However, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of World War III is established enough that it does exist, and as such should be described. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 19:24, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. Takeel, we can read. The article you nominated is about the reality of WWIII as we know it (as opposed to the media hype, or potential weapons that may be used). Please remember that WWI and WWII were both this century, and each resulted in a new world administrative body being created to ensure another WW didnt occur. WWIII has hovered over our heads for decades, and most nations have (big) buildings worth of classified material on scenarios, and how do deal with those scenarios should it happen. It is a real subject; the references are provided in the linked article (maybe this should be converted to a list of close calls?), and Afd is not the appropriate spot for discuss editorial issues. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayvdb_61b3.html" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> 05:08, 24 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>I expect that some of these classified books and war scenario documents should be available under <a href="../../../f/r/e/Freedom_of_information_legislation.html" title="Freedom of information legislation">FOI</a> by now, but the topics are politically sensitive (hence being classified in the first place) and reliable sources usually steer clear.

<li><b>Keep</b>. There appears to be a misunderstanding of what "crystal ball" means, because reporting things that have been said and written <i>in the past</i> about a possible future event is not prophecy. There is nothing speculative about reporting that somebody in the past said something; it is a fact that the person said it.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - this article simply cannot be deleted because it is informative, as a Wikipedia article should be. Such a common topic should have it's place in an encyclopedia.

<p><b>Delete</b> - maybe I'm missing something but an award given by an "association" of 13 members doesn't strike me as particularly notable. Unable to find anything indicating that this is considered to be any sort of honor, let alone a major one. No sources found for which the award is the primary subject. When it is mentioned it's part of a laundry list of other similarly minor awards that studios mention in press releases and on the back of DVD boxes. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 20:01, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Sure you can <i>relist</i> at your discretion, but <i>deletion</i> should be based on Wikipedia policy. "I want to" is not a reason to delete an article. Consensus is reconsidered all the time, and it looks like some good points were made at DRV.

<li><b>Keep</b> The author is a full professor in a major research university (UC Irvine). He is therefore presumably N; he has furthermore written at least one very widely-discussed book--which would make him N even if he had no academic distinction. The sources are adequate, though the third party references see, limited to book reviews. The article is somewhat improved, and the puffery removed from the lede. A good deal still has to be removed elsewhere. I have removed the many duplicate citation of his own works, and will return if the article is kept. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:15, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I have just returned toremove some of the detailed and jargon-laden summary of his own works, translating the kept portion into ordinary language--or as close to ordinary language as one can do with literary theory. This included quite a number of mentions of his own name, and links to many different people and subjects--I kept the links to the writers he discusses and to fellow critics. There are still some rough edges.

<p>2. The Constitution that this article is about is no longer the Constitution of Peru. There's a newer one. This is about the short-lived 1979-1992 Constitution, which is void.</p>
<p>3. Some of the article is still in Spanish and all of it was horribly translated. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDescendall_348e.html" title="User:Descendall">Descendall</a> 22:13, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep with caveats</b>. These caveats being that the article is renamed in some way to reflect that this Constitution lasted from 79-92 (which doesn't seem overly short-lived to me, but perhaps Peruvian politics is a different kettle of fish), the significance of the Constitution is expounded upon (why was it promulgated in 79? Why was it replaced in 92?) and the translation improved. As the Constitution of a sovereign country, it would appear to be notable, even if it no longer is in force. If someone with more experience in these matters can demonstrate that it was an unremarkable document, I'll reconsider my opinion. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I understand that creating individual stubs wasn't the <i>proposed</i> alternative, but I think that it's what the <i>actual</i> consequence of deleting this page will be. I disagree with the judgment that these young actors <i>en masse</i> are non-notable, and practically speaking, it will be easier to maintain a "compendium" list like this than to continually hunt-and-destroy the stubs that <i>will</i> be created otherwise.

<li>Josiah, I have watchlisted all the stubs that redirect to Minor actors and actresses in Harry Potter. Hopefully, you have enough faith in our watchlisting skills and reversion of inappropriate page creation so as to change your mind? I don't agree either that these are all non-notable, because they have the good fortune of appearing in a Harry Potter film. But that information is already covered at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members_4700.html" title="List of Harry Potter films cast members">List of Harry Potter films cast members</a>. Surely, at least a redirect to the latter, featured, list, is more appropriate, and a vote of confidence to continually monitor all the stubs that might be created? --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">☑t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">☛c</a> || 23:52, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>It's not a question of faith in watchlisting, it's a question of additional information. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members_4700.html" title="List of Harry Potter films cast members">List of Harry Potter films cast members</a> is lovely, but there is information at <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minor_actors_and_actresses_in_Harry_Potter_4233.html" title="Minor actors and actresses in Harry Potter">Minor actors and actresses in Harry Potter</a> that isn't contained in the larger list: birthdays, yes, and also other roles and school information. For example, it's of mild interest that the actor who played Charlie Weasley is now studying Law at Cambridge (although, of course, a citation confirming this would be good). (By the way, is William Melling, who's on that list, any relation to <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Melling_%28actor%29_4706.html" title="Harry Melling (actor)">Harry Melling</a>, who plays Dudley and is <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrick_Troughton_475e.html" title="Patrick Troughton">Patrick Troughton</a>'s grandson?

<ul>
<li>I imagine that the page could be very informative if all of the information weren't taken from IMDb, though. William Melling we have no idea about, since he plays on one of the smallest roles in the series (just a few short scenes in GF and apparently a few in OP; looks like his character is a "replacement" for <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colin_and_Dennis_Creevey_b004.html" title="Colin and Dennis Creevey">Colin Creevey</a>). If he is related to Harry, though, that may prove how he got the part. Anyway, it just seems all of the birthdays came from IMDb, which has very little editorial oversight and thus is not a reliable source for actors' personal information or upcoming films. I suppose if we really want Alex Crockford's school information, he could go back to a stub, or we could greatly reduce the page so that it only has information on minor actors <i>who also</i> have some other interesting information about them. For the record, Crockford appeared in a two-second cameo in a photograph of all the Weasleys. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">☑t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">☛c</a> || 20:27, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please don't think me anti-Harry Potter! I'm one of the most active members of the <a href="../../../h/a/r/WP%7EHarry_2a90.html" title="WP:Harry">WP:Harry</a> and am a frequent poster (when not editing Wikipedia) of a number of fan forums around the web. But that does not mean I approve this article. Basically, this is just a listing of about 28 actors or so who appeared in the HP films, and essentially nothing else that's notable. They were originally all stubs, so we merged them into this one giant article. I was originally part of the creation of this page. However, I have since learned the ways of Wikipedia better to realize that you don't need to write something, even if it be one or two sentences, about somebody who's done something famous, just because they've done that. They don't need an article or even a section of an article, if the've been mentioned at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members_4700.html" title="List of Harry Potter films cast members">List of Harry Potter films cast members</a>, where the information there (name, role in which film) is the only information in this article we're discussing here. Look, I'm happy for Jason Boyd and all, but would you say a section that reads: "<b>Jason Boyd</b> (born <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">September 29</a>, <a href="../../../1/9/8/1989.html" title="1989">1989</a>) will play <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_characters_in_the_Harry_Potter_books_62e8.html#Muggles" title="List of characters in the Harry Potter books">Piers Polkiss</a>, <a href="../../../d/u/r/Dursley_family.html#Dudley_Dursley" title="Dursley family">Dudley's</a> best friend, in the upcoming <i><a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_%28film%29_b646.html" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</a></i>" is that necessary? Boyd is listed under the "Muggles" section of <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Harry_Potter_films_cast_members_4700.html" title="List of Harry Potter films cast members">List of Harry Potter films cast members</a>. His birthday was taken from IMDb. Not that hard to find.

<li>Sourcing is not the issue here. I agree that the article is sourced, which is why "unsourced" was not offered as a reason for deletion. The problem is that no matter how well-sourced the indiscriminate list is, it's still indiscriminate. The items listed tell us nothing about AC/DC or the things from which the thing is drawn or the real world. How does knowing that "Snowballed" was heard from Molly Ringwald's character's brother's room in "Sixteen Candles" tell us about her brother or "Sixteen Candles" or the band? What insight into AC/DC, the character or the film does knowing that "Are You Ready" was playing in the background of Chris's nipple-piercing scene in "Rock Star" offer? What does knowing that Angus Young is on top of the red building on the right, behind the dogs pouring brown matter, on the cover of "Dookie" tell us about Young, AC/DC, Green Day or "Dookie"? This stuff is pointless trivia that doesn't belong in its own article or in the AC/DC article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:16, 24 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with you in part. A number of the entries on the article are "trivia" and can be removed. However, it is not trivial that a character on a <i>very</i> popular TV show always wears an AC/DC t-shirt (assuming it's true). It is also not trivial that AC/DC's album <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Made_Who_7078.html" title="Who Made Who">Who Made Who</a> is the soundtrack for the film <i><a href="../../../m/a/x/Maximum_Overdrive_e747.html" title="Maximum Overdrive">Maximum Overdrive</a></i>. So, what does all of that make this article? Essentially a poor- or medium-quality list that can serve as the basis for a more encyclopedic article that discusses the influence of AC/DC on popular culture (yes, I realize they <i>are</i> part of pop culture, but I'm referring to that part of pop culture which they haven't directly produced). As for your main point, this article is <i>not</i> indiscriminate. Firstly, it meets none of the criteria on <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a>. If we were to take the more general meaning of the word (outside of WP guidelines), it still has a clear, discriminating criterion: the influence of AC/DC on popular culture. If this list was unsourced or in significantly worse shape, I would probably have agreed with you. However, it is not, and as you well know, most WP articles start out in poor shape and improve over time. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 00:47, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>You know, if I had one birthday wish, it would be that everyone who says that an article can't be an indiscriminate collection of information because it doesn't fit exactly one of the eight things mentioned there would understand that the section is not <i>limited</i> to just those eight things. I do not mean to take out my frustration on you but come <i>on</i>. None of those eight things would specifically ban List of blue things but is there any question that such a list would be indiscriminate? Would anyone seriously try to defend it by pointing to <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#IINFO</a> and say "list of blue things isn't mentioned there"?</li>
<li>And I have to disagree with you that a character always wearing an AC/DC shirt is in fact trivial, especially since it's an animated show and characters in cartoons frequently wear the same clothes all the time. It's like saying that List of orange ascots in popular culture is notable because Fred from Scooby-Doo always wears one. And the soundtrack information already exists as its own <a href="../../../w/h/o/Who_Made_Who_7078.html" title="Who Made Who">article</a>, which is linked to the AC/DC article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:06, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>But because Fred wears an orange ascot, doesn't mean that orange ascots have an influence over Scooby-doo or any other animated show. But the fact that Butt-head always wears an AC/DC t-shirt is indeed notable in that it shows how AC/DC has been used to denote anti-social characters in popular culture. I agree that the article itself needs to state why everything that is listed there is notable, but this is something which can be done in time.

<li>It was not a false accusation; I take offense to people using condescending tones at me, but hey, that's a discussion which doesn't belong here.

<li>The reasons for keeping the PF trivia article look to me to range from "it's interesting" (which is not a valid criterion for inclusion) to "if it's not here it'll get stuck in the main Pink Floyd article" which I reject wholeheartedly as a reason for keeping. Garbage information does not belong on Wikipedia. All sorts of "interesting" things get deleted every day because they do not meet Wikipedia standards. If the information is garbage on its own and it's garbage in the main article, then the information should be removed. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 17:44, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I was more referring to the users stating it should perhaps be trimmed a bit; I think this comment should be the case here.

<li>OK, but see, just that an AC/DC item appears in some other medium is not enough. There must also be reliable third-party sources which explain the significance of the reference either within the medium from which it's drawn or the real world. It's not enough to have a source that says "X appeared in Y."

What source indicates that Earl Hickey regrets going to an AC/DC concert instead of taking his sons to an amusement park indicates that this marks him as an anti-social character, and what source indicates that the choice of AC/DC instead of, for example, Slayer or Megadeth or Twisted Sister, was deliberate on the part of the creator of the character as opposed to the first heavy metal band that came to mind while writing the script? <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 18:38, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

It does not offer any analysis as to why the wearing of the t-shirts is significant, does not discuss "teenage metal-head stereotypes" and does not mention AC/DC by name. Your second source suffers from the same lack of substantive information and has the additional problem of being IMDB, which because it accepts contributions from anyone and does not engage in fact-checking, is not a reliable source. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:32, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I do not believe this article should be deleted or redirected. It is a natural sub page of Effects of Global Warming which is extremely general. Climate change and global warming are acknowledged as some of the most important topics in the world and in Australia at present. It is not almost identical to Climate or Climate of Australia as the impacts are on species, biodiversity, industry, human occupation and communities. It is about the impact of changes to climate on a wide variety of areas, not climate. If the page should have been developed more before being put into wikipedia, I can understand that as a criticism, but a listing for deletion and redirection only a few days after commencement seems a bit over reactive. <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhanly_0156.html" title="User:Phanly">dinghy</a> 14:56, 22 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>All comments above rendered irrelevant by substantial changes/development in content and referencing. Article now has 17 references, most assertions referenced to articles published under Australian government or other undeniably reputable sources. This development of the article will continue over the next 7 days as advised to User PDH who nominated the article for deletion <a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPhanly_0156.html" title="User:Phanly">dinghy</a> 05:18, 25 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>The article now has over 40 referenced statements and is based largely on a report prepared by Australia's premier scientific research organisation the <a href="../../../c/s/i/CSIRO_7186.html" title="CSIRO">CSIRO</a>. The referencing of the article now compares very favourably with most other articles I have looked at. The article has no POV. The report on which it is based was prepared for the Business Round Table. It ought not be deleted now, even if it should have been before. Could each person who has recommended deletion please review and reconsider your view.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>keep</b> but this is now the summary of a single point of view-- or perhaps everyone in Australia is rational about this.

An example of bootstrapping: label notable because it's run by this individual, who is notable because he was in a band, which is notable because it includes this individual. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It's beyond me why you want to delete all One Be Lo related articles. First of all, the sales figures are out of date (so they should really be updated, but that's another issue). Secondly, this guy is a hugely respected rapper in underground hip hop (by both fans and critics). All of his albums, both solo and as part of Binary Star, have had fantastic reviews from reputable sources. For instance, just checking his <a href="http://www.myspace.com/onebelo" class="external text" title="http://www.myspace.com/onebelo" rel="nofollow">official Myspace page</a> will show you he has had over 300,000 hits - massive for an underground rapper. Apologies if that was incoherant as I'm quite tired, but there's no reason the article should be deleted. <a href="../../../p/o/w/User%7EPowelldinho_1ecd.html" title="User:Powelldinho">Powelldinho</a> 23:33, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Not in my opinion, I never use reviews as a measure of notability. Anyone can send a CD to a magazine or website and get a review published. Reviews of CD are generally not reliable sources that we can create an article from. <a href="../../../o/n/e/User%7EOne_Night_In_Hackney_1d14.html" title="User:One Night In Hackney">One Night In Hackney</a> 00:10, 24 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I disagree. If I were to start a band right now, release an LP with no promotion and sent it to the Onion or Vibe would I get a review published? Of course not, publications won't publish just any review, the subject has to be notable. That is why every single hip hop act doesn't get a review on rap reviews. With underground artists promotion is nearly impossible, artists in the undergound need these reviews. The reasons Guy are using to delete these articles is contradictory to the entire underground hip-hop movement, no artist will get high record sales or lots of media coverage when they are underground, this is part of the whole movement, not relying on high sales and controlling major labels for creative control. --HiphopisNOTdead 17:25, 23 February 2007 (UTC).</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The entry has value, he is a well respected artist. That may not equate into raw record sales but that is not always the best criterion to use when judging such things. 82.9.253.47 23:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I agree, he is a very well respected artist in the hip hop community, and any fan of underground hip hop will assert this. His albums with Binary Star have gotten positive reviews from many reputable sources and the same goes as One Be Lo, his latest album S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M. has gotten positive reviews from many different sources including rapreviews.com and scratch magazine (see his website for these links). Also the fact that he is "deep underground" has nothing to do with this, there are many "deeper" artists who have pages, it seems that this admin here would like to delete every single underground hip hop article there is, if this keeps up there won't even be an underground section. Binary Star's page is already gone, don't let One Be Lo's disappear too. Third party links from reputable sources are as follows: <a href="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html" class="external free" title="http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_masters.html</a> , Review on Binary Star album Also on rapreviews.com note S.O.N.O.G.R.A.M.'s review (under One Be Lo) it states that the said album was released under Fat Beats Records, not Subterraneous Records. <a href="http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07" class="external free" title="http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07" rel="nofollow">http://www.fatbeats.com/catalog/index.php?manufacturers_id=913&amp;elvis=c6ba68a3a0eb40f90d7e5649c629fe07</a> This is One Be Lo's page at Fat Beats records, note other artists on this label. <a href="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" class="external free" title="http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006" rel="nofollow">http://www.avclub.com/content/node/16006</a> review from the Onion (notable source eh?) once again note the label that this record is under.

<li><b>Keep assuming references check out</b> WP:Crystal Ball does not require that the game be "officially announced". It only requires that the information about a future game come from reliable, referenced sources.

Keep the article, and remove any unreferenced information. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 20:47, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>P.S.

<dd>Yes, well it's clear that you feel so, but I don't think that there has been one single good argument for keeping this article.

<dd>That is your opinion, obviously. I see plenty of good arguments to keep it. One of those is, as I wrote above, the sources are no more unreliable then many other sources related to CVG articles. It may not be offically announced, but EA is already talking about it unoffically. This game will come in quarter 4, as every other game in the <a href="../../../n/e/e/Need_for_Speed_%28series%29_6d31.html" title="Need for Speed (series)"><i>Need for Speed</i> series</a> have done each year since <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motor_City_Online_17aa.html" title="Motor City Online">Motor City Online</a>. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 11:52, 2 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>That depends on how you define "speculations" and "romours". Everything in the article is properly sourced. An interview with an EA employee is not what I call speculations. And, there's nothing that says Wikipedia cannot have some speculations as long as they are properly sourced, especially for an article about a future game. --<a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrStalker_a10a.html" title="User:MrStalker">MrStalker</a> 09:20, 3 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>All that interview did was say that the "Pro Street" subtitle was bullshit. There are ZERO facts in this article, and no confirmation the game even exists. WP policy says this article should be deleted until some details are known, it's the same reason articles on the PS4, and other future movies/games get deleted. These articles are not supposed to be up until some details are known (not "the game could have this", "some of the rumored cars are", "information may be announced at E3" type of stuff). <a href="../../../t/j/_/User%7ETJ_Spyke_116e.html" title="User:TJ Spyke">TJ Spyke</a> 09:34, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Sailordude here: I have edited this page many times to reflect the facts contained on radio station WBT's own web site; I also KNOW Mr. Katz. I have spoken to him about the continual editing by the user of IP 67.102.230.77, who is apparently residing in San Francisco and has a grudge against Mr. Katz. I have made Mr. Katz himself aware of what is currently going on with this page, and I think that A) HE should ahve the last say as to what is contained on this page, and the page frozen, and B) the owner of 67.102.230.77 be penalized in some way, for what he is doing. I also have a strong hunch that user 208.66.31.54 and 67.102.230.77 are the same person. It appears that the IP begining with 67 is done from work, then he goes home where his Ip is the 208.

<dd>Hello, gmss0205, thank you for commenting on my talk page. Getting permission from Jeff isn't enough. To be included in Wikipedia, the material must be released under the <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GNU Free Documentation License</a> which would be hard to do unless you can convince Jeff and WBT to do so. Also, that's besides the point. <i>The point</i> is that the material you're referring to isn't written in an encyclopedic <a href="../../../t/o/n/WP%7ETONE_f8b3.html" title="WP:TONE">tone</a> anyways. All content must be in a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable published sources</a> which the WBT text doesn't quite achieve. You're not trying to copy very much material, so I'd suggest rewriting your own text from scratch.

<dd>Thanks Arichnad. Quick question. Do I go back and edit the main "Jeff Katz" page, or should I do the text elsewhere to show it to you first? Let me know what you think is best. I will also make sure that Jeff approves the text before I send it to you.

<dd>No need to get Jeff's approval. Keep in mind, this is supposed to be an unbiased account of Jeff Katz. If Jeff "needs" to approve it, then it won't be very unbiased, will it?

<dd>Sailordude again: Once an accepted, legally acceptable entry is created, will this page be able to be frozen to the editing of the likes of 67.102.230.77? On the mention of Jeff Katz' information not being in an encylopedia, well, neither is Ray Taliaferro, who is another radio host, but resides on KGO 810 in San Francisco, yet there he is on Wikipedia as well! Thanks for the chance to input on this issue.
<dl>
<dd>No, it won't be frozen from editing.

<dd>I (gmss0205) made some edits and reposted a new version. Let me know if this version is acceptable. There is nothing "editorial" in there. It is all just factual information. I think Sailordude's point (which I agree with) is that is appears that someone out there is probably just going to vandalize this page again, once it is up. What can be done about that?

<dd>Thanks. I will try to figure out the best way to cite reference. Not sure the best way to do that. Also, I honestly don't know how to add a vandalizism warning. Would you be able to help with that, as this page has obviously been the target of vandalism, and probably will be again in the future? Any help is appreciated (if you are allowed to do that). Thanks again - gmss0205

<dd>I can help you cite references. If you put them here or on the page, I'll help fit them into the style usually seen on wikipedia.

<dd>I'll forward the references and cites presently. The information was pulled from transcripts of his shows and the station records from his various places of employ. He worked with the Housing Authority in Philadelphia as a police officer, so we can submit his employee records as well.

<dd>What am I missing - there was a personal attack in that last statement? I have only stated factual and unbiased information. He is a former police officer, he is married, he has children, his daughter has special needs (she is retarded), he left his last job due to poor ratings.

<dd>There was a question as to what defined "special needs". As such, I explained what was meant by that terminology. It is not a diagnosis nor is it meant to be hurtful wording merely a statement of fact and used as a description. His ratings in San Francisco were something less than stellar and there is no denying that. The fact that he was dropped as a fill-in host speaks to that. His audience at WBT has been steadily dropping - particularly in light of the attempts that have been made at cross-promoting him. I have seen the articles but I've also seen the facts and figures. I'm not sure why you have felt it necessary to blow this entire issue out of proportion. My entries have never been about any sort of personal attack - I have simply been trying to present the facts in the most accurate and concise manner possible. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.102.230.77 (<a href="../../../6/7/2E/User_talk%7E67.102.230.77.html" title="User talk:67.102.230.77">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.102.230.77_9405.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.102.230.77">contribs</a>).</small></dd>
