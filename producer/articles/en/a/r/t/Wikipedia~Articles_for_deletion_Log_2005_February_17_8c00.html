<li><b>Keep</b>. Bobby Houghton was head coach of the Chinese Football Association, and helped turn around the struggling team. He's also been known to implement effective soccer (football) programs for teams that are... ahem... soccer-challenged. I added some very basic information on his being coach of China's soccer team, based on the following article on <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/news/index/0,1464,5867,00.html?articleid=5867" class="external text" title="http://www.fifa.com/en/news/index/0,1464,5867,00.html?articleid=5867" rel="nofollow">FIFA's web site</a>.

<li>Whenever there exists a "List of things that are X" with individual items linked to pages that only say "Y is an example of X", then the items should be de-linked and the articles should be redirected to the list. The problem in this case is that "Y" (Doherty) will not be an example of "X" (Chicago alderman) when his term ends, and the redirect should then either be redirected elsewhere or deleted. I don't necessarily see that happening. It'd be easier to delete. Some day hopefully wikipedia's search function will work better and a search for any current alderman will easily turn up anyone listed on that page, even without a redirect. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 19:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> -- Just because she was on Unsolved Mysteries, does that make her notable enough? And going a step further: Does that mean that anybody who was on Unsolved Mysteries make them notable, and thus eligible to be in Wikipedia? <a href="../../../z/z/y/User%7EZzyzx11_e7c4.html" title="User:Zzyzx11">Zzyzx11</a> 06:26, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> Okay, let me clarify. She's an unusual enough subject. The circumstances of her death is unusual enough. This is not a vanity article, and Wikipedia is not a paper encyclopedia, so we don't have to keep Wikipedia trimmed down to a small size. Hence, yes, I believe she is notable enough to be included in Wikipedia. Furthermore, if people are willing to write an article on anyone who was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, I say go ahead. As long as it's not a vanity piece, I have no problems with that. --<a href="../../../d/e/a/User%7EDeathphoenix_e325.html" title="User:Deathphoenix">Death</a><a href="../../../d/e/a/User_talk%7EDeathphoenix_86ea.html" title="User talk:Deathphoenix"><b>phoenix</b></a> 06:53, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The nominator's question is wrong, since VfD isn't a cost/benefit analysis. Even if it were, disk space isn't the only cost. If that were the analysis, we'd keep everything, including the vanity, since disk space costs are negligible. I'm not sure GRider didn't nominate this to make a point, which would be "disrupting Wikipedia to make a point". All that said, I agree with the previous voters who argued that being murdered does not make you encyclopdically notable, unsolved or otherwise; nor does being a transexual millionaire. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 16:22, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I hope people voting to keep this realize that far from being a mere "sex move", this is a form of extreme abuse that potentially could seriously harm the female partner. It is NOT PLEASURABLE IN THE LEAST for the woman. The so-called move probably does not really exist except as a kind of sick Howard Stern-type joke. It is far too dangerous. Someone reading this article is going to think that it is OK to try it and someonr else is going to get seriously injured, and it might well be Wikipedia's fault. People have such a chip on their shoulders about censorship, prudishness, etc, that they lose all sense of responsibility. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 02:11, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> about the undesirability of practicing this "move", but I disagree strongly about applying self-censorship in encyclopedia entries just because we don't want people trying what is described.

<dd>Your sarcastic non-sequitur notwithstanding, the fact remains that in this article we have a description as a real "sex move" something, which if it actually were performed, would very likely injure someone, and would be extreme abuse, not to mention criminal battery. We are talking about the person on top punching his partner in the back of the head as hard as he can -- so hard that the anus or vagina muscles strongly contract. And, apparently, Wikipedia editors think it is fine to describe this as a "sex move" and make jokes about "Tony Danza". --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 18:40, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I'm not 100% sure this article needs to be deleted, but at the very least it needs to be retitled, merged, cleaned up or a combination of those. Also, deciding who is a notable player is subjective. If there are official Starcraft rankings, use those.

<li>Voted <b>keep</b>, but clean up and modify into a general "Professional Starcraft Playing" article to give the subject more context.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the subjectivity of notability, the choice of notable players is based on a combination of rankings, past success and fan popularity. All players described are commonly talked about in English-language Starcraft progaming fan discussions, and all on the list that are still active are within the top 20 of the offical rankings. <a href="../../../s/h/a/User%7EShardPhoenix_3069.html" title="User:ShardPhoenix">ShardPhoenix</a> 05:58, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm sorry, the Wikipedia is a work in progress, but it is not a construction site, with "under construction" signs all over the place. People coming to the Wikipedia should be able to find it always in a reasonable state -- although perhaps not in the ideal state for which editors are aiming. The main article space is not your hard drive or even your User space. If you are working on a set of articles and they are not yet in a reasonable state keep them out of the main article space until they <b>are</b> in a reasonable state; otherwise, you are going to find other editors trying to restore Wikipedia to a reasonable state -- by means of cleanup, VfD, and other means. By the way, how does this article make sense even as a redirect to Multiplayer (StarCraft)? And shouldn't that be StarCraft (Multiplayer) , anyway? --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 14:57, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I am working to restore the crapload of preexistent StarCraft articles. I don't really see how it makes sense to delete them all now and restore them later, once someone is done working on them. Following your suggestion, we should trash all articles marked for cleanup because some uninformed outsider might see them and be shocked or whatnot. I am not taking the main space for my hard drive, I'm asking for a few days to make decrepit articles worthy of Wikipedia again. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phils</a> 16:45, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That is laudable. However, the only one that has been nominated for VfD yet (afaik) is the list of notable players, since some Wikipedians hold that the criteria for inclusion are too subjective, meaning that any wannabe could add a cool story there and claim to be the best in his area. Please take that into consideration. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 18:41, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well Phils, you have 5 days, which is the amount of time this will be on VfD before it is decided. You can't expect other editors to decide this on the basis of what you are planning to do when you have not told anyone what that is. How about at least explaining where an article entitled "StarCraft Players" makes sense in your planned scheme of articles? Because I can't see where a list of StarCraft players would be a reasonable article to have, or even a reasonable redirect. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 19:02, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

I have no idea what Phils plans for the article since he hasn't said, but I <b>suspect</b> I don't like it. But, as for what Coolcat has done with the article, making it a miscellaneous list of supposedly notable StarCraft players, I <b>know</b> I don't like it. <b>Delete</b>, <b>delete</b>, for pity's sake, <b>delete</b>.

<dd><b>Delete</b>. Ok, let me state my case: I never wanted to maintain this article, but I am currently in disagreement with <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">User:Coolcat</a> over how the article should be split (see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Talk%7EStarcraft_7c57.html" title="Talk:Starcraft">Talk:Starcraft</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECoolcat_c966.html" title="User talk:Coolcat">User_talk:Coolcat</a>, and <a href="../../../p/h/i/User_talk%7EPhils_0f89.html" title="User talk:Phils">User_talk:Phils</a>), with him reverting my edits on sight as <i>vandalism</i>. I have requested comment of <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> and have faith that the dispute will be resolved (as we do not really disagree - as I see it - it's just a misunderstanding). It's that at the time this VfD was submitted, the main article linked to <i>Notable Players</i>, so I feared the dispute might escalate as a result of any further VfDs. It was just to give a sign that we know there's a lot of work to be done on StarCraft articles, and we're working as quickly as possible to do the appropriate merges and edits, making many VfDs unnecessary as the problems will be addressed anyway. That being said, this article can die, although it would make sense to make it a redirect to <a href="../../../s/t/a/StarCraft_Gameplay_1430.html" title="StarCraft Gameplay">StarCraft Gameplay</a>, which also covers professional play. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhils_21fd.html" title="User:Phils">Phils</a> 11:51, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Starcruft. I have so many problems with this article. Firstly, this article could get pretty huge if being the #1 Starcraft player AT ONE TIME is reason enough for inclusion. These things do change multiple times daily, after all. Secondly, this could set a precedent that any player in any game could argue that his high standing makes him/her worthy of wiki notability.

<li>In the past, I have been among the strongest anti-StarCruft (craft is good, cruft is bad) Wikipedians (see <a href="../../../s/t/a/Talk%7EStarCraft_ddeb.html" title="Talk:StarCraft">Talk:StarCraft</a> for evidence). However, I must reluctantly vote <b>keep</b> on this one (though the page should also be <b>renamed</b> so that it fits naming conventions and the word "Players" is not capitalized). The players listed are actually quite notable in the StarCraft gaming community, which was during the late 1990s possibly the largest gaming community for any single computer game in the world. We do have articles on, for example, chess players after all. —<a href="../../../l/o/w/User%7ELowellian_970e.html" title="User:Lowellian">Lowellian</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/w/User_talk%7ELowellian_719b.html" title="User talk:Lowellian">talk</a>) 22:48, Feb 23, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Reluctant <b>keep</b>. Though terrible in its current state, we need quality articles on professional gaming. Top players are not changed daily. There is a Starcraft World Cup in the WCG: people like Slayers_Boxer are enormously popular. MOST IMPORANTLY, however, WE SHOULD NOT be deleting these until we reach a consensus on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Talk%7EStarcraft_7c57.html" title="Talk:Starcraft">Talk:Starcraft</a> on how to deal with all these Starcraft articles and where to place them.--<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtaonish_6b71.html" title="User:Etaonish"><font color="green">Etaonish</font></a> 01:32, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Upon further review, I'm changing to <b>strong keep</b>. This article is not as inherently subjective as many suggest: The WCG is an excellent standard of top players. Among all Starcraft players, Slayers_Boxers' skill is as undisputed as Muhammad Ali in boxing. The list has room for objectivity and certainly doesn't warrant immediate deletion. I'm as strong an opponent of cruft as the next person, but this isn't cruft.--<a href="../../../e/t/a/User%7EEtaonish_6b71.html" title="User:Etaonish"><font color="green">Etaonish</font></a> 01:37, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I can see the arguements of those who vote keep and could almost do so myself, but this would not be a good precedent. Starcraft is a great game, but listing the best players of various computer games is not a good direction to go in my opinion. There is just too small a segment of the world population that actually care about this, making notability questionable. I myself was an avid Starcraft player back in the day, but I never particularly cared who the top ranked people were. Not claiming that this means no one should find it interesting or important, just that not even all Starcraft fans feel this topic is important. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:54, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>

Who is to say whether or not computerized games call for the same attention? Are there specific criteria that have been agreed on by the community? If not, why not? If we're going to say that computer games aren't notable enough, then we need to have criteria saying what kinds of games ARE notable enough to have player lists.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Sorry Ashton. Thanks for contributing to Wikipedia, but we can only accept articles on certain topics. Not everyone in the world is entitled to an article. Certainly not me and probably none of the people who've voted on this page. If we created articles on ourselves they would be deleted. There is also a message that comes up above the edit box when you create a page. It says something along the lines of "don't create an article to promote yourself." I'm afraid this article falls under that category. We appreciate that you haven't put anything rude or offensive in it, but that doesn't mean it belongs in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I hate The Clash. I hate people who say they like The Clash. The same people instinctively say they like Bob Marley and Beethoven, because they want people to think kindly of them; but <i>I alone</i> know their game, I can see through their disguise of lies, their pies. I hate triple albums. I hate words which end in -ville. I hate Seville, for example, filthy town. I also hate people who say they like a certain band's second-best album, because they think that if they say they like that band's best album, people will think that they are shallow, but at the same time they don't want to pick something <i>too</i> unusual because they don't want to lose the audience. 'Hitsville UK' was a single from 'Sandinista', the Clash's most reviled and longest album, and it sold no copies and meant nothing to anybody and didn't change anybody's opinion about anything, certainly not my opinion about The Clash, who I hate. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I hate the socio-medial crust which has built up around the Clash. With my vote here, I will destroy this crust. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 21:04, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Anyway, I still don't think this qualifies as a terribly noteworthy song. I'm a Clash fan, many of my friends are Clash fans, and none of us have ever paid this song any notice. Just 4 mintues and 21 seconds to get through between The Magnicifent Seven and Junco Partner. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - stupidity on my part. It is not very notable and unless the page begins to include the meaning of the song and its relevance (like the Washington Bullets page) then it should be deleted.

<li>Putting my serious hat back on, and about 'the meaning of the song and its relevance', which struck me as I edited bits of the Sex Pistols' <a href="../../../g/o/d/God_Save_the_Queen_%28Sex_Pistols_song%29_d865.html" title="God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)">God Save the Queen</a>, and the thought which comes to my mind is that even if we write 'many people consider that the song is about X' or 'the third line of the second verse is probably a reference to Y', well we can't do that, can we? Because it would be original research; the editorial voice is asserting something to be so. We can only quote external sources, sources of merit and substance, which makes it <i>dashed hard</i> to write articles about pop songs. Even if the song semi-explicitly makes reference to a specific event, such as <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_on_the_Water_a66d.html" title="Smoke on the Water">Smoke on the Water</a> for example, we still have to cite sources. In fact, <a href="../../../s/m/o/Smoke_on_the_Water_a66d.html" title="Smoke on the Water">Smoke on the Water</a> itself is unacceptable in its current form, because it has no sources, has lots of bald statements, and uses value judgements all over the place ("despite the heaviness of the guitar part, constant movement and interplay within the supporting parts keeps the feel of the song from becoming leaden"). And it doesn't have any useful chart information, only something about a chart in America, a foreign market. -<a href="../../../a/s/h/User%7EAshley_Pomeroy_6ac2.html" title="User:Ashley Pomeroy">Ashley Pomeroy</a> 22:58, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Overall I'm tempted to give a little leeway in articles on songs in terms of what qualifies as "original research". It's well known that many songs are widely rumored to have certain meanings (true or not), that are almost universally known. Citing rumors can be difficult, at times impossible. We can't really have "that guy I was talking to in the cafeteria in my high school" as a source. Even posts on messageboards, which can be linked to, are hardly the sort of sources you'd want to include in an encyclopedia. Certainly just about everyone knows the rumor behind the Phil Collins song "In the Air Tonight", about the guy drowning and the other guy not doing anything to help. It's completley bogus, but it's such a common rumor that any article on the song would have to mention it, and I'm not exactly sure what one would use as a source. I'm sure there are plenty of other examples much like this. That's not to say we should open up the floor to any crank to write about what he thinks any given song is about (I once tried to convince a friend that the Franz Ferdinand song "The Dark of the Matinee" was about Lee Harvey Oswald, but I certainly wouldn't write that here, nor do I believe it). Well, that's my two cents anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 23:34, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> (under William V. Spanos). I've read some of Spanos's publications, and remembered his name afterward. I consider his work, as a body, prolific and high-quality enough to justify inclusion. Passes the professor test in my opinion. The current article is, obviously, still a stub. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 05:31, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Reasons William V. Spanos is more notable than just any old professor: 1. Major interpreter of Heidegger in the field of literary criticism (possibly the <i>most</i> important one currently writing). 2. Founder of <i>boundary 2</i>, an important journal in literary studies. 3. Extensive publication record including at least <i>four books</i>. -- <a href="../../../r/b/e/User%7ERbellin_dc87.html" title="User:Rbellin">Rbellin</a>|<a href="../../../r/b/e/User_talk%7ERbellin_8a70.html" title="User talk:Rbellin">Talk</a> 22:03, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I've been asked to comment about this, and while I would say that I'm not familiar with any of his work from my own dealings with the Heidegger, Arendt etc. discourse (it is certainly too generous to call him the most important Heidegger scholar in the field of literary criticism), he's certainly more important than your average college professor (just 12 hits on Google Scholar, but I get many more on the German Google itself, some 1000+, and including some very good ones), and the presses and substance matter of his pieces are solid enough. Of course, the article is a stub and is missing especially the key material contributions and merits of Spanos, but this is not a "vanity piece" (and if it were, I wouldn't care either; I think vanity is fine for those who have at least a bit of a reason to be vain, and the label of "vanity piece" in Wikipedia certainly does not bear as much as looking at it, let alone thinking about it - according to that, if Albee or Habermas or Rumsfeld would write their own basic entries, they'd have to be deleted). <a href="../../../c/l/o/User%7EClossius_b61a.html" title="User:Clossius">Clossius</a> 07:05, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think that keeping articles for each distinct type of car is a better plan in the long run. What seems non-notable today may be quite notable in the future, and the relevant facts might be harder to mine out. Besides, cluttering a car manufacturer's page or a universal "list of models" page with some potentially comprehensive information about one model or another could get unweildy, and segregating models off only for some car manufacturers creates inconsistency in the organizational scheme. <a href="../../../e/g/g/User%7EEggplantWizard_fc4d.html" title="User:EggplantWizard">EggplantWizard</a> 20:40, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> Personal essay. There are partial truths in there which could be encyclopedic, but none of them are adequately sourced. There is far too much problematic material in relation to salvageable material for it to be worth cleanup. In the opening sentences:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"the fact that intelligence is what sets the standards of who is dominant and who is not"—is that a fact? Sez who? Who is more intelligent, humans or bacteria? Who is "dominant?"</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>"In life there are two main goals, survival and passing on your genes." First, this is a badly constructed sentence. To what does "your" refer? You could rewrite it as "All living things have two main goals: survival and passing on their genes." Then you start encountering the logical issues. What does it mean to say that a living thing has "a goal?" And are survival and genetic self-propagation separate goals? Or is survival merely an means to the single goal of genetic self-propagation?</dd>

"Lithuanian cuisine" would be an encyclopedic topic, but as it stands, it is not an article on the history and peculiarities of the Lithuanian cuisinie, it's just a list of meals. Unless someone expands it now, I'd vote for deletion. By the way, should there be an article for each individual meal? I would say no.

It is a notable case, which a Google search shows, and it is treated in several articles in historical journals. Please look at the history of this article. It is most certainly not originally a copyvio. The essayish text which may be so was inserted on top of the original on Oct. 27, 2004. I have now reverted the article to the last version from before that date. Can the later versions be deleted somehow?

<li><b>Keep</b> in present form. The <b>case</b> seems to be <b>very</b> notable and it should be counted as a notable achievement for Gaines, who personally initiated the suit. It turns out that the New York Times published <i>three</i> articles about the case on December 18, 1938. One of is a long article with a long headline: "EDUCATION OF NEGROES TESTED BY NEW RULING; Missouri Plans Law School for Them And South Studies Implications of Supreme Court's Action SOUTH PUT IN QUANDARY." The story opens "State-supported education systems of the South have been severely jolted by the Supreme Court ruling this week... the decision is notice to all the Southern States that they must make far-reaching adjustments."

<li><b>Merge</b>. For reference, <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland-Palatinate_0b91.html" title="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a> is a state within Germany (a <i>Bundesland</i>), akin to a U.S. state or a Canadian province. By population, it's about the size of Oregon or Kentucky. From what I've seen, the trend is to keep articles about legislators at the national level, but it's a bit fuzzier for politicians working at lower levels. Perhaps this list should be merged back into <a href="../../../r/h/i/Rhineland-Palatinate_0b91.html" title="Rhineland-Palatinate">Rhineland-Palatinate</a>—it's only nine people, that article doesn't seem to be overly bloated at the moment, and it's the only article that seems likely to link to it.

<li>An election only happens every five years, although there are probably periodic cabinet shuffles. An "As of the $MONTH $YEAR election, the cabinet consisted of" at the start of the list seems to be all that is required to warn that the information can date. We have numerous articles on other political offices and officeholders that change on a regular or semi-regular basis, and it appears that this is a large enough region that someone will keep it updated. This is part of the reason I suggest a merger back to the main article—it will receive more traffic, and likely will be updated more punctually. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 17:30, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I still think it would be an encyclopedic article, but color samples would make it more visually appealing. Federal Standard 595 is the U.S. government standard for paint color and has color chips of all listed paints. It's a work of the government so is probably not subject to copyright, so neither would using them if they indeed relate to RLM colors.

<li><b>Delete</b>. What is an "other" country? The article describes itself as a list of "minor" countries' battleships. What is a "minor" country? On Wikipedia, there are no "other" countries and there are no "minor" countries. The author meant, "List of battleships that aren't on any other country lists"; but that is silly.

<li>I was of the opinion that, regardless of whether there should be an article about the NCMEC, it should certainly not be <i>this</i> article. Writing a decent article on them would, I think, have to start by deleting the entire current article. Since this is a lot worse than cleanup, I'd nominated it for VfD. I do usually google-test, but not if I believe that a blank page would be better than the current one. IMHO, of course. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 18:45, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main reason for using <a href="../../../c/v/_/WP%7ECV_27f7.html" title="WP:CV">WP:CV</a> for copy vios is that it creates a temp page for anyone wanting to start a clean copy of the article (assuming it's a worthwhile subject). It's a lot harder to attempt to save edits and history if a page fixed on VFD must later be deleted because the origial edit was a CV. It'll eventually be deleted anyway if no one takes an interest fixing it. Sorry for the sharp words. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 19:38, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li>Agreed. However I have been unable to verify that it is in fact copyvio. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 21:19, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, it <i>is</i> a straight copy &amp; paste from <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=1866" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=1866" rel="nofollow">[16]</a>. NCMEC appears to be a private organization chartered under a congressional act. It's possible that it might not be copyrightable as a work of the U.S. government, but I doubt it. (see their <a href="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=620" class="external text" title="http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PageServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=620" rel="nofollow">Reprint Policy for NCMEC Publications</a>). There seems to some confusion here as to what this organization is. As best I can tell, it's federally funded to carry out public policy and doesn't appear to be religious—its board members belong to many well-known public companies plus governmental and private secular organizations. <a href="../../../d/i/a/User%7EDialUp_ed76.html" title="User:DialUp">DialUp</a> 22:36, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Certainly, however the POV of an organization is no reason to delete it.

<li>I strongly disagree that it makes Wikipedia look bad. We have quite a bunch of R-rated categories already. However, it is true that being a porn star requires nothing but a certain morality, and the appearance (if female) or endurance (if male). Also, anything sex-related is likely to be over-represented on the internet, so the google test is not quite a balanced criterium when applied to porn. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 21:01, Feb 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Making no comment on the morality issue, I point out that Google Web is an <i>exceptionally</i> unfair barometer when it comes to pornography and pornographic actors and actresses, maybe even more so than it is for bloggers. The pornography web site publishers go to great lengths to ensure that it is that way. Try the Google Groups test instead of the Google Web test. (Hint: "Nautica Thorn" gets less than 1% of the number of Google Groups hits than <i>my real name</i> does.) <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:20, 2005 Feb 18 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Cr, you've proven yourself pretty resourceful. If she is a notable person, I challenge you to find out her real name, her date of birth, her educational background and training as an actress, the city she currently lives in, and a few other standard facts that biographies of living people on Wikipedia ought to have. The porn industry apes Hollywood, and wants to package the people they cast in the movies as "stars". Almost without exception, they are just exploited labor, and no more notable than a stripper, which most of them were or are. Wikipedia shouldn't be buying this nonsense. She might have a 100 video "credits" to her name but as Barno pointed out above, she is only 19 and has been working in the porn industry for a year or so, probably doing at least one video per week. Think about it. We shouldn't be evaluating the notability of these people like normal actors. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 12:31, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Wow — how insulting can you be towards one of the biggest (positive) contributors to wikipedia?

<li><b>Comment</b>. BM, what you challenge Cr to find out is unfeasible when it comes to porn actors, who act usually under fake names and try to hide almost every personal details of their lives. By the way, this is not just a matter of personal choice, but a policy strongly inforced by the porn industry. It is generally assumed that part of the "fantasy" involved in the enjoyment of this type of material would be destroyed if the viewer had knowledge of such information: the performances would look unreal if one knew this actress to be a mother with two kids, or this gay actor to be a dedicated husband. My point is: notability standards for porn actors cannot be the same as for, as you say, "normal actors". I concur, nevertheless, that number of video "credits" may not be a good one either. Could number of personal websites ("shrines" and the like) be considered a reasonable measure for porn notability? <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 21:53, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. RaD, I can be a lot more insulting, since so far I haven't been insulting at all. By the way, Nautica Thorn was indeed a stripper. But my point is that these actors are so lacking in notability that none of the usual information about them is available and verifiable. In fact, I'd propose the "Birth date test" for biographical notability: if it is impossible to find out the actual name and birthdate of a person from verifiable published sources, or any personal details, then that person is probably not notable enough for the Wikipedia. The publicists for the porn companies frame these people as "movie stars", and apparently some people are willing to buy into this framing, but these people are essentially faceless, history-less, nameless, pawns of the porn movie producers, and completely unnotable as individuals, with very rare exceptions. But Wikipedia doesn't need to fall for this. --21:33, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. BM, I still stick to the above line of defense. We have to use different notability standards for porn actors and actresses. Knowing one's birthday does not apply here, though I'm not really sure what could possibly apply. As I said, I'm making a point on a broader discussion: I will abstain from voting on this particular matter, because I am not prepared to establish in a definite way whether this person is really notable. <a href="../../../v/m/v/User%7EVmv_bc84.html" title="User:Vmv">vlad_mv</a> 22:00, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>There are a lot of interesting points being raised in this discussion. I would like to comment on several:
<ul>
<li>I don't think we need turn away from Google as a barometer. We routinely use Google a as measure of the fame of computer related topics, which are similarly biased towards high Google scores. Likewise, we know that the failure to get Google hits on a notable person from a developing nation is not a conclusive negative result. What we need to do is establish some topic-specific guidelines. For example:
<ul>
<li>N hits on a topic/person in a country with low internet usage</li>
<li>4N hits on a topic/person in a country with high internet usage</li>
<li>8N hits on a topic/person related to computers</li>
<li>8N hits on a topic/person related to pornography</li>
<li>10N hits on a topic/person related specifically to the internet, etc...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I don't think we should try to compare the level of effort or talent or skill or hard work between fields so much as we should try to look for what is notable <i>within</i> a field. For example, it could be said that just working in the porn industry for a year or two to produce 100-200 movies is not much of an accomplishment. But it doesn't take any longer than that to run for Mayor, or write a few comic books, or discover a few beetles (for a field biologist). We should judge these people against others in their industry. What percentage of all full-time musicians meet our criteria for inclusion? Perhaps we should try to profile a similar percentage of porn stars. I can tell you right now that will be a big percentage.</li>
<li>I don't think a "Birth Date test" is appropriate in this case. Surely we would not pull an article on a famous person from the 1800's because of uncertainty over the year they were born. We would not rule out a fictional character from a novel on that basis either. Similarly, the special characteristics of this industry mean that a publicized birthdate is not a common barometer of how important (or not) they are to their field. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohntex_d2fe.html" title="User:Johntex">Johntex</a> 02:13, 19 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Excellent point, Johntex. I think we can all agree that a porn actor/actress/movie is not inherently notable. So the question is, what makes a person notable within the field of porn? I think the amount of fans a person has would be representative. Also being represented in the media in another field than porn would help. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 13:22, Feb 19, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Can't be systemic bias surely - I am a Brit and totally bored with American politics. The <i>love politics</i> quote was put in to suggest that possibly we will not be inundated with lists for every American municipality.<br />
On the other hand, we don't even have cast lists for every <a href="../../../u/k/_/UK_7642.html" title="UK">UK</a> local government council - still less articles for each member.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The Canadian politicians I've seen in the last few days have been Members of Parliament--roughly equivalent to the legislators in the U.S. House of Representatives. There seems to be a building consensus that politicians at the <i>national</i> level are sufficiently notable for Wikipedia. On the otherhand, <i>municipal</i> politicians are more of a mixed lot. I would suggest that Mayors of all but the smallest communities should get the nod. As for aldermen, city councillors, and the like—I'd say that they need to be notable for some particular reason (in addition to just holding office) to be worth mention.

<li>Neutral. Personally, I don't think politicians at this level are notable. However, I believe quite a few have survived VFD (mostly from Canada, if I remember correctly).

<li>Consistency is good. There are several related discussions at the other Chicago aldermen VfD entries.

<li>I agree with the sentiment that six word (plus a couple of dates) substubs aren't worth adding--better to have a redlink until someone with more to say comes along. However, I also have difficulty with deleting encyclopedic subjects, so I added a bit paraphrased from a machine translation of the fr: WP. There apparently is much more about the guy that is encyclopedic (I couldn't figure out enuf about why it is claimed he was also an economist to add it) so I vote a weak keep on the slightly expanded article. Also, the original contrib is a long-time, respected WP editor, so any questions/comments about the brevity of the original article should probably be raised on his (I'm assuming) Talk page. <a href="../../../n/i/t/User%7ENiteowlneils_bf4c.html" title="User:Niteowlneils">Niteowlneils</a> 20:09, 17 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Generally speaking, this amount of biographical information is better to add to an annotated list of people, and start the article, whenever one gets the time, with at least a two- or three-paragraph stub. I have destubbed or at least desubstubbed a number of Swedish scientists. Agardh has been on my to-do-list for a while, together with his son <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jacob_Georg_Agardh_46b7.html" title="Jacob Georg Agardh">Jacob Georg Agardh</a>. They were both among the leading algologists of the 19th century (CAA probably <i>the</i> leading algologist of his generation).

<p>Are all female supermodels inherently notable? Is this one?

<li>The article doesn't do her justice. In the early 80's (I think it was--maybe late 70's) she was probably one of the top 3 best known supermodels (at least in the US), with numerous Sports Illustrated inclusions.

<li>Radiant makes a generalization of the mud without ever having played it. First off, it's not even Diku. It's LP. Also, it's not how many users, it's how the users interact. Some muds with hundreds of users you can't ever find because they're never interacting with anyone.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Dartmud is small because it is a mud among muds, where only the quick-thinking and adaptable survive. I'd take a small challenging mud - next to one of those giants with 1500 newbs who gripe constantly to the GM's - any day, as would anyone looking for a game worth playing for years without tiring. If you doubt, play for a week or two. And yes, the current description is severely lacking. Kiev

<li><b>Keep</b>: I've been active on muds for several years and have experience a lot of them. I have not seen another MUD that resembles Dartmud in all that time.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I have played Dartmud for over 4-years. I have been banned repeatedly and am still attracted to the originalities, player interaction and deep skill base, that I find myself, despite being banned, searching for alternative methods to playing Dartmud. However, I have also played other muds, like, Achaea, Age of Chaos, and Ancient Anguish. It should be noted that, in comparison, none of these muds come close to the kind of quality that Dartmud possesses. Thank you.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm a longtime player of DM, but I don't say "keep" for that reason, nor for DM's general wonderfulness. I vote to keep it because DartMUD happens to be one of the primary sources of inspiration for Ultima Online (which in turn inspired many other MMORPGs), something I notice isn't mentioned in the entry. Also, the first two posters who left comments could do well to remember that "notable" and "popular" are two different things entirely. As has been previously noted, the second person to comment made a generalization which was wrong in every aspect. I do agree that the article needs expansion.

<li><b>Keep</b> - But only if the description is changed. Dartmud is notable, as a small mud that has lasted longer than most. It's strong emphesis on roleplay creates an absorbing environment that one can easly be lost in for hours. It was innovative at the time of it's change over from level/xp to skill system, however in today's gaming society it is nothing new or innovative. It can be fun, it can be addictive, but that doesn't make it notable. 09:32, Feb 27, 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: Raph Koster, a creator for Ultima Online, once wrote: "DartMUD was influential on me, certainly--ought to have been for everyone. I think the key problem they had was that their system required a critical mass of players of diverse types in order to function, and they never really achieved that mass." Not a huge playerbase, yes. Influential? Yes. (It seems the original article has vanished. My source was an old post in our forums, which you can find at www.surfon.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ topic.cgi?forum=2&amp;topic=351.) Further, Björn Morén wrote: "One of the chief inspirations for simulationist design in the hobbyist community was the game DartMUD." (a live link <a href="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/01/the_value_of_re.html" class="external free" title="http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/01/the_value_of_re.html" rel="nofollow">http://terranova.blogs.com/terra_nova/2004/01/the_value_of_re.html</a>). I apologize if my previous post came off as an advertisement. Kiev</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Though the original article could use some changes. I am a long time player of Dartmud - and it is truly unique in many ways. One way is the way its political system works. Dartmud has the only completely unrestricted PK system I have seen which actually works. Most characters who have been around a few months have the ability to kill and hide most other characters - but the fact that a pk'er who makes one mistep will loose his own character tends to keep pk under control. It is true that most of the votes for keeping the page here are probably from Dartmud players - but I see no problem with the page existing on Wikipedia.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Each request for delete listed stems from ignorance on the part of the deleter. To briefly adress the points, the userlist numbers are not reliable -- this is a feature which allows users to hide their on/offline status. This is not a Diku. Although numberless interfaces are not at all uncommon, DartMUD pioneered the concept in '91. All areas are original, there are no stock areas anywhere in the Mud. Dartmud originated the 'craft' system. In all probability the move to delete was started by one or more players recently banned for cheating (apropos any number of recent threads at the dartmud forum <a href="http://www.surfon.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/forums.cgi?forum=2" class="external free" title="http://www.surfon.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/forums.cgi?forum=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.surfon.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/forums.cgi?forum=2</a> where the banned players have been causing any amount of trouble). With regards to the limited returns from a Google search, this is a result of an in-game policy which dissallows dissemination of information which can be obtained in-character through other means. DartMUD has a long history, has influenced the development of nearly every mud currently existing, and all of the commercial MMOGs currently running from Everquest to WoW. The DartMUD article certainly needs to be expanded such that it reflects the importance of DartMUD and its shaping of online gaming, but it is certainly noteworthy in any discussion of persistent online games.</li>

<li>Comment. Er, that's a bit of a specious comparison. Toronto is a city of three million people; Glenville has thirty thousand. Several of its <i>streets</i> are notable enough for articles (<a href="../../../y/o/n/Yonge_Street_db9b.html" title="Yonge Street">Yonge Street</a>, for instance). That said, I do believe that city councillors need to have <i>something</i> besides their office to give them notability. Involvement in major policy or controversy, extremely long service, etc. <b>Delete</b>.

<li>I realize it's not a perfect comparison; my point was where do you draw the line? At least with mayors you can make a pretty good claim that major city mayors are notable outside of their cities, certianly Guilliani, Bloomberg, Barry, Daly, etc. are, and you can argue that if a mayor isn't known outside his vicinity then he shouldn't have his own article. But councillors are <i>never</i> known outside of their city (perhaps there are a few exceptions), so we can't use the same criterion, or, if we do then we don't include any, which is I guess what I'm proposing. Maybe put them on a list. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:12, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is arbitrary, of course, but how about this: if the city itself warrants more than one article, then the major may be notable enough to get his own.

I've even been arrested four times, spent close to a week combined in jail, and lived with a warrant out for my arrest for months. Still doesn't make me notable. Stupid, maybe, but not notable.

<li><b>Keep</b>, although I hasten to point out mayoral candidates are not inherently notable <i>just</i> for being candidates; they need to have some additional criteria of notability.

<p>This is not a good definition.</p>
<p><br />
Dictdef. Incorrect pronunciation, as well. <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickK_c665.html" title="User:RickK">Rick</a><a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickK_fb75.html" title="User talk:RickK">K</a> 00:15, Feb 18, 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><strike><b>No vote</b>. The article needs some assistance, clearly, but, if we remove this, would we have to remove articles like <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verboten.html" title="Verboten">verboten</a> too? <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenSamples_15e8.html" title="User:BenSamples">BenSamples</a> 05:49, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)</strike>
<ul>
<li>Scratch that. <b>Delete</b>, and I'm marking <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verboten.html" title="Verboten">verboten</a> for VfD as well. <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenSamples_15e8.html" title="User:BenSamples">BenSamples</a> 05:49, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>, but leave <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verboten.html" title="Verboten">verboten</a> alone—it's been long-adopted into collequial English. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenOfAllTrades_d5ed.html" title="User:TenOfAllTrades">TenOfAllTrades</a> | <a href="../../../n/a/m/User_talk%7EName_00f8.html" title="User talk:Name">Talk</a> 14:19, 18 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But how is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verboten.html" title="Verboten">verboten</a> more than a dictdef? (I put it up for VFD already so you might want to see the discussion there.) <a href="../../../b/e/n/User%7EBenSamples_15e8.html" title="User:BenSamples">BenSamples</a> 07:31, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So is this about <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verboten.html" title="Verboten">verboten</a> or <a href="../../../v/e/r/Verstehen.html" title="Verstehen">verstehen</a>? Why do you compare the two words, which have nothing whatsoever in common?</p>
<p>Please reconsider your wish to have <b>Verstehen</b> deleted. It is used in the article on <a href="../../../m/a/x/Max_Weber_eff0.html" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>, but it has also been on <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Applied_arts_and_sciences_6b58.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Applied arts and sciences">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Applied arts and sciences</a> as well as <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequested_articles_Social_Sciences_and_Philosophy_3cc3.html" title="Wikipedia:Requested articles/Social Sciences and Philosophy">Wikipedia:Requested articles/Social Sciences and Philosophy</a>. The word also crops up in two lists, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_sociology_topics.html" title="List of sociology topics">List of sociology topics</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_criminology_topics.html" title="List of criminology topics">List of criminology topics</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, first someone thinks we need an article on that term, then someone else decides to have a go at it and writes a stub. Finally, you come along and want to have it deleted again. But the word is still on the Requested Articles list. And what exactly is it that is not legitimate about a stub? <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../k/f/_/User%7EKF_917d.html" title="User:KF">&lt;KF&gt;</a> 00:49, Feb 21, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep and expand significantly!!!</b> Verstehen is a fundamental component of a significant branch of sociology.

<li>OK, I added a little to it - definitely enough to take it out of the realm of mere definitions, but it does need more. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates">BD2412</a> 02:24, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
