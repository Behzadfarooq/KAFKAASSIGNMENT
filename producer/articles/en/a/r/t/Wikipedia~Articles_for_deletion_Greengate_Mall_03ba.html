<p>No assertion of notability. There are several of these n-n closed malls with articles in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_defunct_shopping_malls.html" title="List of defunct shopping malls">List of defunct shopping malls</a> and in <a href="../../../d/e/f/Category%7EDefunct_shopping_malls_0a21.html" title="Category:Defunct shopping malls">Category:Defunct shopping malls</a>.

<dd>I'm sorry but really doesn't connect to me, just because it's of a large link doesn't necessarily make it notable. Maybe there are some malls that are notable within that list, but being listed there doesn't create notability. There is nothing in that article to indicate that anything in terms of architecture, news, or anything else, made this mall noteworthy. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox">Yanksox</a> <sup><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox">(talk)</a></sup> 22:10, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Well, you will have to be <b>consistent</b>, look at the list and delete most of the articles because ther are many malls in the list that are "very minor" and non-notable. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoreau36_2b22.html" title="User:Moreau36">Moreau36</a>; 2215, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The nominator indicated that he was nominating this particular mall to obtain a conseus of this cat. If this article is deleted, then alot of articles will probably be thrown in.

<dd>As Yanksox said, I'm just testing the waters with this one. I'm sure that some defunct malls may be notable, but I think that this one, as well as others I would afd/prod if appropriate, is not. Don't worry too much about consistency, I'll address it if necessary after this afd. This nom is <i>just</i> for Greengate Mall, though I'd welcome comments on whether others think that more of the group of defunt malls may need to be discussed/nominated/prod'd/afd'd. <a href="../../../i/n/n/User%7EInner_Earth_8c4b.html" title="User:Inner Earth">Inner Earth</a> 22:31, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Query and Comment</b> A) Is there actually a Wikiproject relating to dead malls? B) If so, it should be based on malls which were notable. Existing malls may be different as they are existing large geographical features, but the defunct ones in the category seem to assert no notability, with several having very little content or scope for expansion that will not amount to pointless cruft. <a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">Jammo (SM247)</a> 23:04, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
