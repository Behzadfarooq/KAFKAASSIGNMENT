<p>Michael Grundt Spang (fødd 14. juni 1931 i Mandal, død 2003) var ein norsk forfattar og journalist. Spang arbeida for Dagbladet og Verdens Gang. Han var særleg kjend som kriminaljournalist, kriminalforfattar og samfunnsdebattant. I dei mange bøkene og artiklane sine uttrykte han ei gjennomgåande konservativ og systemtru haldning til norsk rettspleie og kriminalomsorg. Boka Torgersen-saken var eit tilsvar til Jens Bjørneboe si bok Tilfellet Torgersen, der Bjørneboe argumenterte for at den drapsdømte Fredrik Fasting Torgersen hadde vorte utsett for justismord.</p>
<p>Spang sin roman Operasjon V for vanvidd vart filmatisert i 1970. Saman med Kjell Syversen vann han i 1981 Nordvisjonens tevling om beste manuskript for TV-krim. Dramaet vart filmatisert i 1984 av NRK som SK 917 har nettopp landet. I 1985 vart romanen Spionen dramatisert som høyrespelserie av NRK Radio.69.207.105.212 00:01, 6 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>The Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library collects books and periodicals in architecture, historic preservation, art history, painting, sculpture, graphic arts, decorative arts, city planning, real estate, and archaeology. The architectural and fine arts collection are non-circulating. The Ware Collection, mainly books on urban planning and real estate development, do circulate.</p>
<p>The Avery Library is named for Henry Ogden Avery, one of New York's promising young architects in the late nineteenth century and a friend of William Robert Ware, who founded the Department of Architecture at Columbia in 1881. A few weeks after Avery's early death in 1890, his parents established the library as a memorial to their son. They offered his collection of 2,000 books, mostly in architecture, archaeology, and the decorative arts, many of his original drawings, as well as funds to round out the book collection, and an endowment to help the library grow. As of today, the Library now contains more than 250,000 volumes and receives approximately 1,500 periodicals.</p>
<p>The Avery collection in architecture is among largest in the world; it ranges from the first Western printed book on architecture, De re aedificatoria (1485), by <a href="../../../l/e/o/Leone_Battista_Alberti_ac56.html" title="Leone Battista Alberti">Leone Battista Alberti</a>, to the classics of modernism by <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Lloyd_Wright_96e4.html" title="Frank Lloyd Wright">Frank Lloyd Wright</a> and <a href="../../../l/e/_/Le_Corbusier_5fc7.html" title="Le Corbusier">Le Corbusier</a>. Avery's drawing and manuscript collection holds 400,000 drawings and original records. Most of the library's inventory is referenced in a database known as the Avery Index, used throughout the world.</p>

<p>Originally started in the fall of 2005 by the band's guitarist, Julian Neves-Cox, and vocalist, Natalie Backstrom, they were eventually joined by two friends and fellow classmates, drummer Christopher Schnack and bassist Scott Hensen.

<p>Hybrid encryption is an encryption method that utilizes a <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_key_cryptosystem.html" title="Public key cryptosystem">public key cryptosystem</a> and a <a href="../../../s/y/m/Symmetric_cipher.html" title="Symmetric cipher">symmetric cipher</a> (e.g., stream cipher). A symmetric key is randomly generated (session key) and is used to encrypt the input file. The symmetric key is in turn encrypted with the public key of the recipient. The resulting ciphertext is both the symmetric ciphertext and the asymmetric ciphertext. The asymmetric ciphertext is decrypted by the recipient, thereby revealing the needed symmetric decryption key which is used to restore the input file.</p>
<p>This method utilizes the speed advantage of symmetric encryption and the asymmetry provided by public key crypto. Encrypting bulk data using only public key crypto is typically very slow. When a stream cipher is used, typically an initialization vector is generated randomly and is included with the resulting ciphertext in the clear.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-04-07_2149.html" title="Edit section: General Miguel Iglesias, President of Peru">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">General Miguel Iglesias, President of Peru</span></h2>
<p><a href="../../../m/i/g/Miguel_Iglesias_eee7.html" title="Miguel Iglesias">Miguel Iglesias</a> was descended from Spanish colonists who emigrated to Peru in the eighteenth century, founded the Chota silver mine in northern Peru and with the profits acquired a 250,000 acre estate at Udima, near Cajamarca. Miguel Iglesias's father, Lorenzo, was a friend of Simon Bolivar and he was one of the group of dissident Spanish colonists who supported independence from Spain. In 1820, Lozenzo Iglesias married Rosa Pino and their son Miguel was born in 1829.</p>
<p>After having inherited Udima and during Peru's 1866 war with Spain, Miguel Iglesias recruited men local to Cajamarca as a private battalion, was one of the victors of the great battle on the "dos de mayo", was given the rank of Colonel and named as Prefect of Cajamarca. Soon after the outbreak of the War of the Pacific in 1879, whereby a coalition of Peru allied to Bolivia was ranged against Chile in what was to become the biggest international conflict in the history of Latin America, Iglesias was named as War Minister. In January 1881 Iglesias found himself defending the Morro Solar a hill just south of Lima gainst the Chilean forces who following a string of victories on land and sea were now marching upon the Peruvian capital city. Iglesias had 5000 men who were mostly from the area of Cajamarca and who had been armed and trained at his expense in order to defend Lima in last resort. After the Peruvian Army Second Division was forced to retreat from San Juan, the battle for Lima focussed on to the Morro Solar. The first Chilean assault on the hill was repulsed but then the Chileans brought up artillery as well as reinforcements of infantry. In a situation which mirrored the position at sea, the Peruvians had inferior weapons compared to those being operated by the Chileans, which were of the most modern European manufacture. Of Igleasias' 5000 men who defended the Morro Solar only 280 were taken prisoner when the hill was overrun. Igleasias' son, Alejandro, was killed aged 22. Igleasias was among the survivors along with Carlos de Pierola, brother of the Peruvian President, and a younger man named Guillermo Billinghurst. All three were about to be shot by a sergeant, amidst a brutal Chilean policy of taking no prisoners, when Billinghurst stepped out and persuaded the sergeant that he would do better to take them to General Baquedano, the Chilean commander. Thus both Miguel Iglesias and Guillermo Billinghurst providentially were later Presidents of Peru, instead of corpses.</p>
<p>On the orders of Baquedano, Igleasias was released for him to be able to try to persuade President Nicolas de Pierola to end the war, through Peru negotiating terms with Chile. The understanding as regards Iglesias's release by the Chileans had been that he would remain within the limits of Lima. However,Igleasias felt himself freed from that agreement because of the brutality and pillage he witnessed being carried out by the Chilean troops following their capture of the Peruvian capital city and the hoisting of their nation's flag over the Presidential Palace (the former seat of the Spanish Viceroys). Igleasias decided to escape from Lima and make his way to his home town of Cajamarca in the uninvaded north of the country. Following the defeat at the Morro Solar the Chileans declined to recognise de Pierola as President of Peru and replaced him with a puppet of their choosing. Responsibility for continuing the war against Chile therefore passed to Iglesias in the north and General Andres Avelino Caceres in the Andes. Igleasias won a great victory over the Chileans at the battle of San Pablo, Cajamarc, on 13th July 1882 but soon afterwards a fresh Chilean force reoccupied the region and started to carry out harsh reprisals. As a result, Igleasias began to be convinced that the war had to be brought to an end if Peru was not to be completelt devastated.</p>
<p>Igleasias has been severely judged by history because he represented crude reality in recognising that Peru had been so comprehensively defeated by the Chileans that the question was now whether Peru would continue to exist or not. Igleasias saw clearly that if Chilean occupation became entrenched Peru would become a de facto colony of Chile, rather than an independent nation. For this reason, he convoked a congress of the northern departments of Peru to proclaim him President and give him the necessary authority to start to negotite with Chile. After his claims to the Preseidency had been recognised by Chile, Igleasias proceeded to the small seaside resort of Ancon, a short distance from Lima, to fulfil the grim mission of statesmanship of ending the international hostilities by the Treaty of Ancon signed on 23 October 1883. The Treaty of Ancon had fourteen clauses and Peru lost the southern areas of Tarapaca, Arica, and Tacna. Subsequently, when Iglesias rode into Lima following the Chilean withdrawal he found the Presidential Palace stripped totally bare.</p>
<p>When MiguelIgleasias signed the Treaty of Ancon, he expected that his efforts to spare Peru further suffering and despoliation in a lost cause would be rewarded with popular gratititude. Instead, it took him almost two years to realise that most Peruvians could not admire the man who had made himself the symbol of Peru's admission of total defeat. Whereas Iglesias initiated the restoration of the Peruvian National Library which had been sacked by the Chileans during the occupation of Lima, he never discovered a formula for rebuilding Peru's political institutions. Unable to win friends through the judicious use of money because of the depleted state of the national Treasury, Igleasias turned increasingly to repressive measures to silence the opposition. The consequence was a guerilla uprising against him which increasingly attracted support from ordinary inhabitants of Lima. By December 1885 Igleasias understood the full degree to which he lacked popular support, renounced the Presidency and took refuge on an Italian ship.</p>
<p>In 1886 Igleasias went into exile in Europe where he spent two years in Madrid and Paris. In 1888 the government's ban against him was lifted and Igleasias was able to return to Peru. President Caceres reinstated Iglesias as a General on full pay but and in 1895 the people of Cajamarca voted Iglesias their Senator in the Peruvian parliament in an uncontested election.</p>
<p>Miguel Iglesias had eleven children. In 1895 his youngest daughter, Gaudencia, married a considerable Scottish entrepreneur named Edgar Fraser Luckie who had previously discovered the largest gold nugget found in the British Guiana gold rush in the 1880s and who, in 1896, acquired the Andahuasi sugar estate near Huacho. Many of Miguel Iglesias's personal chattels are in the ownership of the current generation of the Fraser Luckie family in Europe, including a full length portrait of Miguel Iglesias wearing General's uniform overlaid with the Peruvian Presidential sash of office, and the casket given to Iglesias by the Peruvian nation in thanks for his having brought the War of the Pacific to an end.</p>

In 1998 he initiated "Project Dragalic" in conjunction with UNA-USA and Roots of Peace to rebuild a community that was completely destroyed by the ravages of war and surrounded by one of the densest minefields in the Republic of Croatia. As a result of Rutherford's efforts,Dragalic is today a thriving community.</p>
<p>In 1999 Rutherford organised a landmark event in Petrinja, Croatia; Musicians Against Mines. The event was organised to raise funds to directly support local landmine victims and was attended by many celebrities to include 1997 Nobel Prize winner Jody Williams and Roots of Peace founder Heidi Kuhn.</p>
<p>During his tenure as OSCE Mine Action Co-ordinator, Rutherford raised in excess of $15,000,000 USD for landmine clearance, education and mine-victims assistance and was recommended for the Kralj Tomislav Medal for his service to the people of Croatia.</p>

<p>Fudgeamania (1990) is the third installment in Judy Bloom's <b>Fudge</b> series, following <a href="../../../t/a/l/Tales_of_a_Fourth_Grade_Nothing_8bdd.html" title="Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing">Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</a> and <a href="../../../s/u/p/Superfudge.html" title="Superfudge">Superfudge</a>.</p>
<p><b>PLOT</b></p>
<p>The story revolves around a summer trip to ?<a href="../../../m/a/i/Maine.html" title="Maine">Maine</a>? in which both the Hatcher family and the Tubman's (including daughter Sheila Tubman, deemed "Queen of Cooties" by protagonist Peter)partake. The tone is notably light as exploits include Peter's crush on the local librarian, his encounter with fictional baseball legend "Big Abphel," and his induction into the ISAF (I Swallowed a Fly) Club. The story culminates with the marriage of Peter's uncle and Sheila's aunt, which makes the two reluctant members of the same family tree.</p>

<p>"Maggie Duffy" is the world's first transsexual robot. Possessing the synthetic anatomy from both males and females, it is a promising step and certainly a culmination of Irish accomplishments, even though Maggie has never been to Ireland, since Joyce. Maggie is still in its preliminary stages and sometimes malfunctions, but so far it is a wildly successful operation. Invented by German scientists, the blueprints were stolen by the Russians and the production took place in an Antartican laboratory painted lime green by college students earlier this year. Everyone is proud of the operation. "It's one small step for man, one giant leap for transsexual robotics," says Vladimir Nabokov, who coincidentally shares a name with the Russian novelist but is of no relation to him.</p>

<p>The album was released in 2002 to enhance Simpson's career after the disappointment of her 2nd album Irresistible. Although the remix album did contain help from rappers Jermaine Dupri and Bow Wow the album and the Irresistible remix bombed due to lack of promotion from her label Columbia records. The album has sold a measly 28,000 copies to date and only charted on the Electronics Album Chart.</p>

<p>The Producer's Cut version of Halloween 6 shows you what was going to happen in Halloween 6. Such as a different ending, different scenes etc. The title of the film has an "a" that looks like the Thorn rune. However, there is less gore in this version of the film (eg.when John Strode gets killed, his head doesn't explode). At some of the scenes, there's a timer at the bottom of the screen. Instead of Jamie Lloyd getting killed on farm equipment, Michael stabs her and leaves her there to die. She survives though. But later on, she gets shot at the hospital by the Man in Black, who tells her that "her work is done". At the end, instead of Kara Strode being locked in a room in the sanitarium's maximum security ward, she is tied up in a cave and held hostage by the Thorn cult. They're using her as a final sacrafice to turn Danny into a serial killer like Michael. However, Tommy Doyle, (as an adult), cancels Michael's evil and stops him. In the end, Dr. Loomis ends up with the Thorn symbol mysteriously appearing on his hand. This film is rare because it shows you what was going to happen.</p>

<p>Clifton Village is a small community of approximately two hundred homes to the south of Nottingam. One enters the village on a forked one-way system through the village green, linking houses to the A453 trunk road which runs to the M1 motorway in one direction and central Nottingham in the other.</p>
<p>The green houses a dovecote, the Old Schoolhouse and the Village Hall, which was formerly a small school. The green hosts daffodils in the spring, and the occasional game of cricket in the summer. Well-established trees shield the green from the A453.</p>
<p>A number of older properties lie along Village Road, which runs from the green to Clifton Hall, the former aristocratic seat of the Clifton family and erstwhile Education Department of Nottingham Trent University. The Village church and Old Rectory lie along the road, the latter being used as a home for the elderly until sale by the council in 2005. A number of thatched cottages and antique streetlamps also adorn the road.</p>
<p>More modern developments were undertaken between the 1970s to the 1990s. A small horseshoe of 1970s homes centres around Groveside Crescent, which are notable for varied Anglo-Dutch design, a number possessing very steep pitched rooves, and for being unusually well spaced out, a result of the imposition of a spacing requirement as an antidote to the perceived intensity of other local developments. 1990s developments of red brick houses centre around Farriers Green and a small private road, Alwood Grove. At the time of writing (March 2006), work is currently underway to turn Clifton Hall into a number of luxury flats, with some new homes in the grounds. Smaller developments and individual builds also exist.</p>
<p>A long, thin park lined with trees, referred to as the grove, runs behind the village. Once the main thoroughfare into Nottingham, this now provides pleasant walks with excellent views of the river and valley below a steep cliff. It links up with footpaths and bridleways to the Beeston wier, Barton in Farbis and Thrumpton, among other places, providing access to a nearby small nature reserve centred around a pond, Holme Pitt.</p>
<p>May Day celebrations take place on the Green every year, organized by the Clifton Village Residents' Association.</p>

<p><b>Natasha '</b><i>"<b>Tasha Nelly</b>"'</i> <b>Nelson</b> was born July 28, 1989 in Columbus, Ohio. She came on to the rapping seen with her song "Stuck On You" with her fellow set member <b>Belinda "<i>Suga-B</i>" Nelson</b> which is also her twin sister. Growing up in the rough neighborhoods of Moose Cock made Tasha agressive. Moose Cock is a place where it is ranked the #2 most dangerous place on earth and Hell being first. Though know one knows where it is, Tasha's fellow members Suga-B and <b>Brittany "Killa B" Wade</b> and also herself claim it to be Nationwide. Some say Moose Cock is in Compton but have yet to prove that. Tasha was discoverd at the age 11 by Moose Cock and after that gave her a deal on Moose Cock records by the late <b>Kylese "K- Boogie" Boomer</b>. Tasha took Kylese's death hard and begin to quit music. After giving up Tasha was taken in by fellow set member <b>Bubbleyum</b>. Bubbleyum helped Tasha get on her feet and recorded <i><b>Non Amaro</b></i> Which means "no love" in Italian. People claimed on that album she was getting on rivalry Rah Digga. Her influences included Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown. Tasha Nelly still hangs with Moose Cock hard and has mixtapes coming soon.</p>

<p>Camp Impeesa was first founded during the late 1960s with the idea of having a <a href="../../../b/a/s/Base_camp.html" title="Base camp">base camp</a> from <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scouting.html" title="Scouting">Scouts</a> to take backpacking trips in the southern canadian rockies. This idea was abandoned by the camp committee during the 1970s and the camp became a residential program for Cubs and Scouts.</p>
<p>In 2001, Mike Bingley began the process of developing a high adventure camping program at Camp Impeesa. With the help of a dedicated team or youth and adults from around the world, this program became Impeesa Extreme. The program was launched in 2003 with six patrols from as far away as New York City and Chicago. The first summer included the additional challenges of <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forest_fires.html" title="Forest fires">forest fires</a>, including the <a href="../../../o/k/a/Okanagan_Mountain_Fire_bb66.html" title="Okanagan Mountain Fire">Okanagan Mountain Fire</a> which forced the program to move five times.</p>
<p>2004 saw the program triple in size, partially due to world of mouth advertising and the cancellation of the 2004 Saskatchewan Jamboree. 2004 was the last year that Mike Bingley was involved with the program.</p>
<p>2005 saw Chinook Council hire a full time outdoor program manager to take over the operation of the program for the 2006 season.</p>

<p>Born Robert Caveh Zahedi on April 29, 1960 in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Son of Iranian immigrants, Zahedi grew up in Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p>Zahedi studied philosophy at Yale University. Upon graduation Zahedi moved to Paris, France where he believed he would easily find funding for his films. He failed to interest any French producers in his projects about Arthur Rimbaud, Stephane Mallarme, and Eadward Muybridge. During this time Zahedi also succeeded in forever estranging himself from his idol Jean-Luc Godard with whom he had hoped to make films. Zahedi worked during this time as a film critic but was soon sacked when he concluded that 1984's Ghostbusters was the greatest film ever made. Zahedi has since stated that this conclusion was based on his homesickness at the time, and his rediscovery and appreciation of Hollywood filmmaking.</p>
<p>He subsequently left France and returned to Los Angeles to attend UCLA film school. Zahedi spent five years in the UCLA graduate program where he completed his first feature film A Little Stiff (1991) which he co-directed with fellow student Greg Watkins. The film recounts Zahedi's real life unrequited and obsessive love for a UCLA art student. Not only does he play himself in the film, but Zahedi was able was able to get his real life love interest and his "competition" to play themselves. A Little Stiff premiered at the Sundance film festival to critical acclaim but it did not bring commercial success.</p>
<p>His next feature film, I Don't Hate Las Vegas Anymore (1994), documents his attempt to bond with his estranged father and half-brother on a road trip to Las Vegas. Zahedi was criticized for insisting that his father and brother take Ecstasy with him, on film, in order to kick-start the bonding process.</p>
<p>In the 1990's Zahedi moved to San Francisco after accepting a teaching position there.</p>
<p>His next feature is the docu-diary In the Bathtub of the World (2001). In the film Zahedi attempts to shoot at least one minute of video diary every day for an entire year.</p>
<p>His latest film, I Am A Sex Addict (2005), has been in the works for fifteen years. Through re-enactments it recounts Zahedi's struggle with his addiction to prostitutes and the havoc it wreaked on his marriages and romantic relationships. The film has just had its theatrical premiere in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Zahedi has also appeared in several films in acting roles such as Richard Linklater's Waking Life (2001) and Citizen Ruth (1996).</p>

<p>Raze is an amateur film currently in post-production. It is written, directed and produced by a group of young film students. Its critical reception insofar has been generally positive, largely due to its innovative use of original action sequences, astounding locations and varied use of tempo in discourse scenes. Critisism rests however, however, on some questionable dialogue, and high level of realistic fighting.</p>

<p>Similar to the famed "turducken" yet going above and beyond your wildest carnivorous dreams. The BOPIMUTTURDUCKEN transcends the world of fowl and ventures into the realm of quadrapedic mammals. Essentially, the BOPIMUTTURDUCKEN consists of an elaboration of the famous "turducken" - a de-boned chicken stuffed into the body cavity of a de-boned duck which is stuck into a de-boned turkey. The "turducken" is then stuffed into the cavity of a de-boned lamb (hence, "mut" of the root word "mutton") crammed into de-boned swine (using the "pi" of "pig"), the creation finally reaching its pennacle as it is wedged into the de-boned body cavity of everyone's favorite bovine, the black angus steer.</p>

<p>A decade ago, aging was not an emerging issue in Pakistan, but over population and urbanization created the problem of “aging”, particularly in urban areas where life is in full swing— people have not enough time to attend the older ones. Aging has been viewed as either the product of biology or the outcome of socio-cultural norms? The emerging interest is the recategorization of later life as post-working life. It constitutes a significant shift in the attitude and behaviour of the society towards the segmented population of old people. Gerontologists are of the view that most of old people even having no major physical weakness are subjected to suffer the problems of aging just because of socio-cultural factors. In addition, most of the time, retired people experience a richer life as compared to a common person envisions but socio-cultural factors greatly affect the psychological state of mind of the old people, which in result create mental stress, social alienation, sense of deprivation and neglection. Out of 162.41 million population of Pakistan 6 percent people are at the age of 60 to 64 whereas 4.1 percent of population are at 65 years and over above. (July 2005 est.) In Pakistan, specifically in urban areas older people suffer a tense situation even having productive assets. Our cultural norms and shared values with the west have increased the vulnerability of old people to be stigmatized as un-productive and burden on society. Moral values are demolished whereas new so-called western system is popular. In urban areas productive proportion of the population looks down upon the older ones as they are no more productive. No doubt, in present time availability of good medical facilities tapered mortality rate and population trend of the country has shifted towards the increased life expectancy which is 63 years on average—resulting in the increase of older people proportion from 3.5 in (2001) to 4.1 % in (2005). Most of the old people are in position to work effectively, but cultural restrains and societal obligations just obstruct the old people to get engaged in some productive work. Societal perception and attitudes are such developed that young generation think just the wastage of time to be spent with their older ones. Typically living environment of old people is regrettable. In west the concept of old house is popular but in Pakistan this concept is not enough mature. Old people are kept in their native homes but at a great distance; a psycho-social distance that is much deplorable for old ones and they feel themselves “cut off” form society. Ironically old people are labeled as indifferent, their actions are considered as conservative, and their presence is taken as surplus. Community based efforts for old people’s psycho-social adjustment are missing. Along with this there are no practical policy measures adopted by Government and NGOs that may soothe old people for getting the sprit to live. Govt. polices and NGOs efforts are just on paper having no practical implication. Govt. and NGOs workers pose to work much efficiently for the welfare and rehabilitation of senior citizens but old people’s plight is on the scene. Urbanization and nuclearization have shifted the role of ‘decision making’ from parents (old) to economically active children. Urbanization that seems inevitable in contemporary world and economics of the family seems to direct the house hold decision making, old people role is much limited. In Pakistan, aging is not being viewed as significant problem but the demographic predictions and statistics show an alarming picture of the situation. According to demographers, Pakistan will become the third most populous country of the world in 2050. Life expectancy is also supposed to increase from 63 years. Aging problem will be prominent in future times. But it does not mean that we should just ignore and discard this important segment of population. We are in need of individual, community, and Govt. level efforts to soothe our senior citizens. Senior citizens are in need of love and care that they deserve. It’s our moral duty to regard and care our older ones as they have spent their whole life in our nourishment and care. It seems that we are not on right direction to achieve moral as well as demographic goals. Safdar Abbas Lecturer of Sociology, Virtual University of Pakistan.</p>
