<dd>Okay, I phrased that badly. I should have said that <i>the article</i> provides no evidence that this term is in common, widespread use. Encyclopedia articles need to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> and their subject has to be, in my opinion, important enough to merit an encyclopedia article. If you want to rewrite the thing, I will reconsider my position but a handful of hits to websites doesn't equal notability AFAIC. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 06:26, 11 January 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Also, since the <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manchester%2C_New_Hampshire_7d61.html" title="Manchester, New Hampshire">Manchester, New Hampshire</a> contains the term, I don't think it needs a seperate article. <a href="../../../r/e/y/User%7EReyk_0a6a.html" title="User:Reyk">Reyk</a> 06:30, 11 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>I have to agree with Fuma. Google shows over 11,000 separate uses of the term online in various contexts. It has been used for quite a long time here (in Manchester, NH.) The owner of the Website manchvegas.net (which was registered by that person in 2000, according to whois) says he's not OLD enough to know the origin of that term. I don't know him, but even if he's just 20, that's establishing long-term use.</p>
<p>An article in the Hippo Press newspaper (a local alternative weekly) back in the <a href="http://www.hippopress.com/pubnote/pubnote05818.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hippopress.com/pubnote/pubnote05818.html" rel="nofollow">summer</a> noted that, "the mayor is pushing to replace the nickname ManchVegas with Manchhatten" (meaning Manchester+Manhattan.) He's now the former mayor. Maybe there was a backlash. Still, the mayor (who's about 60) knew the term and knows it is well-used.</p>
<p>The paper also noted in an article that someone was selling "ManchVegas" t-shirts. His Website noted that they sold extremely well after the article came out. Not solid evidence, but at least hearsay evidence.</p>
<p>A 2003 <a href="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_Hampshire/Manchester-831355/Local_Customs-Manchester-R-1.html" class="external text" title="http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/North_America/United_States_of_America/New_Hampshire/Manchester-831355/Local_Customs-Manchester-R-1.html" rel="nofollow">note</a> on Virtualtourist.com sums things up well: "Residents reflect the regional dry humor by referring to sedate Manchester as 'ManchVegas'."</p>
<p>Anyway, it's recognized, and yes, it's a colloquialism. I do, however, think this article needs expansion, if it's going to stay. Maybe Fuma should contact me and we'll do some more digging for sources. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 07:01, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I do have to add that "No evidence that anyone ever actually uses it" can't possibly be the case, given even the barest of citations I have submitted. Was any research done to back that up, or was it assumed someone just made the phrase up recently? <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 07:42, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><s><b>Redirect</b> Now, i'll be perfectly honest here, I thought a buddy of mine made this term up, and when I saw this AfD I was convinced he was the person who wrote it. I was wrong. In either case, this should be redirected to Manchester, NH because there's nothing here. I'm not sure this will be much more than a stub, and it doesnt deserve a stub status - make a subsection in the Manchester page. If it does turn out I'm wrong, and there is a not of stuff on the term, it can always be re-split later.</s><b>Keep</b> Article's been fleshed out more than I thought it could be. --<a href="../../../j/f/g/User%7EJfg284_447f.html" title="User:Jfg284">jfg284</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/f/g/User_talk%7EJfg284_403e.html" title="User talk:Jfg284">you were saying?</a></sup> 12:32, 15 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You may very well be right. However, consider that this is a cultural distinctive like any other. If the Kurdish <a href="../../../w/o/r/Work_song.html" title="Work song">Work song</a> deserves a page (and a very short one at that) and the cultural peculiarity of the <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scottish_cringe.html" title="Scottish cringe">Scottish cringe</a> does, and - perhaps the most analogous - the oft-used term "<a href="../../../m/a/s/Massholes.html" title="Massholes">Massholes</a>" has it's own page, then a nickname that is well known and, frankly, is well used deserves one, too. Frankly, this almost qualifies as a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portmanteau.html" title="Portmanteau">Portmanteau</a> word - which combines two words into one. Though it may be dubiously one, since I'm not sure place names fit in that definition. If so, however, the word rises to a new level of legitimacy. This evening, I hope to start expanding the article with sources I've found, and perhaps it will win converts. <a href="../../../n/h/p/User%7ENhprman_7c20.html" title="User:Nhprman">Nhprman</a> 20:37, 11 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Strong Keep</b> - I'm a local, and this word is used frequently among youth circles, particularly through the diffusion medium of the <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hippo_Press_85d1.html" title="Hippo Press">Hippo Press</a>, the primary source of youth media in the area, which has built up the term. I'll try to build the article where I can, but this is definately notable, at least in terms of New Hampshire. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKarmafist_f82f.html" title="User:Karmafist">karmafist</a> 18:31, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
