<p>The High Probability Instruction (HPI) treatment is a behaviorist psychological treatment based on the idea of positive reinforcement. It consists of the idea of reinforcing an instruction with a low probability of compliance by using the reinforcement of an instruction with a high probability of compliance. So that a non-complying person should ultimately comply to a given order. It can be particularly useful in autism treatment as well as addiction treatment. HPI can be considered a typical CBT treatment.</p>

<p>A concert is a live performance, usually of music, before an audience. The music may be performed by a single musician, sometimes then called a recital, or by a musical ensemble, such as an orchestra, a choir, or a musical band. More informal names for a concert include "show" and "gig". Concerts are held in a wide variety of settings or venues, including pubs, nightclubs, houses, barns, dedicated concert halls, large multipurpose buildings, and even sports stadiums. A concert held in a very large venue is sometimes called an arena concert.</p>
<p>There is normally a charge to attend a concert. A concert tour is a series of concerts by a musician, musical group, or some number of either in different cities or locations. While the principal reason for a concert is the opportunity for the musicians to perform in front of an audience, even the most purely artistic of endeavors will see gains. Concerts provide the musician’s exposure to the public. An attendee will probably see the musicians perform again if the concert was worthwhile. Recording artists usually go on tours to promote record sales and introduce their fans to new musical compositions. Some musicians and musical groups are known for consistently touring and performing live, others rarely so.</p>
<p>Musical groups with large expected audiences can put on very elaborate and expensive affairs. In order to create a memorable and exciting atmosphere and increase the spectacle, the musicians will frequently include additional entertainment devices within their concerts. These tend to include changeable stage lighting effects and various special effect visuals, which include anything from large video screens, inflatable, smoke or dry ice, pyrotechnics, artwork, pre-recorded video, and unusual attire. Some singers, especially in genres of popular music, augment the sound of their concerts with pre-recorded accompaniment and even broadcast vocal tracks of the singer's own voice. After the songs end, the drums and cymbals bang and crash, or do a drum roll, and the electric guitar rolls, or yells. (There are even long ones with fireworks and the singers going crazy on stage). Activities which may take place during large-scale concerts including dancing, sing-along, moshing or head-banging, and crowd-surfing.</p>
<p>Larger concerts involving a greater number of musical groups, especially those that last for multiple days, are known as festivals. Examples include the Alan Jackson, Aerosmith, Shakira, Shaggy, Andre reiu and so on.

<p>Stingfish is an alternative rock band from Wellington, New Zealand, where they formed in early 2004 with a determination to create a professional and powerful sound. The name Stingfish occured to guitarist "Trick" in a vision.</p>
<p><br />
During 2004-2005 the band played 32 shows and recorded the 5 track EP ‘Down on the Street’ with producer Mike Gibson (whose past work includes the likes of Shihad, Fur Patrol, Letterbox Lambs and the Phoenix Foundation). Track One Eyed was selected for the NZ On Air ‘Off the Record’ initiative and was playlisted on the Rock FM during Dec 2005. One Eyed also received airplay on Fresh FM (Nelson), Vision FM (Palmerston North), The Generator FM (Hamilton), Submarine FM (Tauranga), Munt FM (Wellington), Radio Active (Wellington).</p>
<p>Track Opinionated received airplay on Kiwi FM, BFM (Auckland) Vision FM (Palmerston North), The Generator FM (Hamilton), Submarine FM (Tauranga), and Munt FM (Wellington). 2006 has seen the band continue to play energetic live shows and also focus on developing new material in preparation for a future recording.</p>
<p><b>Reviews of the Down On The Street include:</b></p>
<p>"the sort of rock 'n' roll that makes you want to get up off your lazy ass for fear of letting life pass by for even a second... a sound that finds its feet firmly in the kiwi rock bracket..." - Real Groove Magazine</p>
<p>"...an assured EP from a polished act... Opinionated buzzes along in a manner reminiscent of the no-frills post-punk of vintage Husker Du or Guided By Voices. They have the chops (in both the playing and song writing departments)..." - The Package Gig Guide</p>
<p>"The debut Stingfish EP showcases the strong songwriting talent of a band so incredibly earnest..." - Rip It Up Magazine</p>
<p>"Glimpses of Silverchair and even Feeder … strong Shihad feel… extremely polished and I’m sure there’s a lot more tocome from this band” - Missing Link Magazine</p>

<p>Tittitainment: Where did that term originate? AFAIK some US Official once said during the seventies or eighties that there would not be work for everyone anymore, and that the people would instead have to be fed and kept amused with something or other and "Tittitainment".</p>
<p>I remember this, but I have no idea who or when it was. I have a faint Idea it was Zbginiew Brzezinksi befor he came into office, but I simply do not know and cannot find it. However, the term "Tittitainment" is used as if everybody knew from where it originated.</p>
<p>Any Help /Ideas?</p>
<p>Anyone sure of the quote and origin?</p>

<p>ABOUT ARCHIVE is a music band is based on two persons: &gt; Darius Keeler &gt; Craig Walker</p>
<p>ALBUMS &gt; You All Look The Same To Me &gt; Michel Vaillant &gt; Noise</p>
<p>DARIUS KEELER BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>I started playing music when I was six years old at school. They had these three trumpets and gave me one to learn as I showed an interest in it. I learned classical music as my mum and dad wouldn’t let me listen to pop music at that time. After two years of playing the Trumpet I moved onto the French horn and started playing in orchestras. This was very helpful later on when I wanted to arrange strings and brass. I played the horn for about another three years in which time I started getting into pop music.</p>
<p>The first record I brought was Dexy’s Midnight Runners’ ‘O’ Geno’. I moved swiftly onto The Beatles and, inspired by the introduction of Sgt Peppers Reprise (the drum break intro), I started playing the drums. From that moment I started trying to form various bands. I always found it quite hard getting on with other band members because I used to write the songs and knew exactly what I wanted them to sound like. By the time I was 17 I had my own four-track recorder and was recording on my own. At this time I had started getting into electronic music, Detroit House and UK hardcore music was beginning.</p>
<p>My elder brother had moved to London and brought a sampler AKA1 5900 and asked if I wanted to combine his equipment with mine, I agreed. My brother also knew Kristen Ogden the man behind Genocide 2. He had made a few bootlegs and had done the first three Genocide 2 releases that were very groundbreaking. He wanted to do a hardcore tune with chords and vocals, so we went up and within a month we had done our first tune together under the name Turbulence. Soon after he approached me to do the next Genocide release with him, ‘Narra Mine’. This is where I first met Danny Griffiths. We all worked on the tune together, Dan working with the rhythms and myself with the lyrics and music. We finished it in two days and it became an underground classic. Dan and myself eventually parted company with Kristen and started working on our own music. We had our own label for a while and released about four tunes. These were progressive house records and were great for experimenting with sound and arrangements.</p>
<p>I soon got bored with the limitation of house music and went back to the drawing board. Dan went to Australia for a year in which time I met Rosko. He was a great rapper and had an inspiring outlook on music. I wasn’t really into mixing slow British breakbeat music with rapping, but with Rosko it seemed to work. Within a year of recording we had the demos for Londinium ready. Dan had come back from Australia and Roya Arab was working with us. We named the band Archive and before we knew it we had every record company in the country trying to sign it.</p>
<p>It was all down hill from there. Record companies can be hard work, especially if the band don’t get on either. So within two years Dan and myself had fallen out with Roya and Rosko and lost our record deal. By this time Dan and myself were experimenting with song writing. Something I had done many years ago with my early bands but only touched on in Londinium.</p>
<p>‘Take my head’ was an experiment of that, which is why it is a fairly ropy album. I think with “You all look the same to me” we had found something we were happy with, a way of self-expression using sound arrangements and songs.</p>
<p>I think if you get these three things right you can make the most expressive music of all.</p>
<p>Written by Darius Keeler</p>
<p><br />
CRAIG WALKER BIOGRAPHY</p>
<p>I started playing music in primary school at the age of 8. Mr Ferriter, my teacher at the time, was a music buff and encouraged me to take up the recorder. I found it easier than all the other kids to pick up, and I was quickly annoying anyone unlucky enough to be around me by playing ‘You Fill Up My Senses’ by John Denver.</p>
<p>I continued with the recorder until i saw The Jam on Top Of The Pops. I no longer wanted to play recorder and hassled my parents into getting me an acoustic guitar. I quickly realised the guitar was going to be a bit more tricky to learn, so I took some lessons with a teacher called Kevin, he introduced me to the wonders of John Carpenter and Sergovia. I played classical guitar for a couple of years and then got my first electric guitar. I can't remember the make but it was dark red and most probably rubbish but it changed my life forever. I started writing songs immediately and found the neck so much easier to handle than my acoustic, I could experiment with chords and noise, and fell in love with it.</p>
<p>My brother, Keith, had got himself a drum kit for xmas so we nearly had a band. Mick Kerslake joined us for a while on bass and was eventually replaced by Michael Lennox, who was a friend. We practiced in the smallest garden shed and started playing under the name ‘Power Of Dreams’. We played school halls, scout halls, teen discos and anywhere that would have a bunch of snotty nosed kids.</p>
<p>We made a demo and started playing the legendary underground bar in dublin’s ‘Dame Street’, regularly. Jeff Brennan was the owner and didn't mind us being underage. We played Saturday afternoon gigs that were pure punk rock. Our friends could come and see us and get pissed so everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Somebody gave a copy of our demo to a guy in London who was starting up a label. He loved it and got us to record an ep called ‘A Lttle Piece Of God’. It got rave reviews in the english press and we were suddenly hot property. We signed to Polydor Records, December 1989, it was my first record deal, aged 17. We recorded our first album "Immigrants Emmigrants And Me", early 1990, and it came out later that year. Ian Olney, a guitar player from Cork city, joined us to tour the album and never left. We toured the world for 18 months, having the time of our lives, supporting The Pixies, The Wedding Present, Wire, The Mission and many others.</p>
<p>We were having such a good time we forgot to write songs. We recorded a second album ‘To Hell With Commonsense’, and got dropped the week after release. We continued as a band and signed to Lemon Records in the UK and Polygram in Japan, where we had a strong fanbase. We recorded an album, ‘Positivity’, and then the label collapsed. We recorded our final album ‘Become Yourself’ and finally called it a day in 1995. We played a final show in Dublin and said goodbye.</p>
<p>I had to re-adjust to everyday life and started a succession of jobs I would rather forget. I did meet Gary Oldman while working in the Five Bells on the Old Kent Road in 1997.</p>
<p>It took a while but I eventually got a band together with Ian Olney, Chris Pierce and Morty MacArty, called ‘Pharmacy’. We signed to an American label that folded before we got to release our album. We were gutted and broke up after releasing only one single called ‘Shine’. I ended up working in music retail for a few years and, apart from the shit pay, I enjoyed being a music fan again. I had no desire to play music for a couple of years until one day, while sitting in the canteen at my job, I saw an ad for a band looking for a singer. It was the first time I ever answered an ad like this and, before i knew it, Darius was in my living room telling me his vision and plan, and I liked what i heard. I joined straight away and was in the studio the next day recording with Archive. I met Dan and Pete, Archive’s long term engineer and fourth member of the band, and fitted into Archive's world immediately. They spoke the same language as me, believed in the power of song as much as i did, had been jerked around as much as i had, and yet they retained an innocence that was as infectious then, as it still is now. I was in the band I had always wanted to be in.</p>
<p>Today we released ‘Noise’, I couldn't sleep much last night, nerves i guess, so i got up late this morning and listened to ‘Noise’. I felt proud of Dan, I felt proud of Darius, I felt proud of Pete, I felt proud of myself….we've come a long way!</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-08-07_dea2.html" title="Edit section: Batrider">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Batrider</span></h2>
<p>Batrider are a musical group consisting of 3 girls and 1 guy that write and perform noisy offensive music with a natural ability for melody and songwriting that set them apart from many artits.</p>
<p>Much of Batrider's appeal and originality is born from their rufusal to imitate fashionable trends in music or style. They have been heavily praised for their ability to create loud and abrasive songs that manage to retain the pop sensibilities of the Beatles or the Rolling Stones. They have been described as sounding "like The Yeah Yeah Yeahs if Patti Smith or Janis Joplin were watching".</p>
<p>Originating from small town New Zealand in 2003, Batrider toured their own country heavily during their first year as a band and built up a strong and loyal live following across the country. In 2004 they released "They Said You're Hideous" a self funded, self produced debut album. However, they became disenchanted with the lack of support for original artists in their homeland and relocated themselves across the Tasman to Melbourne in 2004 where shortly after they secured a record deal with renowned independent Australian label Remote Control Records (Pixies, Cat Power, TV on the Radio, Dirty Three, Elliott Smith among others). In early 2006, they rereleased "They Said You're Hideous", this time to Australian audiences, receiving no end of praise and an awed response from music critics.</p>
<p>Maintaing their DIY ethic, Batrider have self-funded several tours of Australia since landing in Melbourne, as well as playing shows with established Australian icons the Dirty Three and UK sensations Sons and Daughters. They have also self-funded two separate tours back to New Zealand in this time.</p>
<p>The artwork and posters of Batrider is made solely by the members of band, and has built a cult following of its own. Published works can be found in many notable magazines and websites including international youth culture magazine Vice, and the Oxford American.</p>

<p>Patrique is an American author, socialite, and fashion designer.</p>
<p>Patrique first came in to the public eye in late 2005/early 2006 as a socialite when his antics with British socialite Shane Tyas became a fixture in internet gossip blogs. On December 23, 2005 Girlstalkinsmack.com reported that Patrique and Tyas would be starring in a Fox spinoff of the E! program "The Simple Life" starring Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie. Then, on January 21, 2006 FadedYouth reported that Patrique would be suing Shane Tyas for $3 million. Patrique reportedly filed the lawsuit with Paris Hilton, and gossip blogger Perez Hilton.</p>
<p>In 2006, Patrique released his first book "Beverly Hills 60643" with print on demand company Lulu. The book chronicled the lives of four teenagers in the wealthy Chicago community of Beverly. The book recieved a fair amount of public attention, the book has yet to recieve any commercial success, lurking at the bottom of the Lulu.com sales chart.</p>
<p>Also in 2006 Patrique released his own clothing line called "Strength: By Patrique" the line featured highly priced clothes for all ages.</p>

<p>Chappy's premature death is a loss for all of us. His "Watch Steal" video is a classic, created with the other CB, Charles Bach.</p>
<p>Chappy was born in 1964 and died in 1998. Although young, he was a famous face around Las Vegas, performing at Ceasar's Palace and on the strip itself.</p>
<p>A stirring two-hour service was held at Caesars Palace that used music, magic and video montage to eulogize Brazil, 33, who died in an accident involving a Las Vegas police vehicle.</p>
<p>Chappy was riding his motorcycle on Industrial Drive around 12:43 a.m., Saturday 29th of June, when he was hit by a black-and-white squad car driven by Las Vegas police officer Edward Jones.</p>
<p>The service ended with Bach taking the watch off his wrist and smashing it with a rubber mallet.</p>
<p>Bach said later that the watch had special meaning to him, because on the night of Brazil's death, he had finished a videotape that he and Brazil put together, instructing magicians on how to steal watches. Chappy was on his way to Bach's house to look at the video, Bach said, when he died.</p>
<p>Lorena Brazil, Chappy Brazil’s wife, filed a lawsuit against the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, Edward Jones and the Nevada Power Co. on Monday July 19 1999 for violations of Brazil's civil rights which caused his death on Jun. 28, 1998 in the head-on collision with a speeding police car.</p>
<p>Eye witnesses contradicted the officer's statement that he was using his lights and siren at the time of the collision, which occurred on the wrong side of the road, and had no skidmarks at the scene. The officer admitted exceeding the speed limit.</p>
<p>The result of the legal action is unknown.</p>

<p>Frank Seiberling was born on October 6, 1859, in Summit County, Ohio. He attended Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio, for two years, before becoming the secretary and treasurer of the J.F. Seiberling Company in Akron, Ohio. Seiberling's father began this company, which produced farming machinery, several years earlier. The younger Seiberling also became involved in other businesses, including banking and electric railways.</p>
<p>In 1898, Seiberling began the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company in Akron. The firm quickly emerged as a leader in the production of rubber items, including bicycle tires, pneumatic carriage and automobile tires, horseshoes, and hoses. Seiberling remained as the company's president until 1921, when an economic recession prompted him to resign. Soon thereafter, Seiberling began the Seiberling Rubber Company in Barberton, Ohio.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, Seiberling became famous for his fair treatment of workers. He also donated millions of dollars to charitable causes in his community. Seiberling served on the board of trustees of Buchtel College and assisted this institution in becoming the University of Akron. Seiberling died in 1955.</p>

<p>The Trumpeter of Krakow is as famous today as he was centuries ago. His trumpet call which is sounded every hour on the hour from the bell tower of a famous old church is a sound familiar to all who live in this very old Polish city. Stories about the trumpeter abound. His famous suddely ended call stems from the time when the city was besieged by the invading Mongol horde. A Mongol arrow struck down the trumpeter as he was almost finished with his call. Thus, ever since, the trumpet call has been suddenly cut off, in memory of the courageous trumpeter who stood by his post in a time of great danger.</p>

<p>The pirate Lemurs's humble beginnings started with the Infamous Seinor Chinchilla R. Lemur. He formed a small club and that club grew into what we all know and love as the Pirate Lemurs! They sail around tree tops and pillage small families of birds, and towns of squirrels, the most famous of the Pirate lemurs however is Ghostlemur, who was the first one to actually use Flash to advertise them he was also a ghost so the legends have said, his weapon was a chinchilla sword, he disapeared 2 years ago</p>

<p>Brian Litke was born in in the state of Claifornia, the only member of his direct family actually born in the state. Born in the year 1986, Brian grew up in a harsh enviroment having the mental strength and ability of a black man's penis. Although he flourished im sports, he wasn't as forntuanate as to flourish he school. His report card may have shown straight A's, this is only due to the fact that his mother and father have "connections" you might say, but either way Brian Litke overcame his disability and is now attending Santa Clara. He currently has a very pretty and intelligent (unlike his previous girlfriends) girlfriend. No one can say how long it will last, but the truth is that it appears to be match made in heaven, Brian being an atheletic and remotely smart lad and she being a generous and supportive gal.

<p>--86.142.185.108 19:55, 6 August 2006 (UTC)== Aberayron, Lampeter and New Quay Light Railway.</p>
<p>The Lampeter, Aberayron &amp; New Quay light railway was a branch line that ran from the Manchester &amp; Milford line at Lampeter. The line ran from a junction about a mile north of lampeter station and headed towards the coast at Aberaeron, through the beautiful countryside of the Aeron valley. A journey of some thirteen miles. Although incorporating New Quay in the original scheme the railway never reached this harbour town five miles down the coast from Aberaeron. The railway opened for passengers on Friday May 12th 1911, and was closed to passengers on Monday 2nd February, 1951. Goods facilities were to continue for a few more years, but these eventually finished on 5th April, 1965. At this time the Milk Marketing Board operated a creamery at Green Grove which was about seven miles from Lampeter. This section stayed operational until 30 September, 1973. Within one year the railway ceased to exist after only 62 years of operations.</p>

<p>Ernst Regener sank instruments down to a depth of 230 m. in Lake Constance, and sent up self-registering apparatus in balloons up to 27 km. in the atmosphere. Regener inferrred that the cosmic radiation carried a flux of energy equal to 3.5*10^-3 erg/sec /cm^2, which is the same order of magnitude as the energy arriving at the earth from the stars in the form of light and heat.</p>
<p>The flux referred to here is that of high energy radiation--i.e. positrons. Not that of low frequency photons making up the cosmic background radiation first discovered experimentally by Penzias and Wilson.</p>
<p>Other Wikipedia articles have mentioned that Regener predicted a 2.8 K cosmic background. Some other contributor will have to provide more information about that.</p>

<p>Let's be blunt: In the American audio education world, Tom Misner is viewed as the Big Bad Wolf - the outsider intent on blowing away the competition as he methodically builds an empire of SAE Institute of Technology schools around the world. Success does sometimes breed contempt, and Misner has been very successful: There are currently 30 SAE schools teaching more than 12,000 students in such far-flung ports-of-call as London, Paris, Sydney, Munich, Singapore, Stockholm, Kuala Lumpur, Athens, Madras and several other locales. What frightens other U.S. recording programs - and this has become a very competitive business - is Misner's plans to set up shop across the United States. So far, there are two SAE schools here - in New York and Nashville - and Misner says he hopes to eventually have a dozen dotting the American landscape. Misner claims a fortune of about $900 million (he made most of his money in real estate), so SAE programs don't have to worry much about capitalization, and one imagines that the organization could expand at will. Former SAE students already populate hundreds of studios worldwide, though so far their inroads in the U.S. have been modest.</p>
<p>Misner isn't just some rich businessman dabbling in audio. He's a working engineer, producer and studio designer with some 30 years experience in the field. In the mid-'70s, he built SAE up from nothing, opening his first school in Sydney (though Austrian by birth, he moved to Australia when he was 14), then eventually expanding to London, Munich and beyond. He builds studios on property he owns, and he fills them with gear that he gets at good prices, because he is certainly one of, if not the, largest single purchaser of audio equipment in the world. Though his home base is Sydney, where he owns much real estate, including 301 Studios, a multimillion-dollar multimedia facility, he considers himself a citizen of the world; indeed, it seems as though he's been traveling almost constantly for much of the last three decades. Appropriately for a man of the world, he has an accent that is part German, part Australian with a few American- and British-isms thrown in.</p>

<p>1816 to 1909</p>
<p>Born in 1816, the oldest of nine children by Charles and Susannah Pickingill. from a small Essex village called Hockley in East Anglia. Later he moved to the nearby village of Canewdon where he died in 1909.</p>
<p>“Old George” as he became known was a <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hereditary_witch.html" title="Hereditary witch">hereditary witch</a> a descendant of Julia – The Witch of Brandon, who had lived in a village north of Thetford in Norfolk. And burned at the stake in 1071. Since that time each generation of the Pickingill family has served as priests in the Old Religion</p>
<p>Over the course of his lifetime, George re-established a total of nine hereditary covens. These were bassed in Norfolk, Essex, Hertfordshire, Sussex, and Hampshire. These covens have become known as the nine covens of <a href="../../../b/r/i/Britain.html" title="Britain">Britain</a>.</p>
<p><a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> is reported to have been a member of one of his covens sometime around 1899. He is thought to have obtained his Second Degree before being dismissed due to his contemptuous attitude toward women and his deplorable behavior.</p>
<p>George had an intense dislike for Christianity and Local Authority. He openly campaigned for the overthrow of the Christian Religion and the establishment in generally. He even conspired with Satanic Cults to expedite his would be intentions. This brought him into conflict with other Craft Elders who objected to his activities.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief for many misinformed articles abounded and were sensationalized in the Press during those times. Witches do not believe in “devil-worship”, nor do they invoke Satan during ritual to carry out evil deeds. Satan and the Devil are by-products of Christianity and have nothing to do with the Old Religion. The Old Religion was being practiced well before Christianity came along.</p>
<p>The nine covens re-establishing the council of craft elders and the Craft Elders had good cause for objecting to what “Old George” kept advocating, preferring secrecy and discretion to the unwanted attention he was arousing.</p>
<p>George campaigned against Christian Religion and in doing so created much publicity around the Nine covens To protect against this, the Elders of the Hereditary covens conspired to discredit any claims made by George and others concerning the survival of Hereditary Witches. This in part involved the eradication of many traces of “Old George” and his “Nine Covens” as was possible.</p>

<p>Родился Михаил Владимирович Круг (Воробьев), 7 апреля 1962 года, в старом районе города Твери, который назывался Морозовский городок, сейчас имеет название "Двор Пролетарки" о котором была написана песня "Милый мой город".</p>
<p>Первые свои стихи Михаил написал в 14 лет, которые посвятил своей однокласснице. В то время кумиром Михаила был В. С. Высоцкий. После армии Михаил под впечатлением его песен стал играть на гитаре и петь в его стиле.</p>
<p>Михаил закончил в городе Твери 39 училище на Соминке по профессии слесарь-авторемонтник. Придя из армии, Михаил женился, родители его жены настояли на том, чтобы он пошел в институт, т.к их дочь окончила с отличием институт легкой промышленности, а его образование не соответствовало их принципам. В 1987 году Михаил успешно поступает в институт, в котором узнает о конкурсе авторской песни, принимает в нем участие и занимает первое место. После этого он серьезно занимается написанием песен, но не малую роль в этом сыграл Е.И.Клячкин, который был председателем жюри на 8 фестивале авторской песни, где и увидел скрытый талант в Михаиле, и сказал: "Миша, тебе надо работать…"</p>
<p>Первый свой альбом "Тверские улицы" Михаил записал на студии "Тверь", потом был записан второй альбом "Катя", и третий альбом без названия, все они не имели выхода, но были украдены и разошлись пиратским способом. Практически все песни с этих альбомов были переписаны и спеты в альбомах: "Зеленый прокурор" "Мадам" "Роза" "Мышка". В 1994 году вышел первый официальный альбом “Жиган- лимон".</p>
<p>Первое выступление Круга прошло в городе Москве, в Театре Эстрады на фестивале “Русский Шансон“ в ноябре 1996 г. В этом же году был показан первый клип “Это было вчера”.</p>
<p>На обложке диска "Жиган-лимон" Михаил изображен со своими музыкантами. Слева Владимир Овчаров (уехал в Израиль) справа Влад Савосин, баянист.</p>
<p>За выпуск аудио кассет с альбомом “Жиган-лимон” от студии “Союз” Михаил не получил ни копейки, а за выход лазерных дисков с этим же альбомом получил три тысячи долларов (3000$), хотя затратил на запись намного больше.</p>
<p>Первое большое интервью Михаил дал, отвечая на вопросы в часовой программе в студии кабельного телевидения А.Л.С. 9 марта 1998 г. (г.Москва. ул. Гончарова 17)</p>
<p>Летом 2000 года закончена съемка фильма “Апрель”, в котором Михаил Круг сыграл криминального авторитета.</p>
<p>В его группе в течение трех лет был сухой закон.</p>
<p>Михаил отдал деньги на новый клип, но ему их вернули, т.к. его песни запретили на телевидении.</p>
<p>Перстень с тремя алмазами, который он всегда носит, ему подарил вор в законе Хобот.</p>
<p>Блатные выражения для своих песен Михаил берет из словаря выпуска 1924 г. для внутреннего пользования НКВД, который приобрел случайно.</p>
<p>Второй клип "День как день" ему сняли друзья. Его можно увидеть на видеокассете "Песни Михаила Круга".</p>
<p>Песня "Кольщик" писалась три года, и имела три разных варианта. Последний вариант на альбоме "Жиган-лимон".</p>
<p>Все свои песни в первых четырех альбомах Михаил посвятил своей первой любви Марине. Песня "Девочка-пай" была написана в 1987 году и посвящена ей.</p>
<p>Первый раз Михаил Круг выступил за границей в 1997 году на фестивале "Русский Шансон в Германии", на котором спел четыре песни, одна из которых "Мадам" была спета в гитарном варианте. Её можно услышать на диске "Русский Шансон в Германии" выпущен немецкой фирмой "Solo-Florentin".</p>
<p>С февраля 1997 года с Михаилом работает новая солистка Светлана Тернова, которую он услышал на фестивале песни "Заволжье", и взял ее в группу. Параллельно со своим творчеством он пишет ей альбом в эстрадном стиле.</p>
<p>Песни "Поле зеленое", и "Моя королева" которые поет Света. Михаил написал в 16 лет и также посвятил Марине. Он их переделал для исполнения от женского лица.</p>
<p>27 марта 1998 года в гостинице "Космос" Михаил участвовал на вручении премии "Овация" и получил ее в номинации "Русский Шансон".</p>
<p>В 1994 году был снят д\ф "Бард Михаил Круг" и показан по каналу "Культура" только в 1999 году.</p>
<p>В 2000 году исполнил роль криминального авторитета в фильме "Апрель" (реж. Константин Мурзенко).</p>
<p>В ночь с 30 июня на 1 июля 2002 года убит в своем доме в Твери.</p>
<p>Похоронен в Твери на Дмитрово-Черкаском кладбище.</p>

<p>The nine covens are thought to be the only surving covens of traditional english witchcraft to have survived to the present day.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with a <a href="../../../w/i/c/Wiccan.html" title="Wiccan">wiccan</a> coven, the learning of these covens form the basis for the modern resurgence in witchcraft and neo-paganism.</p>
<p>They include covens from Essex, Hampshire, Cornwall, Kent, Suffolk and other rural areas of the UK.</p>
<p>The high priests or priestess of these covens each froms a member of the Council of herditry elders, or the coven of nine. Responsible for solving arguments between individual covens and ensuring they work together to preserve some of the secrecy in the craft and also deal with its outside elements and politics.</p>
<p>Known covens include the horsa coven in burly, new forest, england, as mentioned by Sybil Leek in her book, "Diary of a witch" and the art of witchcraft.</p>
<p>Members of these covens include, <a href="../../../a/l/e/Aleister_Crowley_151e.html" title="Aleister Crowley">Aleister Crowley</a> (who was thrown out for mis-use of the craft) <a href="../../../g/e/r/Gerald_B._Gardner_5bee.html" title="Gerald B.

Gardner</a>, <a href="../../../d/o/r/Doreen_Valiente_081a.html" title="Doreen Valiente">Doreen Valiente</a> and sybil leek, all of whom went on to form their own covens following their modern interpretations of the ancient traditions.</p>
<p>The Nine Covens were re-assembeled as a council of elders by George Pickingill in approx. 1840</p>
