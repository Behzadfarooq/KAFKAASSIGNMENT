<p>Briefly: recently-coined neologism that seems to have limited use, in Internet forums, and only in the context of the evolution/creation debate.</p>
<p>This useful and evocative phrase <i>deserves</i> wide use. I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, but my strong impression is that it is a neologism and that it is used in a very limited context: it is used primarily in certain forums and Wikis, and it almost exclusively used in the context of discussions of the theory of evolution. It has not gained enough traction to appear in published sources that meet reliable source guidelines.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest evidence I have for this is that a Google Books search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mining%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mining%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"quote mining</a> returns only five hits, of which three are irrelevant, one is a 2004 book entitled "Creationism's Trojan Horse," and one is a 2007 book entitled "The Counter-Creationism Handbook." A similar search on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mine%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22quote+mine%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">"quote mine"</a> yields similar results: 48 hits, all but one of which are irrelevant ("And again I quote&#160;: Mine inspections and enforcement of State and Federal law and working codes in themselves are not enough"). The single relevant hit is again "The Counter-Creationism Handbook." 35,000 Google Web hits are harder to analyze but seem to follow the same pattern.</p>
<p>The online <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/61" class="external text" title="http://www.bartleby.com/61" rel="nofollow">American Heritage Dictionary</a> does not define "quote mining," "quote mine," "quote-mining" or "quote-mine."</p>
<p>Online search of <i>The New York Times</i> from 2000 to the present shows no occurrences of the exact phrases "quote mine" or "quote mining."</p>
<p>Note that my objection is <i>not</i> that it is confined to evolution/creation debate, although if I'm correct about this the article should explain this—but that it is not in widespread use and cannot be described or defined by references to reliable published sources. (P. S. I'm not a creationist, and I believe creationists are one (among many!) groups that is fond of the tactic of making collections of misleadingly out-of-context quotations.) <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:21, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. S. Earliest USENET hit in Google Groups search is a 1997 posting <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.christian/browse_thread/thread/e0da83b53ce46dcf/9b9dd4613dfb30d2?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=21#9b9dd4613dfb30d2" class="external text" title="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion.christian/browse_thread/thread/e0da83b53ce46dcf/9b9dd4613dfb30d2?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=21#9b9dd4613dfb30d2" rel="nofollow">Creation VS Evolution</a> in alt.religion.christian, and it seems to be very widely used in talk.origins. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 13:46, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>P. P. S. If the article <b>doesn't</b> explain that the term is used almost exclusively in the context of the evolution/creationist debate, then the article isn't accurate. But if the article <b>does</b> explain this, it needs to support the statement by citing a reliable published source—and I don't think one can be found.</p>

<li>I'm unconvinced by the rationale in the now, per Limulus. Coverage is books is not a criterion for something not being an unestablished neologism. In addition, changing the search term to "quote mine" increases the hits in google books to 48 - many of which are Francis Bacon quotes.

<dd>The issue is not whether the term is "notable." The issue is whether <i>there is enough material to document its usage, based on published sources meeting reliable source guidelines.</i> I think the biggest issue is the one mentioned in my P. P. S.</dd>
<dd>The present article is <b>inaccurate,</b> because it implies that the term is used <i>generally</i> to refer to quotations out of context. For example, in presidential campaigns it is not uncommon for party A to distribute collections of out-of-context quotations, attacking party B's candidate, that were made by that candidate's primary rivals. ("Look! Even his own party thinks he's despicable!") But they've been doing that for decades, and it is never called "quote mining."</dd>
<dd>The phrase is <i>not</i> used generally. It is used <i>specifically</i> by... let me narrow it even more... non-creationists, with reference to argument tactics used by creationists. (And perhaps, I'm told, in some blog postings about global warming).</dd>
<dd>If the article <i>doesn't</i> properly explain how, where, and by whom the term is used, its inaccurate. But if it <i>does</i> include these details, it needs to have a published source meeting reliable source guidelines, and I haven't found one. It's such an evocative term that I think there will be one eventually, and <i>when there is</i> we can have an article. Basically, you don't write articles about neologisms when they're still neologisms, even if you can <a href="../../../c/r/y/WP%7ECRYSTAL_aa2d.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:CRYSTAL">see the shape of things to come</a>. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 14:02, 9 March 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To begin with, the presence of inaccuracy in an article isn't grounds for deletion. As for it being a neologism - there are reliable sources <i>about</i> the term - the Quote Mine Project includes a section about the term, as does an NCSE document<a href="http://www.ncseweb.org/media/Analysis-of-the-Discovery-Institute.pdf" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ncseweb.org/media/Analysis-of-the-Discovery-Institute.pdf" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Berkeley science review reports on the <i>meaning</i> of the term <a href="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=evolution" class="external autonumber" title="http://sciencereview.berkeley.edu/articles.php?issue=10&amp;article=evolution" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>. So I'd say that there are quite a few reliable sources <i>about</i> the term. <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> 16:15, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Incredibly common term.

<dd>These are sources that use the phrase "quote mining," usually without explanation. I've never denied that it's used.
