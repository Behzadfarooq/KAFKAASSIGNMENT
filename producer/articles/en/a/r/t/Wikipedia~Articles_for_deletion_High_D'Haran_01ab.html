<dd>it doesnt matter. having it this way makes it easier to find and use. that geocities page could end up going 404 in a week. having the info on the wiki will make sure it stays avalible. and putting it on the D'Hara page will just clutter that up because you know as well as i that we cant have anything close to the High D'Haran info there. this is nuts. there has been no peer review, or any other input. its just been you going on about deleting it since i put it up. get off it. i strongly encourage people to check out the page, and check out the talk page with it. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickjsanford_f565.html" title="User:Patrickjsanford">Patrickjsanford</a> 20:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am sorry if I am sticking my nose where it doesn't belong but neo, stop being wiki snob and admit that even though you didn't think of it this page does have its merits. Furthermore I think that everything imitates everything else have you ever heard the phrase art imitates life which imitates art? If this is a copyright violation then so is the page on Plato and Aristotle and Socrates and every other thing that has ever been offered any info on because you cant give a excellent observation on anything without including some of the original material into the article. I notice you haven't jumped on Tolkeins elven language page, why is that? Stop being a snob and let those with new and interesting ideas have their say also. This page does not belong to only you but to everyone, so please stop acting as if you are the Wiki god, okay? Sorry if I've offended you but I am offended by condescending people who are rude, so just stop. The page should stay because it offers an in depth look at High D'Haran. - Selena Moriarti 20:15, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I just want to clarify for people before they start screaming about clones and multiple accounts and such. Selena Moriarti is my wife, she has her own account, but we are on a DSL connection, and use the same computer so we will have the same IP address. i think that everyone will be able to see that it is two diffrent people due to the diffrent styles of writing, wording, and oppinions. - <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickjsanford_f565.html" title="User:Patrickjsanford">Patrickjsanford</a> 20:19, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I've read the books in question, and the language described in this article does not play a particuarly significant role in the books, and is never described in detail. I'm pretty sure that the "list of terms and words" contains - more or less - every single word of the conlang which appears in the series, including a number of words inferred from phrases. In total, there are perhaps fifteen or so unique words and phrases which appear in the series.. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 20:51, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b><s>Weak Delete</s></b> <b>Delete</b> I'm against indiscriminate listcruft, and the words of the High D'Haran language are pretty non-notable, even to a <a href="../../../s/w/o/Sword_of_Truth_2471.html" title="Sword of Truth">Sword of Truth</a> fan. Still, it's possible that a truly motivated individual could expand this into a somewhat respectable article. - <a href="../../../r/u/n/User%7ERunch_22cb.html" title="User:Runch">Runch</a> 21:29, 12 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The main issue, as I see it, is that there's very little expansion possible without making things up (i.e, creating <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon.html" title="Fanon">fanon</a>). As it stands, I think there's already some significant conjectures being made - for example, the assumption that the chimes <i>reechani</i>, <i>sentroshi</i>, and <i>vasi</i> are the words for "water", "fire", and "air", rather than arbitrary names. <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 22:11, 12 September 2006 (UTC)

Gezzz Neo why is it that all you want to do is to tear down anything but your ASOIAF pages? Talk about fancrufty the whole BwoB on GRRM's page is all that... Dude, you seriously need to stop being an edit nazi. If you cannot add to the positive aspect then stop trying to destroy a page. All you can do is to point out what "you" see as faults. All you do is to add content (and questionable at that) to your asoiaf pages. I think we need someone to look into your abusive actions on this whole issue....</p>
<p>BTW.. this ISN'T Geocities it is Wikipeda... what is or isn't on other MB's has nothing to do with what is or isn't on this page. <a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMystar_a512.html" title="User:Mystar">Mystar</a> 13:39, 19 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Also, High D'Haran is definitely not a "very large part of the novels". It is, at best, a bit of flavor.
