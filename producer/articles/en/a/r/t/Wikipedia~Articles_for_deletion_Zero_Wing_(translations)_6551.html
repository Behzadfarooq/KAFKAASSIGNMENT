<li><b>Speedy keep</b> The text presented is integral to the understanding of the AYBABTU phenomenon but also is relevant to the <i><a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a></i> game page as well, which is in large part why it was made a separate page and not a subpage of AYBABTU. (Also, it was my understanding that subpages were discouraged.) The text was originally found in the AYBABTU article as mentioned above and existed peacefully without complaint for months or even years. Removal of this page would be hugely detrimental to the AYBABTU page and would completely defeat the purpose of <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a> laws. As for the comment above that this is "the entire script of a game," I take extreme issue as the text presented is only a few lines from the opening and closing scenes, certainly not the entire game! I could go on, but it would be pointless. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrossow_94a7.html" title="User:Brossow">BRossow</a> 02:35, 26 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy keep</b> per what BRossow said. This is an important part of understanding AYBABTU. I feel this is a very misinformed and petty AFD that is based on conclusions derived from (unwritten) original research of copyright law. If this is a problem, then many very public sites have the same problem<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22In+A.D.+2101%2C+war+was+beginning.%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-ff&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGGL,GGGL:2005-09,GGGL:en&amp;q=%22In+A.D.+2101%2C+war+was+beginning.%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<ul>
<li>Establish why the copyright hasn't been diluted due to clear lack of enforcement and widespread use.</li>
<li>Establish the identity of the copyright owner since the company is apparently dead. (If you don't know who owns the copyright, how do you know there is even a valid copyright? How do we know the copyright didn't lapse into public domain?)</li>
<li>Establish why this isn't simply fair use since the entire text of that opening statement is necessary to understand the phenomenon.</li>
<li>Establish why the concept of fair use of a copyrighted work somehow gets blown out of proportion in this case because the game didn't contain much text. If the game contained only three words, would it therefore be not fair use to repeat the three words since they compromise 100% of the words in the game? Of the entire copyrightable mass in the game, the text likely compromises a tiny percentage of the entire work.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>By the way, the comparison of this text to a song lyric is invalid. Lyrics are an integral part of the song. Without the lyric, the song's character changes fundamentally. This text does not bear the same kind of relationship to the whole copyrighted work as a lyric does to a song.</dd>

<li><b>Speedy keep;</b> Apparently not a copyright violation; on all of the Internet, there are sites that contain this text. I'm talking about Flash movies, HTML pages, Quicktime movies, the lot. All of these movies show both the text and also the images from this game. The publishers, Naxat Soft and SEGA, have never, not once, attempted to enforce their copyright (if it is indeed their copyright; it could have been Toaplan's, and they are no longer in existence; there is no certainty about this at all). It would appear that there is no need to consider this for deletion, as it seems that the copyright holders of this material don't seem to mind fair use of their material. On a sidenote, certain important prerequisites for mentioning that this a copyright violation haven't been adhered to; like Nova SS mentioned, people don't seem to realize the extreme widespread use of this text, and its important in understanding the All Your Base Are Belong To Us phenomenon. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a> 06:56, 27 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Erm, all those other websites using it are probably infringing on Sega and Naxat Soft's copyright too. And as I said, a few select quotes in the main article are indeed covered by fair use. Additionally, <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Zero_Wing" class="extiw" title="q:Zero_Wing">q:Zero_Wing</a> contains the specific quotes, so it's a dpiulicated effort to have them here.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:18, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>"They aren't pursuing their copyright, so let's infringe upon it" seems to me to be a pretty scary line of reasoning. Nowhere in <a href="../../../c/o/p/WP%7ECopyrights_5026.html" title="WP:Copyrights">WP:Copyrights</a> does it say that we should only protect those copyrights which are already being actively protected.

<ul>
<li>The point here isn't the fact that "those other websites are also infringing copyright", the matter is that the copyright of this phenomenon has been ignored for so long, along with it gaining such widespread recognition, that it's become almost unenforcable and absolutely imperative to know the full text in order to understand the magnitude of its following. Although I do think that the Zero Wing translations article should be merged with <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, it's to be understood that there is no way that this text is not <b>fair use</b>. It's important enough and without it, the whole thing no longer makes sense. Or are we going to have to start linking to external sources in order to give people the information about the text that they really want to read?

<li>Please explain how fair use doesn't apply here. Having taught Internet law and fair use in workshops for many years, I'd truly like to hear your take on this. The lines are but a small fraction of thousands and thousands of lines of code from the game. Further, no one here has thus far been able to establish that there even <b>is</b> an enforceable copyright in place on the snippets of text or the game as a whole.

<li>(unindenting) Of course it's valid. But no matter the copyright status, this is an unencyclopediac collection of original research and quotes, the latter of which already exists at <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Zero_Wing" class="extiw" title="q:Zero_Wing">q:Zero_Wing</a>, as I've said several times.

<li>Huh? Unencyclopedic? It's terribly important to be able to read this text in order to understand the phenomenon. It is in no way unencyclopedic because of how noteworthy it is. This is one of the most famous Internet legends, afterall. You can't tell a visitor to go look up the appropriate information on Wikiquote; it's supposed to be right here on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../m/i/c/User%7EMichiel_Sikma_a1b1.html" title="User:Michiel Sikma">Michiel Sikma</a> 06:59, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why? Wikipedia is not for collections of quotations. Have some of them in the main article, accompanied by examination and discussion, but blocks of quotations go in Wikiquote, where they already are- I will add the {{<a href="../../../w/i/k/Template%7EWikiquote_fab6.html" title="Template:Wikiquote">wikiquote</a>}} template, which I neglected to do earlier, if that addresses any of your concerns.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">Sean Black</a> <sup><a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black"><font color="#FC0FC0">(talk)</font></a></sup> 07:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>The full quote is necessary to understand the background of the AYB meme. Look, all your base are belong to us. OK? Main screen turn on, and it say that for great justice, this is not clearly a copyright infringement. So please move zig.

<li>I'm an anonymous user so feel free to disregard my opinion, but isn't the point not the fact that the sites that have the Zero Wing text are infringing copyright as well, but that whoever the copyright holder is doesn't seem to mind or enforce their copyright? I'd be in favor of a <b>keep</b>. --213.84.233.132 10:47, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> until and unless the copyright holder (whoever it may be) asks us to take it down. The text is necessary to understand the phenomenon, it's not long, the copyright holder doesn't seem to care, and replacing it with links to other sites is an unnecessary hoop for readers to jump through. <a href="../../../t/u/a/User%7ETualha_bd83.html" title="User:Tualha">Tualha</a> (<a href="../../../t/u/a/User_talk%7ETualha_df7e.html" title="User talk:Tualha">Talk</a>) 13:53, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, possibly <b>merge</b> back into the AYB article. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparky_the_Seventh_Chaos_dc6c.html" title="User:Sparky the Seventh Chaos">Sparky Lurkdragon</a> 21:35, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Almost certainly fair use. Opening sequence is a very small part of the video game, but is important to understand "All your base" phenom and its origins. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThesteve_4de4.html" title="User:Thesteve"><font style="background: darkblue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">&#160;T</font><font style="background: #0000AA;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">h</font><font style="background: #0000CD;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font><font style="background: blue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">St</font><font style="background: royalblue;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">ev</font><font style="background: #6666FF;text-decoration: none" color="#FFFFFF">e&#160;</font></a> 22:33, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As TheSteve said above, the value of the entry in understanding the "AYB" phenom is the most important consideration. The text quoted is but a tiny part of the overall work. I think it would be nice to re-incorporate it into the AYBABU page.<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikereichold_c414.html" title="User:Mikereichold">Mikereichold</a> 05:45, 28 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge back</b> in to <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, where it originally was. A standalone article makes no sense, there is no context. The <a href="../../../z/e/r/Zero_Wing_59e8.html" title="Zero Wing">Zero Wing</a> article already links to the All your base page, so there's no particular need for breaking it out as a standalone article. The 73 words of dialog quoted are a small fraction of the overall content of the original video game, well within fair use guidelines for quoting textual material. As others have pointed out, in all these years no copyright complaints were ever undertaken by the copyright holder even against the makers of the Flash animation or websites distributing it, and the Flash animation made extensive use of images as well as dialog. We have a strong presumption of fair use; if the copyright holder should one day change its mind about fair use, then there is always <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequest_for_immediate_removal_of_copyright_violation_2e67.html" title="Wikipedia:Request for immediate removal of copyright violation">Wikipedia:Request for immediate removal of copyright violation</a>. -- <a href="../../../c/u/r/User%7ECurps_5b50.html" title="User:Curps">Curps</a> 01:13, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Transwiki</b> to Wikisource and <b>delete</b>. WP can't use piles of fair use text, but I'm not sure that a copyright assertion will stand up. However, this is not encyclopaedic. If anything was originally in <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, <b>merge</b> it back there. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 09:47, 1 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Strong Delete</b>, copyright violations are simply not endorsed at wikipedia. Absoluely not. When one is discovered, it is deleted or promptly rewritten.

<li><b>Merge back</b> into <a href="../../../a/l/l/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us.html" title="All your base are belong to us">All your base are belong to us</a>, where it originally was.

</ul>
<p><b>Keep</b> and/or <b>Merge</b> This is still very valuable to the article and all those copyvio pushers need to just chill. We might not want to merge back, as I think some of those additional english translations shed light on how the game translation is different, and all that text might be too large to merge into the original article. -<a href="../../../r/i/d/User%7ERidge_Racer_0b07.html" title="User:Ridge Racer">Ridge Racer</a> 17:02, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
