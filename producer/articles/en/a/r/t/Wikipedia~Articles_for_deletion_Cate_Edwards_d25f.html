<li><b>delete</b> If there was reason to believe that she would be interviewed again in the future, I'd say keep... but as is, her claim to fame is her father.

<li><b>Keep</b> She did a lot of work for the 2004 campaign, graduated in the top of her class, and is attending Harvard. Odds are, for one, she'll do more notable things in the future (its hard not to with a presidential-candidate-nominee for a father). The information in the article is accurate and verifiable as well. I'd say we should keep it.

<li><a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> requires that an individual be the topic of multiple non-trivial, reliable, independent published sources. Cate Edwards meets this requirement. Whether the info on her should belong in a separate article or the Edwards campaign article is an editorial issue which it is inappropriate to resolve at AFD. Krimpet is calling for the deletion of an article that meets WP policies and guidelines based on a personal, subjective definition of "notability". Please reconsider your position. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 07:06, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I didn't base my position on a "personal, subjective definition of 'notability.'" Yes, she has been mentioned in plenty of reliable published articles... articles <b>about her father's campaign</b>. Working as part of a notable political campaign does not make her inherently notable herself; campaigners are regularly quoted and featured in the press, as part of their job is to get their candidate media exposure. <a href="../../../k/r/i/User%7EKrimpet_fb21.html" title="User:Krimpet">Krimpet</a> 21:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>If you play a notable role in a notable campaign, then you are notable.
