Google shows most mentions are mirrors to wikipedias or sites linking back to Gordon Worley's own site. None of the non-encyclopedia sites appear to have any mention of this 'celebration' dating from the last two years unless they are referring to this Wikipdia article itself. It would appear the article itself is perpetuating the celebration.

<li><b>Keep</b>. OK, time to come clean. By now I think I probably have as much personal experience with Newtonmas as anyone. Not self-initiated even: When I was a young adolescent my science teacher had an annual tradition of having his religiously diverse class celebrate Newtonmas as a "neutral" winter holiday. There was no "secular" bend to it, just a pro-science one. We had a little tree with apples and calculators hanging from it, and we ate pasta (manicotti I think), which according to our teacher was "Newton's favorite food". It was fun. Maybe I should make a website about it, and then I'll be an expert source like Gordon Whorley!--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:31, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Both Gordon and Robin have connections or interests in the academic world of Artificial Intelligence, so maybe one passed the <i>holiday</i> onto the other. Besides, since when has the blog of one person, the picture album of another and the science teacher of the third constituted enough evidence for the notability of a holiday? <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 00:33, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This isn't a neologism; it's a holiday over 10 or 20 years old. Usenet postings go back to 1992, and a user on Talk:Newtonmas very credibly says to have made a radio broadcast about Newtonmas back in 1984. Look, I'm not saying it's the most popular holiday. But many people have heard of it, and a small but real group of people do celebrate it. Unlike high schools or something, there aren't that many small holidays; there's no reason to have an overly exculsive criterion of notability for them.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 01:17, 27 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Me and some friends could devise a new holiday tomorrow involving a historical figure. We could celebrate it, tell people about it and mention it on forums we go to, in emails, on our blogs and post pictures of us celebrating it. This will let people beyond the group who celebrate it know about the new holiday. We could do this for several years. We would be a <i>small but real group of people</i> who celebrate this holiday. But would it make the holiday notable? I think not. Also, looking over the edits on Talk:Newtonmas, the person who added the info about the radio transmission appears to be quoting source written by Michael Morotta, who wrote an page linked to in the main article, so this radio broadcast was carried out by one of the few people we've already got associated with Newtonmas<a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 01:37, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>: Newtonmas is certainly <i>interesting</i> enough to keep. Whether it's <i>real</i> enough is shakier, but I'll take the word of the various editors who vouch for it above. I do think the "traditions" § should go, though -- it seems to be entirely inspired by the suggestions in Gordon Worley's blog. Also, since the wikipedia isn't a soapbox, Newtonmas probably shouldn't be in mainpage selected anniversaries until its popularity begins to approach that of <a href="../../../f/e/s/Festivus.html" title="Festivus">Festivus</a>. <a href="../../../d/o/o/User%7EDoops_385d.html" title="User:Doops">Doops</a> | <a href="../../../d/o/o/User_talk%7EDoops_62fc.html" title="User talk:Doops">talk</a> 05:58, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> since it should be Hookemas&#160;;-) Actually this should be an article about Gordon Worley if he's notable, but Newtonmas itself is a conceit and really is not widely observed.

<li><b>Keepish</b> I just noticed the article on Wikipedia, (I saw Newtonmas as a link in the "See also" section of the <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> article) but I had also heard of it way before this.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. From just above-- Not to mention, Newtonmas is hardly a <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secular.html" title="Secular">secular</a> holiday when you consider not only was <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Newton_6c7e.html" title="Isaac Newton">Newton</a> a famous scientist, but he was much more into the (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christian</a>) Bible than science. Also, in accordance with the currently used <a href="../../../g/r/e/Gregorian_calendar.html" title="Gregorian calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>, Newton's birthday should accurately be celebrated on <a href="../../../j/a/n/January_4.html" title="January 4">4 January</a>, not <a href="../../../d/e/c/December_25.html" title="December 25">25 December</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickA_389d.html" title="User:PatrickA">PatrickA</a> 08:05, 31 December 2005 (UTC).

<li><b>Keep</b> I created the Wikipedia page and wrote my blog entry about it because numerous people had discussed Newtonmas with me. At the original time of my blog article's creation, there was very little you could find on the Internet about Newtonmas. The holiday is becoming more visible on the Internet and I've read several blogs where the writers have mentioned either celebrating it or at least observing it. To me, people are looking for information on Newtonmas, so Wikipedia should try its best to supply that information. <a href="../../../g/g/o/User%7EGGordonWorleyIII_ec34.html" title="User:GGordonWorleyIII">G Gordon Worley III</a> 16:15, 31 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - My High school physics teacher (in Australia) mentioned this well before Wikipedia.. but I might argue it is non notable and should be deleted anway. At best its more of a joke in the scientific community rather than an actual celerbrated holiday.

<p>Why not just state that it is celebrated, often only half-seriously, by a small number of people around the globe...and is not "notable."</p>
