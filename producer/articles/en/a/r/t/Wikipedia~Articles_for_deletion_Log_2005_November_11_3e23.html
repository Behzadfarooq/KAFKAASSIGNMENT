<p>This page was created by a user who seems determined to prevent the main article, <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>, from being a comprehensive main article about the 2012 Summer Olympics. This is surely exactly what one would expect it to be, and I am unable to fathom why anyone would oppose it. The nominated article was set up after a belated concession that it was no longer appropriate for the article about London's bid to be the principal article and to be updated rather than <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>. But there is no need for it. The main article should cover all the key points, including development between 2005 and 2012, and break out articles should only be created as required - a point which we are nowhere near reaching for coverage of the development. A great deal of valuable information on other aspects of the 2012 Olympics was deleted from the main article when this one was created - as it had been deleted before - so that it was once again only in the bid article, which less and less people are likely to visit as time goes by. The main article should cover all the main aspects of the London Olympics, and I think that completely removing coverage of things like the budget and the transport situation from the main article is quite unreasonable. It is not in line with normal practice of having a comprehensive main article on a topic, and it reduces the clarity and accessibility of wikipedia's coverage of the 2012 Olympics. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 02:15, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

Further, <i>"I think that completely removing coverage of things like the budget and the transport situation from the main article is quite unreasonable"</i> is wrong, as nothing was removed from the article. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 21:12, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> appropriately with 2012 Summer Olympics.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> article should be about the Olympics and not be swamped by the development or detailed specifics of the games - brief details should be included in that article, but it should be no more than an overview. The details of this article would not fit into any other one. This is a bad faith AfD from a user that disagrees with the arrangement but has refused to discuss it. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 08:46, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>For the record, the arrangement is:
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> is the main Olympics article</li>
<li><a href="../../../l/o/n/London_2012_Olympic_bid_39f3.html" title="London 2012 Olympic bid">London 2012 Olympic bid</a> contains the full details of the plan and organisation</li>

<li>In my opinion these comments are not consistent with <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> actions. I would ask users who are in doubt as to how to vote to visit the history of the article to look at the scale of the deletions which s/he has made from the article s/he now admits should be the main article. Main articles usually cover all the aspects of a topic, not just a few of them. Break out articles are usually written when length demands it, and at least a pr√©cis is left in the main article.</li>
<li>There is no justification for the personal attack. I am not acting in bad faith and have not refused to discuss the matter. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> made no attempt to discuss matters with me before this nomination, and now, apart from the personal attack here, s/he has made another personal attack on my user page. These are not welcoming invitations to discussion. I am the one who has initiated discussion with my lengthy explanation of the reasons for nominating this article. I have seen swathes of an excellent article deleted and I have restored them, that is all. The main issue is that <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> does not seem to wish Wikipedia to have a thorough main article about the 2012 Summer Olympics. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 13:27, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's rubbish. Those comments are consistent, and you have not attempted discussion prior to this nomination. You reverted lots of hard work without any discussion and called it the "devestation" of an article, which is frankly offensive (thus starting my dislike of your behaviour). The content removed from <a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a> is a seperate issue to whether this should be deleted or not, and it is all present in <a href="../../../l/o/n/London_2012_Olympic_bid_39f3.html" title="London 2012 Olympic bid">London 2012 Olympic bid</a> anyway.

<li>I restored a good main article to its prior state, which had stood for several months with just minor incremental amendments. I would do the same if someone removed major subsections of <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and I spotted it.

<li><b>Comment:</b> As there are still 7 more years before the event surely it's obvious that there will be more and more developments - it would need to be split off in the near future anyway. <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 15:02, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree that a breakout article might be appropriate at some point, but there is no need at present as the article is not up to the size limit. This article is part of an attempt to prevent the main article covering the whole of the topic in the way that any other main article does. We should continue to expand the main article until it hits the size limits and then create break-out articles. Even then the main article should contain a pr√©cis of each break-out article. That is normal practice. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 17:36, 11 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No - when it is obvious that an article is going to be overwhelmed by one part (in this case, announcements and developments) it should be split out. It's hardly the most important aspect of the Games and any really crucial developments will be noted in the article. Why merge it back in only to demerge it later on? <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> <a href="../../../v/i/o/User_talk%7EVioletriga_1aa0.html" title="User talk:Violetriga">(t)</a> 17:38, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> In response to the previous comment, I should have made it clearer that even when more breakout articles are required, this should not be one of them. The title is poorly chosen. It is not a natural subsection of the main article, and this is reflected in the fact that <a href="../../../v/i/o/User%7EVioletriga_40fe.html" title="User:Violetriga">violet/riga</a> has chosen to subdivide it for the sake of clarity. More appropriate break out articles would cover natural main subsections of the main article such as transport and facilities. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 22:09, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> -- main article will inevitably become big, and to me it seems sensible to keep that as a crisp summary, with the minutiae of developments in London on a separate page.

<li><b>Merge</b> with the main 2012 Olympics page. Yes that article may become too big one day, but I do not feel that the whole of the conetent on this page is suitable to be absent from the main article, not do I agree that over time that this will be the best way to split up the main article. It is best to wait until the main article does reach it's limit in size and see what is the best way to split it up then rather than second guessing what the best course of action will be. <a href="../../../e/v/i/User%7EEvil_Eye_7860.html" title="User:Evil Eye">Evil Eye</a> 20:44, 13 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><s>*Reluctant <b>Delete</b>, as long as another page or pages is/are quickly developed with relevant info in them so that the 2012 Olympic page does not become too bloated. My only problem with this page is its unilateral status, and the fact that its just a series of bullet points.

<li>The 2012 Olympics should be written in the style that VioletRiga has in mind, but I think he has gone over the top in his removal of info from the main article. Also, Im not sympathetic with the bullet point style of this article; however, I'm going to say <b>Keep</b>, as long as the aritcle is improved<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobdurbar_10c0.html" title="User:Robdurbar">Robdurbar</a> 09:52, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. As best I can tell from its current content, the intention of this article seems to be to present information on the games in a chronologically sequenced format. It seems to me that this is an entirely desirable piece of organised data for Wikipedia to have. Obviously we also need an article in a more narrative form, and it seems to me that trying to have both in the same article would be less than desirable. So lets have two interlinked articles, one (this) in chronological sequence, the other (<a href="../../../2/0/1/2012_Summer_Olympics_3ebe.html" title="2012 Summer Olympics">2012 Summer Olympics</a>) in traditional narrative form. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 12:42, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Odd title. I guess it's a version of "History of the 2012 Summer Olympics" but they haven't happened yet and I don't think they'll merit a "History of" article when they have. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarina22_3bab.html" title="User:Carina22">Carina22</a> 15:56, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Any Olympic Games is really made up of three phases. There is a bidding phase lasting several years, then there is a development phase of seven years, then two weeks of phrenetic sporting competition. Frankly I think phases 1 and 2 are much more interesting than phase 3, but that is my POV. In the case of the 2012 games, we are already through the bidding phase and several months into the development phase, so it is way too simplistic to say they 'havn't happened yet'. As for your thoughts on whether they merit a history article, that is your POV. If there are enough people interested enough to write a good article, they merit that article. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChris_j_wood_afc2.html" title="User:Chris j wood">Chris j wood</a> 16:06, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

Then if you still need further proof, google "2Six biking" and the first hit is a the website of a reputable mountain biking magazine, "Decline," while the second is a UK bike forum. As for the groups members, I shall deal with only one, Kyle Strait. He is a talented young mountain biker who has appeared in biking DVDs and he even has a biography on the Red Bull Website (<a href="http://www.redbullusa.com/article.action?documentIntID=1070309642716-1812641887" class="external free" title="http://www.redbullusa.com/article.action?documentIntID=1070309642716-1812641887" rel="nofollow">http://www.redbullusa.com/article.action?documentIntID=1070309642716-1812641887</a>). <b>eatr</b> 21:38, November 2005 (EST)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Don't Delete</b> The main reason for deletion appears to be that it is not a common term. However, it is a valid term, as pointed out by eatr, and I believe the point of an encyclopedia, online or not, it to inform people, and help them learn what certain words or terms. As the 2Six Stallions gain more coverage (trust me, the article in decline is just part of it), people might wonder what the name means. A reputable online encyclopedia like this would be a place people might look. And not just Americans are familiar with the term. I am Canadian, and I knew about them far before the decline article. In fact, the debate about the group has spread to a very Canadian site, www.nsmb.com .</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not sure "band vanity" applies here. This a Flemish group, with articles on the Dutch, Polish and Esperanto Wikipedias (and yes, I realize that does not justify an article on the English Wiki, in and of itself). I can't really tell how notable they are, because very few of the Web sites that mention them are in English. I don't think you can rely on allmusic for judging the notability of music from non-english speaking areas. They may well be quite notable in Europe, but as I can't document that, I won't vote. I do worry about musicians and groups being dismissed as "not-notable" because they are not well-known to English speakers. - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 16:05, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Abstain</b> per Dalbury, and because my Flemish is not good enough to read most of the comments about them, although I would point out that their first release was only in 2004, and they are a folk group - these tend to struggle to gain much notice outside a rather narrow community. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 21:09, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Delete: Boldly into the breach, then, I'll go ahead and vote to delete, not because the band is or is not notable, but because the claims of the article are <i>unverifiable</i> at present for the voters. I think that a help from the author would be welcome, as there is no particular desire to restrict coverage to Anglophone bands.

<p>I'm bringing this here after originally having put a <i>nn-bio</i> tag on it. The tag was removed by an anon, replaced by another editor, and then removed again by <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilwelch_fd5e.html" title="User:Philwelch">User:Philwelch</a> with the edit summary "royalty are notable". The article, as it now stands, is a couple of lines of genealogical information. My impression is that our standards for inclusion of biographical articles are fairly demanding, and this article does not meet them. If there is some precedent for keeping all articles about nobles, I am unaware of it. <a href="../../../j/k/e/User%7EJkelly_f091.html" title="User:Jkelly">Jkelly</a> 17:09, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>(sorry im proably definatly doing this in the wrong way , I apologise I don't know the procedure, but I know the person who is programming it ., his name is Mark Hodghton and the article is not a hoax (he wrote it up at school for ICT and for form time and could do with it staying there) ,the game its self is very near to completion according to him , and everyone here is looking forward to seeing it . I've got a demo and everything he lists is there is there&#160;!</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I'm sorry, but how hard you friend has worked is irrelevant because the game is 1) not yet complete and 2) not notable.

<p>This is difficult to describe. It's about a supposed phenomenon apparently motivated by vengeful feelings or prejudice towards people with good dancing abilities, by the owners or operators of clubs. The only reference given is to a conspiracy wiki. The entry in question describes, in heavily teutonic-flavored English, an incident in which the author was banned from a club after dancing on the bar. This entry is in turn apparently a mechanical translation of the same account in German, on a German conspiracy wiki. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a><a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 15:01, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm the author. I really hate to see this page go ... really&#160;:-( but I understand the reasoning.

Bye, for now cotton mouth candy (if anyone wants it to stay I'd be happy ... no?, ok then). I repeat, it is sad to see a piece of midwest history rejected just because it is not on google ... guess I'm getting old. Disambiguation post:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Ok, this is fair. I wanted to understand why the original deletion, thanks for taking the time to explain. I understand I should in theory know all the rules before I post, but a little common courtesy is not too much to ask from society I hope (??). I resent the implication it's a hoax or lie. I am a respectable person, but didn't understand that when I added a page it needed to be google verifiable. See it from my uninformed point of view ... I grew up with this stuff when I lived in the U.S. in midwest states like Wyoming and Montana. We made it for people when they had dry mouth from allergies or medical treatments (now there are many over the counter alternatives). In fact, I added the page because I was looking for it on wikipedia because of my allergies, not to make a "joke" or "hoax". I thought I could help some people. In the process I even learned to merge some pages that needed it and fixed a bad link from the Garage Band section of all places. I am friends with studsmc, and we collaborate on many pages in our field of work ... I don't think that is wrong (she is also familiar with cotton mouth candy). In fact, I will delete the page if I can figure out how and move it to my user page until I can find a way to verify. Please any of you who are interested, look at my user page (it might take me 24 hours or so to get it on there). I will put up a picture of my ingredients and the two bottles I currently have right here by my computer (it's no joke!!). It is not medicine so you can make it yourselves for fun too! I will repeat this on the original page and agree it should be deleted. By the way, there are many things, you youngsters&#160;;-) might be interested to know, that are real even though they are not on google searches! Don't assume and infer people are liars because you can't google it. I understand the problem, though ... and don't forget, much can be avoided by a little niceness from person to person (it might not even kill us&#160;:-o ). Oldness makes you ramble too, sorry. <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperclear_767a.html" title="User:Superclear">Superclear</a> 06:32, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the past now, but being accused of pulling a joke or hoax is what made me upset in the first place, even though my page should be deleted.

<li>I don't see anything inappropriate about calling an article with no Google presence and no citations a <i>possible</i> hoax. Other editors cannot intuit the difference between unverifiable genuine information and hoaxes. I hope you post this information to a personal website.

<li>Thanks <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a>. My objection was that the first time it was deleted it just disappeared with no mention of why on the discussion page (there was not even a afd discussion like this time ... just gone). The edit title didn't say possible hoax, it declared as fact that it is a joke or made up ... an arrogant statement by a anonymous user who clearly didn't read some of the common courtesy Wikiquette I have now become familiar with. The second time the same anonymous user deleted it they suggested it might be a joke or made up and sent a discussion of why it was deleted ... that was understandable to me. Although I would still prefer something like "Sorry, but my research couldn't verify this content, so in accordance with wikipedia policy I will mark it for deletion. If you have refereces we can take it off the delete list". I hope wikipedians aren't generally this antisocial, or many nontechnical computer users will just not bother helping. Please see my user page for a description and picture of cotton mouth candy/product whatever!! <a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperclear_767a.html" title="User:Superclear">Superclear</a> 14:52, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sadly a lot of us end up valuing convenience over politeness (and I use the inclusive pronoun deliberately); it's a lot easier to write "hoax" than "information that I tried to verify and failed, and which also looks unlikely based on my own personal experience". And given the amount of hoaxing and vandalism that <i>does</i> go on, a lot of us find it hard to remember to assume good faith.</li>
<li>That said, it's good to see you've userfied the information. You might also consider adding it to the <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook" class="external text" title="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cookbook" rel="nofollow">Wikibooks Cookbook</a>, if you haven't already; that's the appropriate Wikimedia place for recipes. ‚Äî <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 18:14, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Notable trance/house DJ, important in that scene as far as I know. He's on AMG, has 1 album and 4 EPs on notable labels (Inluding <a href="../../../p/o/s/Positiva.html" title="Positiva">Positiva</a> which is part of <a href="../../../e/m/i/EMI_68e5.html" title="EMI">EMI</a>). His website claims 6 albums but I don't see label information for them. Also produced the minor mainstream hit "Better Off Alone" per article. His own "higher and higher" #34 billboard dance hit in 2000 per AMG. I think all of that evidence together meets <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMusic_04f0.html" title="WP:Music">WP:Music</a>, but it's kind of close so I'm making this a weak keep. --<a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 03:20, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I will explain my reasons for calling for deletion, to some extent this is a test case to establish the threshhold of notability. This person is less than a year old, her only claim to notablity is her relationship to royalty. How close to royalty do minor figures have to be to be regarded as inherently notable? I would be prepared to regard all grandchildren of monarchs as inherently notable, but I draw the line there, this child is only the great-great-granddaughter of King <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_V_of_the_United_Kingdom_078f.html" title="George V of the United Kingdom">George V of the United Kingdom</a>, she has no title, not even e.g. "Lady" or "the Honourable". Some might point to her place in the succession to the British throne, but many of the people above her are still young and likely to have children, she is likely to drop many places in her lifetime. How high up a line of succession is inherently notable? I know her brothers and sisters all have entries, I am trying to establish a precedent. <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 11:27, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>What is your cut-off point then? We also have to consider the issue if, once people are high enough in the order of succession to make them notable, do they cease to be notable as they drop down the list, or do they remain notable for the rest of their life? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 14:40, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>This last comment is contrary to a well-established Wikipedia policy: "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information. That something is 100% true does not mean it is suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia." If we don't draw the line somewhere then who all is notable in this context?

<li>Weak <b>keep</b>, Trollderella is persuasive here, but it's a tough call. Consider the reader: is it more useful to them to follow the link to this stub than to find the information in the parents' article? On the other hand, 29th in line to the throne is closer than you'd expect (albeit with zero realistic chance of making it to Westminster Abbey). - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <font style="background: #000077; font-weight:bold; color:#FFFFFF">&#160;Guy,</font> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 17:51, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - British royalty is inherently notable, plus the presence of an "Order of Succession" template gives this interest from a trivia perspective, too.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The young lady is in a line of persons to inherit the English throne, and is thus a significant royal. The article should not be removed. (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Claim to fame is being born to a family of minor nobility and pissing in her diapers. There is absolutely no worthwhile claim of notability here. If we include her we might as well start adding famous actors/actress's children as well. Apple Martin is easily as notable as Estella Taylor, as is Coco Arquette. At best this should redirect to her Father... That being said I also want to say that I completely disagree with nominating for AfD as a test case or as an attempt to set precedent.

<li>"Notability is not part of deletion policy". I beg your pardon? It is well established that notability IS part of deletion policy. If you look through AFD archives you will see that there have been several cases where accurate and verifiable articles about people have been deleted because the person is not notable, we have e.g. the "average professor test" of notablity. "There is a common misunderstanding of the phrase 'Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of items of information'. It means that unstructured, uncontextualized lists of facts are not what an encyclopedia is. It does not mean that articles about real people, that are verified, and within an encyclopedic structure should be deleted simply because someone is not interested in them." Sorry, but my understanding is that that is exactly what this statement can mean, it raises some fairly fundamental questions about the Wikipedia project if it does not. The line of persons to inherit the British throne includes ALL the legitimate Protestant descendants of <a href="../../../s/o/p/Sophia_of_Hanover_bc15.html" title="Sophia of Hanover">Sophia of Hanover</a> (1630-1714), there must be several hundred such people, do they all deserve a Wikipedia article? (Plus all the similar people in other kingdoms?) 23skidoo at least recognises the problem, he/she would be prepared to treat the top 30 in line of succession as inherently notable but not the top 120; fair enough but where would he/she draw the line between 30 and 120? <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatGallacher_b78b.html" title="User:PatGallacher">PatGallacher</a> 23:11, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed you may have it. Notability is not part of deletion policy. It never has been. People have deleted things for various reasons not supported by policy. That's a shame. It doesn't make it policy. Can you write a verifiable article that is long enough not to be better off merged into another and is not original reserach? If so, then write them.

<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable. The only way she'd inherit the throne is if someone went on a massive assassination spree.

<li><b>Keep</b> Hardly a neologism, since it originated in the 1950s. As one of the oldest bits of "hacker jargon", this term occupies a place of honor in the <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jargon_File_ced0.html" title="Jargon File">Jargon File</a>, and it has encyclopaedic potential. <a href="../../../a/n/v/User%7EAnville_a648.html" title="User:Anville">Anville</a> 22:00, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Agree with the content of Anville's comment. Not completely sure whether it deserves its own article. BTW Frob is used in mathematics for "the conjugacy class of Frobenius elements." The word persists in hacker circles, but may have declined in use since the sixties, and has never crossed the chasm into ordinary parlance. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 01:19, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Anville is 100% correct. This word is part of hacker/programmer parlance (perhaps not common, but certainly in use), and as such deserves inclusion. Piperatthegates2 09:42, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think the truth is people don't really no much about his father. They did travel to the U.S. in 1877 but by 1881 they were back in London. I don't have any evidence that Harold Power really performed in anything significant after his marriage, in the 1871 British census he was a Wine Merchant, in 1881 a Mine Agent, and in 1891 a Mining Engineer all three times in London and he died in London in 1901. He may have played the piano but maybe its significance was exaggerated to make him seem more interesting for bios of his grandson <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrone_Power_79df.html" title="Tyrone Power">Tyrone Power</a>.

<dd>Thanks for the comments. I would definitely like to keep separate pages for all the Tyrone Powers as they were all famous in their own right. I would personally be in favour of deleting the Harold page. I would mention a bit about Harold's career on his son <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrone_Power%2C_Sr._dd69.html" title="Tyrone Power, Sr.">Tyrone Power, Sr.</a>'s page and create a clearer family tree outline on <a href="../../../t/y/r/Tyrone_Power_%281795-1841%29_070e.html" title="Tyrone Power (1795-1841)">Tyrone Power (1795-1841)</a> which would give Harold's date of birth and death.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. 4 merge/8 delete so it's tricky, I am calling this a delete for three reasons. First the article is extremely short, almost a A1 "little or no context speedy", as Haeleth said, the article doesn't say what the building is used for. Second, there is very little reason why "Jorgenson Hall" should redirect to Ryerson University when there are a load of other Jorgenson Halls around the World. Finally, I looked at the <a href="../../../r/y/e/Ryerson_University_318f.html" title="Ryerson University">Ryerson University</a> article and concluded that merging this there would just clutter up that article. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:19, 18 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Now I've read through that and I'm even more confused than before. The problem seems intractable. I've wrote some academics stub myself; <a href="../../../%C3%B3/s/k/%C3%93skar_Halld%C3%B3rsson_3167.html" title="√ìskar Halld√≥rsson">√ìskar Halld√≥rsson</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/r/Hermann_P%C3%A1lsson_d478.html" title="Hermann P√°lsson">Hermann P√°lsson</a>], <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigur%C3%B0ur_Nordal_78ad.html" title="Sigur√∞ur Nordal">Sigur√∞ur Nordal</a>... I'd say Nordal is definitely notable - he's in Britannica, for one thing. In my opinion Hermann P√°lsson is notable too but √ìskar may be more marginal and I'm not sure if I'd create a stub on him if I'd been thinking about it today. Nevertheless his is a name you'll see come up in a "History of Icelandic Literature" type of work - even if only for his research on <a href="../../../h/r/a/Hrafnkels_saga.html" title="Hrafnkels saga">Hrafnkels saga</a>.</p>
<p>But it really depends on how deep a coverage of the relevant subject we have. Once we have a deep coverage of the <a href="../../../i/c/e/Icelandic_sagas.html" title="Icelandic sagas">Icelandic sagas</a> it will be very useful to have articles on the academics who have contributed most to their study. Because that's a field I know well I feel I can make reasonable judgment calls on what biographies to include at each stage.</p>
<p>But in the field of Katheryn K. Russell I'm completely lost. So I guess my vote is: "Leave it up to people who know something about that field." - <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHaukurth_cc12.html" title="User:Haukurth">Haukur √ûorgeirsson</a> 11:13, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>, this is a good point, though I doubt that the list could ever be complete enough to be a useful resource.

<li><b>Keep</b> (does the article creator get a vote?) This is a good resource for musicologists and musicians and doesn't need to be complete to be so. It says right up top that it should not be thought of as complete. All it needs to do is give modern examples of what some think of as a quaint and boring meter. But "My Name Is Jonas" is not quaint. "Judith" is not boring. Every band page where I placed a link had few or no links in 'see also,' so it's not as if I'm crowding those sites. And while triple meter is not uncommon per se, it is not as ubiquitous as detractors of this article would have others believe. For anyone who claims this, please, on your next visit to this afd page, write in three examples that would fit this category. Be honest. Don't go surf the net looking. Top of your head. How about two? One? I only know of a few bands who do more than, say, a fifth of their songs in triple meter. If you can actually think of a number of examples, why not add them and make this page better rather than trying to delete it. I firmly believe that Wikipedia is a better resource with theses lists on it. I don't know of anywhere else with anything like this and I have looked. Especially a resource with linked text like wiki. I also don't think it's fair to judge this article on what was said in an afd for another article with different criteria i.e. no date parameters where these are neatly defined by decade. Take the article for what it IS, the way a user would see it, not for something written in an afd for editors/contributors, etc. And while I understand that Jersyko's examples are intentionally hyperbolic, I'm going to respond anyway. You can't hear a band and say 'These guys sound like their band stars with a d' and saying that a band uses whole notes, half notes, whatever, is like saying they use sound to make music. You CAN listen to music and tell that it is in triple meter. There are certain bands that use triple meter and most avoid it like the plague. As Trollderella points out...these lists are maintained.--<a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHraefen_512a.html" title="User:Hraefen">Hraefen</a> 00:56, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>What has to be done to make this 'not original research?' Do I have to provide a link or paper resource for every single song noted? Do I have to go one step further and show that I also got these songs from a list that already exists in published form somewhere? Does it matter that many modern bands never write their songs down in a way that people would consider standard notation?

<dd><a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">No original research</a> is a longstanding Wikipedia policy with broad consensus.

<dd>The reason for this policy is that unlike print publications, anyone can contribute to Wikipedia, so readers cannot trust in the authority of Wikipedia's authors. Nor can readers trust consensus judgements of WIkipedians on the <i>merits</i> of a new idea.

<dd>I don't actually see much evidence that it is more common in popular song now than it ever was - maybe the author's favourite bands just reached the ballad phase&#160;:-) As it is, triple metre is and always will be uncommon in rock anthems and much more common in ballads.

<li>OK. Again. I'm not trying to PROVE anything. I just want an admittedly incomplete list of songs. PLEASE stop inferring things from a prior afd where I said I was tracking a trend. I just want an incomplete list of songs and if I have to provide documentation for them I will look for that documentation. But if someone is going to try to delete this on some other grounds, well, that would be wasted time. What kind of documentation is acceptable? A link to a guitar tab page which indicates meter? I need to know what the wiki community finds acceptable. I'm sure many of you hate <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_works_in_irregular_time_signatures.html" title="List of works in irregular time signatures">List of works in irregular time signatures</a> as well, but until I see that page on the afd page (and I don't want to), I really feel as though these lists are being held to a standard much higher than that one and many others.

<li>Analytic was kind of a sloppy word choice, but I couldn't think of a better one at the time. All I meant was that if there is a song that I can't find documentation for (which very well could happen), does that forever prevent that song from being written about in the areas of meter, or key, or instrumentation, etc. Even if it's not contentious for someone to say that a song has a guitar, piano, bass and drums, does some source need to be cited for that? I'm not trying to change the way wiki articles are created, validated, etc., I just want to know what the standard procedure is and then work within it.

"However, research that consists of collecting and organizing information from existing primary and/or secondary sources is strongly encouraged." A song is a primary source if I'm talking about a song. How can a source get more primary than that? If it states right in the <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy that it's ok to collect together primary sources, I don't know where the charge of original research is coming from. <b>Wahoofive'</b>s president/White House analogy, upon further reflection, is just absurd. Few people have access to either the president or the White House, but anyone with a library card or internet access could find most of the songs on this list. Do I have to walk to their houses and hand them a mix tape of these songs? Plenty of articles cite only a book which is shelved in a library somewhere and trying to force me to do anything more is silly. Would you ask the writer of an article on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Great_Gatsby_0702.html" title="The Great Gatsby">The Great Gatsby</a> to cite anything but that book as a primary source? What else would there be that is considered primary? People who can't interpret that primary source (i.e. can't read English/ don't understand time signatures) should respectfully bow out of the argument. And why is all this fuss being made about verifiability when no one has even claimed that one of these songs is not appropriate to this list? And even if someone does eventually do that, is that so bad? Isn't that what happens all over wiki? I don't know if I've read a talk page on an article more than a month old which had nothing in question. Isn't the 'sifting and the winnowing' just part of wiki? People are always going to disagree about certain things, but I think <b>Wahoofive</b> is really overestimating how contentious this list will be to anyone who would care enough to add to it or watch it (as I have said I will).--<a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHraefen_512a.html" title="User:Hraefen">Hraefen</a> 00:35, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>You may be right about the overestimating part (I certainly have better things to do than try to challenge every entry on that list), but I just deny that every person who listens to a song will agree what meter it's in. Wikipedia is supposed to be a <i>tertiary source</i>. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they should refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by a reputable publisher."

<li>Well. I think it's ridiculous that you wouldn't consider a song a primary source, but whatever, I see I'm not going to change your mind. I think if a user cares enough to read a list, you kind of assume a certain level of knowledge and interest in the subject. Enough for them to seek out an album to try to disprove something which seems wrong to them. There are many lists which are not held to this standard. But, this is a list of songs, and I have been finding out that they are primary targets of deletionists (and some of them undoubtedly deserve to be deleted). For instance, the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_English_words_of_Etruscan_origin_896a.html" title="List of English words of Etruscan origin">List of English words of Etruscan origin</a> does not contain on it (or anywhere on wiki as far as I can tell) etymologies for the words 'ides' 'element' and 'style.' It simply has a disclaimer at the top of the page which says that there are competing theories for some of the words. Now, I'm not trying to use the "there's a less-than-perfect page on wiki so why have any standards?" argument, but I'm just pointing out that anyone who cares about a page/subject will contribute critical discussion, as has happend on the Etruscan site. People who care will always be questioning. This doesn't really seem like a fair compromise (to me), but why don't we simply tag the whole list with a 'factual dispute' tag that I've seen on many pages and also encourage users to note any disagreements they have on the talk page (and to add and edit boldly of course)? I think it's silly, but I prefer it to seeing the lists deleted. That will also allow me time to find secondary evidence. I'll try to find secondary source evidence for everything, but a good place to start would be with a song which has been contested. It's surprisingly hard to find sheet music for many modern bands, especially when their albums are not platinum-selling. I'm really excited to see what this list could become after people of all musical tastes have the opportunity to add to it.--<a href="../../../h/r/a/User%7EHraefen_512a.html" title="User:Hraefen">Hraefen</a> 00:29, 16 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b> Let's just delete anything to do with modern music if this is deleted. Seriously, not everyone who posts something on here has unlimited access to actual, proof-laden factual information to back up every single list or article that is posted. Are we to deprive people of useful information just because there's no re-typed history of renaissance examples of triple-metered songs posted before a list? Let's say I'm a DJ and I'm thinking of putting together a playlist for a wedding and I need songs that would match up well. A waltz would most certainly match up to a song in triple meter over a song in standard 4/4. Where would I find a list of songs I could play? Wikipedia? Maybe not if such a list is deleted.--<a href="../../../k/l/e/User%7EKle5i5_2ee1.html" title="User:Kle5i5">kle5i5</a> 13:30, 16 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>I don't believe that my article should be deleted from the Wikipedia. I am not a vain person in the least bit. I have had a very sucessful run as a pro-wrestling trainer and eventually trained a WWE World Heavyweight Champion. If you are the coach of a sucessful football team that wins a national championship, they don't erase you from the story because you didn't step on to the field. Originally, I didn't post this article at all as <a href="../../../r/a/n/Randy_Orton_13bb.html" title="Randy Orton">Randy Orton</a> will personally attest. The original article was poorly written and had gramatical errors all over it. I have a masters degree in Teaching and decided that if some wanted to write about me in the first place, I might as well do the story justice and correct the errors. At the same time put a bit more depth to the article. If you guys wanna erase it, go ahead. Like I said, "I didn't write it in the first place, I just corrected it." I do apologize for being successful in Pro-Wrestling and Television. By the way, I was a television show host for a show called Audaphobia that ran on the WB Network in 2004. So between my two careers in entertainment, I personally don't feel that it is quite off the mark for someone to have put me in wikipedia. I mean, nothing personal, but I have done 2 things in this article alone that most people will never do in their entire lives, and be successful at a high level.</p>
<p><br />
I will say to McPhail. I think your Randy Page is quite impressive and I like it's depth. As I have told you before, Randy also thought it was very in depth and justified. I think their needs to be some kind of gatekeeper to keep irrelevant information out of the article though. The OG Stevie B name in the first paragraph is a little over the top. I have wrestled Randy hundreds (not kidding) of times and you don't see me going out of my way to name every single guy I have worked in the past 10 years. Anyway, I think your article is great.</p>
<p>In closing, I can prove anything I said here or on the MARK BLAND article page. It's not a problem at all. My email is markbland@charter.net. I live in St. Louis (actually St. Charles, MO ) Missouri, not more than 2 minutes from Randy's gated community. If you want to erase the article about me, go ahead, it's not a big deal to me. I appreaciate you guys taking the time to read this. s968339 00:51, 15 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The only reference this article links to doesn't even list it among notable buildings of Toronto. It's an old commercial building converted into residential lofts.

<li><b>Keep</b> -- Granted, the article in its current state does not suggest that the building is noteworthy. However, it is notable. First, the Merchandise Building is a landmark, and arguably the most noted example of loft conversion in Toronto. Second, downtown Toronto was once the retail capital of the country, containing most of the Eaton's and Simpson's factories and mail order warehouses. In an age when Canada was mostly rural, when Canadians did far more of their shopping through catalogues than today, and Eaton's and Simpson's between them controlled more than 70% of all department store sales, this building was a hub serving Canadians from coast to coast. It is the last remaining of the Eaton's and Simpson's warehouses/factories in the core. Third, this building is at the vanguard of the <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_roof.html" title="Green roof">green roof</a> movement in Toronto and Canada, with a 10,000 square foot green roof -- it was the first significant green roof on a residential building in Toronto. <a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 14:43, 14 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hmmmmm...the <a href="../../../h/o/u/Housing_cooperative.html" title="Housing cooperative">housing cooperative</a> that I live in is currently working on a 22,000 sq. ft. green roof which, when done, will be AFAIK the largest residential green roof in at least Ontario and quite possibly all of Canada.

<p>Was tagged for speedy, but doesn't really qualify. What we have here is a subliterate rambling on something from Mortal Kombat. "Character" is a bit of a stretch as characters tend to have character, which it seems this does not. Maybe if rewritten it's suitable for a merge somwehere. But to have articles on stuff like this when we don't have any on many, many major characters from significant works of fiction (nor on many major works of fiction themselves) is stupid. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 17:20, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>So put a para in Newsweek which describes it. Just about every publication on the planet publishes a top 10/20/50/100 (depnding on how much blank paper they need to fill) list at least once a year, either as a silly-season filer or to pad out the Chrstmas "special" when there is no actual news to report.

This is your friendly neighborhood <a href="../../../i/n/t/Intellectual_property.html" title="Intellectual property">IP</a> <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attorney.html" title="Attorney">lawyer</a>. Listing the names of the schools can not be a copyvio, because Newsweek is simply taking a set formula and applying it to publicly available facts about the schools in question.

The formula itself is merely an idea, and is not subject to copyright; only the expression of the idea can be protected, and the listing here does not duplicate the expression because it differs significantly from the layout of the Newsweek list. See <i>Kregos v. Associated Press</i>, 937 F.2d 700 (2d Cir. 1991).

<li><b>Comment.</b> I suspect that this is easily a copyright violation. The list is the product of <i>Newsweek's</i> data-gathering, analyses, and considered opinions. It is not a list of simple facts, such as, say, a list of the tallest mountains in the world; I agree that that sort of thing is not copyrightable. This list, however, is <i>Newsweeks's</i>, a product of <i>their</i> work, and as such eminently copyrightable. There are many instances of similar lists which amply demonstrate the point. For example, the <i>ISI Science Citation Index</i>, published every year, is a list of science journals in ranked in order of impact factor. The list is a product of ISI's analyses, and the copyright is jealously guarded (they actively ferret out and shut down any lab website that rips off a copy and publishes it on the net). <i>US News and World</i> rankings, same thing‚Äîtheir lists are all copyright. One good hint that you're doing something wrong by copy pasting this on WP: does the publisher charge readers for access to the list? If so, how can we imagine that something is not seriously wrong with taking that material and unilaterally publishing it under GFDL on our website? This is not our material to take. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>07:29, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</i>

I've maintained such a list - indeed one more similar to Newsweek's own - <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_Best_high_schools_735f.html" title="User:BD2412/Best high schools">in my user space</a> for quite some time without fear of legal action, because I'm quite confident that this is no copyvio (and even if it was, it would easily qualify as <a href="../../../f/a/i/Fair_use.html" title="Fair use">fair use</a>).

<li>IANAL, but I am not sure your judgement is correct in this case. For example: Kregos v. Associated Press and Eckes v. Card Prices Update both show that the non-protection of facts is narrowly drawn. In the first, it was held that the selection of which baseball statistics were important was a sufficient creative step to merit protection even though the stats themselves are clearly unprotected facts. In the later, a list of what are "premium" baseball cards was considered protected because of the editorial nature of what is "premium". The Newsweek list would appear to be an original expression of what are the best High Schools. What facts were used in doing this is indisputably an editorial judgment. If they had been touchy-feeling about it and merely selected "premium" schools in a subjective way, it would obviously be protected ala Eckes. Your argument rests on the position that because they used an algorithm, which relied upon some selection and weighting of facts, then the resulting ranking should be regarded as uncreative. I would instead defend the notion that such an ranking is the expression of an idea for how schools should be ranked and thus should be subject to protections. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 22:26, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>Kregos was not merely about the formula, but about the arrangement of the presentation of the nine categories of information that went into the formula. The AP in that case was presenting a table pretty much the same as that devised by Kregos. Had the AP merely listed the "winning" teams according to the formula (without arranging them according to the formula) they would have been off the hook. Also, I argue fair use in the alternative. This is a relatively non-creative work, with zero commercial value (it's available for free on the internet), being used for a purely educational purpose (on a non-profit, ad-free informational website). The version on my user page incorporates substantially all of the information on the list, but the version in the article uses only the names of the institutions and their order (and augments it with something Newsweek lacks - links to articles on many of the actual schools). <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 01:58, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Since they get ad dollars when someone looks at it, it obviously has at least a little more than zero value. But in terms of fair use the criterion with the biggest problem is the "amount and substantiality of the portion used". Aside from not explaining where the ranking came from or the score, our use is total. In most contexts our list can effectively replace Newsweek's list, which is not the intention of fair use. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 02:45, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Fair use is a balancing test - three factors leaning strongly one way can outweigh one leaning the other way. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 03:39, 12 November 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>For "purpose and character", one also asks whether the use attempts to supercede or replace the original, which we fail. As an effective replacement, uses such as ours also destroy any future market value the item might have had. Since for practical purposes it would appear to have very little value, that makes this criterion largely irrelevant but can't really help us, either. So, by my count I'd say there is roughly one factor in favor and two opposed. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 03:51, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>I suppose I'd argue that since we provide only the school names and not the equation, we are actually driving interested consumers to visit Newsweek's website (or look for the magazine) to get the complete picture. <a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: lightgreen">BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><b>T</b></a> 04:19, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment.</b> BD, thanks for weighing in. As I said when tagging the articles for copyvio, this is something that needs to be looked into and determined by WP's higher-ups. Lawyers being lawyers (:-)), I'm reasonably certain that one of your colleagues could put forward a good case that this is a copyright violation‚Äîindeed, Dragons flight's comments indicate this is clearly not an open-shut case, but open to some interpretation. FWIW, my reading of <i><a href="../../../f/e/i/Feist_v._Rural_4040.html" title="Feist v. Rural">Feist v. Rural</a></i> suggests to me a different interpretation than yours as far as this Newsweek list is concerned.</li>

<dd><i>In regards to collections of facts, O'Connor states that copyright can only apply to the creative aspects of collection: the creative choice of what data to include or exclude, the order and style in which the information is presented, etc., but not on the information itself. If Feist were to take the directory and rearrange them it would destroy the copyright owned in the data.</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>This seems to indicate that the names of the schools are not <i>Newsweek</i> copyright (obviously), but the creative choices <i>Newsweek</i> made in producing a ranking <i>are</i> copyrightable by them. The ranking is a creative invention of theirs‚Äîthey did not simply publish the names of schools as in a directory. Note also that the WP users who placed this list on WP under GFDL did not "take the [list] and rearrange" it: the entire list is simply reproduced verbatim, and even indicates in the title that the list is <i>Newsweek's</i>. It doesn't seem legal to me to take their list‚Äîpublished in their commercial magazine and website‚Äîand simply publish it on our site under a free licence like GFDL. I also don't buy the argument that they are providing the list free: MSNBC-Newsweek get serious ad revenue from their website.
<p>Now, whatever the truth of the matter, these issues are not our prerogative to decide. It should be up to WP lawyers to decide if they think lists like these are acceptable for WP. If they decide the risk is not worth it, we shouldn't accept them; if they decide they are quite prepared to defend it, WP:Copyrights may be amended to indicate the acceptability of such lists. <i>But it is not something that we should be judging on an AFD, IMHO</i>‚Äîthe very idea is surreal, and I'm rather perplexed at (unqualified) keep votes being made after the Copyvio issue was raised (is the expectation that, if most people said "Keep, this is not a copyvio per XYZ anonymous editor", the closing admin should go "Ok, it seems there is a consensus that this is not a copyvio, so keep" (!?)). As it stands it seems a delete consensus is likely in which case the issue is settle with respect to these particular lists; the question whether similar lists are permissible, however, must be decided and WP:Copyrights amended accordingly. <a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000066">encephalon</font></a> <i>07:07, 12 November 2005 (UTC)</i></p>

<p><s>PA is bearly mentioned in that article. It does not set forth the actual standards we use to identify who is White.

That is untrue. Yes most people in those first countries are White, and most from the latter are not, but there are exceptions in both instances Why is it that you are fearful of a comprehensive article on PA? Moreover, kindly specify what is "poorly written" about it? Finally, why should my questioning of your motives effect your vote. Dont you think that is childish?

<li><s><b>Response to the above.</b> The problem with this article is that it reads like a screed from the organization‚Äôs informational pamphlet and it is written is such a manner as to try to persuade readers to the organizaton‚Äôs point of view. In the Wikipedia that is what is called ‚ÄúPOV‚Äù (point of view) and that is not acceptable for an encyclopedia. An article on an organization must objectively describe the organization with no attempt at persuasion. Outside criticism of the organization should be included for balanced information. Your entire article could probably be scrubbed and reduced to about two paragraphs if written objectively. The entire FAQ section should be removed or reduced to about one paragraph. You must include sources of information and external links where possible. The article needs to be ‚Äúwikified‚Äù‚Äîwritten in proper Wikipedia page format. The spelling, spacing, and sentence formatting need to be cleaned up and corrected. More information about the organization‚Äîor movement, or whatever it is¬ù‚Äîneeds to be given. For example: How long has the organization existed? Who founded it, where, and when? How many members does it have? What notable persons are members? What kinds of activities has it participated in? What kinds of outreach does it have? What is the source of funding? What kinds of media attention has it received? Given these stated corrections, the article MIGHT be worth keeping as an objective description of the organization.</s></li>

<li>I created this article and I assure you I'm not spamming, my website is of no commercial value to me, I had created a list of freerolls for myself to follow and decided to make it available to everyone! There's no affiliate links and no money is asked of anyone. Please consider this article as I believe it is not covered in Poker Tournaments. The "Poker Freeroll" artricle currently available on Wikipedia does not serve the term well and is a blatant cutout of Doyle Brunson's first poker bible "Super System"</li>

<p>I had originally intended for winpoka.com to use mediawiki software however with the complexity of the coding and my intended audience, I did not believe a wiki would be the best format for my website. Instead I ask for public input at addme@winpoka.com and thought I would create add my own little peice to your wiki. I assure you that this information located on my website is incredibly valuable to any up and coming poker player and they would surely find it of interest. Thanks for the chance!</p>

<dd>Sorry, but there are certain notability standards because this is an encyclopedia.

While a back link from an article on a artistic work to the underlying science is valid, and a <i>discussion</i> of the impact a scientific phenomenon or theory has had on culture is valid (baring original research), long lists of books, movies, and TV shows that have used these ideas adds little value to an explanation of a theory. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDV8_2XL_8587.html" title="User:DV8 2XL">DV8 2XL</a> 15:48, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><small>This project does exist, and does have backing (so may well get off the ground, as it were) but has not yet signed off the design phase, so is in the very early stages. As an aircraft, therefore, it is clearly not notable. As a project, does its mere existence and sources of funding make it notable? What does the panel think?

<li>Did someone cast "Summon Fiend"? Erm, anyway, having one article on spells in D&amp;D is certainly a better idea than articles on each spell and the like. This level of attention is still much less than we give to many much less notable games. I think we can handle a single article like this, though I'm wondering if such an article would discourgae people from writing individual spell articles, or encourage them. If it's the latter, I might be tempted to vot to delete. <s><b>No vote</b> until I look into the matter a bit and see how this subject is covered already.</s> <b>Keep</b>. A cursory examination seems to indicate that this isn't really covered elsewhere, and it's not excessive detail (yet, let's hope it stays that way). Given many multitude of significance D&amp;D has over something like <a href="../../../g/u/n/Gundam_Wing_c222.html" title="Gundam Wing">Gundam Wing</a>, this article seems almost necessary. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 22:10, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You don't get it. I dont think either should be deleted. Its the hypocrisy I have an attitude with. If you support deleting this article, then you better delete that one too.

<dd>Funny you should say that.

<dd>I don't buy it. What constitutes a "likely misspelling"? By this logic we should create redirects for "Seve Russell", "Stee Russell", "Stev Russell", "Steve Rssell", "Steve Rusell", etc. And aside from that, where is the right place for deleting redirects?

<dd>Actually, what I was implying was he doesnt meet notabilty requirements IMO (ergo <b>Delete</b>)... and this article either gets no traffic from people who do indeed know the notability of the subject, or lots of traffic from people who know nothing about the subject. So, if the artist is notable and we delete it someone will go "wtf?!??!??" create a new article and hopefully do a better job establishing the notability. If we delete it and indeed he wasn't notable, it remains deleted and all is well with the encyclopedia containing articles on verifyably notable people. I did a google search. At most I can find that there is a music festival dedicated to Guru Sarajananda as noted, and several articles about a person who received an award named after him...but I am not finding anything that actually describes the award even when searching for 'Guru Sarajananda Award'. So I am claiming that the article meets none of the notability requirements for a musical artist. Its not for me to state why he's notable. --<a href="../../../s/y/r/User%7ESyrthiss_6bb0.html" title="User:Syrthiss">Syrthiss</a> 18:18, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Blimey, that was like pulling teeth! There is, it seems, only one Surajananda but there are sufficient mis-spellings (and flexibilities in transliteration) as to make it nearly impossible for an anglophone to track down the references. I believe there is enough evidence he is a signficiant - possiobly even eminent - figure in Carnatic music to justify his inclusion, especially giving regard to systemic bias, but I have tagged it for expert attention (and will moe it to Guru Surajananda which is the name by which he is apparently usually known). I removed the songs as they cause (IMO) more confusion than anything; I lack the knowledge to make this more than a stub. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub>&#160;:: <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 21:46, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>the article represents a very biased view and is far from any neutrality. besides that, a lot of sentences are vague and not in grammatically correct english (e.g. "Violent games usually have strong playability" or "When they learn as play at the same time. Children are good users- they are easy to be attractive to use interactive products"). i think wikipedia is clearly misused in that article. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinpi_b8b7.html" title="User:Martinpi">Martinpi</a> 16:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think we should keep this article. It's a unit of measuring time. It should not be merged with the Unununium operating system article. That would be like merging the article on the Unix operating system with the article on Unix Time. So in short we should keep the article.- Posted by <a href="../../../b/w/f/User%7EBWF89_5f6a.html" title="User:BWF89">User:BWF89</a></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>". Although the article is copied word for word from the website the website it copies from places all it's information into <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Domain_4d3d.html" title="Public Domain">Public Domain</a> so that shouldn't be a problem. Also, just because it's about some big operating system doesn't mean it's any less imprortant. I'm sure if MS WIndows had their own time system there wouldn't be any quetion on whether to kep that article. The goal of Wikipedia is to gather all human knoledge. <small>(unsigned edit by User:67.163.250.244 - <a href="../../../d/a/l/User%7EDalbury_2fbf.html" title="User:Dalbury">Dalbury</a> <a href="../../../d/a/l/User_talk%7EDalbury_e849.html" title="User talk:Dalbury">(talk)</a> 16:23, 11 November 2005 (UTC))</small></li>

<li>Why would anyone use Un..time&#160;? Running on TAI means the time will not match civil time, and besides that, computer systems don't run smooth enough to approximate TAI anyway.

<li>This isn't an article about an <i>expression</i>. It's an article about a <i>concept</i>. A (dictionary) article about an expression would provide quotations, translations, pronunciation, etymology, and so forth of the phrase. This article, about a concept, does not. It instead tells one <i>what a walk of shame is</i>. There appear to be a lot of people who agree on what a walk of shame is, and they have written a fair amount about walks of shame, from how to avoid appearing as if one is performing the walk to criticisms that the concept is mis-named. We have multiple, independent, sources writing and publishing their own articles about the subject. If this were a person, that would be a "keep" per the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> criteria.

<li><b>Keep</b> I didn't know the subject had already been considered for deletion or that a similar article existed, but I don't see why it shouldn't be kept and cleaned up. It is a FACT that some videogames are usually cited as "worst of all time" examples (without always being commercial failures), so wouldn't it be interesting to explore the criteria applied, the possible bias etc?

<li><b>Comment</b>: The nominator was seeking a merge. This is the wrong project page for that request. The merge can be performed, with a redirect, if there is no opposition. However, if there <i>is</i> opposition, the proper place to ask for comment is on WP:RFC. Note that each royal family is covered according to the standard naming conventions. In the case of Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other "Eastern" kingdoms, the choice of surname/forename as primary in the article is something I, personally, don't know a thing about, but consistency is vital. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 22:41, 11 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
