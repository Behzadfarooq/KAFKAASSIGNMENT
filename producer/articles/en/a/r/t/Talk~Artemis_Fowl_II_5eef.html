<p>|} the 4th book will be called <i>Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception</i>, contrary to what you have on the page. I would correct this but I am not that good with Wikipedia, so, sorry! (I got the name off of <a href="http://www.eoincolfer.com" class="external text" title="http://www.eoincolfer.com" rel="nofollow">Eoin Colfer's website</a>)</p>
<p>Interstingly I've already seen that book out in a nearby borders, so that date might be a little off.</p>
<p><br />
hi. do you know how many books there are in all in the seiries? and do you think artemis will get his memory back?</p>
<p>hi...artemis does gets his memory back...why dont u try out the fourth book opal deception. its nice.</p>
<p>well...does anyone know the exact release of artemis fowl:the last colony</p>
<pre>
 Matt: Nope, no exact release date yet, unfortunately. I'll keep you posted.

<p>Added some information on the movie and a couple of the characters. The movie is projected for a release next year. Casting will begin at some point either early or to the middle of this year, then filming will begin, hopefully aiming for a 2007 release. <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIammatty_8ea3.html" title="User:Iammatty">iammatty</a> 22:15, 16 January 2006 (GMT)</p>

Made a few changes to correct and clarify what age Artemis is during different stages of the series: He's twelve in the first book, and his father disappeared less than a year before that, whereas the previous version suggested he was ten during both. (Also, no, there's no exact release date for The Last Colony yet, only the vague one already listed on the page.) <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittyRainbow_f00e.html" title="User:KittyRainbow">KittyRainbow</a> 00:23, 4 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Wikipedia isn't for advertisement or opinions. The information concerning some of those external links is opinion. I'll get rid of the information; anyone who wants to replace it without the POV is welcome to do so. <a href="../../../v/i/m/User%7EVimescarrot_2ee2.html" title="User:Vimescarrot">Vimescarrot</a></p>

<dd>...Right...I'm not likely to get a reply, I know, but someone reverted my changes...what do I do now? When i try to read Wikipedia's guidelines and rules I can rarely find the information, and if I do it leaks out of my brain anyway.

<p>Are you talking about the links on the main page? Artemis Fowl Confidential IS the largest and most visited fan site on the internet, therefore it is not an opinion, but a fact. If wikipedia wasn't for advertisements, would there honestly be links sections on loads of the pages? <a href="../../../i/a/m/User%7EIammatty_8ea3.html" title="User:Iammatty">iammatty</a> 07:59, 27 January 2006 (GMT)</p>
<p>Whilst it's easy to measure the size of AFC's forums (just look at the member list) and they are the largest, it's more difficult to measure amount of site content, particularly where lots of different things are grouped together. For example, one site might have a small number each of many things, and another site have many things in fewer categories. Difficult to measure, especially as we're all updating all the time. Possibly better for us to stick to easily measurable quantitative facts. (But I don't think many people in the Artemis Fowl fandom would contest Eye on Fowl being the most up-to-date AF news site there is! Even if another site gets something first, which is extremely rare, it'll probably appear on EoF within hours, and EoF is often days ahead of other sites, so overall it is the most up-to-date... But I shan't add that back in.) <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittyRainbow_f00e.html" title="User:KittyRainbow">KittyRainbow</a> 02:05, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Okay, nevermind, I thought someone had removed the "most up-to-date" thing but it's still there, and I can't find anything in the history to suggest it was ever removed. Memory playing tricks on me! Oh well, that's my case for it not being removed in future. <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittyRainbow_f00e.html" title="User:KittyRainbow">KittyRainbow</a> 02:31, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>There's a lot of confusion generally about this motto, so I think a section here might be helpful. In the US, the motto is "aurum est potestas" which under Latin grammar is incorrect. The grammatically correct "aurum potestas est" is used in the UK editions. For this reason I've changed it back to the grammatically correct version and I suggest we keep it that way, possibly including a note in the article about the grammar, because a lot of people don't know about Latin grammar and will change it to the US version thinking that it is "wrong"... <a href="../../../k/i/t/User%7EKittyRainbow_f00e.html" title="User:KittyRainbow">KittyRainbow</a> 11:20, 25 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>I beg to differ. I am taking Latin I and the verb "est" may stand anywhere in the sentance. It does not change the meaning. Typically in Latin, the verb is at the end of the sentance, but "est", "sum", and other is/are words are the exception. Both phrases are correct. While they may not be what Eoin Colfer first put down, I don't think it really matters. They both read "Gold is Power."</p>

<p>I want to clarify two questions that I found related to the Artemis Fowl series. The first is about why there isn't an article on the Artemis Fowl movie. There was simply too much gossip, speculation and rumor about the cast and was thus deleted. The second was about the status of the article <a href="../../../d/o/c/Doctor_J._Argon_8257.html" title="Doctor J. Argon">Doctor J. Argon</a>. In my opinion, the article should not be merged because other characters have their own articles and a character that deserves its own article. <a href="../../../s/r/1/User%7ESr13_af5f.html" title="User:Sr13">Sr13</a> 08:47, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"And yet, despite all his intellect, he is fairly pathetic when it comes to social skills, implying that he may suffer from Asperger's Syndrome."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I agree with this being stated in the article that it is implied that he "may suffer" (How about "have?" I don't know about "suffering" from Asperger's). Couldn't be just as likely that his 'pathetic' social skills stem from a lack of interaction with his peers? The article also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He isolates himself from his 'lesser-minded' peers as much as possible and prefers the company of Domovoi Butler, who plays the role of Artemis' bodyguard and best friend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe I'm just unconventional, but to me, it doesn't appear that he 'suffers from Asperger's Syndrome', to me, at least, it appears that young Master Fowl merely "suffers from" self-imposed isolation, and that is the cause of his 'pathetic' social skills. --<a href="../../../a/e/r/User%7EAerodotus_55d6.html" title="User:Aerodotus">Aerodotus</a> 06:31, 18 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sorry. That was me. It's just that people that people with Apserger's Syndrome are normally very intelligent but quite pathetic in social situations. I thought that Artemis seemed like he had it.</p>

<p>Artemis put in his birthday as "01/09" at the end of Book V, apparently someone took this to mean he was born on September 1st, but when I read it I had assumed it was January 9th. Did it say his birthday was September 1st elsewhere? --67.162.34.19 19:49, 11 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>January 9th would be correct if we were using the American date system - i.e., mm/dd. Here in Australia, and in the UK (the home of author Eoin Colfer) the dd/mm system is used, making it September 1st. There is no real possibility of it being January 9th, as the author is not American. --149.135.51.74 15:27, 17 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Does anyone know if the fact that Artemis's fourth and index fingers on his left hand have been switched was corrected? I haven't read the fifth book, but I did read the first chapter. If this has not been corrected, I think there should be a mention of it in the article. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_75.24.200.104_cb9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/75.24.200.104">75.24.200.104</a> (talk) 02:17, 21 March 2007 (UTC).</small></p>
