<p>Vespel® is a polyimide based material manufactured by DuPont. Thousands of critical &amp; demanding applications in the aerospace, semiconductor and trasportation industries have been solved by the unmatched performance of Vespel. Vespel combines High-Temperature Performance, Natural Lubricity, Dimensional Stability, Chemical Resistance, Creep Resistance, and more. It does not outgas or melt at any temperature &amp; performs well in vacuum applications, even in extremely low cryogenic temperatures. Vespel® is produced in five standard formalations including: SP-1, SP-21, SP-211, SP-22, and SP-3. Vespel SP-1 provides operating temperatures from cryogenic to 300°C (570°F), great plasma resistance, plus a UL rating for minimal electrical and thermal conductivity. Vespel® SP-1 is the unfilled base resin grade. SP-1 provides maximum physical strength, elongation, and toughness as well as the best electrical and thermal insulation values. Vespel® SP-21 has 15% graphite by weight added to the base resin for increased wear resistance and reduced friction in applications such as bearings, thrust washers, bushings, seal rings, slide blocks and other wear applications. Vespel SP-21 has the highest mechanical properties of the graphite filled grades. Vespel® SP-22 has 40% graphite by weight for enhanced wear resistance, lower friction, improved dimensional stability (low coefficient of thermal expansion), and stability against oxidation. Vespel® SP-21 has 10% PTFE and 15% graphite by weight added to the base resin for the lowest coefficient of friction over a wide range of operating conditions. It also has excellent wear resistance up to 300°F (149°C). Typical applications include sliding or linear bearings as well as many wear and friction uses listed above. Vespel® SP-3 is 15% moly-filled (molybdenum disulfide solid lubricant) for wear and friction resistance in vacuum and other moisture-free environments where graphite actually becomes abrasive. Typical applications include seals, bushings, bearings, gears, and other wear surfaces in outer space, ultra-high vacuum or dry gas applications. Vespel basic shapes are only sold through authorized distributors such as Professional Plastics, Inc. www.professionalplastics.com</p>

<p>Charle Henry Armentrout V is the fifth generation in a long line of superb men. Residing in Greensboro North Carolina he is currently working on absolutley nothing at all (simply because he is so wonderfull he doesnt need to). So far in his short life he has made almost $1500. Although he has spent most of it on video games. His main talent in life is being able to fart on command (yes its true i have seen it), while this provides his friends with great entertainment it has no other apparent value. I am sure ther is more to come of this wonderfull young boy in the comming years</p>

<p>Kaufman Cabs is a notorious street gang that originated in Cameron Village. Its members are usually non-white, with the exception of Larkin Coffey. The street gang doesn't usually commit violent crimes, unless against each other, however, it does make fun of popular culture through videos that mock everything from Laguna Beach to the Bush Administration. They are distinguishable from the North Raleigh Pinoy, who tend to wear expensive clothing and live in the suburbs. One incident in particular was when the gang's youngest member, Yancey Presnell, paid a Mexican for one hundred tacos and didn't leave a tip. Mauro Francisco Sarabia Garcia Rodriguez Ramierez Santana Martinez Sanchez Carlo Gonzalez Ortiz Walters the fourth is the only member who has a license, which makes the group unstoppable. Their main target is Cecil Carlyle, who is a busta and is trying to defect to the Wendell Wanksters. The Kaufman Cabs, is a very complex group that has contradicting personalities within the group. One member is a very avid Communist who hates George W. Bush, while another member believes in a goverment that combines Faciscm with a semi-monarchy and hates the lower class. The other members of the group know very little of politics, although one is rumored to be a Trotskyist.</p>

<p>Russell was born in England in 1862. He is usually credited as being the first ventriloquist to use a knee-sitting figure and is, therefore, known as “The Father of Modern Ventriloquism.”</p>
<p>Russell first appeared at the Palace in London, England in 1896 with his figure, Coster Joe, a cheeky-boy dummy that established a precedent for such famous figures as Charlie McCarthy and Jerry Mahoney.</p>
<p>In 1910 Russell pubnlished abook on his craft entitled "Ventriloquism and Kindred Arts." Russell died in 1957.</p>

<p>Pidgeons are a four-peice indie band from New Jersey. They are: Alec Gabin; Rhodes, Conor Meara; Bass, Jake Waters; Guitar, PJ MacKinley; Drums. Currently recording an album with Tamur Records (which they co-founded, along with Tricked-Out Gutter Fashion), they have an EP out, which features the songs Irrelevance, By Boat from Below, and Soundcheck (Montreal). Their other work includes such face-melting songs as Ophelia, Movement, and Red.</p>
<p>Pidgeons were formed when indie-band The Ish broke-up due to a dispute with their drummer, John Lemann. Conor, Alec, and Jake started a new band, along with PJ in the summer of 2005. While their recorded music is decent, their live performances far outstrip recordings (This is also because Pidgeons is a relatively new band and they haven't recorded much together yet).</p>

<p>www.no-games.com started out as a small Breaking Benjamin portal in early October 2004 known then as "Saturated" on a free hosting account and sub-domain due to rising issues that the creator had at a similar site dubbed "TSB." A week later the site found it's current name and home on the internet. October 15th, 2004...NG was born. Slowly but surely the site is gaining popularity among the masses and is destined to become one of the greatest fan-created web sites ever made. The site has seen somewhat of a local buzz and has been featured numerous times on music news sites such as thePRP.com and AudioAggression.com.</p>

<p>Black militant youth organization in East St. Louis, Illinois from 1967-1969. Founded in March or April of 1967 as The Royal Serprents, the organization's name changed to Imperial War Lords within its first month of existence. The organization sponsored teenage dances, and frequented the First United Lutheran Church, whose pastors Sonny Goldenstein and later Keith Davis ministered to them. The group was led by Charles "Sweed" Jeffries, who was active in the East St. Louis school boycotts in the spring of 1968. He was closely associated with Charles Koen, and often arrested. The War Lords played an active role in Project IMPACT (innovative Methods of Positive Action for Community Tranquility, a federally-funded arts and recreation program in East St. Louis which sponsored summer music concerts. In 1968, the War Lords were involved in the formation of Youth Organizations United, a national coalition of street gangs, which included the Black Knights from Memphis, the Black Egyptians from East St. Louis, the Vice Lords from Chicago, the Thugs United from New Orleans and many others. At sometime in 1969, the War Lords joined with the Black Egyptians and possibly Black Culture Inc. as well to form the United Front of East St. Louis. There are few references to the War Lords after that, although in one late press release, Charles Jeffries stated that membership had been opened to whites.</p>

To nerd, the action of being a nerd, productively using the brain, ex., "I am nerding all night with my project." "Do not bother me I am nerding with my assignment".</p>

<p>nerd</p>
<p>n. 1. [mainstream slang] Pejorative applied to anyone with an above-average IQ and few gifts at small talk and ordinary social rituals. 2. [jargon] Term of praise applied (in conscious ironic reference to sense 1) to someone who knows what's really important and interesting and doesn't care to be distracted by trivial chatter and silly status games. Compare the two senses of computer geek.</p>
<p>The word itself appears to derive from the lines "And then, just to show them, I'll sail to Ka-Troo / And Bring Back an It-Kutch, a Preep and a Proo, / A Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker, too!" in the Dr. Seuss book "If I Ran the Zoo" (1950). (The spellings `nurd' and `gnurd' also used to be current at MIT.) How it developed its mainstream meaning is unclear, but sense 1 seems to have entered mass culture in the early 1970s (there are reports that in the mid-1960s it meant roughly "annoying misfit" without the connotation of intelligence).</p>
<p>An IEEE Spectrum article (4/95, page 16) once derived `nerd' in its variant form `knurd' from the word `drunk' backwards, but this bears all the hallmarks of a bogus folk etymology.</p>
<p>Hackers developed sense 2 in self-defense perhaps ten years later, and some actually wear "Nerd Pride" buttons, only half as a joke. At MIT one can find not only buttons but (what else?) pocket protectors bearing the slogan and the MIT seal.</p>

<p>Two venture capitalists go moose hunting together and book a private plane into the wilderness. The guide drops them off at the lake and says “okay guys I am going to take off now you are totally on your own for a week with your food, gear, guns and whatnot. When I come back I just want to remind you that I have room for only one moose on this plane, so just keep that in mind and figure out how you will sort out the shooting on your own.” With that he hops in the plane and motors off.</p>
<p>A week passes.</p>
<p>The pilot returns and taxis to a stop.</p>
<p>He gets out and sees the two venture capitalists beaming at him from the shore.</p>
<p>“Did you get a moose?” asks the pilot excitedly as he ties up the plane to the shore. The two VCs nod happily and step apart and point at the trees behind them.</p>
<p>There are two moose hung up and quartered.</p>
<p>“GOD DAMN YOU!” howled the pilot “I only have room for one moose on this plane!” As he is hopping around angrily the two VCs look at each other, take out a stack of hundred dollar bills and start counting.</p>
<p>“HELL NO!” curses the pilot “These are laws of physics! Safety laws! Aerodynamics! There is no room for two moose on this plane!”</p>
<p>200… 300… 400…</p>
<p>“Even if we left all your fancy gear here, it still wouldn’t be enough” says the pilot angrily “there is no room for two moose on this plane!”</p>
<p>800… 900… 1000…</p>
<p>“We could leave your gear here, and take the seats out, and it would still be too heavy! There is no room for two moose on this plane!”</p>
<p>1200… 1300… 1400…</p>
<p>The pilot is starting to sweat a little.</p>
<p>“We could leave the gear here, take out the seats, and taxi down the long part of the lake towards that hill but not take off due to the weight. There is no room for two moose on this plane!”</p>
<p>1800… 1900… 2000…</p>
<p>The pilot gnaws on his fingers as they keep counting and starts to stammer.</p>
<p>“Even if we leave your gear, take out the seats, and taxi down the long part of the lake, we can’t do it because we got too much fuel.” He pleaded, and then stopped himself.</p>
<p>2100… 2200… 2300…</p>
<p>“Wait a minute…” He said. “We could siphon off the fuel.”</p>
<p>“We could take out the seats.” He added.</p>
<p>“We could leave your gear here.”</p>
<p>“We could turn the plane down the long part of the lake.”</p>
<p>“we could siphon off the fuel until we only had enough to coast in on fumes but YES! WE CAN PUT TWO MOOSE ON THE PLANE!”</p>
<p>The pilot grabbed the fistful of money, grabbed his tool box and went to work.</p>
<p>They took out the seats.</p>
<p>They put their gear higher up on the shore.</p>
<p>They siphoned off the gas.</p>
<p>They pushed in the moose carcasses and then crawled in on top.</p>
<p>“Yes!” Howled the pilot as he turned the plane down the long part of the lake and pushed the throttle forward.</p>
<p>The VC’s gripped the moose hides.</p>
<p>The pilot started screaming as he pulled back on the stick.</p>
<p>“Lift!” he howled “Liiiiiiiiiiiiift!”</p>
<p>The VC’s started screaming along in unison!</p>
<p>The engine whined louder!</p>
<p>The plane took off from the lake.</p>
<p>“WE CAN DO IT!” whooped the pilot!</p>
<p>The plane skirted the tops of the trees and gained altitude as it approached the hill.</p>
<p>They made it up to the top of the hill as the plane kept rising,</p>
<p>And one of the pontoons snagged a treetop and flipped the plane over to crash on the ground in a fiery wreck!</p>
<p>The two dazed VCs crawled from the wreckage. “where are we?” muttered the first one.</p>
<p>“About 200 yards farther than where we crashed last year” muttered the second in reply.</p>
<p>Moosing – (verb, slang) – The process of creating an untenable business proposition by trying to isolate out risk factors or elements on a project in order to close a deal for the sake of closing it.</p>

<p>Space Beaver was the debut work of comics veteran Darick Robertson. Robertson created the title in a high school summer school history class in 1985, further defying the teachers who told him it would never amount to anything.</p>
<p>The main cast featured anthropomorphic funny animals firing guns and quipping at one another. In addition to Space Beaver, Beave had a mentor-like sidekick, an aged tortoise name Tog, and an impulsive and rebellious rat named "Rodent", a rabbit girlfriend "Jackie" and his main enemy, an obese hog known as "Lord Pork". Space Beaver's mission was to avenge the death of the son of Tog by destroying Lord Pork and his kingpin-like stranglehold on Space Beaver's planet 'Anutherearth'.</p>
<p>The title ran for nearly 3 years and Robertson produced 11 issues in all, writing the series, drawing in pencil and ink and creating the cover artwork.</p>
<p>Robertson produced a finale in a two volume collection published by AiT publications in 2000. The series was produced in black and white, in a era when that sort of thing was very popular.</p>
<p>Darick Robertson is the co-creator of Transmetropolitan. After 16 years in the industry he can easily be considered a seasoned veteran of comics, having worked for Marvel, DC, Vertigo, and a few now defunct companies, such as Malibu Comics (where he co-created and designed the Nightman, and wrote and created Ripfire), Acclaim, Eclipse and Innovation. His career started just out of Aragon high school in San Mateo, California when he was 17. He created, wrote drew and painted covers for "Space Beaver" which became the only title published by Tibor Sardy's Ten Buck Comics.</p>

<p>iKP [3] (where i = 1, 2, 3) is a family of secure payment protocols developed at IBM Research Labs in Zurich and Watson Research Center in the United States (1995). based on public-key cryptography and differ from each other based on the number of parties that possess their own public-key pairs. 1KP, 2KP, 3KP. The greater the number of parties that hold public-key pairs, the greater the level of security provided. The 2KP and 3KP protocols can be phased in gradually to achieve full multiparty payment security as a more sophisticated certification infrastructure is put into place.</p>

<p><br />
Formally known as Deal Cinque Ports FC the club was formed in 1908 before 12 years later changing its name to the current Deal Town FC.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deals first games were played in the Thanet League and the East Kent League until in 1909 they joined also the Eastern section of the Kent League. After the Kent League was abandoned in 1959, Deal was then to become founder members of the Aetolian League.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In 1963 Deal was elected into the Southern League but after a terrible 3 seasons Deal was then moved into the Greater London League where they remained for the 1971-72 season until yet again they regained their place in the Kent league to which they have held their place in ever since to this day.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deals first Kent League Championship came in 1953-54 after that their best seasons have only been in 1988-89 when they finished runners up and in 1998-99 when they also came runners up.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deal has however had a good run in the Kent League Cup reaching the final on 4 separate occasions. Their first was in 1957-58 where they emerged victorious against Margate and again in 1981-82 where they again won the cup this time against Erith &amp; Belevedere. In 1993-94 Deal lost in the final to their old opponents Margate but turned it around and 1998-99 saw Deal once again lift the cup for the 3rd time this time against VCD Athletic in a 1-0 victory.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deal also made 3 appearances in the Kent Senior Trophy Final. They were beaten finalists in 1982-83 against Fisher athletic and lost the final again in 1990-91 but this time to Hythe Town. But third time lucky to Deal when in 1994-95 they finally managed to lift the trophy in an epic penalty shootout against local club Folkestone Invicta following a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The only other trophy since to come Deals way was the Greater London League Cup which they won in 1967-68. Deal also gained proud distinction in 1991-92 when they became highest goal scorers within the Pyramid of Football.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>1999-00 was with no question Deals finest season seeing them to be Champions of the Kent league and the first ever Kent team to be finalist let alone Winners of the FA Vase in 2000 against Chippenham town</p>

<p>The British High Commissioner for Palestene appointed Daniel Auster as mayor of Jerusalem after the 1944 death of Mustafa Al-Khalidi. The Jewish Agency demanded a Jewish mayor, but the Muslim interests preferred a Muslim mayor, as had been customary since 1877. From 1945 until the end of the British Mandate a mayor and two deputy mayors were appointed by the British.</p>

<p>ROWLINS - a British surname - origins unknown. A family with the surname ROWLINS lived in Brighton, England until the late 1940's when both daughters (there were no known sons) married. After this time there is no evidence of the surname surviving apart from that on my own birth certificate. I am the illegitimate son of the youngest daughter before her marriage.</p>

<p>Its easier to understand the fourteenth amendment if you know the plot of the civil war. The war was in north America in 1861-1865. The conflict was between 24 states in the north and a coalition of 11 states in the south. The southern states wanted to declare their independence. They also wanted to claim their right of secession from the union in 1860-1861. Approximately 560,300 people died in the civil war, that is the highest death toll ever in U.S. history. One issue was how much control the federal government should have over the states. But they also had different opinions about industrialisation, trade and slavery. Eleven states in the south seceded from the union and set up an own independent government after Abraham Lincoln was elected president in 1860. They called it the Confederate States of America. All those causes led to the American civil war. The war was bloody and lasted for four years. The southern states defeated and had to end the slavery. Still today the causes, and even the name of the war are debated. Afterwards the fourteenth amendment was written to avoid new conflicts and prevent injustice.</p>

<p>The people in USA were from the beginning very segregated in two groups, black and white. On the buses they had different sections and it was like that in the whole society. It took many years of struggle to make the laws equal. The fourteenth amendment was written after the civil war. On July 28 ,1868 former slaves became real citizens with rights. The fourteenth amendment was now made. The law forbids any state to deny any person life, liberty and property. This law continues to provide a basis for civil rights in USA.</p>
<p>The fourteenth amendment says following:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> All persons that are born or naturalised in the united states are citizens in USA, and also in the state where they live. No state shall enforce or make laws that abridges the privileges or immunities of the citizens in united states. Everybody shall have the same protection of the laws.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The representatives shall be apportioned among the different states depending on their respective numbers. Counting all the numbers of persons in every state. The only group that not are counted are those Indians that does not pay taxes.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> You can not be president, senator, representative in congress or elector or vice president in united states in you previously have taken an oath in a different country or supported enemies. But congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each house remove this ability.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> The public debt of the united states authorised by law, including debts for paying pensions and bounties for services shall not be questioned. The united states and other states shall not pay any obligations to make rebellion or insurrection against the USA. Its also forbidden to claim money for the loss of slaves.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> The last section of the fourteenth amendment says that the congress shall have the power to enforce these rules by appropriate legislation.</p>

<p>No one is really sure from where the term Jim Crow is coming from. But it is believed to have arrived from a white minstrel show performer named Thomas Rice. Thomas Rice created a sketch where he blackened his face with burnt cork and danced while singing a ridiculous song named “Jump Jim Crow”. Rice is assumed to have created the sketch after have seeing a black, crippled old man singing a song. “Weel about and turn about and do jis so, Every time I weel about I jump Jim Crow”. Some historians believe that Mr. Crow was the man who owned the slave. The song became hugely popular in United States and in 1850 the “Jim Crow” character had become a standard part in minstrel shows. The word Jim Crow became a word instead of colored, blacks, negroes etc. At the end of 1800 acts of racial discrimination towards colored people were often referred to as Jim Crow laws.</p>
<p>The Jim Crow “era” many say started in the 1890`s when the southern states in America began to rewrite their laws that discriminated black people. But the discrimination actually started earlier. The fact is that the segregation and racism existed in the states long before the Jim Crow laws were introduced. In the first days after the civil war had end, Mississippi and many others of the southern states introduced the so called black codes. The reason with the black codes was to make a limit for the now free slaves economy and freedom. Among with the black codes, violence spread trough the states, and the power of Ku Klux Klan were growing. The KKK and other racist organizations prevented and threatened the black men from voting on the republicans, Ku Klux Klan were supporting the democrats. In the south around 1870s white leaders of the Democratic Party in the state would come up with an agreement with the states black political leaders, who were usually Republicans, on how many county offices held by blacks. Black voters could choose and vote on their candidates but only black candidates accepted to the white political leaders were allowed to run. If the plan was not followed it was met with violence and the black candidates had to fear for their lives. In Mississippi, the method of controlling black votes and their life by brutal violence was known as the First Mississippi Plan, this was year 1875. Instead of risk a painful death to be beaten up, many of the black voters voted Democratic in the presidential election of 1880. The white oppression against black in Mississippi reached a level where the members of KKK no longer had to cover their faces with the white masks and they together with the new legislature were so powerful that the republic governor after the election decided to leave the state.</p>
<p>In 1890 the Jim Crow laws were presented. Many of these legal steps were aimed to separate the different races in public places, public schools, parks, restaurants, and transportation’s such as trains and buses. It was even separate water fountains, toilets and public bath houses for white and black people. Adult black men’s right to vote disappeared also. During those early segregation years Jim Crow cars was the name on segregated vehicles. These different segregation laws were often supported by the white inhabitants in the states of the south and some sort of witch hunt began against blacks. Violence was a daily thing for the people, from 1889 to 1930 over 3.700 men , women and children around the south were reported seriously beaten up because their color of skin, it was not unusually that they died from the injuries. Of course was the rewriting of the laws nothing that the blacks would accept and serious race riots started as a protest against the new laws. The riots spread all over the south. In the summer 1919 at least twenty-five riots were recorded with death and injuries as a result for several hundreds. That summer was so bloody that it became known as the red summer of 1919 in history books.</p>

<p>Nearly all civil rights have resulted from the theories of natural law and natural rights. The idea that people have certain rights that cannot be taken away probably began thousands of years ago with the theory of natural law This theory states that a natural order exists in the universe because all things are created by nature, or God Everything has its own qualities and is subject to the rules of nature to achieve its full potential. According to this theory, anything that detracts from a person's human qualities, or prevents their full achievement violates the laws of nature.</p>
<p>The ancient Greek philosophers and the writers of the first testament stressed that there is a higher law than human law. In the first century Before Christ, the Roman philosopher Cicero insisted that this higher (natural) law is universal and can be discovered through human reason. This idea led to the belief that governmental power has limits, and that people and governments everywhere are bound by natural law.</p>
<p>Some of the most historic English legal documents are based on the principles of natural law. The earliest and most famous is Magna Carta, which the king approved against his will in 1215. The document placed the king himself under the law. In 1628, the English Parliament drew up a Petition of Right. The petition claimed that certain actions of the king, such as levying taxes without the concept of Parliament, were unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Natural law had always stressed the duties more than the rights of government and individuals. But during the late 1600's, the natural law tradition began to emphasize natural rights. The change was brought about largely by the writings of the English philosopher John Locke.</p>
<p>Locke argued that governmental authority depends on people's consent. According to Locke, people originally lived in a state of nature with no restrictions on their freedom. Then they came to realize that confusion would result if each person enforced his or her own rights. People agreed to live under a common government, but not to surrender their "rights of nature" to the government. Instead, they expected the government to protect these rights, especially the rights of life, liberty and property. Locke's ideas of limited government and natural rights became part of the English bill of rights(1689), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man(1789) and the U.S. Bill of Rights(1791). Today, many scholars reject the natural law and natural rights theories.

<p>Of course people could not handle the civil rights very good. They started to call black people slaves and said that they had no rights at all. But in the beginning of the 19th century things started to change. In 1808 for example, the importation of slaves got banned, but the illegal slave trade continued. Twelve years later, 86 free blacks sailed to Sierra Leone, a British colony in Africa. This was the first immigration of blacks from U.S. to Africa.</p>
<p>In the same year Missouri Compromise allow slavery in Missouri, but not elsewhere west of the Mississippi and north of Missouri’s southern border. This was repealed in 1854.</p>
<p>The Oberlin College was the first U.S. college to adopt coeducation. It was also first to refuse to ban black students. A Dred Scott supreme court decision rules that slaves do not become free when taken into a free state, that congress cannot ban slavery from a territory, and that blacks cannot become citizens. This was 24 years after the Oberlin college, in 1857. In 1861 the civil war started. It lasted until 1865. All slaves in areas still in rebellion was freed in 1963 by president Abraham Lincoln. He issued Emancipation Proclamation, which means exactly to free.</p>
<p>Klu Klux Klan was formed in secrecy in 1866. It disbanded 1869 but resurgence in 1915.</p>

<p>After the Civil War the United States offered Civil Rights to African-Americans. The Government of the United States passed an amendment, the thirteenth, ending slavery in 1865, that outlawed slavery, it did not provide citizenship and equal rights. The Government passed another amendment giving African-Americans residing in the United States citizenship and they were offered citizenship in 1868 when the fourteenth amendment was passed. Blacks born in the United States had equal protection under the laws of the Constitution and 1870, the fifteenth amendment, all citizens had the right to vote.</p>
<p>Northern troops occupied the south and enforced the new constitutional amendments during Reconstruction (1865 – 1877). Many blacks took prominent positions in society.</p>
<p>Reconstrucion ended following the Compromise off 1877 between Northern white elites and Southern white elites. The Radical Republicans had attempted to eliminate both governmental and private discriminatin by legislation. That effort was ended by the Supreme Court’s decision in the Civil Rights cases 1883, in which it said that the fourteenth amendment did not give Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or bussiness.</p>

<p>In 1896 racial segregation was upheld by a decision of the United States Supreme Court. This landmark decison, Plessy V. Fergusion, arose when a railroad company refused to provide a black train passenger. The Supreme Court could segregate white sleeping car passengers from black sleeping car passengers, but the railroad had to provide sleeping accommodations for blacks that were equal to similar accommodations for whites. This decision promulgated for the first time the famous “Separate but equal” doctrine. That doctrain was used extensively by southern states to justify racially segregated public schools from kindergarten to graduate school. Justice Harlan, the only member of the Court to dissent from the decision wrote: our Constitution is colorblind and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens”. Despite Harlan’s words, the major characteristic of southern blacks at the beginning of the twenties century was that they were “governmental isolated” The protections of the national government had been removed from them and after 1892, when the congress repealed national voting right laws, black southerns males were even denied the vote.</p>
<p>In many cities and towns, African-Americans were not allowed to share taxi with whites, they had to drink from separate fountains, attend separate schools, use separate restrooms, be burried in separate cementaries, swear on different bibles and enter a building through different doors. They were excluded from resturants and public libraries. Even parks had a sign with “Negroes and dogs not allowed”. They were expected to step aside to let a white person pass, and black men dared not look any white woman in the eye.</p>

<p>During the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decade of the twentieth century, thousands of black males were lynched by white vigilantes. In some cases lynching turned into mass murder, as rampaging whites killed large numbers of blacks. No white were charged with crimes in any of those massacres. They took pictures of their victims and made postcards out of them.</p>

<p>The white society also kept blacks in a position of economic subservience or marginality. Employers and labor unions generally restricted African-mericans to the worst paid and least desirable jobs. Steady well-paid emplyment was hard to find in black communities. Relatively undistinguished jobs, such as working as a pullman porter, became prestigious positions. The Jim Crow system that excluded African-Americans from many areas of economic life led to creation of a vigorous, but stunted economic life.</p>

<p>At the turn of the century Booker T. Washington, an African-American educator and author, was regarded as the foremost spokesman for African-Americans in the United States. Washington, who was principal of the Normal school, an institution for training teachers, in Tuskegee, Alabama that later developed into Tuskegee institute, preached a message of self-reliance, in whish he urged blacks to concentrate on improving their economic positions rather than demanding social equality until they had proved that they “deserved” it. His accommodationist rhetoric not only accepted the continuation of Jim Crow and in the short term, but implicitly blamed blacks for their own subjugation.</p>
<p>William Edward Burghardth Du Bois, an African – American civil rights activist, and others in the black community rejected Washington’s apology for segregation. In 1905 Du Bois and one of his close associates William Monroe Trotter, who was the first black graduate of Harvard, convened a meeting of black activists.</p>
<p>Du Bois created the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, in 1909 with other black leaders and Jewish activists. NAACP was formed by both blacks and whites. The NAACP concentrated on using the courts to attack Jim Crow laws that exempted most whites voters from a law that disenfranchised African-American citizens in the Unites States. The NAACP also lobbied against President Wilson’s introduction of racial segregation into federal government employment in 1913 and for commissioning of African – Americans as officers in World War 1.</p>
<p>Most of the American Jewish community supported the civil rights movement. Many of the members in NAACP came from the Jewish community. In the 1930s and 1940s Jewish refugee professors arrived at southern black colleges where they organized dinners at whish blacks and whites were forced to sit next to each other.</p>

<p>The Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) is an educational organization that was found by Marcus Garvey in Jamaica in 1914. In 1920s he offered a program of black nationalism that encourage black economic independence whitin the system of racial segregation in the United States, and a campaign that urged African – Americans to “return to Africa”. Garvey attracted thousands of supporters but the movement collapsed quickly when he began to suspect the foreign-born radicals of challenging his control. The Government deported Garvey to his native Jamaica in 1927.</p>

<p>Many African- Americans had moved during World War 1 as depressed conditions in the farm economy of the South in the 1920s made the north look more appealing. Those expanding northern communities confronted familiar problems, racism, poverty and police abuse.</p>
<p>In 1931 nine black teenagers were accused of raping two white women on a train. The NAACP and the Communist Party (CP) USA organized support for this case that called the “Scottsboro boys”. The Communist Party and its arm the International Labor Defense (ILD) had many cases like this one. They defended and saved many accused blacks from death to freedom.</p>
<p>The NAACP devoted much of its energy between the first and second world wars to fighting the lynching of blacks through the United States.</p>

<p>Murders of African – American made by whites were still common in the 1950s and still unpunished n large areas of the South. In 1955, Rosa Parks “the mother of Civil Rights Movement” refused to get up out of her seat on a public bus to make room for white passengers. She was arrested and when the incident reached the black community, fifty African- American leaders gathered and organized the Montgomery Bus Boycott (political protest) to protest the segregation of blacks and whites on public buses, which lasted for 381 days. Until the local ordinance segregation African- Americans and whites on public buses was lifted. This instance is often credited as the start of the Civil Rights Movement.</p>
<p>In 1957, Highlander Folk School created Citizenship schools to teach literacy to allow blacks to pass voting tests. The program was an enormous success, tripling the number of black voters on St: John Island.</p>

<p>Sit- ins were an integral part of the non-violent strategy of civil disobedience that ultimately ended racial segregation in the United States. The Civil Rights Movement received an infusion of energy when students in North Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia began to “sit-in” at lunch counters in local stores to protest establishments refusal to desigrate. Protesters were encourage to dress up, sit quietly, and occupy every other stool so potential white sympathizers could join in. Many of the sit-ins resulted in authority figures physically and brutally escorting them from the lunch facility. The activists who had led the sit-ins formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960, to take these tactics of nonviolent confrontation further. In 1961, their first campaign was conduction freedom rides, s series of student political protests performed as part of the U.S. civil rights movement. Activists traveled by bus through the deep South to desegregate the Companies’ bus terminals, as required by federal law. It proved to be an enormously dangerous mission. For example one bus was firebombed, forcing its passengers to flee foe their lives.</p>
<p>In 1962 Robert Moses, SNCC’s representative in Mississippi, brought together the civil rights organization the state. SNCC, the NAACP, and CORE formed COFO the Council of Federated Organizations.</p>

<p>A. Philip Randolph had planed a march on Washington in 1941 in support of demands for elimination of employment discrimination in defense industries, but the march was called of. In 1962 Randolph and Bayard Rustin, an African- American civil rights activist, proposed a plan of a second March of Washington for Jobs and Freedom.</p>
<p>The march was held in 1963. It had six official goals: meaningful civil rights law, a massive federal works program, full and fair employment, decent housing, the right to vote, and adequate integrated education. More than 200,000 demonstrators were gathered.</p>

<p>COFO brought more than a hundred college students to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 (Freedom Summer) to join with local activists to register voters, teach in “Freedom schools” and organize the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, (MFDP). MFDP was a political party organized by both black and white Mississippians.</p>
<p>President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, on August 6. The voting rights act was necessary because many African- Americans were being intimidated not to vote or register the vote. The Act had and immediate and positive impact for African- Americans. After some months, one quarter of a million new black voters had been registered.</p>

<p>Stokley Carmichael, who became the leader of SNCC in 1966, was one of the most articulate spokespersons for what became known as the “Black Power” movement.</p>
<p>Stokley urged African- American communities to meet white supremacist group known as Ku Klux Klan armed. Several blacks met Ku Klux Klan armed and as a result the Klan stopped terrorizing their communities. Several blacks demanded that whites no longer refer to them as “Negroes” but as “Afro- Americans”.</p>

<p>Our contemporary theorists are standing on the shoulders of the giants of sociology, but they are in turn expanding the horizons of our discipline at the macrostructural, microinteractional and interpretive levels of analysis. Our contemporary sociology is characterised by a confusion of science and policy. A scientific analysis does not or should not involve any emotional part of the investigator, but when legal sociology is presented in a scientific language the normative considerations become subtly applicable.</p>
<p>In my article I have made an attempt to discuss ‘ The Boundaries of Legal Sociology’ by one of the Masters of Sociology of law and its founding thinker Donald Black, who essentially construed and contributed in its development.</p>
<p>Donald Black tried to explain the nature and aims of a pure sociology of law. He said that the study of sociology of law must engage and include in itself the empirical aspects.</p>

<p>Donald Black is a theoretical sociologist with numerous publications in the sociology of law, morality and conflict. Black's work has increasingly expanded to include projects as a theory of the differential success of ideas, a theory of scienticity, a theory of scientific theory, and a theory of the behavior of supernatural beings such as God. Black is the founder of pure sociology, a sociological paradigm that includes no psychology or even people. His most recent book, The Social Structure of Right and Wrong, was awarded both the 1994 Theory Prize and a Distinguished Book Award of the American Sociological Association. He also authored The Behavior of Law, The Manners and Customs of the Police, and Sociological Justice. A recent article, "The Epistemology of Pure Sociology," which was published in 1995 in Law &amp; Social Inquiry, won a Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association1. After completing his doctorate at the University of Michigan in 1968, Professor Black pursued postdoctoral studies as a Russell Sage Fellow in Law and Social Science at Yale Law School, and continued at Yale University with appointments in both the Law School and the Department of Sociology. In 1979 he moved to Harvard University, where he again held appointments in both the Law School and the Department of Sociology. He came to the University of Virginia in 1985, where he has occasionally taught in the Law School as well. His University Professorship entitles him to teach in any school or department of the University. Donald Black, at present is the University Professor of the Social Sciences at the University of Virginia. He often serves on the editorial board of scholarly journals, and edits a series of books called "Studies on Law and Social Control" for Oxford University Press. He has been invited to lecture in numerous countries abroad, including Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Holland, France, Scotland, England, Poland, and Japan. In “The Boundaries of Legal Sociology,” Donald Black argues for the positivist “Scientific analysis of legal life” that would result in “a general theory of law, a theory that would predict and explain every instance of legal behaviour” EXPLANATION OF THE ARTICLE:</p>

<p>Black here tries to explain what he thinks about the contemporary sociology and what he calls as pure Sociology. To write on law and society is to respond to two crises: crisis in law and crisis in social theory, both are consequences of the reaction against enlightenment rationality. Contemporary jurisprudence has been marked by a series of movements to deconstruct or salvage law and legal theories. Ever since law and legal theory were subject to question and critique by the legal realists at the beginning of the twentieth century, legal institutions, legal consciousness and the study of law have been in crisis. The legal Sociologists try to make an attempt to mark the boundaries of i.e. beginning and end of Legal Sociology. As the task is difficult, there are always debates within that whether it should have a scientific or empirical Sociology of Law or should it be more theoretical and Philosophical. The two most important questions that always open up debates within Legal Sociology are regarding the Structure of Sociology of Law and How to study it&#160;? What methods should be adopted by the Sociologists of law to study it&#160;? i). What should be the scope of the discipline&#160;? ii). What is the method adopted&#160;? Black says that Legal Sociology is mostly presented in a scientific manner, specifically in language and tone, but the normative considerations are implied in it. The ideology of the sociologist overpowers the scientific aspect involved in it. He says that a purely sociological approach to law should not involve assessment of legal policies keeping in mind what is just or what ought to be, but it should be scientific analysis of the Legal behaviour. He offers a general theory of law, which would incorporate every aspect of legal behaviour. He also contends that the achievement of such a theory, may be a utopian idea but every sociologist must try to achieve it. The problem faced by every policy making are problems of value or value considerations. Thus, in this article the nature and aims of a pure sociology have been discussed.</p>

<p>Legal Sociology tries to answer the question that how does law affects society and behaviour of human beings. This can be said in a single word Legal effectiveness. How effective is the law in restricting and curtailing human behaviour&#160;? There are three dimensions of Legal effectiveness&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementation: How well is a law implemented&#160;?</li>
<li>Impact: What is the impact of a law in the Society&#160;?</li>
<li>Comparison between the Legal Ideal and Legal Reality: What is law in action and what is it in theory?</li>
</ol>

<h5><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-12_84b2.html" title="Edit section: The Miranda Case: (Mirinda Vs State of Arizona)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">The Miranda Case: (Mirinda Vs State of Arizona)</span></h5>
<p>Early in 1963, an 18- year old woman was kidnapped and raped in Phoenix, Arizona. The police investigated the case, and soon found and arrested a poor, and mentally disturbed man. The name of this man was Ernesto Miranda, a name that would become well known in American constitutional studies. Miranda was 23 years old when he was arrested. He confessed that he had kidnapped and raped the young woman after only two hours of questioning. By confessing to the crime, Miranda was convicted for kidnapping and rape. However, when Miranda was arrested he was not told his rights that are stated in amendment number five. On appeal, Miranda’s lawyers pointed out that the police had never told him that he had the right to be represented by a lawyer, and that he could remain silent if he wished to do so. In addition, he was not told that everything that he said could be used against him. In the end of 1966, the United State’s Supreme Court gave support to the defendant side by only a 5-4 majority. The Supreme Court decision detailed the principles governing police interrogation. In addition, they decided that the police have to make certain points clear for the accused before questioning and suspect. The Miranda versus the state of Arizona would detail the principles governing police interrogation, and protect the rights and the privileges of the people in the United States of America. Accused and arrested people in the United States of America are enjoying too many rights and privileges. As shown in the Miranda case, a person may get away with no punishment, even if the accused confesses to the crime, if the police do not read that person his five rights and privileges that are supposed to ensure the due process of the law stated in Amendment number five in the American constitution. Now Black says that the implementation of such a decision can be questioned and researched. In such cases the impact might be very difficult to measure. Legal effectiveness is helpful for people to reform legal order if there is a wide gap between the law in theory and law in action. But again this can be precarious as it may at each step involve the moral judgement of the investigator.</p>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-12_84b2.html" title="Edit section: PART III">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">PART III</span></h4>
<p>Each and every problem can be solved if a proper technique is applied to it. All that works can be learned through Science. In the world of today every social controversy is dominated by the scientific thought, whether the use of drugs should be legalized or not. The rationality of each policy is thought of before enforced. Moral problems of every sort are translated into problems of science and knowledge and practical solutions are then searched. Thus Donald Black contends that Sociology of law must engage and include in it self the empirical aspects.</p>
<a name="PART_IV" id="PART_IV"></a>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-12_84b2.html" title="Edit section: PART IV">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">PART IV</span></h4>
<p>Black says that sociology is a scientific enterprise and thus can be distinguished from moral philosophy or any normative oriented study i.e. to say that the facts are different from values. Max Weber4 said that intrusion of values occur at various stages of social science. For example at the first stage of scientific enquiry which can be the choice of the problem. But what a sociologist can do is that after the selection of a problem he should be pursued non-evaluatively. But Black goes a step further and says that bias is thus built inherently into the foundation of social sciences. Thus value judgement at the time of selecting the problem may also affect its scienticity. But the fact that scientific statements are influenced by the value does not make them value statements, because they are verified and proved empirically. Value may affect social sciences but that should not be the reason to abandon the concept of empirical sociology of law. Black is an empiricist. Empiricists claim knowledge is a product of human experience. Statements of observations take pride of place in empiricist theory. Naïve empiricism holds simply that our ideas and theories need to be tested against reality, and accepted or rejected on the basis of how well they correspond to observed facts.</p>

<p>Black describes law as governmental social control. It is a concept easily employed in cross societal analysis, encompassing any act by a political body that concerns the definition of social order and excludes social order as a sense of morality. Law is essentially a social control system.</p>

<p>In the end, Donald Black says that the quality of applied science depends on the quality of pure science. Today what is useful is the being of a pure sociology of Law and its being there does not solely depend on its usefulness, but it should be scientific and verifiable today because then only will it have its application.</p>
<a name="CRITICISM_OF_BLACK" id="CRITICISM_OF_BLACK"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-12_84b2.html" title="Edit section: CRITICISM OF BLACK">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CRITICISM OF BLACK</span></h3>
<p>The Blackian perspective of a pure sociology has been challenged by basically 2 thinkers i.e. Philippe Nonet5 and R. Cotterrell6. Following were the bases of criticism offered&#160;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sociology of law must have redeeming value for policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is said that any kind of theoretical work yields very less. Thus we should not and cannot make value judgements irrelevant in the society .</p>
<ul>
<li>Sociology of law must integrate policy analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black argues that to research on a law that is already clear on the part of the decision is applied science. And thus it retreats from major scientific responsibility of policy research, it has to clarify a purpose. Black says that a sociologist should ignore the purpose of the policy he evaluates, but this would sterilize the research.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pure Sociology cannot mean what it says.</li>
</ul>
<p>Black has not defined what is the need of such purification. What are the standards of such purity have also not been defined. One cannot remain free from behaviour or bias of any kind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete neutrality is impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one can eradicate the bias, subjectivity and value orientation. Research is often subjective. Researchers always have their own motives, goals, ethics and values, some deeply unconscious, and it is thus nearly impossible to be a completely objective observer. A bias is a prejudice in a general or specific sense, usually in the sense for having a predilection to one particular point of view or ideology. One is said to be biased if one is influenced by one's biases. A bias could, for example, lead one to accept or not-accept the truth of a claim, not because of the strength of the claim itself, but because it does or does not correspond to one's own preconceived ideas. A context of jurisprudence has to be present in sociology.</p>
<ul>
<li>The study should be intredisciplinary.</li>
</ul>
<p>It would seem at this point that the only way to generate results that would explain the major causes of social phenomena would be to utilize variables from all relevant disciplines. Even in their advanced form, studies are still in correlational mode. They are only preliminary to building models of process. If we want to understand suicide well enough to prevent it, we will need an approach that can combine economic, social, and psychological vectors into a single dynamic system. If the determination to keep sociology pure does not advance our understanding of the real world, what other function could it serve? As it is said ‘Purity is the enemy of change, of ambiguity, and compromise’7. This is a kind of conservative approach.</p>
<a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-01-12_84b2.html" title="Edit section: CONCLUSION">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">CONCLUSION</span></h3>
<p>A variety of new theoretical paradigms have emerged, challenging the mainstream quantitative, empiricist, and positivist conceptions of social theory and social research. The new paradigms, such as phenomenology, ethno-methodology, structuralism, and hermeneutics have provided new ways to examine and analyze social practice and social issues, but none of them has successfully replaced the prevailing positivist social theories and social research. The consequence is that twenty-first century studies of law and society, with whatever orientation or perspective/approach, must be mindful of a number of distinctive but intertwined challenges: the critical, hermeneutical, postmodern, global and plural. Black basically argues 4 things&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pure sociology</li>
<li>Value Neutrality</li>
<li>Legal Effectiveness</li>
<li>What is Law&#160;? Governmental social Control.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, what ever Black argues cannot be fully relied on and because one cannot exclude dimensions of critical theory and only include empirical theory. Today, although most sociologists would agree that scientific method is an important part of sociology, extreme positivism is rare. Social scientists realize that it is extremely hard to create a law that would hold true in all cases when human behaviour is concerned, and that often while behaviour of groups may be sometimes explained and predicted with some probability, it is much harder to explain the behaviour of each individuals. In some quarters of contemporary sociology, positivism has been replaced by a contrary view, antipositivism. Most sociologists today operate somewhere between positivism and antipositivism, arguing that human behavior is more complex than animal behavior or the movements of planets. Humans have free will, imagination and irrationality, so that our behavior is at best difficult to explain by rigid "laws of society".</p>

The actual meaning of the Yiddish cup is still unknown, the secret lying with Neil Bauman of www.ebaumsworld.com. In a recent letter to Max at www.ytmnd.com he said "Obviously you have lost possesion of your Yiddish Cup!" We may never know its true meaning but for now it stands as a symbol of the Ebaums staff's increasingly failing mental health.</p>

HōmBrū was formed out of Denton, TX as a five-piece ensemble. The original spelling was a bit less creative. Homebrew. The players were Michael Powell- vocals and guitar/stick, Todd Wink- Drums, David Huff- Bass, Mike West- Guitar, Brian Gendron- Guitar. The purpose and mission of HōmBrū was, and always has been to bring back the sincerity and validity that had once been the driving forces behind popular music. As a five-piece, HōmBrū struck a chord with audiences in their use of unique arrangements and complex rhythmical lines. HōmBrū quickly developed a loyal fan base, and gained the reputation among local live music venues as "the professionals" and the "go-to guys" whenever national acts were scheduled to play.</p>
<p>In early 1999, HōmBrū made their first full-length independent release entitled "Imaginary Music." The response from fans and critics was positive overall; however, the band was then faced with a dilemma. The main concern was that, although the music had been well received, the equation was not quite balanced enough for them to be considered by the major recording labels and, in turn, radio-broadcasting corporations. HōmBrū knew that if they were going to fulfill their professional goals as musicians they would have to play the game within the boundaries that had been established. By the end of 2000, the band unanimously decided to take a hiatus from writing and playing to reflect upon what they had accomplished thus far, and to decide what adjustments needed to be made to propel them to the next level.</p>
<p>In 2001 the band reconvened, this time as a trio of Mike, Todd and Dave. The reduction in force brought with it a stronger focus and a new understanding of what needed to be done to accomplish the group’s objectives. By the autumn of 2001, HōmBrū made its return to the stage, an event that was held in great anticipation by the fans in the weeks and days that preceded. The response was unimaginable, and the sound was raw yet precise. HōmBrū was definitely on the right track with the new material, so the decision was made to reenter the studio.</p>
<p>During the first two weeks of March 2002, HōmBrū recorded, mastered, and pressed their second release, simply titled "Ingredients." This 30-minute recording personifies HōmBrū’s commitment to excellence, professionalism, and dedication to the attainment of their goals. Since releasing "Ingredients", HōmBrū has garnered significant international recognition gaining fans and radio airplay in France, Denmark, Germany, Israel, Spain, and the Philippines.</p>
<p>A third album the continues in the Ingredients style is near complete and will be released summer of 2006. HōmBrū has now moved on once again, this time further into the "electro" world. Todd has now switched to ZenDrum: a tap drumset. Mike and David both play midi chapmansticks. The sound is new and cutting edge.

<p>The business landscape is constantly changing and evolving, and the race to keep a small business afloat against competition is many times decided by the structure of the business' internals, as well as the machine that runs the business in the background. The information that keeps a business competitive in the marketplace is only useful if it can be shared thr oughout a company with speed and efficiency, and many times the inefficient are overtaken by sub-par competition based simply on a better business model and a streamlined information platform. Small business owners are scrambling to eliminate the frustrating and time consuming shuffling of paperwork from office to office, impacting the bottom line through streamlining information transfer, and staying competitive by using the best methods available to run their business effectively. The debut of online business management programs such as Quickbooks Online and NetSuite at the beginning of the Millennium allowed millions of small business' to make the leap to the connectivity and streamlining of the internet, creating an environment where small business' were able to function at the same technological level as large companies. The features of large firm online business management software were stripped down to allow price reductions, and therefor price the service at a level that small business could handle. In the range of a per-user fee of $80 per month, the bar had been set in the arena of online business management. A user had access to an inclusive management product that previously would have to be built on separate products each targeting a specific segment of the market (Quickbooks for accounting and SalesForce.com for sales-force automation.) Even though the service still did not address many of the other specific needs of business, from communication to security, it still did a better job than integrating separate products each with it's own focus, and it enabled the business to become better connected through it's online nature. Then they realized they had no competition.</p>
<p>NetSuite existed as the only player for years, slowly raising the price structure and alienating the small business target market further with each update, gearing the product more and more to large business', and raising per user fees to the astonishing levels of $1200 per year. It was a simple case of pay or move back to your old formats, all of which still presented the same problems as in the past. Many customers, frustrated with the state of affairs and feeling duped, began moving to products which seemed to be online versions of the old programs they ran, Quickbooks leading the charge to draw Netsuite's captive audience to products developed with their business size in mind. From the $99 SimpleStart program to the $3500 per year Quickbooks Enterprise, the small business seemed to be back in control, at least with respect to certain aspects like finance. Still, the connectivity lacked and the inclusive nature of a high-end service was not available to the small business. Small companies were once again treated like small fish.</p>
<p>As in all business, the landscape changes dramatically with blazing speed, and those who fail to see the changes usually do not last very long. While you were sound asleep in your big expensive bed, dreaming happily about fleecing the next customer, the competitor arrives. The talking has been going on behind the scenes for years, from how the customer is being ripped off with a sub-standard product to the failures in addressing the multiple needs of business, the framework for a better service was being constructed. Customers are truly only as loyal as their options, and have been waiting a long time for another option to consider. CyTek has entered the game with a superior service, and is changing the landscape.</p>
<p>The CyTek BMS is an all-inclusive online business management system that allows customers all the functionality of the most expensive products from Quickbooks and Oracle, iced with additional connectivity, streamlining and data sharing features that have never been available to any customer, let alone the small business market. While addressing all of the management issues that the other services do, this service simply offers more features, a better platform and superior integration, period. There are no competitors that offer this level of service, and yet the price is still lower.</p>
<p>CyTek is a Web Solutions firm that specializes in taking the mystery out of the web from a business standpoint, allowing small business to concentrate on the primary focus of selling their products or services. Located in Las Vegas, CyTek takes business online presence to the next level by focusing on individual business' needs. While the ability to purchase the software as a standalone service to manage your business from any internet connection is always an option, CyTek takes customer service to the next level by providing the ability for your business brand to be developed as a strong presence in the growing internet market. They realize that the management of customers and data is important, but the creation of new customers through the internet is the other part of the equation. The face CyTek can develop for your business online builds the customer base that their software manages so effectively. A true one-stop shop for development of the future face of business, CyTek as a firm really does function like their software, as a way to take the mystery out of the whole equation. Their software addresses all of the issues that managing your business brings up, and their team addresses all of the issues that your online presence produces. They truly have covered all the bases.</p>
<p>CyTek is on the verge of a global release of it's entire service line, and is poised as not only a threat to the antiquated system that customers have been forced to settle for, but as the only real solution in a rapidly changing business landscape. The future presents itself on a moment to moment basis, with information being the catalyst that forces change through adaptation to the landscape as it is presented at that moment. CyTek has the tools to place a small business on that landscape.</p>
