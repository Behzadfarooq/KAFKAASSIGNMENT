<li><b>Keep</b>. Perhaps because a lot of people don't consider "notability" to be a major factor in whether something's worthy of having an article about it in an encyclopedia, or disagree with your assessment of this person's notability? There are articles on <a href="../../../b/r/f/Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116.html" title="Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116">Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/n/Jennifer_8._Lee_9f70.html" title="Jennifer 8. Lee">Jennifer 8. Lee</a> solely on account of their unusual names, for example, so this article isn't some aberration. I personally happen to think it's noteworthy that someone named Optimus Prime fought in Iraq. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:36, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Jennifer 8. Lee writes for the New York Times. The naming of Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 was at least a protest against Swedish naming laws. Someone like <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Lu_Hitler_Marak_9014.html" title="Adolf Lu Hitler Marak">Adolf Lu Hitler Marak</a> is a notable Indiian politician. That Optimus Prime (the person) fought in Iraq doesn't I think make him any more notable than hundreds of thousands of others who have.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 23:45, 1 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, but the fact that he's named <i>Optimus Prime</i> makes him more notable than hundreds of thousands of others who have. Why can't someone be notable because of their name? You've already granted Brf...116 a pass in that regard, and Jennifer 8. Lee's notability as a Times writer doesn't appear to be the reason why the article was written either considering how much of it's focused solely on her name - there's as much about her job in her article as there is about Prime's job in his article. I don't see why the fact that the name was self-chosen in Prime's case would make a difference. <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 07:23, 2 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>I could easily go down to the local courthouse tomorrow and legally change my name to <i>Godzilla</i>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. An unusual name is not an encyclopedic claim to notability, and this article is wholly unexpandable.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm really strained to consider all of these keep votes as serious. Should I really advise the writer of the next vanity article that comes up here to just adopt an unusual name, as this simple measure will guarantee their notability?--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 15:18, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>At the very least, assume good faith. My vote is based mostly around the fact that it's already survived the VfD process, but I do believe he's notable enough to warrant an article and would have voted keep then, too. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 15:22, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm trying to assume full good faith, but I just don't see any reasonable basis being given as to why he is notable. Surely you realize there are probably thousands of people with names just as unusual as "Optimus Prime"; Mr. Prime just happens to be one of a few who've received mention in their local newspaper.--<a href="../../../p/h/a/User%7EPharos_440d.html" title="User:Pharos">Pharos</a> 15:47, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm sure there is a pretty large number of people who change their names to something a bit bizarre. If they recieve media attention and/or do something a little out of the ordinary (this guy, for instance, was deployed in Iraq and his military ID also reflects his new name, which is fascinating), I'll vote to keep them every time. If I have a kid and decide to name him <a href="../../../c/a/p/Captain_Underpants_7c43.html" title="Captain Underpants">Captain Underpants</a>, he's not going to be notable until there's a reason to notice him, such as a newspaper article or something he does. I don't know if there is a standard in place for bizarre names, but given the nature of WP, I have no problem with using that threshold personally. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">Badlydrawnjeff</a> 16:01, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Even if someone does something just to become notable, that doesn't prevent them from becoming notable for doing it. This person has found a unique way to become more interesting and notable than the average National Guardsman. <i>"Optimus Prime comes home from Iraq."</i> I love it. This article is surely a quirky, but real improvement to Wikipedia. <a href="../../../u/n/f/User%7EUnfocused_30b9.html" title="User:Unfocused"><font color="#66CCFF">Un</font></a><a href="../../../u/n/f/User_talk%7EUnfocused_667a.html" title="User talk:Unfocused"><font color="#0000CC">focused</font></a> 17:00, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as this is an article about a member of the National Guard with a notably unusual and bizarre namewho has received ample press coverage, and is duly noted at <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html#Language_and_names" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual_articles#Language_and_names</a>. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHall_Monitor_050f.html" title="User:Hall Monitor">Hall Monitor</a> 18:53, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../o/p/t/Optimus_Prime_ba88.html" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. "Optimus Prime" (toy) is notable, and the fact that someone chose to name himself after it is an interesting fact about the toy. The person is not notable at all. --<a href="../../../a/u/s/User%7EAustrian_d99f.html" title="User:Austrian">Austrian</a> 18:56, 3 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It actually got merged into that article for a while after the first VfD. However, the merged material didn't fit very well and wound up pared down to the snippet that's currently in the "see also" section so the person-stuff was split off into its own article again. I suspect the same would happen now, the Optimus Prime article is even bigger than it was back then. Besides, how would the merged article be categorized? <a href="../../../b/r/y/User%7EBryan_Derksen_3ce8.html" title="User:Bryan Derksen">Bryan</a> 23:40, 3 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as a standalone article. How many other people named after Transformers can one find in any country's military? This article is one of the many cool things I've learned about since reading <a href="../../../u/n/u/Wikipedia%7EUnusual_articles_dd7d.html" title="Wikipedia:Unusual articles">Wikipedia:Unusual articles</a> a while back. --<a href="../../../i/d/o/User%7EIdont_havaname_acde.html" title="User:Idont havaname">Idont Havaname</a> 00:56, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>comment</b> IMHO, the fact that the guy changed his name to Optimus Prime DOES make the guy notable enough for inclusion. Its cheesy notability. <a href="../../../r/o/o/User%7ERoodog2k_ec1a.html" title="User:Roodog2k">Roodog2k</a> <a href="../../../r/o/o/User_talk%7ERoodog2k_3c5f.html" title="User talk:Roodog2k">(Hello there!)</a> 09:56, 4 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: quickly checking <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, this article might conceivably come under the category of "genealogical entry, or phonebook entry": <i>One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line)</i>.
