A service fraternity is different from a social club fraternity: the main purpose of this type of group is to do charitable work in the community. Nine chapters in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic makes it sufficiently large and stable. What makes this a weak keep instead of a regular keep is the lack of citations. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 05:15, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> - Most of those Google hits are for American universities -- in fact, I haven't found one yet that mentioned Puerto Rico or the Dominican Republic. <a href="../../../z/e/t/Zeta_Phi_Beta_d643.html" title="Zeta Phi Beta">Zeta Phi Beta</a> in the US is apparently a sorority but the Google results seem to indicate it has male and female members both (this may be due to confusion between ZPhB and <a href="../../../p/h/i/Phi_Beta_Sigma_d39f.html" title="Phi Beta Sigma">Phi Beta Sigma</a>). It's a little confusing, but either way, I don't think the results are representative of the specific fraternity in question. I'm voting Weak Delete because I can't see any notability here. If the article adds some cited charitable work on a scale larger than "Car Wash" and "Candy Sale", then maybe. Otherwise, its only remote claim to notability is longevity. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 14:30, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Note:</b> If the result is "keep", can we get the name changed to something else?

<li><b>Weak delete</b>. I had a hard time fighting down my bias against all "fraternities"/"sororities" everywhere but the last section ("contact <b>us</b>") makes it read like a vanity article. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 14:59, 27 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Guys this is my first time making a internet page. I really dont now what exactly you want but just to clear things up. We are a Latin Faternity in a Little Island called Puerto Rico. In PR all fraternities are recuired to do things both charitable and social. All PR fratrnities and sororities are diffrent from the states yet we are recognized by the our and your goverment. When we were founded in 1957 the technology wasn't so advanced nor was the comunication and when we registerd the name Zeta Phi Beta at the time the goverment was required to look in PR registry only to see if anyone else had the name. Since no one else had it they registered it. Later we found out that Zeta Phi Beta was a Black sorority in the US. Years ago we met and decided that it was no ones fault and we could both keep the name since all was done acording to the law. i went to NY and met 2 sisters and they were more than happy to meet me and we hit it off pretty well. About our charities; all the money we get from selling candy, washing cars, etc... we donate to diffrent organizations for example: Cancer, Red Cross, Batterd Wifes, Youth in Trouble, Schools, Children of CREA (children of parents who are in prison), etc... One experience i personally had was my mother and Grandmother needed blood for diffrent operations, since i can't donate blood cuz of a tatoo i got when i was a frechman all my brother got togther and helped me out. Currently we have a few brothers who are making a websites so i can't give you one but as the "vanity" article reads; you can cantact me to clarify any doubts. you can alo contact the universities listed so they can varify any info. Currently the Politechnic Univ. and UPR - Mayaguez and Bayamon Campuses have Profesors that are fratbrothers. I really don't now what proof you need but i'm shure we can come up with something.

<li><b>Comment</b> â€” The reason that I listed Zeta Phi Beta 1957 up on the AFD is simply because the fraternity seems non-notable. While your frat donates to respectable charities, we respect that, but it still does no't make your fraternity notable. Perhaps if there were notable alumni who had been a part of the fraternity, but even then it may be stretching it a little bit. <a href="../../../k/a/r/User%7EKareeser_8b5c.html" title="User:Kareeser">Kareeser</a>|<a href="../../../k/a/r/User_talk%7EKareeser_7817.html" title="User talk:Kareeser"><sup>Talk!</sup></a> 06:15, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as utterly non-notable fraternity. If every random frat had an article on WP the we're be Fratpedia. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 17:35, 28 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b>: seems like a notable fraternity in Puerto Rico. Would like to see some numbers of members and alumni though. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalwatch_8ce9.html" title="User:Calwatch">Calwatch</a> 06:10, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Of corse we aren't notable in the states but in PR we are very respected by the community and other fraternities here. Personally i didn't find in the rules established by WikipediA that all fraternities added had to be known by people of the US or been established ther either. I do believe this website is a Free Encyclopedia and can be seen by all around the world and everyone who becomes affiliated with the site can add infromation cuz that is what this is about, contributing information. I could mencion a few names of some important frats but it's more than obviouse that none of you are going to know who the mayor of Carolina is, the singer Julio Cesar Sanabria, Rufino the owner of The New West, Antonio Rios the Head Manager of the Human Resorces Depatment of AEELA, Pujols the director of the Surveying Department of the Politecnic Univ of PR, the list is endless. To us a notable fratbrother isn't someone who is on TV, plays sports, etc... It's someone who through hard work and dedication has made a name of himself by growing profesionally. We've been around now for 49 years i think that makes a huge diffrence in comparison to other frats that only last a few years and then never hear from them again.
