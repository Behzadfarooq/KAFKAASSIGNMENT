<li><b>Weak keep</b> I'm kicking myself for voting this way (my personal bias is to delete it completely, and I voted that way in the last AfD), but there is enough press (e.g. <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10382721" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10382721" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>) and other mentions here for an article.

<li><b>Delete</b> Although I've been active in editing this article over the last few months, it's always been with gritted teeth.

Further, she has been dropped from her talent agency so her 15 minutes of fame are up.

<li><b>Weak delete</b>.

<li><b>Keep</b> It has been trimmed down a lot and provides information on someone who is becoming more infamous.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Just because someone's fifteen minutes are up doesn't mean that they never had them.

<li><b>Delete</b> I've been one of those calling for a keep vote in the past, based on her activities on various forums and being active in the New Zealand newspapers. However lately the furor has died down (with one minor yet vaguely amusing incident where she managed to get herself banned from any and all South Pacific Pictures productions) and frankly I see this for what I feel it is: "Liz Hating". While I'm a self-confessed "liz hater" and am tempted to vote keep for that reason, there is no way that Wikipedia can rely on having a neutral POV on this matter when the sources are all very biased against her (because news without an opinion doesn't sell, and bad opinions sell better then good ones). IMO she's a silly bint that needs a kick up the rear, but doesn't need a Wikipedia article devoted to her. Crocos 10:30, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've been editing the article a little recently. One thing to watch is that there are quite a few Internet forum types (for want of a better term) who are quite quick to add any little bit of information to the article in order to make Liz look bad. It's very hard to keep NPOV also (not least because she is known for mostly negative reasons). I'm not sure how to vote but even if she vanished tomorrow the article will still need watching for at least another year.- <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonLyall_811c.html" title="User:SimonLyall">SimonLyall</a> 11:41, 15 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Biased Keep</b> She was in two of my lectures last year. Oh boy... what a strange one! Anyone capable of wearing a miniskirt, no underwear and sneakers in 10 degree weather deserves an article (ok just kidding, but she is certainly notable in New Zealand). -- <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_f0ef.html" title="User:PageantUpdater"><font color="#DE3163">PageantUpdater</font></a> • <small><a href="../../../p/a/g/User_talk%7EPageantUpdater_3fed.html" title="User talk:PageantUpdater"><font color="#660066">talk</font></a> | <font color="#FF4F00">contribs</font> | <a href="../../../p/a/g/User%7EPageantUpdater_Esperanza_875b.html" title="User:PageantUpdater/Esperanza"><font color="#2E8B57">esperanza</font></a></small> 22:44, 16 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> relatively notable in New Zealand. <a href="../../../h/a/u/User%7EHauser_43ca.html" title="User:Hauser">Hauser</a> 10:36, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As others have said, edit out unsourced negative claims. She is well noted in New Zealand, as Nambio said she was on the front page of the new paper and is constantly in the lime light. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7EStevee2_4ff9.html" title="User:Stevee2">Stevee2</a> 11:43, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I have not contributed to the article, and have no interest in at all in the subject, but just because I would rather people wrote about what I consider more worthwhile should not allow the deletion of accurate material about subjects we're not interested in. Yes, I have heard of her, (and good luck to any young New Zealanders who haven't). The basic rules of WP:BIO are so restrictive that I suspect most of the bios on wikipedia would fail the test - the begining of WP:BIO should be read in conjunction with the other means of obtaining notability, such as the google test. She passes the google test. Criticism of the living person is a matter sorted by editing the material not deleting the whole article - and I notice in passing the Wikipedia living person guidelines are clearly based on U.S. law and really need someone to have a thought about other nations defamation laws. <a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWinstonwolfe_5756.html" title="User:Winstonwolfe">Winstonwolfe</a> 00:48, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notability was established satisfactorily when this article was created - the subject has continued to make media appearances and headlines since then. Remove unverified claims and retain the article; it does have relevance for New Zealand audiences. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamf-nz_b14e.html" title="User:Samf-nz">Samf-nz</a> 06:11, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> SHe appears to have been made notable by her own attention-seeking behavior, but is notable nonetheless. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 15:01, 18 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Extremely non-notable. New Zealanders who haven't watched every episode of NZ Idol are very unlikely to have heard of her. Every instance of her being mentioned here seems to relate to her self promotion. <a href="../../../m/o/s/User%7EMostlyharmless_cd83.html" title="User:Mostlyharmless">Mostlyharmless</a> 02:53, 20 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
