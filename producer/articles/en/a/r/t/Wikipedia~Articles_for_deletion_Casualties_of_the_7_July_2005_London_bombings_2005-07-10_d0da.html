<li><b>Keep</b>,This information should exist together with the article about the bombing. It could be merged onto the page, but it could become a long page itself, and I think for reasons of decency it could well be kept a separate page. I agree that right now it is trivial, but it will acquire content. reconsider in 6 months once facts are known. I do not think that long-term an obituary list would be appropriate unless the people remain notable in the future because of what happened to them, but this is possible yet. Right now, they would have to be considered notable.<a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandpiper_2d25.html" title="User:Sandpiper">Sandpiper</a> 16:36, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - I'm in agreement with Zscout. It's useful, and as the time goes on, it will be <b>expanded</b>, which it is need of.

<li><b>Merge</b> per Wile E. Heresiarch's second scenario (it's a list of numbers) into the main article.

<li><b>Delete</b>. We seem to be forgetting that Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia, <i>not a memorial</i>.

<li>For those stating that Wiki is not a memorial, here is the policy: "Memorials. It's often sad when people die, but Wikipedia is not the place to honor them. Subjects of encyclopedia articles must have a claim to fame besides being fondly remembered by their friends and relatives." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#What_the_Wikipedia_Encyclopedia_is_not" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#What_the_Wikipedia_Encyclopedia_is_not" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> What this means is that we can list how many have died in an accident, but we cannot have articles on everyone that was killed in the attack. <a href="../../../z/s/c/User%7EZscout370_3f46.html" title="User:Zscout370">Zscout370</a> <a href="../../../z/s/c/User_talk%7EZscout370_dbee.html" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Sound Off)</a> 16:00, 12 July 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed, but the page as it appears at the moment could easily be condensed into a sentence or two in the main <a href="../../../7/_/j/7_July_2005_London_bombings_2280.html" title="7 July 2005 London bombings">7 July 2005 London bombings</a> article. All it is is a few figures broken up with superfluous headings. And I would also take the view that the names of the dead are not worthy of inclusion. Just the other day the 9/11 casualty lists were transwikied to the sep11 wiki on the grounds that Wikipedia is not a memorial. — <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrilobite_212d.html" title="User:Trilobite">Trilobite</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETrilobite_e418.html" title="User talk:Trilobite">Talk</a>) 16:26, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<li>In that case, perhaps we wait the same 4 years before transiki-ing this list? <b>Keep</b> as long as it expands to a list of casualties instead of simple numbers. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:28, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>keep</b>. As it presently stands this is a useful spinoff article. It could do with a little tidying up at the start, but the information that is there is worthy of an article, particularly if it were structured into a timeline of when identifications were made and to highlight the problems of the recovery of remains. Its obvious now, less than a week after the attacks, what the timescale is and what the effort involved is. This might not be the case in 6 months or a years time, let alone 10 years time. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThryduulf_2c44.html" title="User:Thryduulf">Thryduulf</a> 13:19, 13 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd like to close out the voting and declare this a Keep (or Speedy Keep) now. Better yet, an admin with more experience in closing votes should do it (probably needs to as I've voted here). I think there's broad consensus that this article is now a keeper, considering the major changes that have been made to it since it was nominated and considering its importance to one of the most heavily-viewed articles in Wikipedia right now. The VfD tag diminshes it. I know the lag time since nomination is shorter than for most VfDs, so okay, speedy keep.

<li>I still think the article should be kept, but <b>not on this basis</b>, by no means should the article be such a tribute. Wikipedia is not the place to pay tribute to or honor the dead, see <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information</a> --<a href="../../../m/y/s/User%7EMysidia_5e77.html" title="User:Mysidia">Mysidia</a> 00:12, 16 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, I was under the impression "Wikipedia is not a memorial" referred to articles about individual people.

<li><b>Keep</b>. wikipedia has at least 10 000 good-for-nothing articles. this one is interesting and important, good to see there are some muslims which were killed in that barbaric attack such as Gamze from Turkey. a small note might be necessary to add that the killers will not go to Heaven, and they were brain-washed Muslim Brits. 16-7-2005</li>
