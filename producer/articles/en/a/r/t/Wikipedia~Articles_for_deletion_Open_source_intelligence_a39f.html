<li><b><s>Cleanup</s> Keep, with continuing cleanup</b>, <s>if not cleaned then <b>delete</b>. I've read this, top to toe. I am forming my view from the essay nature of the article, and not from the content, much of which seems to range from notable to highly notable. That it has a nice tone of prose is not a reason to have it here.</s> It would benefit from brevity (as would this comment!). A substantial précis would help it no end.

<li>I see good evidence of a cleanup. I would like to see more. Parts still have an essay and soapbox feel, and thus feel POV. However I see enough work done to limit my comments to the "cleanup".

<li><b>Learn</b>Yes, but is it possible that knowledge, broadly shared, will save the world? Wikipedia can go in one of two directions: it can enlighten, or it can allow the neanderthols to *impress* upon it their outdated views. With all due respect, this is about who gets to decide: the people, or the bureaucracts.... your call.. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Bear@oss.net (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Bear%40oss.net_c1b7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Bear@oss.net">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>Factual Errors, Needs Balance: it is my habit not to get involved in this sort of argument but as this article mentions me by name allow me to point out at least two errors. I was the Staff Director of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence but I served under Chairman Larry Combest (R-TX), 1995-97, not under Dave McCurdy for those earlier dates. The staff study mentioned, IC21, was written in 1995-96 under different circumstances and with different conclusions than described. I would add that the description of the so-called Burundi exercise is not entirely accurate and does not comport entirely with the views of the Aspin-Brown staff. This is piece as it currently stands is more polemical than informative. It needs to be toned down and it needs balance. OSINT is not some sort of Manichean struggle.

<li><b>Keep, cleanup and caution</b> the individuals who try to use this article, which clearly is about an encyclopedic topic, as a soapbox. The latter is probably due to <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060702/nysu015.html?.v=56" class="external text" title="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060702/nysu015.html?.v=56" rel="nofollow">this request</a> by a political interest group to use this article as an opinion outlet.

<li><b>Keep, cleanup, caution notes, and expand participation</b>. Lowenthal is correct to point out the inadvertent error, which I will correct now. More helpful would have been an actual entry adding to the group knowledge. The caution is noted, and should be extended to Alan Simpson, who is a spiteful blow-hard, and the CIA folks, who cannot stand having the truth about the inadequacy of their program pointed out. While Lowenthal is not correct on the Burundi exercise, and it was a major factor in getting the Open Source Agency into the 9-11 report, I am quite happy to move strongly away from "soapbox." My intent in not creating my own wiki at oss.net as I was asked to do, and instead pointing to the wikipedia, was precisely to engage as many people as possible in the sharing of knowledge through the wikipedia idea. I will be at the wikipedia conference in Boston in early August and would be very glad to participate in an offline session about how to make this more useful and less conflicted. It would be great to make it a special project with a moderating super-editor (not me) who can lock in truthful statements subject to repeated deletions by spiteful antagonists, and who can block untruths or other sidebars as necessary. I found it quite shocking to have all the references deleted simply because they were primary. Isn't that what knowledge is about? I have spent 18 years advocating open source intelligence in support of public policy, and I can tell you it has been a sacrifice, not a joy ride. I actively solicit group help in wikifying the page, in expanding the table of contents, and in identifying and blocking people who delete useful information out of spite. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> (<a href="../../../r/o/b/User_talk%7ERobert_Steele_3cb2.html" title="User talk:Robert Steele">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Robert_Steele_5aef.html" title="Special:Contributions/Robert Steele">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Edit</b>, if not edited, <b>keep</b>. I think there is definitely a demand for a thorough article on Open Source Intelligence, and the current one is at the very least a good start.

Guided by this group (which has been a very constructive process, thank you) I have wikified and now understand the architecture of many small paragraphs creating a structure that supports a summary page. So I have now created a process sub-structure (will do this last), a community of interest sub-structure, and a sources, softwares, and services substructure.

Then insist that new material be fact-based on not just based on Mr. Steele's voluminous ideas. Mr. Steele clearly needs to realize that he needs to get <i>other</i> people to talk and write about his ideas before they are notable enough to get into Wikipedia - otherwise, maybe it is all just in his own mind. He does have an NNDB entry but his three books are by his own press: OSS International Press. He is widely published in articles in major magazines like TIME and Forbes - so he is no crackpot. This is a common problem: his huge web site full of his personal ideas has no place at Wikipedia. What <i>other</i> people say about him and his ideas might have a place at Wikipedia.

<li><b>sigh--tired of mean-spirits</b> I have done a press release seeking to get the 7,500 people that have attended the annual OSINT conference to make contributions. I have worked VERY HARD to make this about OSINT and to avoid references to me or my web site, but the sorry fact, however mean-spirited a handful of critics might wish to be, is that the HISTORY of OSINT would not exist if I had not, at great personal sacrifice, lost money on each of those annual conferences, and taken the trouble to digitize the contributions from 1992-date. I am ready to do whatever it takes to satisfy the Wiki process and to attract OTHERS to contribute, and I am most grateful to the organizers for blocking the individual that was doing repetitive deletions out of spite. An individual that chooses to remain anonymous, I might add.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: If the delete notice could be removed, it would at least not DISCOURAGE new entries by OTHERS. My press release should result in at least 100 potential new international contributors, and many of them, if they see the delete notice, will choose not to waste their valuable time.</p>

<dd>Robert, I've posted a note to your talk page, however I'd like to reiterate that we aren't really what you are looking for. We aren't a site where you can just edit willy-nilly, though the press might lead you to believe otherwise. As has been pointed out to you by many, many editors, there are site policies with which we expect contributors to read and bear in mind when they add material to Wikipedia. Wikipedia is not there for anyone's essays or boosting of a particular topic. You <i>must</i> write with the site policies in mind! - <a href="../../../t/a/_/User%7ETa_bu_shi_da_yu_9191.html" title="User:Ta bu shi da yu">Ta bu shi da yu</a> 14:48, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>trying to focus, question</b> I am earnestly trying to focus on the Wiki way. I considered creating a whole series of quotes from the 600 folks that have spoken at my conference, but thought that the constant leads to my web site were not appropriate. I agree with the person who says joint point at my web site (as the master page does) but the whole point of what I have tried to do with the sub-structure for OSINT is to set the stage for OTHERS to contribute. Am going to go passive now and wait to learn more at the Wiki conference. It would help if the delete notice could be removed, and the master page could be "locked down" or at least blocked from CIA deletions--they HATE having me point out the fact that for 18 years they refused to pay attention to this, and now they have one young man with $5M to spend, when we should have someone of the stature of the Librarian of Congress, with $500M on the way to $1.5B to spend--simply trying to put all this in context. I will immediately comply with any guidance from the group between now and Boston. 68.227.195.23 15:01, 6 July 2006 (UTC) <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> 17:59, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

Can someone finally kill the delete box and we can revert to discussion page? <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> 17:57, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep, Steele Stands Back</b> I've just talked with your President, we will do a press release retracting or modifying my call for inputs, I have changed my web site to stiff vendors, and I will wait to learn more in Boston. This is my last entry here. Best wishes to all of you.<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_Steele_6ced.html" title="User:Robert Steele">Robert Steele</a> 20:56, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>You know I fear there are misassumptions here. The organisation behind the wikipedia phenomenon assuredly has a president (or similar role). But it appears to me as a relatively new editor here that he exercises the same rights here as any other editor. "We" thus do not have a president, because "we" are all autonomous editors, some of whom have (for example) rights to administer the project. Thus we have organised chaos, if you will. Based upon <a href="../../../a/s/s/Assume_good_faith.html" title="Assume good faith">assuming good faith</a> the wikipedia phenomenon has grown and is widely respected. As an entity it is not manipulable. This AfD nomination is a case in point. An article that was in a parlous state was nominated. It has been substantially cleaned up. At the end of the period of the nomination a decision will be reached. The article should not be a soapbox. It needs to end up flat, neutral and factual. In that way the nominator will have done us all a service, as will those who worked on the article. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 21:16, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I think what he means in that he talked to Jimbo on the phone and straightened out what is and is not encyclopedic. Hey, try this on for size: "Wikipedia is not a call to action, except for building a general encyclopedia." I guess the "soapbox" clause covers that. I think that that rest of Mr. Steele's agenda might be better suited for <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a> or something like that. He is obviously looking to network with other people about his area of expertise. Clearly, he is politically adept and is not going to make a nuisance of himself at Wikimania 2006. -- 67.121.114.153 21:55, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Don't you just hate it when people think they have rank and try to pull it? Mr Steele is doing himself no good in my eyes. I support retention of the article, but by no means in its current form. The <i>topic</i> is notable. Even the fact of the <i>soapbox</i> is notable. But the article is execrable. At the end of this AfD we need a diligent editing process to finish stripping out the POV and uncited stuff, to look at the articles it has spawned and do the same task, and maybe even AfD some of those if they exhibit the same POV tendencies. <a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETimtrent_b963.html" title="User:Timtrent">Fiddle Faddle</a> 22:05, 6 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
