<p>Looks like vanity to me. A politician who this page seems to indicate has never been close to being elected to anything. Is a businessman and has worked for a few bureaucracies (are all bureaucrats notable now)? Being elected to government on a national level is notable. Just running (especially on as a minor party candidate) is not. No real accomplishments. He has included his travel intinerary though. Fluff.

<li>I've compressed the page to a redirect. <b>Deletion is no longer necessary</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To explain in more detail: This is not the first time that pages of this sort have come up for discussion on vfd. In past discussions, a general consensus emerged around "minor candidate" pages: (i) there is room on Wikipedia to store some information about such figures, (ii) individual bio pages might not be the best way to approach such figures.</p>
<p>In one previous discussion, I suggested that I (or someone else) could create a more centralized database for minor candidates of the same party, storing the basic information for several such figures on a single page. Most seemed to agree that this was a reasonable compromise, in the event that it was necessary. (The threshold for "relevance" is somewhat lower for a general page of this sort than for a bio page; also, some readers opined that having the information in one location would be more convenient.)</p>
<p>"<a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Chernushenko_729a.html" title="David Chernushenko">David Chernushenko</a>" is now a redirect to a page on 2004 Green Party candidates. For the time being, his is the only entry -- there are a few more "dubious" bio pages that I plan on adding (and compressing to redirects) in the near future, however.</p>
<p>If anyone disagrees with this decision, please contact me on my talk page. For the time being, however, I suspect the matter may be closed. (Note that I made a similar decision on vfd once before, without any complaints.)</p>
<p>(Btw -- the page in its previous form *was* vanity.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 03:50, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm alright with this compromise; certainly better than a whole article on him. Also currently on VfD is <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Biocchi_a31a.html" title="Dan Biocchi">Dan Biocchi</a>, who, amazingly, is surviving VfD, even though his page said less than this one did. Part of the reason might be that he was once apparently an Olympic athlete (a fact that the article does not mention, nor does it even mention what he ran for and when). If he ran the same year I think he could be put on the same minor candidate page. I imagine there are many pages of candidates who ran for some office and lost who could recieve similar treatment. I know of a few anyway. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 04:11, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I hereby amend my earlier list (on <a href="../../../d/a/n/Dan_Biocchi_a31a.html" title="Dan Biocchi">Dan Biocchi</a>) of what I consider the main criteria for inclusion of minor party candidates, to add <i>(e) most candidates are included on a single list</i>. I think this is a really good idea, and strikes a good balance between notability concerns and the fact that the information <i>is</i> useful for some purposes. Keep list. (Oh, and I still think Dan Biocchi's Olympic history makes him an <i>individual</i> keep, as long as the article is expanded to include it.) <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 04:21, 24 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you have some good points. Some related discussion is going on in <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_Local_politicians_0d4d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Local politicians">Wikipedia:Deletion policy/Local politicians</a>. Would you consider joining it? <a href="../../../r/a/d/User%7ERadiant%21_e591.html" title="User:Radiant!">Radiant!</a> 09:28, Feb 24, 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I am still inclined to vote <b>delete</b>. He just does not meet my understanding of the recommended <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. Merger into a list doesn't really solve the underlying problems of articles about such persons. He is so little known that no one will realistically be able to verify the information in the article. A vandal could add, delete or modify the content of the article (whether stand-alone or in a list) and there won't be enough knowledgable reader/editors to catch it. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:52, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't believe this is likely, or that it makes a strong case for deletion -- these may not be well-known figures on a national level, but they're still public figures; information added to such pages may be scrutinized, as such. (And questionable edits can always be reverted in the absence of concrete information.) Chernushenko, in particular, is a relatively well-known figure within the City of Ottawa. He may not deserve a separate bio page, but there's surely room on Wikipedia for information on his political history. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 06:03, 27 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Including the redirect. Candidates for election, even to national legislatures, are usually not notable, and this is the only basis for notability that is mentioned. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a>'s "compromise" was to create a list article <a href="../../../g/r/e/Green_Party_of_Canada_candidates%2C_2004_federal_election_513e.html" title="Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election">Green Party of Canada candidates, 2004 federal election</a> aiming to have a short bio on each of the Green Party's 308 candidates (almost all of whom list). This list actually only has one bio, for Chernushenko. I think if you create a list that has a potential for 308 entries, you should create it with a significant number of those entries from the outset, rather than relying on eventualism to complete it. Nobody is going to expand this list to any reasonable degree and it is just going to be crud that is eventually going to have to go through VfD itself. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 15:40, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I realize that the discussion time on this article is over, but I should probably explain my motivations on the odd chance that anyone actually looks over this discussion in the future: the page only has one entry because it was presented as a model for future entries, and was meant to solicit discussion. There are numerous other pages that I could compress to redirects as well; in fact, I may do so shortly. (Btw -- for those overseeing the vfd/old page, I do not believe there is any consensus to delete the "David Chernushenko" page *in its current form*.) <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 23:02, 1 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is now preserved as an archive of the debate and, like some other VfD subpages, is no longer 'live'. Subsequent comments on the issue, the deletion, or the decision-making process should be placed on the relevant 'live' pages. <b>Please do not edit this page</b>.</p>
