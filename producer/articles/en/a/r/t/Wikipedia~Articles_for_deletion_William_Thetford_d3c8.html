<li><b>Keep</b>. And, by the way, people, keep in mind that the person who nominated this page for deletion for some reason is trying to destroy every ACIM-related article on Wikipedia. He is currently behind deletion attempts of the following ACIM-related articles: <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, and <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b> I would assume good faith if I had any reason to. A little history: Ste4k first came to my attention on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> article. He/she placed a tag at the top of the page that said the topic wasn't "notable" and that the article didn't assert any notability. Another editor, who was completely neutral, said that the contesting of the article's notability was not valid as you can find plenty of evidence that the article is about a real topic and is notable. This editor was met with a rather defensive and hostile response by Ste4k, which can be read on the talk page of that article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Because I was tired of all the arguing on the talk page, I sent Ste4k a message on his own personal talk page. I was met with a rather nasty reply about how it was inappropriate to talk to him/her on his/her talk page about some comment he/she had made about (and I quote) "some article". I was informed that he/she contributes to many pages on Wikipedia and doesn't remember any of them. I was then informed that I was too "attached" to the article, the suggestion being that if I were not "attached" to the article then I wouldn't make a statement that completely neutral editors agreed with.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And from there it just snow balled.... This person is on a campaign now to rid Wikipedia of every ACIM-related article, and is even slicing and dicing aspects of the main <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_In_Miracles_1d56.html" title="A Course In Miracles">A Course In Miracles</a> article, and doing so on the same flimsy grounds: that a few sources are not "verifiable". That is basically this person's only complaint: that some of these articles have sources whose verifiability does not meet with his/her approval. On the talk page for deletion proposal of <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKickahaOta_6061.html" title="User:KickahaOta">Kickaha Ota</a> wrote: <i>"The disputes about particular sources mentioned in the article don't undermine the notability of the controversy itself."</i> This is the only point I'm making in contesting all of Ste4k's deletion nominations of ACIM-related articles: disputes over particular sources do not warrant deletions of entire pages. It appears to me that Ste4k is simply looking for excuses to rid Wikipedia of ACIM-related articles. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 03:54, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Addendum</b> I would also like to add that in the course of this edit war between the two of us, Ste4k has made inaccurate accusations that I am involved with "some advocacy group" and has suggested that I am in some way making money off of ACIM. Somehow, though he/she claims to love verifiability so much, Ste4k has made these statements without a <i>shred</i> of evidence. He will never find any evidence to support such accusations, because such accusations are completely untrue. I can assure that the frustration I have felt with this situation emanates mostly from the "editor" in me, not the person who reads ACIM. You are aware, aren't you, that I first encountered Ste4k on the <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a> deletion proposal page; that is, I met him/her on the page for the <i>second attempt</i> to delete that article. The Wikipedia editor in me finds it very frustrating that after having worked hard to improve that page, it is facing yet another deletion attempt, and then in addition to the deletion attempt I must contend with Ste4k saying that the whole topic doesn't even exist at all. -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 04:05, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Just to inform fellow editors: it appears that the nomination of this page by Ste4k for deletion is a “bad faith” deletion attempt. Ste4k has recently submitted deletion nominations for all of the following <a href="../../../a/_/c/A_Course_in_Miracles_e1cf.html" title="A Course in Miracles">A Course in Miracles</a>-related articles: <a href="../../../a/c/i/ACIM_church_movement_7dd6.html" title="ACIM church movement">ACIM church movement</a>, <a href="../../../h/e/l/Helen_Schucman_99ad.html" title="Helen Schucman">Helen Schucman</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Thetford_8a2e.html" title="William Thetford">William Thetford</a>, <a href="../../../a/t/t/Attitudinal_healing.html" title="Attitudinal healing">Attitudinal healing</a>, Foundation for Inner Peace, <a href="../../../f/o/u/Foundation_for_A_Course_In_Miracles_a5a3.html" title="Foundation for A Course In Miracles">Foundation for A Course In Miracles</a>, Community Miracles Center, <a href="../../../g/a/r/Gary_Renard_560c.html" title="Gary Renard">Gary Renard</a>, Kenneth Wapnick. And in the article <a href="../../../a/u/t/Authorship_of_A_Course_in_Miracles_7511.html" title="Authorship of A Course in Miracles">Authorship of A Course in Miracles</a>, Ste4k will not accept ANY websites as “verifiable” websites with regard to ACIM, including <a href="http://www.acim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.acim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.acim.org/</a> and <a href="http://www.facim.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.facim.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.facim.org/</a>, both of which are the official websites of California-based non-profit organizations. This editor's deletion attempts are merely personal bias masquerading as adherence to Wikipedia policy. And it appears that this editor has a history with this kind of behavior. Please see: <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Big_Brother_Australia_series_6_3747.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big Brother Australia series 6">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Big Brother Australia series 6</a> -- <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrew_Parodi_4398.html" title="User:Andrew Parodi">Andrew Parodi</a> 07:57, 28 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
