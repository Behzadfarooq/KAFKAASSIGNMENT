<li>If someone wants to drop a copyvio notice there instead, I have no objection.

<li><b>Delete</b>: 300 fans can be wrong. More importantly, the company/product is not significant.

<li><b>Keep/Comment</b> I think it is short and sensable and can be added to by fans of the toy. I think I get a vote since I am a wikipedia member? Plus we do link to quite a few other companies here on Wikipedia that did deserve articles! As well as the other product <a href="../../../s/t/i/Stikfas.html" title="Stikfas">Stikfas</a> has external links to their company page and their distribution sales page and if they are listed and we are a similar product people should know the differences. I think it helps define differences in similar toys. Also instead of burning us at the stake maybe the knowlegable folks here can tell us how we can improve the article and make it more of a learning defining description. I happen to like Wikipedia and so do my fans and wanted to contribute not for advertising but for the sake of Wikipedia, this is why I tried to keep the advertising and external links out of it unlike others!-- <small>unsigned comment by Shocker Toys 20:28, 7 September 2005</small>

<li>I support <b>keep</b>&#160;:: this may have begun as slang, but it has now passed into a broader usage, which has run for at least ten if not twenty years.

<ul>
<li>Delete: I hate to be the dissenter, but the extra part is the extension of the slang term to a <i>highly, highly, highly specialized</i> group of speakers -- anime fans who happen to use this term because they are interested in the pictures. That's what's "extra" here. The first paragraph is unlikely, if not inaccurate. "Jailbait" is used for women above the age of consent? It is? I must not be keeping up, then. The term is offensive for being sexually suggestive, suggesting both that the object is promiscuous <i>and</i> that the subject is only interested in sex, but I don't think the bad part of it is due to the reversal of blame. (People who take jailbait are <i>not</i> "rapists" and "pedophiles": that's the whole point of the term!) Anyway, I don't see the great value here or the way that it escapes being dictdef. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:05, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No vote. But my perception is that articles like this are contrived exercises by people who wish to create an article and search for something, anything that hasn't been written yet—as opposed to writing articles for which there is plausibly a real audience. Individual articles of this kind are mostly harmless, but the dynamic of wanting to create new articles rather than edit existing them is not harmless at all, and becomes more and more harmful as Wikipedia's coverage of "legitimate" topics becomes more and more complete.

<li>The band has not released any albums or singles, been signed by anyone, or even had any gigs apart from performing in school. Furthermore, not only does the article explicitly state that they play in the garage of one of the member's parents, the article even has photographs of all of the band members in said garage. This article therefore fails to satisfy any of the <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> criteria.

<li>Who's the one saying we haven't played anywhere except school? That's all it says in the history thing. But we have played at many gigs. 3 battle of the bands in 2004, 4 in 2005. We played at push up in the western suburbs. also that image is not in a garage. the ones of us playing are in a garage, but the image of all of us is in an abanodened place where we thought it would be cool to take photos in, and make them look official possibly giving us some credibility. the problem with our site is that all the links are linked to live.com.au but the host moved to music.net.au, they have reset all passwords and thus anyone owning a site with them is unable to access. thus i cannot fix the links until the host resets everyones pw back to normal. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThoughtless_Band_8349.html" title="User:Thoughtless Band">Thoughtless Band</a> (<a href="../../../t/h/o/User_talk%7EThoughtless_Band_f9ca.html" title="User talk:Thoughtless Band">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Thoughtless_Band_2ae8.html" title="Special:Contributions/Thoughtless Band">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<dd>A ghost bus terminal is not notable if it is merely a ghost bus terminal as you think it is. Bus terminals do have a history and do have an impact on local demography and social life too.

<dd>Erm, then you obviously cannot tell the difference between a bus stop and a bus terminal in Singapore, because the two are never the same here. A bus stop numbers by the hundreds here, with each one merely a transition stop along roadsides and such and are sometimes as small as a single post from the ground. A bus terminal/interchange, however, is a large structure where at least one bus route terminates, along with the provision of adminstrative offices, berths, and large parking bays for buses. There are about 40 of these structures here. If you think we are calling for an article on a pole in the ground, then your concern is obviously unfounded.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:31, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I meant a bus station is a stop in a conventional sense, it is a stop on the route (even if it is the last one). In the sense you mean of course I can tell the two apart. I have spent more of my life than I like in bus terminals, and while I laud public transport I find myself unconvinced that a bus terminal deserves an article. This has nothing to do with Singapore, which has a good public trasnport system. It's a general concern. If this was about the bus terminal in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salisbury.html" title="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> I'd feel the same way. But seems like I'm, well, maybe not a minority, but it seems that plenty of people disagree with me. But I will vote against poles in the ground. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 01:46, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then let us take a look at just how big this "pole in the ground" is from space. I illustrate in the two images on the right <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurong_East_Bus_Interchange_2687.html" title="Jurong East Bus Interchange">Jurong East Bus Interchange</a>, one of the articles also on the VFD. The first one shows the extent of the interchange compared to the typical sizes of your normal bus stop, and with an MRT station beside it. You can see the individual buses parked there, so that should give you an idea of its relative scale. Compare with the sizes of nearby buildings as well. Now, look at the second image, which shows its relative size to the entirety of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_town.html" title="New town">New town</a> it directly serves (which btw is a relatively small town compared to others in Singapore.) You can still see the terminal's shape clearly even at this scale.</dd>

<dd>I think it is plain clear from this illustration, that you are not talking about a stick in the ground, not just simply a "large bus stop", but a HUGE one. To say it is not worthy of being on wikipedia is like saying an airport is merely a bigger airstrip, a city a bigger village, a mountain a bigger lump of sand, and so on. Clearly, size is a relative factor which cannot be used as a determining factor alone. What I would like to know, however, is why this seemingly widespread discrimination against bus transport, as thou it and its related articles have less notability than their more facied cousins in aviation and rail transport etc. Again, why do we keep articles on airports (and airstrips), railway stations (and the smallest metro stations), and such, but not bus terminals (and no, I am not refering to bus stops)? Is this again an issue of physical scale? Or do people think somehow that bus transport do not have as much an impact on human civilisation than airplanes, ships, and trains do?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 10:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The protests against expanding <a href="../../../h/o/u/Hougang.html" title="Hougang">Hougang</a> suburb and shifting its commercial centre have nothing to do with this bus station and are best dealt with at <i>Hougang</i>.

<ul>
<li>I would have thought this was quite clear in the article (which I have not completed espanding). As far as Singaporean transport planning goes, a bus interchange is build in every new town in its main commercial centre. When Hougang's town centre was moved, the planners wanted to shift the interchange as well, and it was the closure of this interchange which led to protests, <b>not</b> the expansion of Hougang or the movement of the town centre.

<dd>I don't see a breach of either of those policies here. Please be careful in making such comments as if they lack sufficient justification they may themselves appear to some to be a breach of the <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">no personal attacks</a> policy. <a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalJW_41ef.html" title="User:CalJW">CalJW</a> 18:24, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>CalJW, I'm afraid I don't understand you. What part of reminding someone about relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines could possibly be considered a personal attack? Please elaborate. As for my welcome message to Kappa, I thought it appropriate, since it is clear that Pilatus is not <i>randomly</i> deleting articles — whether you agree with his nominations or not, you surely must acknowledge that they are systematically focused on one topic at the moment — and describing such nominations as "random" is an argument addressed to the nominator, not to the content. Kappa correctly takes umbrage when people describe him as "always voting keep no matter what the subject" (and he doesn't — I've seen him vote delete quite a few times). I'm reminding him to extend the same courtesy to others with whom he disagrees. If you choose to interpret <i>that</i> as a personal attack, you are welcome to; I'm confident that your opinion will be in the extreme minority. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 20:51, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As far as I am concerned, its your words which beg to be understood. I too, do not find Kappa's comments contravening any wikipedia policy, and your message to him does appear overboard and inappriopriate to me. I suppose that makes me a "minority" as well?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 21:06, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>If you believe that politely reminding someone about relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines are a personal attack, then yes: I sincerely believe — and hope — that you are in the minority. If anyone else would like to discuss this, I suggest you drop by <a href="../../../n/a/n/User_talk%7ENandesuka_53de.html" title="User talk:Nandesuka">my talk page</a> and comment there, rather than clutter up this vote page. <a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENandesuka_0333.html" title="User:Nandesuka">Nandesuka</a> 21:53, 6 September 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is a major difference between a "polite reminder on wikipolicies" for a genuine case of policy violation and a "polite reminder on wikipolicies" where no clear-cut evidence of violation exists. Obviously, the issue is not whether a "polite reminder" is a personal attack or not. It is whether you somehow consider someone else's edit as a policy violation when they are not, which then amounts to a personal attack. You appear to completely miss the point there, delibrately or otherwise. Anyway, I do not think I need to go to your talkpage at this juncture, for I have nothing else worth saying, and I do not wish to continue on this discussion any further.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:38, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> I approve your work on deleting vanity entries on non-notables, Zoe, but in this case I think it is something different. Only today I saw a television documentary on these girls; I was reminded of an article I had previously read on them a few years back. I was after extra information, and a google came up with this article, which I found an extremely useful summary. It also contained some information I couldn't find easily elsewhere on the web. --211.29.199.111 09:47, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I went through several edits before being happy with it, but in the end I deleted the quotes from the twins as unencyclopaedic, though if someone can figure out how to include them in the context of an encyclopaedia they are quite cute. I deleted the section on their personal tastes for the same reason, then changed my mind, and put it back in. I still don't know whether it belongs in an encyclopaedia or not, but I've erred on the side of caution and left it there. I deleted the sentence about how "rumours of the twins appearing in a sitcom are unfounded", since it's unsubstantiated by definition and frankly sounds like patent nonsense. Still needs the name of the documentary they appeared in.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>REDIRECT</b>. Clearly, we do not have a consensus to delete. Since the new article is a copy-paste of this, I'm going to presume the debate applies to that article with its sensible title, and interpret the 'moves' as keeps (which is what they are, really).

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. Clearly all the keeps are the same person, so I'm only counting it once. They appear to have some genuine article to write here, but the consensus is against it remaining, owing largely to weak sources and poor verifiability. I would think, then, that this AfD need not necessarily preclude a <i>rewritten</i> article being created which is properly sourced. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 20:01, 15 September 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article is a hoax. There is no such thing as Aqeel Islam. The pages Aqeeli, Aqeelah, and the image Aleeqahlogo.jpg refering to it should also be deleted. <a href="../../../y/o/d/User%7EYodakii_63f2.html" title="User:Yodakii">Yodakii</a> 11:40:25, 2005-09-06 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Apparently an attempt to revive <a href="../../../m/u/27/Mu%27tazili.html" title="Mu'tazili">Mu'tazili</a>, which clearly does exist, but there are no Google hits for the name or the supposèd founder and the single external link is about Mu'tazili rather than Aqeel. So no proof that this revival exists neither in the article nor elsewhere. Plus the list of 'figures' of Aqeel is apparently mostly a list of figures of Mu'tazili, with the exception of the founder - they're certainly long dead and nothing to do with the modern 'revival'. Five of the six tenets of Aqeel are lifted directly from the five tenets of Mu'tazili. Reads rather like a vanity page, only instead of being an up-and-coming politician, singer or programmer we've got an up-and-coming Islamic revivalist scholar. <a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Last Malthusian</a> 13:22, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Ok first of all i myself am a aqeelah and convereted to the secret organization a while back. I dont know why just because it is not commercialized it would make it a hoax. Aqeelah Islam is almost exactly alike to Mu'tazili because it is a modern version of it. It kept alot of its tradition, almost exactly. Our headquarters are located in NY and in CA. 68.8.70.214 22:38, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The random believer above of me is right, Aqeeli Islam is definitly not a joke, it is not successful or even big, it is made up of only 7 <a href="../../../d/i/s/Disciples.html" title="Disciples">disciples</a> in each state making only 350 disciples in all. If the article is kept i will promise to add more information on the division and i will add as much facts as i can. I will look up the "6" tenets as soon as possible from the local Imam in the Aqeeli Islam conference house near my home. The article may be a little unbelieveble, but i will try to add as much facts as possible later on. And i just wanted to make one correction on the random believer above me, the New York HQ is being sold so i think they moved to someplace else, i forgot the name of the city right now. Ok well last words, keep believing no matter the criticsim of others. RuthCoronado 6:43, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The hoax itself isn't done very well. One give-away is the Arabic name for "Aqeel Islam" according to the article is "al-'iraqi" which translates as "The Iraqi".</li>
<li>Wikipedia is an encyclopia, and its not appropriate for every one with a private club or "secret organisation" to be listed here.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> since nothing shows notability. Ruth, your attempts to create this are fine but because of the way wikipedia operates you are going to need to find stronger sources.

I recommend that you keep a copy of this page as a sub-user page so it ges preserved and edit it... if you find good sources (from some notable media and not just a site created on Geocities) then feel free to recreate and I'll probably support it. However, as it stands now nothingshows that this is real or notable. I think it'd make for an interesting article if you could prove it... but until then I'll have to stick by my interpretation of wikipedia policy. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGrenavitar_5bda.html" title="User:Grenavitar">gren</a> <a href="../../../g/r/e/User_talk%7EGrenavitar_133f.html" title="User talk:Grenavitar">グレン</a> 19:05, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>This is really hard, i want it to stay on wikipedia but because of its secrecy and low success, not many write about the organization. We have been to many peace rallys and i have many pictures of the disciples in my computer, but there is no (or atleast one i can find) website containing info on it. Can't we just put it up for "clean up" and during that period i will desperatly try to find info of it on the internet or atleast get a reliable resource? I really need help on this one.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>keep</b>. This was never a deletion candidate and listing it on AfD, although an act made in good faith, was not the best use of Wikipedia resources. The article could have been merged with redirect to "the Hellen Lovejoy section of the simpsons" or whereever anyone wants it to merged. AfD has not decided on this; to editors have decided it's so trivial that it should be deleted, but neither they not the merge-proponents, nor those who propose a transwiki, constitute a consensus--rather the reverse!

While public transport is an important factor in the geography of cities (just look at how the trolley lines and their subsequent abandonment in favour of the car shaped Philadelphia), the recent slew of Singapore bus stations does nothing for the encyclopædic treatment of the subject.

<li>If buses stop there, it is a bus stop.

<li>Unfortunately, that is not the case here. A bus terminal or bus interchange is NEVER called a bus stop.

There is some implications in that the tapes from the security cameras in Civic (the CBD of <a href="../../../c/a/n/Canberra.html" title="Canberra">Canberra</a>) are missing and that there is some indication that there was a police chase underway when she was hit. The underaged driver of the vehicle is facing manslaughter charges as the result of her death. There will be a coronial inquest into her death.

<dd>The idea of "_____ case" is that the case (accident, aftermath, controversy) is notable, while the person involved was not. I would vote <b>delete</b> on a bio of the person, but the article might qualify as encyclopedic. I don't think it's unconventional at all. I don't have the inclination to do dig up a bunch of examples, but I've seen them in the form of "_____ case", "_____ controversy", "_______ matter".

Seems like someone merely getting persnickety. As is said elsewhere on this site, "Wikipedia is not paper." The advantage of Wikipedia is being able to go from the broad view of a subject to a specific detail, but there seem to be a few who think it should be more oriented toward exclusionary highlights of subjects. That's not necessary here and defeats the purpose of the project, which is to create an encyclopedia far more thorough than any print version could be.</li>

<p>This article is simply an attempt to find a venue for POV material that would be instantly removed from the main Clinton article. It is highly POV and cannot hope to be otherwise.

<li><b>Delete</b>. If these are notable they should be in the President in question's article. Jefferson's one is extremely point of view, and even admits that in the phrase <i>this would be considered rape by modern standards</i>. It is impossible to know the true facts of the case, and there is no evidence presented that Jefferson was accused of rape in his lifetime. My opinion is that if we allow this article we open the door to articles on everything United States President's have ever been accused of. The best place for this information is the article on the President in question. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">talk</a> 18:27, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd><del><b>Comment</b> I do not believe I am on a slippery slope here. I am merely making the point that we can not judge Jefferson by today's standards, as the article text does so. Do you also consider we should judge historic people's sexuality by today's standards? Should we judge all slavers as criminals if they broke no laws of their own time? Yes we can state their actions, butr we can not state they have been accused of rape if they have not so been. I am not limiting it as such to accusations in their life time, but rather that such accusations have been explicitly made. The two sources <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> quotes do not make the accusation he so dearly clains they support, and he even admits himself it is a possibility.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Jefferson's case was not raised during his lifetime and my personal view is that calling it rape is drawing a long bow. The case against Reagan was not raised until forty years later and originally appeared in a dubious source namely a Kitty Kelley book. The alleged case against George W. Bush was made by a woman with mental illness and appears not to have been taken seriously. I don't think we should be in the business of repeating hearsay claims unless they are widely-publicised and therefore notable. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 00:54, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree, the only article that has a remotely credible source is the Jefferson one which is from a very different time and arguably keeping people in slavery is as heinous as rape anyway.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Just tuning into this debate. According to <a href="../../../b/u/s/Bus_transport_in_Singapore_aa1c.html" title="Bus transport in Singapore">Bus_transport_in_Singapore</a>, there are like twenty bus terminals total. It seems kinda silly to have a huge fight over this. We should respect dorkiness within limits, even if it is a kind of dorkiness we do not share. Also, it was not the best idea to AfD every single one of these terminals. Just AfDing one for starters and seeing the outcome would have been the best decision, IMO. <a href="../../../s/d/e/User%7ESdedeo_53c4.html" title="User:Sdedeo">Sdedeo</a> 17:36, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Even as a Torontonian, I simply don't buy the argument that a street deserves a Wikipedia article just because it exists and is verifiable; as far as I'm concerned, to deserve an article a street has to have demonstrable historic or cultural significance far beyond its mere existence as a strip of pavement.

<li>Stopping the Spadina Expressway was a watershed in the development of Toronto: stopping that also blocked other proposed expressways (the Crosstown and the Scarborough), and the fact that a subway was built along that route therefore helped shape Toronto city planning, with the idea that Toronto would be a transit city, rather than an expressway city (not that we are there, but it was an important signal). The dispute bewteen the City of Toronto and the Province of Ontario over this was also an important event in shaping the city/province relationship. Yeah, it was historically important. <a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGround_Zero_934e.html" title="User:Ground Zero">Ground Zero</a> | <a href="../../../g/r/o/User_talk%7EGround_Zero_01ae.html" title="User talk:Ground Zero">t</a> 17:39, 9 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This was clearly a test page, and there's a good article about Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (<a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Redirect</b>. It was listed in copyright problems so I rewrote it (not knowing about (<a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a>) in order to clear the violation. As long as we have a decent article about her this can go away or turned into a redirect. Either is fine with me. By the way, the temp page comes on every copyright violation template so that editors can work on replacement pages. <a href="../../../r/x/_/User%7ERx_StrangeLove_2537.html" title="User:Rx StrangeLove">Rx StrangeLove</a> 20:42, 6 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>This is clearly <i>not</i> a test page, but a rewrite page, scheduled to eventually replace Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil to resolve the copyright problem there. Separately nominating a rewrite page, that is in use as part of an ongoing <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:copyright problems</a> deletion process, for deletion via AFD like this simply causes a mess. And nominating an article for deletion on the grounds that it is a duplicate article by an alternative title, when dealing with such <a href="../../../d/u/p/Wikipedia%7EDuplicate_articles_da79.html" title="Wikipedia:Duplicate articles">duplicate articles</a> does not involve deletion at all, is simply wrong. Editors who think that Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil should redirect to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a> after the copyright problem has been eliminated, because it is a duplicate article, should simply <i>edit the rewrite article to be a redirect</i>, not nominate it at AFD. <b>Keep</b>, and let the <a href="../../../c/o/p/Wikipedia%7ECopyright_problems_b9ab.html" title="Wikipedia:Copyright problems">Wikipedia:copyright problems</a> process proceed as intended, without spanners in its works. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 23:37:29, 2005-09-06 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>merge</b>: Okay, sorry because there was a misunderstanding, please don't bite the newcomers (like me!). Anyway, this may be a little confusing, since there's already the article named <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a>. Maybe merging Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil to <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a> would be a good idea.

<li>At the end of the copyright problems process, Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil will be deleted and <a href="../../../d/o/n/Dona_Isabel_%28I%29_of_Brazil_Temp_0dd5.html" title="Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil/Temp">Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil/Temp</a> will be renamed in its stead. If you want, once the copyright problems process has completed, Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil to be merged with <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a>, then what you should do is simply <a href="../../../m/e/r/Wikipedia%7EMerge_ec58.html" title="Wikipedia:Merge">merge</a> <a href="../../../d/o/n/Dona_Isabel_%28I%29_of_Brazil_Temp_0dd5.html" title="Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil/Temp">Dona Isabel (I) of Brazil/Temp</a> with <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isabel%2C_Princess_Imperial_of_Brazil_29b0.html" title="Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil">Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil</a> now, and leave the copyright problems process to run its course. The only thing preventing the merge bring done right away is this AFD nomination.

<li>Perhaps, if you spent <b>any</b> time whatsoever researching the history of debates here for schools, you would realize that these issues have been hashed, re-hashed, re-re-hashed, re-gurgitated, re-envigorated, served up for breakfast and then re-defecated for months upon months upon months. Most of us have repeated again and again and again what our reasons are to the point of absolute and frustrated ad-nauseum. Many deletionists feel exactly the same way and they don't bother to give their reasons on each and every vote. There *is* an ongoing battle on Wikipedia for the future of school articles and attempts to convince or achieve a <b>true</b> concensus are long exhausted and dead. Those of us that believe that schools are inherently notable have no choice but to continue to marshall our forces to defeat AfD nominations on schools, and to utilize the 5-day waiting period to clean up and expand school articles to appeal to moderate and fence-sitting voters (which I might add, has the added benefit of actually improving and expanding the encyclopedic content of Wikipedia - imagine that!). If anything is obvious from the last 2-3 years of this ongoing struggle, it is that <b>no permanent concensus will ever be reached</b> irrespective of how many editors post their reasons for voting. Want my current reasons for voting to <b>keep</b> this school? How about, "because the deletionists want to remove it" or "because the school has four walls and a roof" or "because you asked". My point is that the argument itself no longer matters - the only tool we have to work through this is the AfD process - discussion and debate has failed. Most of us are not interested in a complete re-ignition of the debate all-around despite last-ditch efforts by deletionists to try to get a "merge" position to remove school articles, or the latest effort to attack the AfD process itself. To re-state, <b>there isn't and will not be a concensus</b> on the status of school articles.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 12:23, 8 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Good for Soltak. I am not him. Perhaps my initial repsonse was too caustic. However, the facts still remain. There have been attempts to build concensus on this issue for <b>years</b>, and all of these efforts have failed. Many, many well-intentioned people have tried unsuccessfully to build a concensus on this matter - but the reality of the debate (despite the fact that some "moderates" would like to claim that there is some strange, subjective, floating middle-ground, is all about whether or not schools are inherently notable. Those who try to re-state the debate in some other terms, are either trying to sidestep this issue, or are simply in denial. Those who do not believe that a school is inherently notable are engaged in a constant effort to nominate school stub articles which are not yet expanded and developed as quickly as possible in order to hopefully get the articles deleted before those of us that want school articles included can marshall the necessary resources to re-write the articles to demonstrate to enough of those who hold a middle position on schools, or voters who do not regularily follow these debates to vote to keep the articles. This is evidenced by the fact that many (not all) VfD/AfD nominations for schools are made by the same group of editors. In a way, there is a bizarre form of "concensus" being reached through this entire process, that is, as <a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a> has pointed out elsewhere, the number of new school articles is growing at an exponential rate which is <b>rapidly</b> outstripping the ability of the AfD process to delete them. The inevitability of this reality (coupled with the constant re-writing of school articles once the AfD process is started) is defacto, creating a Wikipedia-wide "concensus" that school articles will survive and flourish. The sad and unfortunate truth, is those editors that do not believe that a school is worthy of an article simply by virtue of it's being a school, cannot be reconciled with those of us that believe that schools are inherently notable, knowledge-worthy and important enough to create and maintain articles at Wikipedia. It truly is an impasse.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 08:39, 9 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. This sort of thing makes it really hard for those of us who try to decide, in good faith, the merits of each article without reflexively voting to keep or delete.

There is not even one independent reference for the article. I guess I almost don't know what to say. It's honestly difficult to understand how this qualifies to be in an encyclopedia, but clearly quite a few people think it does. Well, I'm sure it will be kept anyway, so it hardly matters, no?

<li>Hi Nicodemus75. I can really understand that point of view (although I do disagree with it). I hope you will understand, for your part, the view of those who feel that WP is best when its articles are well-referenced, excellently composed pieces— and if they aren't (for example, if they are stubs), that it is patently clear they have the potential to be such pieces. The problem for many "moderates", and perhaps this is not realized often enough, is that school stubs are not like a stub on, say, Erwin Schrodinger. Schrodinger was an immensely important physicist, and there are a huge number of works that have been written about him and his work. If I were to come across a stub on Schrodinger, I'd be willing to keep it even if it was abysmally written and referenced at that time because I know its potential— in fact, I'd probably simply expand it right then; it would be so easy to do because of the availability of good sources. But here we're being asked to keep a stub on something that most people in the world, and a significant number of WPns, cannot see the notability of; far more importantly, it is doubtful that there are any independent, reputable sources focused on the school that may be used to write an encyclopedia article. In such situations, it's fair to ask that the usual standards be applied, and that the article be judged for what is on the page. With very best wishes—<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncephalon_6951.html" title="User:Encephalon"><font color="#000077">encephalon</font></a><a href="../../../e/n/c/User_talk%7EEncephalon_2b5c.html" title="User talk:Encephalon"><font color="#606060">έγκέφαλος</font></a>&#160; 22:43:59, 2005-09-10 (UTC)

<li>The whole begging of the question here is really a red herring by everyone that uses it in the first place. Non-notability simply <b>is not</b> a legitimate criteria for deleting schools (only for deleting persons). It is merely unfortunate that deletionists use notability as a criteria for other deletions improperly. For those of us who hold that schools are inherently notable, it doesn't really matter a fig if some other editors "feel" that an article on a school has to be "notable" or "well-referenced, excellently composed". All school articles will eventually be, since all schools are notable. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 14:05, 12 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Proof by assertion comes a few steps below proof by authority and way below any valid form of argumentation. Non-notability has been held to be a valid criteria to delete any article, including by long established precedent bands. Does non-notability really not apply grocery stores or churches? Other editors don't "feel"; they reason from analogy. If Lichenstein's (hypothetical) greatest rock band that has been drawing crowds of hundreds of Lichensteinians for decades doesn't qualify, why do all of the probably dozen schools in Lichenstein qualify?--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 18:51, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>With all due respect, that is just more horse manure. "Non-notability has been held to be a valid criteria" - by <b>whom</b>, exactly? It is <b>not</b> a valid criteria for deletion of schools, per Wikipedia policy - PERIOD. I couldn't give a fig if it is "held to be a valid criteria" by you, which is exactly what your <b>proof of assertion</b> is, and nothing more. The reason this debate exists in the first place, is because those of us that believe schools should have articles <b>do not agree or have any concensus with people who believe as you do</b>. As to bands in Lichenstein, who cares? We are talking about <b>schools</b> here - to somehow bring in some totally false analogy about musical bands is yet another way of trying to confuse the issue at hand. Apart from your <b>assertion</b> that because notability may apply to musical bands as a valid criteria an thusly should apply to schools, there is no relationship between schools and musical bands as you are trying to construct, except in your own opinion. In any case, <b>all schools are inherently notable</b>, and in summary, non-notability is <b>not</b> a criteria for deletion of schools articles, as per Wikipedia policy. Any "[holding] notability as a valid criteria" for deletion of schools, is merely an invention of yourself, and other deletionists. --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 20:34, 12 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Link to the policy, if it's per Wikipedia policy. What things, besides schools, are inherantly notable? You're stating things to be fact, but you provide no evidence. You aren't even trying to reason here.--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 02:12, 13 September 2005 (UTC)

<li><a href="../../../d/e/l/WP%7EDEL_635e.html" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a> Lack of Notability is a not a criteria for deletion, nor is being obscure, nor is being "unimportant". As far as the position that <b>all schools are inherently notable</b> maybe you haven't been following along at all - this is obviously not Policy, this is what I (and others) believe. Lots of things are inherently notable, elected officials, towns and cities, battleships, countries, monarchs, sports teams, great literary works, etc. etc. etc. etc. Do I really need to go on? --<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENicodemus75_090d.html" title="User:Nicodemus75">Nicodemus75</a> 04:13, 13 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Great literary works are notable because they are notable; that's what great means. Elected officials aren't inherantly notable; they're less common and notable than the average college professor. Sports teams aren't inherantly notable; note that WoW clans get deleted all the time, and I'm sure kids T-Ball teams would get deleted just as fast. Professional teams are notable because people know about them country-wide.</li>
<li>As for the rest of them, countries are inherantly notable, because there's circa 200 of them in the world, and a soverign government has a lot of power. There's probably less than 200 monarchs in the world, and they make news across the world. The lists of battleships of the major powers are each listed on one page; I'm guessing at most 1000 ships. The only one of the above that's not likely to be completely covered by a standard encyclopedia, that is at all comparable to schools, is towns and cities. Most towns have at least one elementary school; Alva, at 4000 people, has 3 and bigger towns have hundreds or thousands. By sheer numbers alone, towns and cities are more notable than elementary schools. Morever, I have never seen the elementary school someone went to listed in a encyclopedia-sized biography, but the town they grew up in is frequently mentioned. --<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 04:48, 13 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can look up Aba in an atlas; I can find good sources on Aba without problem. Where's your justification for including the schools of Aba, which being pushed as inherantly notable? If you can even begin to wonder why <a href="../../../a/b/a/Aba%2C_Okayama_a3fa.html" title="Aba, Okayama">Aba, Okayama</a> qualifies to be in an encyclopedia, how can you justify including multiple specialized subunits of the Aba government?--<a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProsfilaes_86ec.html" title="User:Prosfilaes">Prosfilaes</a> 22:57, 10 September 2005 (UTC)

The changes are "notable" within the Mozilla community, both for the resulting <b>practicality in use</b> of the browser; and <b>structurally:</b> (1)because the "skins" or themes for it must be modified from K-Meleon "skins" (and are not easily interchanged), (2)because the menus (and the macros upon which they are based) must also be modified (K-Meleon's menus are insufficient for K-Ninja, K-Ninja's versions may be excessive for K-Meleon), and (3)because the "Prefs" script must also be modified to make the visual changes. ----Vincent(original author of K-Ninja stub)</p>

<li>No, my reason for this AfD is that I believe that we should not have articles on every umpire/judge/referee that has officiated an international match, be it in cricket, football (soccer) or ice hockey. If John Payne did not make himself noted in any other way than being an umpire in one game, then I believe he is not notable enough to have his own article.

<ul>
<li>Because <a href="../../../t/e/s/Test_cricket.html" title="Test cricket">test cricket</a> is not a "regular international match". Regular international matches are first class cricket, or maybe One Day Internationals. Test cricket is the highest form of the sport.

<li><b>Keep</b> Umpiring any first-class cricket match makes someone notable enough for a WP article (for which the threshold is admittedly small).

To illustrate the point: <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> suggests that a top-100 record in any significant market is notable enough. Cricket is a major sport in much of the English-speaking world, and a Test match umpire (even one from the 19th century) is therefore more relevant to the English Wikipedia than a singer who reached number 97 in Italy in 1974 with a song no-one outside that country has ever heard of. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> (<a href="../../../l/o/g/User_talk%7ELoganberry_54ba.html" title="User talk:Loganberry">Talk</a>) 00:05, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>General comment</b> I see I am going to "lose" this AfD, but I would like to make a few comments none the less:<br />
1) There have been statements that there aren't that many test umpires and that all of them thus should be included. Is that really true? Just the <a href="../../../a/u/s/Australian_Test_Cricket_Umpires_309e.html" title="Australian Test Cricket Umpires">Australian Test Cricket Umpires</a> lists 85 umpires, and I doubt that the (comming?) lists for England, India, and so on would have less than that, right? 85 umpires just from Australia, and every single one of them is notable enough to be on Wikipedia? As a comparison, Sweden has had a total of eight football referees that has referred over 20 international matches (as opposed to Australia's 11 umpires that have officiated 20 or more test matches), and I don't even believe that more than two or three, maybe four of them deserve their own articles. Definitely not all of them. Do you? If no, what is the difference?<br />
2) <a href="../../../g/u/e/User%7EGuettarda_9de6.html" title="User:Guettarda">Guettarda</a> wants to compare a test cricket match to a World Cup match (I guess he means football). Very far from the truth... The <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_test_umpires.html" title="List of test umpires">List of test umpires</a> has a lot of umpires with more than 25 test matches. I'd like to see someone find a few football refs that has that many World Cup matches. The probably most know referee today, <a href="../../../p/i/e/Pierluigi_Collina_7be7.html" title="Pierluigi Collina">Pierluigi Collina</a>, has something around 40 international matches in total, whereof 11 are World Cup or EURO internationals. Is the test cricket match &lt;-&gt; World Cup match still a fair comparison?<br />
3) <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELoganberry_d015.html" title="User:Loganberry">Loganberry</a> compares to a "notability" test of an artist. Well, I don't agree with that WikiProject's test. I am fairly certain that an artist from Italy that held the 97th position in 1974 would be deleted at once. At least I'd vote delete. Thus the comparison does not make any sense to me.<br />
It is also interresting to note that the only voter that is <b>not</b> part of the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Cricket_255e.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Cricket">WikiProject Cricket</a> voted merge.

<li>Being member of the WikiProject on cricket of course makes you more interrested in keeping cricket-related articles than the regular Wikipedia user? In the same way as I would be more interrested in keeping football-related articles, a Frenchman in keeping France-related articles or a biologist in keeping biology-related articles. I am only noting that this vote could have had a completely different outcome if a different group of people would have voted. Also remember that "Yelling 'Assume Good Faith' at people does not excuse you from explaining your actions". There has been very few arguments for keeping the article, some of them being completely wrong (se the test match &lt;-&gt; World Cup match comparison for example), others being simply "Test match umpires are notable", without explaining <b>why</b> they all are notable. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 17:22, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that you choose to speculate about the motives of other voters says more about you than it does about them. Secondly, the corrolary of your expectation that we should 'explain our actions' is that yelling 'not notable!' isn't of itself a sufficient criterion for deletion: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_is_not_paper" class="extiw" title="m:Wiki_is_not_paper">Wikipedia is not paper</a> and you've yet to provide a convincing argument (to my mind) for why this article should be deleted. Finally, I think the comparison between Test matches and World Cup Football matches is a fair one -- Test matches happen more often than the World Cup, but they are at a comparable level within the two sports: the highest pinnacle of international competition. --<a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Ngb</a> <sup><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">?!?</a></sup> 17:39, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yep, all those areas of Wikipedia should have people arguing to keep stuff. Why should we delete something that is factually true and can be demonstrated to be true? What is gained by deleting? What is gained by not deleting? If anything is verifiable reasonably, it can be kept. <a href="../../../s/m/o/User%7ESmoddy_2381.html" title="User:Smoddy">[[smoddy]]</a> 17:51, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't feel like arguing with the whole WikiProject Cricket, but I'll answer these last comments. One good reason? Out of everything, let's for example have a look at the (sometimes subjective) <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_test_1cda.html" title="Wikipedia:Google test">Google test</a> of the article. <i>"John Payne" cricket umpire</i> gave 118 hits, of which the majority does not deal with "our" John Payne. Any sportsman worthy of inclusion should have at least a couple of hundred hits, IMHO, even if this particular umpire lived a long time ago. My opinion is also that if test matches were so uncommon that the top umpires of the world would have only 10 or 20 games, one game would be notable. However, as there are many umpires with over 10 officiated games, officiating one game would not be enough. Comparing World Cup with test matches is really out of control. Come on, I've found no football referee with even close to 20 World Cup games, and as said earlier, umpires with over 20 test matches are pretty common. I don't even know if I consider football referees with 1 World Cup game as notable enough to be included. I also feel this discussion is leading nowhere. You seem to be inclusionists, I am not. Nothing to do about it. -- <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohan_Elisson_10de.html" title="User:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Elisson</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johan_Elisson_6c3e.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johan Elisson">•</a> <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohan_Elisson_e39b.html" title="User talk:Johan Elisson"><font face="fixedsys">Talk</font></a> 18:14, 8 September 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><i>You seem to be inclusionists, I am not.</i> I think you've put your finger on it. as it happens, we are actually debating within the WikiProject right now whether and how we should set out inclusion criteria along the lines of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, and it's fair to say that the balance of opinion so far has been heavily inclusionist.

<li>Assuming good faith applies to Wikipedia editors, <i>not</i> to sources. Indeed, to sources such as this one, where the subject is providing the information about itself, <i>exactly the opposite applies</i>. <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Autobiographies</a>, be they people writing about themselves or bands writing about themselves, are not to be accepted unquestioningly. Please read our <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiability</a> policy. We most definitely are <i>not</i> in the business of taking people's own unsupported words for things. Good journalism involves having <i>multiple independent <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a></i>, and good encyclopaedism does too. <a href="../../../g/r/c/User%7EGrcampbell_a0e7.html" title="User:Grcampbell">Grcampbell</a> is quite right. In light of how easy it is to do <a href="../../../p/h/o/Photo_manipulation.html" title="Photo manipulation">photo manipulation</a>, the Guinness book itself should be consulted directly, or a source similarly independent of the band found. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:44:29, 2005-09-07 (UTC)

<li>I have read the policy, of course. In this case, the page web cites a reliable source—which could be trivially incorporated into the article—and even provides a scan from the book. It's a verifiable reference. All I'm saying is, we should assume that a verifiable reference is not a hoax until we have good reason to believe otherwise. I believe this is implied by <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - My intent was not to create an advertisement. As you can see, the external link site has no commercial links - purely informational. While there may be differing opinions about the efficacy of described body cleansing techniques, there is definitely a growing alternative healing culture that believes in cleansing and detoxifying the body, per the techniques that I briefly describe. I suggest that these be fleshed out and linked to other Wikipedia sections, as appropriate. I am not sure exactly how Wikipedia works, but I would be happy to help in lending some time and knowledge in implementing editorial action you decide to take. --pronatural 8 September 2005</li>

<li>It sounds so much better when you say it InShaneee. I also meant to say that there is nothing wrong with self promotion, provided it is in the right context. Wikipedia is not the place to be promoting an original concept for a comic book character, especially one that is an obvious copyright infringement. Paul should go out and get a free webspace (like at MySpace or Geocities), set up a concept storyline/artwork, and start spamming links on comic book websites and message boards. That would get the word out about his work, at least until DC finds out and either slaps him with a cease and desist... or hires him.</li>

<li>In my mind, a ballad is sorta a slow loveish song (or something like that), and some slow songs use electric guitars, drum machines, etc. hence the power but despite that, nomenclature is inevitably opinionized by fans hence this nomination. --<a href="../../../s/u/p/User%7ESuperDude115_8134.html" title="User:SuperDude115">SuperDude</a> 22:13, 7 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>&#160;; the scope of the list is much, much broader than outlined by the <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_ballad.html" title="Power ballad">power ballad</a> article (which is in line with the <i><a href="../../../i/_/l/I_Love_the_80s_ddf5.html" title="I Love the 80s">I Love the 80s</a></i> definition, for instance). I'd say cleanup, but if it's gotten this far it may be unsalvageable/unmaintainable. - <a href="../../../c/h/o/User%7EChoster_075d.html" title="User:Choster">choster</a> 22:36, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Speedy Keep</b>-We should keep this list right now <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a>

<li>Also, until further notice, the content will be copied to a sub-page of my user page. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a></li>
<li>Please note that voting "speedy keep" implies that you feel the deletion nomination was made in bad faith. I'm pretty certain this is not the case. It's fine to copy this article to user space, but if you copy it <i>back</i> to article space after AfD finds a consensus to delete, it is speedy-deletable on sight. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79"><font color="green">android</font></a><a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79"><font color="purple">79</font></a> 01:56, September 10, 2005 (UTC)

<li>OK, if the result is "delete", please post in my talk page what you want added to my userspace page. <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolKatt_number_99999_b352.html" title="User:CoolKatt number 99999">CoolKatt number 99999</a></li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. A pointless list, with no clear definition or upper limit of entries. (Note, incidentally, that a deleted article shouldn't be saved by being kept in User space. If you want to maintain a page of this kind, there are plenty of hosting services. See <a href="../../../u/s/e/Wikipedia%7EUser_page_1e96.html" title="Wikipedia:User page">Wikipedia:User page</a>.) --<a href="../../../m/e/l/User%7EMel_Etitis_83ce.html" title="User:Mel Etitis">Mel Etitis</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/l/User_talk%7EMel_Etitis_fdc2.html" title="User talk:Mel Etitis"><font color="green">Μελ Ετητης</font>)</a> 12:02, 10 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Cleanup</b> if possible, otherwise delete. Some songs IMO don't come under the category of "power ballad". 50 Cent is a rapper/hip-hop artist - since when did they write ballads? The list was good when it was uncluttered (see page history). <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndrewh_d62c.html" title="User:Andrewh">Andrew</a> 21:20, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Cleanup</b>. This page doesn't seem to fall under any of the categories in Wikipedia's "Problems that May Require Deletion" table. (See <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>.) The list in itself is a useful one, (I discovered it because I was searching for just such a list). The problem is that incorrect information has been added to the list, 50 Cent's song being the most blatant. Delete misleading entries and keep the list. 15:16, 13 September 2005 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.63.232.8 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.63.232.8_42e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.63.232.8">contribs</a>) 16:16, 13 September 2005.</small>
