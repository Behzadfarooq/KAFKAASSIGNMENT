<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_successful_automobiles_%28second_nomination%29_b606.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of successful automobiles (second nomination)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">List of successful automobiles</span></h3>
<p>The shameful course the previous discussion took notwithstanding, I would like to renominate this article as I believe it is inherently and incurably not belonging to an encyclopedia and Wikipedia in particular. Please see the reasoning below:</p>
<ol>
<li>As was noted before, "successful" cannot be objectively defined, therefore this article in its present form will always be an expression of the authors' POV. Even citing sources, which some seem to believe fixes the problem, will not help, as any source claiming an automobile to be successful is POV (just like any piece of text proclaiming some woman a "great actress" etc.)</li>
<li>This could theoretically be fixed by renaming the article, but given its present form (see header - <i>"A list of automobile models that have achieved a cult-like following."</i>) it would also bring about the need for actually completely rewriting it, and I mean starting from scratch - therefore, it would be equivalent to deleting and starting a new article. By deleting, we ensure this will happen.</li>
<li>Please note that this article is called a <b>list</b>. There are specific rules governing lists in WP, described by <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a>. The current form of the article does not conform with the adopted standard for such lists. An example of a featured list quite similar to the proposed "List of automobiles / automobile nameplates produced for over 20 years" can be found <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_largest_suspension_bridges.html" title="List of largest suspension bridges">here</a>. See how different it is from the present state of the article.</li>
<li>As a sidenote, I would like to remark that creating "<i><a href="../../../g/u/i/Guinness_Book_of_Records_2093.html" title="Guinness Book of Records">Guinness Book of Records</a></i>"-style lists does not really help the encyclopedic character of Wikipedia, but rather is often a thinly veiled attempt to promote a given group of items, especially if the criterium chosen makes them seem superior than some other of a given kind. As such, they are prone to generate edit wars and conflicts, as seen before in this very example.</li>
<li>The notion that an automobile model or a nameplate has been selling exceptionally well or running exceptionally long belongs first and foremost in the article, there is little need to repeat that in another article. Also, a well-defined category can be much easier to maintain than a list.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bottom line is - even if this list can be rectified by turning it into a proper WP list, it would require actually starting it over. Therefore I suggest users defending this list for the reason that it can be rectified (and I actually see no other reason for defending it from deletion) could start the new, rectified list now and let the deletion process do the other part.

<li><b>Delete</b> This article has no coherent thesis. It contains only abstruse and arbitrary POV selections of undefinedly "successful" automobiles, consisting of one individual's pet makes and models—straight POV, as it seems. It might be marginally appropriate as a "top ten" blog même, but it is most unencyclopædic. An article specifically and narrowly listing longest-running vehicle models or longest-running vehicle model names might be debatably less inappropriate. Either is arguably just as trivial and unworthy of Wikispace as the present article. NOTE TO KARMANN: Your unnecessarily strident language ("I want it gone", etc.) is not helping your case or winning you allies.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> The fact that it doesn't conform to the standard is irrelevant; what matters is whether the title &amp; topic combination in any form would belong. And I reckon it doesn't. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Literate_Engineer_1749.html" title="User:The Literate Engineer">The Literate Engineer</a> 09:58, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete.</b> There's no article on Successful automobiles. It's always questionable when there's a "list of X" but no article on X itself. If "successful automobiles" were a legitimate encyclopedic topic, there would be an article on it, and this list should have begun as a section within that article. In fact, I don't think you could write an article on successful automobiles that could be anything but a personal essay and original research. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 15:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> The definition of 'success' is too vague. What should readers of this article learn from it? If this was a 'List of marques that sold more than 1,000,000 cars' or 'Car designs that made more than $10M profit' - then <i>maybe</i> (but still probably not). But can a car that made a loss for it's manufacturer be a 'success'? Yes - the <a href="../../../m/i/n/Mini.html" title="Mini">Mini</a> for example. Can a car who's production run was cut short be a 'success'? Arguably - the DeLorian - it's a cultural icon - it's fantastically collectible. If we don't have a definition for 'success', the criteria for inclusion or exclusion must be inherently POV - and this ends up just being a place for people to argue endlessly about the cars they love (or hate). <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveBaker_6942.html" title="User:SteveBaker">SteveBaker</a> 16:35, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> There is no definition of success. WP should cover vague concepts but this is just too vague. The netire article is too OR, POV with a completely subjective subject matter. An article on the world's most sold vehicles might be appropriate but success is an undefined term and this article could hurt the credibility of WP. <b><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel"><font face="Arial" color="#1F860E">Signature</font></a><font color="#20038A"><sup><a href="../../../g/e/r/User%7EGerdbrendel_cba6.html" title="User:Gerdbrendel">brendel</a></sup></font></b> 16:38, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. There are two points of redirecting. So people searching for one thing can be automatically forwarded to the relevant article, and so that existing wikilinks don't break. I'd be pretty surprised if someone were to search for exactly this term (incest being far more likely, IMO), and the article is essentially an orphan (only links outside the AfD realm are a vandalism warning and some user page with already a lot of nonexistant article links). I don't see any reason to keep it at all. -- <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyh</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">ea</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">d</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 15:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

He did not want this article to be deleted and he did not know what he was doing so i took the time to fix his problem for him so his page would not get deleted.And yes his Album is supposed to be coming out late December early January so look for the album to be in stores real soon.I feel this kid is tryin to let people know where he is coming from. Yeah he made a couple mistakes , but they are real easy to fix. Instead of bringing the boy down try to help make it right. But overall the article is well put together and is good. For a first time article. I did my facts on the charts and everything is all cool now so it shouldn't be a problem about this article anymore i done the job for him.

<li><b>Delete</b> Not notable.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I disagree that local news anchors are "not notable as a rule," since they appear every day in the living rooms of hundreds of thousands of people.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I'm wary of accepting the notion that all TV presenters merit a wikipedia article: I think that there is a risk of confusing notability with visibility.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> To refute, it is not fictional weather, the ion storm is a documented astronomical anomaly and just because I know no one believes me, I brought proof from the NOAA website &lt;<a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:5gIHqXJCIxIJ:sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html+%22ion+storm%22+%22anomaly%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" class="external free" title="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:5gIHqXJCIxIJ:sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html+%22ion+storm%22+%22anomaly%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:5gIHqXJCIxIJ:sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html+%22ion+storm%22+%22anomaly%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=1</a>&gt; Click there, scroll down a bit, and you'll find documented proof of observed Ion Storms. Second, when is too much detail ever bad? Seems like a rather conceptual rather than analytical attack to make, espacially considering there is no real argument to be made. Third, sourcing is not always the root of an intellectual community. I can tell you a hundred thousand times that the moon is made of green cheeze, or that we never went to the moon, or that the Earth is flat, and I can even find sources to back the claim, but one way or another it adds neither fact nor fiction to the general postulation. So why the big stink about sources? Moreover, addressing the final point, how is this better suited to a game guide? It provides no actual information on how to play the game, just that the occurence appears in the game. Since there exists an ion storm which causes similar effects to happen to high level technology in the real world I find it easy to draw the parallel between the ion storm's game application as a figuritive adaptation of modern day astrological occurrences, a fitting conclusion I dare say given that the plot of the game is to describe a society in which the earth is slowly being rotted from both outside and in. Behold the destructive powers of mother nature.<a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChiRoGuardian06_70e1.html" title="User:ChiRoGuardian06">ChiRoGuardian06</a> 08:37, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> and <b>Comment</b> To refute your refutation...neither the existence nor notability of the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_wind.html" title="Solar wind">Solar_wind</a> (the redirect for the astronomical phenomenon) is being disputed in this AFD. Nor is the existence of the ion storm in the game - rather, I think it's really just the notability of the C&amp;C ion storm. There's not really a huge problem with including too much detail, except when that detail turns into a new article. Since every article on Wikipedia is expected to eventually (through good editing) be good enough to become a featured article on the main page, there comes a point where a full article on a minor topic is not warranted, and should instead be shrunk down enough to be merged into another article. I'd rather not address the "big stink about sources" and will simply direct you to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. That's one of Wikipedia's three big policies - don't take it lightly. As far as the "game guide argument"...I actually agree with you. Probably the reason that argument was tacked on was because of <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_gc_78b1.html" title="User:Proto/gc">User:Proto/gc</a>...any attempt to label something a "game guide" has been a golden argument lately. And while I hate that argument because it seems to be a blatant attempt at making a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a>, I still vote delete, for the previous arguments laid out.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is the exact opposite of original research. Every statement is subject to factual verification. WP:OR states "An edit counts as original research if it proposes ideas or arguments. That is, if it does any of the following: It introduces a theory or method of solution; It introduces original ideas; It defines new terms; It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms; It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source; It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source." (I reformatted the list but did not change the words.) Which of these proscriptions does the article violate? None. There is no original research in this article. User:Mallanox is precisely right that this is a "super-disambiguation" page. It's an index to other articles in Wikipedia. It's a useful way for a reader who knows the name of an automobile to get to the right article. It's a useful part of Wikipedia. Also, "listcruft" is not a criterion for deletion, but even if it were, it would not be applicable because this article is list gold.

<li><b>SUPER DUPER DELETE</b> Alyosha Karamazov is the main character in what many if not most consider the most important russian novel of all time. The notability guide specifically says that this character does not warrant an entry. Nobody can possibly argue that the sequel to a PC video game is more notable than The Brothers Karamazov. Clearly does not satisfy the notability guide, should be rolled into the half life 2 article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ltbarcly (<a href="../../../l/t/b/User_talk%7ELtbarcly_b6c5.html" title="User talk:Ltbarcly">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ltbarcly_842a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ltbarcly">contribs</a>).</small>

<li>No, that's exactly the opposite of what the notability guideline says. First, it says that Karamazov is covered in the main article because it is short enough to do so.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The Article is not specifically about a campaign, although it is true that it mentions Charlie's current occupation as working for a campaign. The main purpose of the article is to publicize one of the FIRST American Jewish Students to visit Germany Post-WWII. This is a big deal. YUHSB (Charlie's school)sent a diplomatic mission, entirely sponsored by the German Government, the FIRST OF ITS KIND by a High School with its goal being to rebuild connections between Jews and Germans. Not meaning to sound Melodramatic, but Charlie and the rest of the delegation "made history" so to speak, by acting as Ambassadors of Jewish Youth to a nation struggling to deal with its past in the holocaust. This was never done before - it is therefore noteworthy. It does not deserve to be deleted. This is not an article of self-praise, it is an article dealing with an individual who functioned as a leader on a barrier-breaking mission. --YonkersRepublican 08:52, 3 August 2006 (UTC)Matt Stern</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> In regard to Brownhaired's comment- I talked to a friend with some familarity with Bulgarian music. They agreed that having the official page of a band be in myspace meant about as much as it would for an English speaking band. No opinion on whether this is true for small countries in general. Should probably be discussed at <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but in this case it is a clear decision. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 15:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> So apparently the situation is more complicated than I initially realized. After talking to another person who familiar with Bulgarian music, it is weakly plausible that a notable band would work off of a myspace page so it isn't by itself a death strike to notability. However, the use of a myspace page together with other details (the lack of google hits for the band itself, certain musical aspects, the individual's knowledge of Bulgarian music in general) confirm that the band would not meet "any reasonable notability criteria." This friend is going to talk to another person tommorow who has better knowledge of the current Bulgarian scene and will report back however he strongly suspects this won't change matters. He also confirmed that in general our conditions for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> have serious cultural assumptions and would likely rule out genuinely notable bands. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 01:46, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The irony here abounds.
<p>Looking at Talk:Argumentum ad Google I find the link to the French Wikipedia article <a href="../../../../fr/a/r/g/Argumentum_ad_Google_dbd2.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Argumentum_ad_Google">fr:Argumentum ad Google</a>.

(<a href="http://www2.lifl.fr/~morge/aes2/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www2.lifl.fr/~morge/aes2/index.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> also discusses the argument, but cites Wikipedia as its source.) Those all call it <i>Argumentum ad Googlum</i>, which explains why <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a>'s Google Web search for <i>Argumentum ad Google</i> didn't find anything. However, the discussion on the French Wikipedia talk page focuses more on the validity of the argument rather than upon citing sources, the sources are sparse, and the sources certainly don't support the contents of either the French or English Wikipedia articles. It does appear that this is mostly original research that began on the French Wikipedia and that has metastasized onto the English and Serbian ones over the years. This does not belong in the main article namespace.</p>

<dd><b>Keep</b>: NS (Y HALO THAR, IT'S BEEN A WHILE) is absolutely right -- it is an official group, it's been mentioned in the cards and in the V-Jump publication, from whence the information about their relationship with the Seven Deadly Sins comes. Groups like this aren't common, and they're generally fairly notable, the Three Great Angels, the Four Holy Beasts, and the Royal Knights being some other fine examples. The information on the this page is pretty much all correct, although their collective goal, if one is extant, is unknown, not necessarily conquest and destruction, as its been edited to say (The Demon in the show seemed perfectly content to reside in the Dark World, and Lucemon's purpose was at least ostenibly to create a paradise). If this is going to be merged, then it should be merged onto a Digimon Groups page and listed with the Three Great Angels, Four Holy Beasts, Royal Knights, Four Great Dragons, etc, but it's been my observation that the Demon Lords are generally the subject of much interest and discussion in the Digimon fandom and thus notable at least in that context (and individuals from the group have been important characters in the show and manga), and thus, deserve their own article. At any rate, it most certainly <i>not</i> be merged with the Digimon article. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShining_Celebi_c782.html" title="User:Shining Celebi">Shining Celebi</a> 17:50, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The same user who originally put this article up for {PROD} has been putting up a lot of fetish articles for {PROD} these past few days, this is just the first one I noticed. So those who want Wikipedia cleared of minor fetishes will apparently see their wish granted. As for this article, I know that lots of people like freckles, so I assumed that freckle fetishism was also a fairly large fetish. However, those who have run the Ghits have found relatively few hits. Perhaps there just aren't that many people whose appreciation of freckles rises to the level of a fetish. Cultural factors could be at work: a guy with a blonde fetish is simply a guy who likes blondes; a guy who likes sex dolls has a sex doll fetish (inflatable fetishism is another article on {PROD}; and perhaps guys who like freckles don't think of themselves as having a fetish. Or it may be too closely related to redhead fetishism to have a distinct identity. At any rate, its apparently small webprint comes as a surprise to me. --<a href="../../../g/r/o/User%7EGroggy_Dice_1730.html" title="User:Groggy Dice">Groggy Dice</a> 12:50, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

Making up stuff about the topic ourselves, or relying on some blogs or personal websites, does not produce an encylopedia article. --<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzyplugh_8c21.html" title="User:Xyzzyplugh">Xyzzyplugh</a> 20:20, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm not sure that the two are mutually exclusive. A lot of rugby league players in Australasia were simultaneously schoolboys and club representatives (not so sure about internationals), and I'd imagine the same can be true in union. That said, it makes it look pretty hoaxy, and probably goes some way towards explaining why his purported professional team doesn't know him. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Fair enough, and I won't pretend I know more than I do about the rugby leagues in New Zealand. But as an element combined with the author's other hoax articles up for AfD, nothing relevant appearing in professional team literature, unsubstantiated claims of "being the finest first five New Zealand has produced since Grant Fox," etc., I'll agree that it all adds up to an almost-certain hoax. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 23:53, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Looks like a hoax article, and I believe the nominator that no relevant ghits were found. I certainly found none for the supposed forthcoming album once I eliminated Wikipedia and Answers.com from the search. Starts with "This article relates to Charles Mason, the philosopher. For Charles Mason, the astronomer, see <a href="../../../c/h/a/Charles_Mason_aa49.html" title="Charles Mason">Charles Mason</a>." but has an intro that says "Charles Mason (born 14 September 1950) is a pro-Western political revolutionary and musician." (note - no mention of being a philosopher in intro). Later it says "Believed to be the illegitimate son of General Carlos Suárez Mason, a hardline general at the heart of Argentina's pre-Falklands dictatorship, he eschewed his grandfather's political beliefs." (There is no antecedent for the pronoun phrase "his grandfather".) <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 03:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, with a little hesitancy. The absence of sources or verifiaility are sufficient grounds to delete, but if half what is claimed here is rue, it's a an account of a quite remarkable person. But without sources, have to assume it's a hoax. --<a href="../../../b/r/o/User%7EBrownHairedGirl_3187.html" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">BrownHairedGirl</a> 08:54, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as hoax. The lack of verifiable sources is a clue, but for me the giveaway is: the article states he was born in 1950 and was the son of General Carlos Suárez Mason. However, if you check the history in the original version, he is the grandson <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Mason_%28philosopher%29&amp;oldid=34251872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_Mason_%28philosopher%29&amp;oldid=34251872" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>. Carlos Suárez Mason died in 2005 aged 81, so would have been 26 at the time of the supposed birth: both he <i>and</i> his son would have had to be 12 at the time of the respective conceptions. Fairly unlikely, so it was updated to be more believable. Aside from that, without sources it is <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> so should be deleted anyway. <a href="../../../y/o/m/User%7EYomangani_bb58.html" title="User:Yomangani">Yomangani</a> 12:04, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Those unsourced claims of notability serve to keep it from Speedy Deletion, but they shouldn't serve to keep it from being deleted here. I can find no evidence that they have produced anything of note, and the external link is in Chinese (and even if it wasn't, it's not a source independent of the subject, so it couldn't be used anyway).

<li><b>Keep</b> I was one of the people who originally suggested the article be deleted, because at the time I assumed the article creator had taken the term from my own, joking, off-the-cuff use in the anarchism template talk pages. However, after digging around a bit, it looks like similar terms have been used in print at least twice. I suspect that it’s such a temptingly paradoxical concept that people keep coining it over and over again. I listed the five usages I’ve found in my comment below. Three of them appear to be independent coinages. I should also note, however, that it does <i>not</i> appear to bear any relationship with <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarchism.html" title="Anarchism">anarchism</a> proper. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 13:29, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Some people have used the term in the past, yes; but the problem is, almost all of them seem to think that they invented it, and none of them seem to have been using it to say quite the same thing. We could have an article here, I guess, but its content would amount to "a handful of people have used the term <b>anarcho-monarchism</b>, either in a humorous fashion or as a neologism to describe the views of a single person. The majority of people using the term seem to have no knowledge that it has ever been used by anyone else, and none have provided a concrete definition. Below is a quick listing of all the usages of 'anarcho-monarchism' we could turn up on Google." Ok, so we wouldn't actually <i>say</i> the last sentence, but you get the idea. I don't see how we could make an encyclopedic article out of that. --<a href="../../../a/q/u/User%7EAquillion_cc2b.html" title="User:Aquillion">Aquillion</a> 01:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, it shouldn't be listed <i>as a political philosophy</i>. That's certain. It's a (deliberately) paradoxical or nonsensical notion.

<li><b>Reply</b> I guess the difference between "grue and bleen" and anarcho-monarchism is that the former is rather inconsequential while the latter could confuse or misinform people who are trying to find information on actual schools of anarchism.

<li><b>Reply</b> No, it makes no sense to link it to Anarchism. I'd say anarcho-capitalism also should not be linked to Anarchism proper. I'm discovering that there are a whole slew of alterna-anarchisms or pseudo-anarchisms that don't come out of traditional anarchism...for example <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anarcho-nationalism.html" title="Anarcho-nationalism">anarcho-nationalism</a> and anarcho-mysticism. These are ideas alien to Anarchism. They have a place on Wikipedia in their own right, but it would be misleading to imply association with Anarchism proper. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 20:02, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Anarchism calls for the destruction of coercive, involuntary rule and authority... just as Anarchists agree that people can come together to create voluntary communes, come together to forge third-party arbitration, so can they come together to form voluntary groups of people led by a patriach, who serves nominally as a leader and advisor. To delete this article would simply be giving in to pressure and supporting censorship... just as some anarchists view anarcho-capitalism as not anarchism.. it must be agreed that such theories must remain to be accessed... by the simply use of "anarcho-" or "anarcha-" we are agreeing that there are varying forms of the political theory known as "anarchism".

<dd>emotions my ass. "spirit of German Kings"? "voluntary patriarch"? "supporting censorship"? "we are agreeing"? I'm glad someone has decided to fill the shoes of the banned TheIndividualist and Shannon in being utterly unversed in basic anarchist principles and general rationality for that matter.

<dd><b>This discussion should be taken elsewhere.</b> However...see my comments above. A "theory" doesn't qualify as part of the Anarchist movement just because it uses "anarch-" in its name. Anarchism is a <i>movement</i>, and it has a history. Anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-monarchism, anarcho-nationalism, anarcho-mysticism, panarchism, and perhaps anarcho-primitivism do not share any history within Anarchism proper, and from a traditional Anarchist point of view, they are mis-uses of the term anarchism. All of these alterna-anarchisms, pseudo-anarchisms, para-anarchisms, are separate theories and/or philosophies and/or movements. They have every right to exist and they have every right to have Wikipedia articles. But putting them within Anarchism proper is just facutally incorrect. --<a href="../../../a/e/l/User%7EAelffin_4ceb.html" title="User:Aelffin">Aelffin</a> 20:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

How is that unreliable? Ungovernable, how can you tell that "almost all" of the google hits are unrelated? Did you look through all 19,100 results? Most of the hits on the first few pages are from huge online stores selling t-shirts. A search for <i>"funny punk" -shirts -shirt</i> gives about 11,700 hits. Looking through the first four pages, about two to four sites on every page use the phrase in the obvious context of a musical classification.

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, yes, I only looked through the first few pages. If it really is a notable genre chances are I would have found some mention of it within those first few pages. Can you link to some of those other sources? I agree that some people may use this term, but I don't think it's really notable. Anyone can come up with a new genre classification, but I don't think this is really an accepted subgenre by many people. <font color="black"><b>The</b></font> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_fe89.html" title="User:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="green"><b>Ungovernable</b></font></a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7EThe_Ungovernable_Force_6a81.html" title="User talk:The Ungovernable Force"><font color="black"><b>Force</b></font></a> 20:15, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Ungovernable.. yo, so this is what im thinking, "funny punk" yeah that is just... how can i say it.. FUNNY!!! what the punk man, "hey, dudes, yeah lets go to that funny punk show down the street!" , "OK".. naw that never happened... but what i think this is actually describing it what we might want to call "satirical punk" i dont want to create neologism, but there does seem to be a trend and some precedence to suggest that this exists. As you can see from the edits i made today, there are definitely a number of bands and individual songs which would apply. I use the term "satrical punk" because that is what The <a href="../../../d/e/a/Dead_Milkmen_a8d9.html" title="Dead Milkmen">Dead Milkmen</a> are called in the first sentence of their article... i dont know who wrote that but i would agree with that description, but also note that the term their is linked to the two separate works, "satrical" and "punk" individually. If we were to rename "funny punk" to "satrical punk," then we could also change The Dead Milkmen qualifer accordingly. The problem then becomes finding precedence for the existence of "satirical punk" which might be possible from the Donny the Punk article? <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 22:08, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>There's a fine distinction between descritptive terms and descriptive genre terms. Just because an adjective or something appears right before the word punk (and for that matter, rock, metal, pop, folk, etc.) does not mean it is being used in a genre context by whoever wrote the piece.<a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWesleyDodds_17ee.html" title="User:WesleyDodds">WesleyDodds</a> 22:27, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Again, I did not say this was an actual genre, but more than anything, I think there is actually some evidence that this is a "tendency" or within punk. This evidenced by the existence of a number of bands which could fit the bill and the fact that The Dead Milkmen and Butthole Surfers and others are significantly different makes an arguement for it. Yet wikipedia is not the place to create new qualifiers. We'll just have to wait for some to appear from external sources. <a href="../../../x/s/x/User%7EXsxex_c215.html" title="User:Xsxex">Xsxex</a> 02:45, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Someday, when people aren't so het up under the collar about these things, we'll have to settle down and work out what really makes a school article worth keeping. (Or maybe we'll just create wikischools and move them all there.) Until that day, I'm willing to compromise on keeping any school with a meaningful assertion of notability in the article, and deleting all others. So for now, keep, but if no better assertion of notability arises, this will be a goner once we actually have standards instead of being an indiscriminate collection of information. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 02:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment. I think the debate used to be between those who considered schools inherently notable (eg. as of significance to all in the community they served for several generations) and those who said 'nope, let each one have a specific claim to notability over and above that'. Generally speaking we seem to have moved on to accepting the latter viewpoint. And that is a good thing IMHO. The issue with this school is thus whether or not it meets that extra level of notability over and above being a school and thus of import to its community. Does it? Well, it would certainly appear to be a <b>good</b> school. (The awards tell us as much perhaps). But is it notable simply by virtue of it's being a good place to send your kids? I still think not. It may require other schools to strive to reach it's standard - and that is no bad thing - but to my mind it still requires something more in order to be considered notable. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarcus22_c85c.html" title="User:Marcus22">Marcus22</a> 12:43, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Indeed. That's life. The elementary school I went to as a child is not on Wikipedia, nor should it be. Schools (and people in the district) should not be seeking validation by having articles on Wikipedia. If it's a decent school, be content with that.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the awards listed in the school's article are not valid. One (the <a href="../../../t/i/t/Title_I_21a1.html" title="Title I">Title I</a> "award") is not an award at all but a designation by the Federal government that a school has a significant number of students from low-income families. It is not based on test performance, teacher quality, or anything else. The other one (the <a href="../../../c/a/l/California_Distinguished_School_d7bc.html" title="California Distinguished School">California Distinguished School</a> award) is expired. It is only valid for 4 years, and was not renewed for this school in 2004.<a href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingyear.asp?year=2004" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/sr/cs/ap/distingyear.asp?year=2004" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> Without these awards, what's notable about this school? <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 19:25, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<p>The result was <b>no consensus on all.</b> Some points: (1) it seems to be in agreement that the topic is notable. (2) No one has argued that the topic is INHERENTLY advertising, just that it is written in an advertising style. Similarly, there is not a consensus that there isn't enough verifiable information to have an article on this topic. Those issues can and should be addressed by editing. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:12, 13 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for the reply&#160;:) Well this site also lists only the MSRP and since as far as I can tell the only places that you can get any Bose headphones is directly from Bose or from Apple they are always the same never changing so that isnt a problem. As I mentioned earlier listing the facts on an item shouldnt be a problem from my point of view so listing the waranty is just another fact. If it really means that much to everyone I guess it could do without it... but really I don't see any real reason not to include it. If you want we could always cite the release information that talks about them. One of the reason that they are mentioned is also because if you read the Criticisms the price is one of the main points of contentsion. Your point about HD DVD is correct it does not go into detail about the product lines but if you read <a href="../../../x/b/o/Xbox_360.html" title="Xbox 360">Xbox 360</a> or the <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_8051.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a> the price is all over the place. If you want to see other articles that mention price I have many other links throught this article.

<li><b>Comment</b> The comment was not a Red Herring but was used to point out that <i>any</i> product article can be called an ad. The PS3 is a great example since it talks about the specs and the prices like the Bose Headphones do, but in addition to this it also talks about the products in particular using as much info as possable. The Bose Headphone article does cite other sources than the manufacture itself. But if you want us to list all facts from Non Bose sources thats easy enough to do!

<li>We're not discussing <a href="../../../p/l/a/PlayStation_3_8051.html" title="PlayStation 3">PlayStation 3</a>. Wikipedia is inconsistent. Measuring articles against other articles is the recipe for a "race to the bottom." In AfD we measure individual articles against policy, not against other articles. Good grief, this article is one long NPOV violation from beginning to end. Not even the photographs are neutral; instead of documenting the product, they present professional models pretending to experience intense enjoyment. The "proprietary" technology, which is probably patented and therefore probably has had many details disclosed, is not discussed in any significant way. An unlikely story about Bose not being able to enjoy music on a jet flight is presented... with no references.

<li><b>Comment</b> There are only two types of photos there ones that are just of the products and the advertising ones that we are at least known to not be copyvio and do the same as the famous iPods shadow dances they make the page look much nicer and I think quite a bit more professional. Even if you want me to get poeple to take photos with their own ones on I doubt that they would look as nice. Your point about the propiatary tech is interusting where do you think we could find more detail? I thought that those things would be something akin to traid secrets and not disclosed with much detail. The origins of Dr Bose starting research on noise cancelling headphones is on the bose site itself. I guess that would need to be cited. As in most articles citing more sources is needed but the need to cite more sources doesnt mean that you remove the article itself but improve it. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 22:17, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Indeed "the Bose site itself" should be cited if that's where the story came from. But that's not a terrific source, since corporations frequently concoct human-interest stories about the origin of products, and they're not necessarily the gospel truth. You know the sort of thing: the story on the Martinson Coffee can about how young Joe Martinson, displeased with the taste of even the finest coffees, worked day and night until he found the perfect blend.

<li><b>Reason for Modification:</b> These articles explain the reasons why Dr. Bose had to create Acoustic Noise-Cancellation technology. <i>No Bose Product</i> would ever be released unless the company had an explicit reason to do so. In fact, there's enough history and reason for the article(s) to be kept. I should also point out that merging <i><b>any</b></i> separate Bose pages to the main Bose (audio) page would only equate to a Wikipedia article being 200KB in length!

<li><b>Follow-Up:</b> Each Bose Headphone pair has the company's reasons why it's released, and the headphone technologies should <i>at least</i> be retained, because it is a piece of artwork that can't be ignored. Bose started out with acoustic noise cancellation and refined it since then so that the technology would have fewer sound artifacts PLUS less RF interference, thanks to EM-shielding technology. Furthermore, the Tri-Port technology is worthy of some explanation because it's also complex technology that enabled Bose to overtime overcome the bulkiness of the headphones, though other companies have came up with other routines to shrink the headphones. Bose also work closely with the US Military for professional communications, so I would have to say stay at Keep All. — <i><b>Vesther</b></i> (<a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">U</a> * <a href="../../../v/e/s/User_talk%7EVesther_ca6d.html" title="User talk:Vesther">T/R</a> * <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Vesther_28bc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Vesther">CTD</a>) 19:08, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>There's nothing very special about the TriPorts. I doubt they're worth mentioning. They're not anyone's standard of comparison. They're decent non-audiophile mid-priced headphones, that a reasonable person might like more or less than other good $120 headphones. They don't have any secret miracle ingredient. They're not proverbial. One of my paperback-novel references mentions "sound-killing Bose headphones," the others just mention "Bose headphones." Nobody talks about anyone "plugging their TriPorts into an iPod." Bose's sound-cancelling headphones could honestly be called innovative technology. (So could their actively-equalized speakers when they were introduced).

<li><b>Delete them all</b>. I believe these were created in good faith, but Wikipedia is not a place for detailed product line information.

Broadly sourced, NPOV articles on these products are possible.) To the extent a product becomes a cultural phenomenon, reported in the mainstream press (like <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">iPod</a>), an article focusing on this phenomenon makes sense, but we still would need to be careful about weeding out mass dumps of brochure verbiage, which is carefully designed to be thoroughly one-sided (which you can hardly blame a company's sales organization for doing, eh?). Even apparent reviews from trade magazines must be regarded with extreme skepticism, as the authors and magazines frequently have unsavory financial connections to the companies and products they report on.

<li><b>Comment</b> So would you think that we should delete those pages also? I would think that if anyone even tried to delete the Xbox page because it listed the "Detailed specifications" and prices that you'd get a torrent of angry users yelling at you at your talk page. The reason that HD DVD was mentioned is if you check out the HD DVD page within the 1st paragraph it states the prices of the 1st HD DVD players. I don't think that anyone could EVER delete an iPod product from wikipedia and that is just one article that goes on and on about that one product. This is a list of products that have had a lot of work done on them to just state the facts, state the Criticisms and make it look nice. All while making it as NPOV as possable! I don't see any reason why it would not talk about the Bose QuietComforts since they were the 1st company to make and market noise cancelling headphones to the public! If it wasnt for them doing this it might have taken another 10 years before anyone came out with Noise Cancelling headphones. Wikipedia is supposed to be a repository for all the worlds information and while it should not become an advertisement it should not be limited and not offer valid information about the evolution of technology that has name recognition and has factual &amp; verifiable information inside of it! I cannot see any reason why this article that has much more information and credibility (even tries to cite sources) then other product stubs is being singled out! Please help us edit the article or reccomend changes instead of removing it completely!-- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 08:31, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, that is exactly what we are doing. And editors who are <a href="../../../c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECiting_sources_8ba4.html" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources">citing sources</a> to demonstrate that the notability criteria are satisfied are contributing constructively to the discussion, whereas giving no rationale except to question the discussion and not discussing the article at hand is not a constructive contribution to the discussion at all. The argument that "notable company implies notable products" is highly flawed, as can easily be seen with a little thought about notable companies whose catalogues include thousands of minor products that have no independently sourced material published about them at all, or indeed have anything published about them except an entry in a product catalogue.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am now going to apply a personal test. I do not know how it is going to turn out. I am going to perform a search in Google Books to see whether there are references in <i>novels</i> to Bose headphones, much as there are references in Ian Fleming's books to Guerlain perfume, etc. If there are, I'll acknowledge that the <b>topic</b> is encyclopedic, although I believe there's no useful encyclopedic content in the present article and that it would need to be blanked and rewritten from scratch.

<dd>The things I think should be in the article would be hard to research and would involve quite a lot of hard work, and it's not my field of interest. A good article would answer questions like this: When did Bose first introduced noise-cancelling aviation headphones? Noise-cancelling consumer headphones? Were either of these the first on the market? If not, whose were and what factors account for Bose's success in outstripping them? The basic idea of active noise cancellation dates back to the 1930s, so why is it difficult to do? Obviously there much more to it than "send[ing] out the noise it receives phase-shifted 180 degrees." What were Bose's key technical innovations, as documented in patents and, probably, in the trade press, and, Bose being an academic, quite possibly in scientific journal articles? What's the difference between the technology in the aviation headphones and the consumer version? What can be said about Bose's business and marketing strategies? Does Bose sell exclusively by mail and in its own retail stores? Why? To what people is Bose trying to sell these headphones? How many have been sold? How do sales of Bose noise-cancelling headphones compare with those of other headphones in the same price range?</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Actually I checked out the photo your mentioning to see why it was there and it the guy was a <i>smug man in suit</i> and while I agee that he is in a sute he dosent look smug but actually the photo is of a man in an airplain looking in the direction of the windows and that is all. I think that it is actually in a quite apropriate location also since it is in the area that talks about the history of Bose and noise cancelling headphones and where it talks about the technology behind them. The photo does in no way look like an ad and I think is much better then taking a photo of myself on an airplain.</dd>
<dd>Some of your questions are already answered inside of the article. Including
<ul>
<li>When did Bose first introduced noise-cancelling aviation headphones? <i>The Bose Series I Aviation Headset is introduced in 1989 as the first commercially available Active Noise Cancellation headset specially designed for <a href="../../../a/v/i/Aviator.html" title="Aviator">pilots</a>, also used by the <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_81b3.html" title="United States Air Force">United States Air Force</a>.</i></li>
<li>Noise-cancelling consumer headphones? <i>The Bose QuietComfort Headphones (also now known as the QC1) was the very first headphones released by the company (1989). The Bose QuietComfort Headphones retailed at $299.</i></li>
<li>Were either of these the first on the market? Not answered directly in the article but as stated above they were both released in the same year and from what I would gather on the same day.</li>
<li>What's the difference between the technology in the aviation headphones and the consumer version? Those are answered inside of the article where it shows the specs. But there is no section that is specifically dedicated to this question.</li>
<li>To what people is Bose trying to sell these headphones? <i>Bose markets the QuietComfort family of headphones mainly for frequent travelers.</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Some of your other questions are actually pretty good!
<ul>
<li>The basic idea of active noise cancellation dates back to the 1930s, so why is it difficult to do? I dont know. Thats a good question. I would have to guess it would have to do with technology.</li>
<li>Obviously there much more to it than "send[ing] out the noise it receives phase-shifted 180 degrees." What were Bose's key technical innovations, as documented in patents and, probably, in the trade press, and, Bose being an academic, quite possibly in scientific journal articles? Since bose is a privately owned company I don't know what information is out there. The suggestions on pattents might be ones best bet.</li>
<li>Does Bose sell exclusively by mail and in its own retail stores? Not answered in the article but for a long time you could only get the QuietComforts from Bose directly via the web, phone, mail order or a Bose Store. But recently it looks like you can get them also from Apple stores. The Aviations and the Triports can be purchased from Bose directly or from bose dealers.</li>
<li>What can be said about Bose's business and marketing strategies? Dont really know.</li>
<li>How many have been sold? Since bose is a privatly owned comany I highly doubt that they give out that information. But I'd like to know that one also.</li>
<li>How do sales of Bose noise-cancelling headphones compare with those of other headphones in the same price range? see previous answer.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>I do like your suggestion of having one that shows the innerds of the headphones. I think there is one on the Bose Site but I dont know if its a jpeg or a Quicktime or a Shockwave image. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 23:41, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep all</b> Articles about consumer products cannot be considered unencyclopaedic just because of their subject matter. This article should definitely stay. Such articles are an excellent resource for the consumer because they are purely factual rather than being biased marketing literature or an opinion-based review. It is clear a lot of work has gone into this article and the article in its present state seems very factual and an asset to Wikipedia. However, I do believe that the some of the pricing and warranty information should be removed, as despite being factual, it makes the article look a little like a product catalogue. The units of measurement should also be primarily metric, as that is the system used in most of the world. The section about good customer relations should possibly be removed or edited, as it does not reflect <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. <a href="../../../n/f/h/User%7ENFH_d937.html" title="User:NFH">NFH</a> 18:40, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Don't worry UKPhoenix, I'm not offended. I am absolutely interested in helping make the Bose article better - please don't misinterpret my less-than-regular involvement as disinterest, I just don't spend as much time on Wikipedia as more regular contributors. I think the lack of independent sources about Bose products is a serious problems in writing encyclopedic articles related to the company. The main Bose page is hard enough, these articles just slip completely into unencyclopedic. A revision would only work if they were stripped down to bare stubs. As for this discussion, I appreciate your comments, but you should try to keep them concise and in one place. This is meant to be a poll of opinions, and it's hard to read if the strong opinions of one or two users are make up most of the page. No hard feelings, I genuinely feel that a detailed article written entirely from promotional sources is pretty fundamentally corrupt. --<a href="../../../z/a/m/User%7EZambaccian_0d80.html" title="User:Zambaccian">Zambaccian</a> 01:18, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Glad that your not upset with me replying to you&#160;:) Would you say then that you'd be ok with making this page more NPOV and listing facts from other sources? Since I'm sure that most can be found all over. The only reason we took the spec info from Bose directly was beacuse it made the most sense. The Bose headphones are always used to compare to other headphones out there on the market so wouldn't it be better to edit it rather than deleting it outright? -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 01:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Like I said, sourcing articles about Bose is hard, because there's little information out there that isn't basically parroting Bose promotions. Serious stereo publications don't have any information about Bose products. Partly it's because Bose does not release any technical information beyond the kind of faux-scientific babble that permeates this article. Partly it's because of Bose's litigiousness when it comes to reviews that go against its sales pitch. Like others have said, if you take out the problematic sections and advertisement mirroring you're left with next to nothing, so I'm weary of claims that this can be improved. --<a href="../../../z/a/m/User%7EZambaccian_0d80.html" title="User:Zambaccian">Zambaccian</a> 02:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Well I have found other sources out there and they are placed all over this page. With those sources and others I'm sure that there would be more than enough to support what is said on the page without coming from Bose directly. What is it specifically that you don't like? Are the specifications a problem? Is it the wording on the particular products? Don't forget that I have done a lot to this page and I might be mistaking the forrest for the trees. Please let us know where the problem is since this page has never been based souly on bose sources, it was just the easiest to cite. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 03:12, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The sources themselves are only one problem. The inclusion of detailed specifications and descriptions for many individual models of Bose products is extremely dubious, with or without a reliable source. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a collection of indiscriminate information</a>. Without something to indicate that these individual models are all so notable as to warrant inclusion in an encyclopedia, it doesn't particularly matter if the source of the specifications is Bose, Best Buy, or the Vulcan Science Academy. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 03:19, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> With the possable exception of the triports <i>Each</i> headphone listed are (and were) the standard that others in their category are judged. Bose created the noise cancelling headphone market with the QuietComforts and the Aviation Headsets and I believe that something that is held in such high regard should be kept. I'm glad that you agree that other sources can be used. But I would also say that such notable products should be included and warrant their inclusion inside of Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 03:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep all</b> Wow there is a lot going on here. I dont see any reason why well known products should not be kept. If everyone out there compares their product to the Bose version then I believe that shows that they have a worth inclusion in Wikipedia. I didn't think they really read like ads although some articles had only a little information on it the headphones seamed well written and informative.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 64.240.163.221 (<a href="../../../6/4/2E/User_talk%7E64.240.163.221.html" title="User talk:64.240.163.221">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_64.240.163.221_cd9f.html" title="Special:Contributions/64.240.163.221">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> It's simply not the case that Bose headphones are some kind of "standard" that other manufacturers compare themselves to. What's true that they're the most well-known active noise-cancellation headphones, but that's only because no other hi-fi headphone maker makes uses this technology, opting instead for sealed or in-ear technology, which tends to provide higher isolation (see <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/traveling/" class="external text" title="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/traveling/" rel="nofollow">here</a>). The point is, there's not really anything special about these models.
<ul>
<li>I would think otherwise, all the reviews I read mention the Bose when talking about other headphones. I did a quick search on google for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bose+quietcomfort+review&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=bose+quietcomfort+review&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">bose quietcomfort review</a> and there are 290,000 articles using those words. From what I have read all one needs is to provide independent research on a product for it to be included. Does this not provide such proof especially since the 1st page shows much critical thinking over the headphones. <a href="http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/ISEO-rgbtcspd/reviews/20030715/bose_review.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.crutchfieldadvisor.com/ISEO-rgbtcspd/reviews/20030715/bose_review.html" rel="nofollow">[28]</a> <a href="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/7dec2001.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/7dec2001.htm" rel="nofollow">[29]</a> <a href="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/2003/0912.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thetravelinsider.info/2003/0912.htm" rel="nofollow">[30]</a> <a href="http://playlistmag.com/reviews/2005/02/quietcomfort/index.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://playlistmag.com/reviews/2005/02/quietcomfort/index.php" rel="nofollow">[31]</a> <a href="http://www.thetechzone.com/?m=show&amp;id=46" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.thetechzone.com/?m=show&amp;id=46" rel="nofollow">[32]</a> <a href="http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review242_main1208.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reviews.digitaltrends.com/review242_main1208.html" rel="nofollow">[33]</a> <a href="http://www.adriansrojakpot.com/Reviews/Bose_QuietComfort/Bose_QuietComfort_02.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.adriansrojakpot.com/Reviews/Bose_QuietComfort/Bose_QuietComfort_02.htm" rel="nofollow">[34]</a> I think there's enough independent reviews on the net to justify such an article.--64.240.163.221 00:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The other articles such as the <a href="../../../p/r/e/Previous_Bose_Headphones_1c2b.html" title="Previous Bose Headphones">Previous Bose Headphones</a> should stay because for one thing (I hate that I don't have a link) the 1st prototype aviation headsets were used on <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scaled_Composites_Voyager_f843.html" title="Scaled Composites Voyager">Voyager</a> for its no stop flight around the world in 1986. I saw an interview with them where they were talking about the prototype aviation headphones. The QuietComforts are what EVERY other noise cancelling headphones are compared too. And the SoundDock has multiple places out there that have independent reviews on it listing the specs and information about them. The computer speakers I'm not sure upon but I'm sure that places like C|Net have reviews &amp; the lifestyle systems I havent had much time to look up but right now as it stands its basically a stubb with the prices and minor details. I'm sure that if we remove the proces even if its the MSRP from when they 1st came out they should be fine if more detail could be included from other sources.

<li><b>Delete all</b>. Just to make it clear, I repeat my vote in the main section for this section as well. None of these additional articles are anything but product specs spoon-fed from Bose, without any decent critical analysis. The few reviews mentioned are not indepedent sources of any data in the articles, and even if the review material eventually found its way into the articles, there's still the twin problems that (A) their factual data still comes from the manufacturer, and (B) audio tests are inherently subjective and are never conducted in these reviews in a truly double-blind manner that would prevent audiophiles from coming to the conclusions they expect, positive <i>or</i> negative. The criticism section that turns up in a couple of these articles, as I mention below in my WP:CORP analysis, is unsourced. Bose is certainly popular, but that doesn't justify the explosion of brochure dumps with none of the content of real encyclopedia articles, and <i>no independent sourcing</i>. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 21:27, 6 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> How many independent reviews must be given for a product to be accepted? It looks like this is becomming an argument about if bose products are good for audiophiles not if they pass the standard test to be included in wikipedia which I think has been amply shown by now. When one askes about the specs of other products like the PS3 or the Wii right now we only have the manufactures word of what it has and that is not removed because it is relevent to the article in whole. When we read about the iPod we dont say that it shoulnt be included because there are better sounding DAP's or because they dont do this or that. We include them because they are the best selling DAP's on the market and the one that all other DAPs are compared against. Such is the same when one talks about the Bose headphones or the sounddock. Why is there even a debate any longer? Hasn't the argument been proven? -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 00:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete all</b> articles and redirects. The notability of <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_%28audio%29.html" title="Bose (audio)">the Bose corporation</a> is not disputed; the notability of <i>the entirety of one company's past and present products</i> is a gross and inappropriate exaggeration of the notability of the company. The "Bose products suite" of articles is an enormous collection of fancruft, written overwhelmingly in a style indistinguishable from advertisement, presented from a non-neutral point of view, going so far as to list prices in multiple markets and present links to one retailer where the products may be purchased. Additionally, the "Bose products suite" of articles is significantly lacking in non-trivial published references. Some in this discussion have pointed out other articles in Wikipedia which display the same fundamental problems; those should clearly be nominated and deleted as well, but this is a discussion of one particular group of related articles. It does not seem to me, however, that the editors who created and expanded these articles are being paid by the Bose corporation for the contributions. That, indeed, may be the greatest tragedy of all. It's very good advertising copy. <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 11:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Thanks for agknowledging that I'm not getting money for this&#160;:) Believe me this is not the entire line of Bose products out there and stuff that is quite well known like the Wave Radio's and the 901's dont have their own article. In no way has the main article <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Headphone_Family_52bc.html" title="Bose Headphone Family">Bose Headphone Family</a> or <a href="../../../p/r/e/Previous_Bose_Headphones_1c2b.html" title="Previous Bose Headphones">Previous Bose Headphones</a> tried to be ads. I know your personal belief on Bose is low but please don't let your opinios cloud your judgment on what are otherwise good articles that might need some work on them! Can you not see that they have had a lot of work done bringing them from Stubs including all information possable to make them both factually correct and and interusting read. The Specifications are correct from all sources I have seen and stuff like the <a href="../../../b/o/s/Bose_Headphone_Family_52bc.html#Background" title="Bose Headphone Family">Background</a> is well thought out. If you think parts are to much like ads then please point them out and help us make it a better article! p.s. Where does it list where it can be brought? The only like that I can see is the link to Best Buy to cite a source! Bose does not release information such as Sensitivity, Impedance or Magnet Type and for some reason Best Buy does so that is why that link is there! Is there another link your refering to? And I know that I have personally bent over backwards to make this article as NPOV as possable.

<li><b>Comment</b> I would deem an article about stereo systems <i>in general</i> to be encyclopedic; a series of articles about one company's stereo products can never be much else than advertising. Is a detailed list of models of headphones by a single company really so important that it needs two articles? This really cannot ever have any appeal outside a very small group. In contrast, an example of a manufacturer that probably <i>does</i> warrant a whole series of articles on individual products would be something like the <a href="../../../s/t/r/Stradivarius.html" title="Stradivarius">Stradivarius</a> violin series (and note that even there, only two prices are listed, and one is noted because it was a <i>world record</i>). <span style="font-family:serif;">—<a href="../../../p/t/k/User%7EPtkfgs_cda3.html" title="User:Ptkfgs">ptk</a>✰<a href="../../../p/t/k/User_talk%7EPtkfgs_c4c2.html" title="User talk:Ptkfgs">fgs</a></span> 12:24, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Strongly agree.</b> Furthermore, the Bose 901 mentioned by UKPhoenix79 is a good example of a world famous product that probably <i>should</i> have an article. And the article on <a href="../../../n/o/i/Noise-cancelling_headphone.html" title="Noise-cancelling headphone">noise-cancelling headphones</a> should be expanded to cover the history and development of the technology, including the contribution made by Bose, but not exclusively (<a href="../../../s/e/n/Sennheiser.html" title="Sennheiser">Sennheiser</a>, for example, should not be left out). -- <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:47, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would agree. It's quite possible that an article about the Bose product range would be encyclopaedic, too, if it discussed the historical development of products and so on. But what we have here is a series of articles massively larger than, say, <a href="../../../f/o/r/Ford_Transit_aa69.html" title="Ford Transit">Ford Transit</a>, on a series of products which, from their pricing and other parameters, are not actually designed for the mass market. We have crossed the line into indiscriminate land, I fear.

<li>It can be more than advertising if there are secondary source materials available, from sources independent of the products' manufacturer, that are non-trivial, i.e. more than simple catalogue entries but instead (for examples) histories of, analyses of, or guides to the product.

<p><a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> asked me to review this article in light of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, which establishes some rough guidelines on product articles. For convenience, I cite the entire relevant text here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A product or service is notable if it meets <i>any one</i> of the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself.
<ul>
<li>This criterion excludes:
<ul>
<li>Media re-prints of press releases, other publications where the company or corporation talks about its products or services, and advertising for the product or service. Newspaper stories that do not credit a reporter or a news service and simply present company news in an uncritical or positive way may be treated as press releases unless there is evidence to the contrary. <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_1_back"><a href="#fn_1" title="">1</a></sup></span></li>
<li>Trivial coverage, such as simple price listings in product catalogues.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This criterion includes published works in all forms, such as newspaper articles, books, television documentaries, and published reports by consumer watchdog organizations. <span class="reference"><sup id="fn_7_back"><a href="#fn_7" title="">7</a></sup></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The product or service is so well-known that its trademark has suffered from <a href="../../../g/e/n/Genericized_trademark.html" title="Genericized trademark">genericization</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><cite id="fn_1"><a href="#fn_1_back" title="">Note 1</a>:</cite> Self-promotion and product placement are not the routes to having an encyclopaedia article. The published works must be <i>someone else</i> writing about the company, corporation, product, or service. (See <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> for the verifiability and neutrality problems that affect material where the subject of the article itself is the source of the material.) The barometer of notability is whether people <i>independent</i> of the subject itself (or of its manufacturer, creator, or vendor) have actually considered the company, corporation, product or service notable enough that they have written and published non-trivial works that focus upon it.</li>
<li><cite id="fn_7"><a href="#fn_7_back" title="">Note 7</a>:</cite> Two examples: <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Word_bde4.html" title="Microsoft Word">Microsoft Word</a> satisfies this criterion because, amongst many other reasons, people who are wholly independent of Microsoft have written books about it.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>In light of this, I re-read the current article. I found it to have three basic pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Brochure-like detailed product information</i>: 8 sections, approx. 1st 75% of article
<ul>
<li>includes segment on "very close relationship" with American Airlines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Criticisms section</i>: 1 section, approx. 12% of article; no specific source cited</li>
<li><i>Ongoing improvement</i>: 2 paragraphs that appear to be a Bose marketing response to criticism; no specific source cited</li>
</ol>
<p>The only thing that doesn't sound like it comes straight from Bose or sources with strong Bose ties is the unsourced criticism section, which doesn't by itself support an article.</p>
<p>Identifying sources for the claims is problematic, as virtually none of the statements are specifically sourced. (This is understandable for most of the material if it is taken directly from brochures, but that doesn't support the notability case.) The "References" section lists the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 direct Bose sources</li>
<li>a Best Buy product page (which is very likely data copied from a Bose source)</li>
<li>a program description from American Airlines, which has a "very close relationship" with Bose</li>
<li>a biz.yahoo page that starts with the heading "Press Release / Source: Bose Corporation"</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on WP:CORP guidelines, not one of these sources provides reliable notability evidence.</p>
<p>I still think the editors were making a conscientious effort to build a solid article, but its foundation is completely undermined by the lack of any independent sources, and given their efforts and the current result, I doubt enough independent material can be found to make this a proper article. I stand by my "delete" vote above. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:33, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>ADDENDUM: My review was of the current article, but I did not factor in citations that <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> has made in the discussion above, which are attempts to show independent sources of information on this article's subject that are not yet included in the article or factored into its text (understandable, given the pace of an AfD). Here is what I currently note from above:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/hometheatre/accessories/0,39028666,40002300,00.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.cnet.com.au/hometheatre/accessories/0,39028666,40002300,00.htm" rel="nofollow">"Bose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling headphones" review</a>, author not specified, <i>CNet.com.au</i>. This review is so favorable I have to wonder if this is one of those infamous "puff pieces" written by a company and distributed anonymously as a review. The only truly critical item is about its battery, where it compares the speakers to a competitor (usually a marketing no-no, suggesting independence).</li>
<li><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1989406,00.asp" class="external text" title="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1989406,00.asp" rel="nofollow">"Bose QuietComfort 3" review</a>, Mike Kobrin, <i>PC Magazine</i>. This sounds like an independent review.</li>

Another likely independent review.</li>

Falcone. The review ends with the statement "Freelancer Steve Guttenberg contributed to this review." Fairly brief for something 3 people worked on. I'm especially concerned about the "freelancer", which is a term often used for marketing reps who contribute corporate promotional material to news agencies. Of course, it could just be a junior <i>PCM</i> researcher or intern.</li>
<li>"Professional Pilot Magazine (2004 Headset Preference Survey, Dec p 80) where the Aviation Headset X was voted #1 by a consumer survey 4 years in a Row from 2000 to 2004". This would seem promising if we could examine the claim (surveys are notoriously subjective and open to abuse). A Google search on '"Professional Pilot Magazine" "aviation headset"' turns up not the <i>PPM</i> survey but a bunch of links that cite it, starting with Bose itself. That and the lack of a link to the specific <i>PPM</i> mention troubles me.</li>
<li><a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a>'s various book citations of Bose products. These support the general notability of Bose (not contested here) but not specific products. (In fact, the <i>Mortal Prey</i> quote, "next to an elderly woman who plugged her sound-killing Bose headphones into a Sony discman", makes me wonder if we're looking at literary product placement.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem with the reviews (for the sake of this article and its associated articles) is that they don't suggest the products rise above the millions of new products from thousands of companies. I don't think that every product reviewed in every trade magazine warrants an article. In my <i>opinion</i>, specific products should have a substantial impact on the culture before they warrant articles, and even then, the focus should be on the impact, not the detailed product specs. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information</a>; in this case, it isn't a place to collect product specs. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 16:34, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So in your judgment there is some worth to the articles if we find other sources and its not just about the headphones but how they changed the industry? It will take a bit. Thanks for doing this. I have found some places like <a href="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/traveling/" class="external text" title="http://www.headphone.com/guide/by-application/traveling/" rel="nofollow">here</a> Where it directly talks about other headphones by initially comparing them to the Bose QC2 and even gives the user the option to <a href="http://www.headphone.com/technical/product-measurements/build-a-graph/" class="external text" title="http://www.headphone.com/technical/product-measurements/build-a-graph/" rel="nofollow">compare</a> with graphs. If you look a search of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=QuietComfort&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" class="external text" title="http://books.google.com/books?q=QuietComfort&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;as_brr=0" rel="nofollow">Google Books</a> Using the key word QuietComfort you also get books containg that phrase. I think that the reason that the C|Net review didn't list the author is bacuse it was the Australian site. Here are some more products from the official American C|Net site <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Bose_QuietComfort_2_Noise_Cancelling_headphones/4505-6468_7-21165521.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://reviews.cnet.com/Bose_QuietComfort_2_Noise_Cancelling_headphones/4505-6468_7-21165521.html" rel="nofollow">[52]</a> <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Bose_QuietComfort_3/4505-6468_7-31929466.html?autoplay=true" class="external autonumber" title="http://reviews.cnet.com/Bose_QuietComfort_3/4505-6468_7-31929466.html?autoplay=true" rel="nofollow">[53]</a>.

Wikinfo aims to provide the best information about subjects, maybe they would welcome this, but in a general enclcyopaedia the level of detail is excessive. An article on the development of noise-cancelling headphones which includes the Bose, Sennheiser and other products might be OK, but this gives a largely uncritical restatement of Bose's own spin on things. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 08:37, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It is not even written vaguely for this website.</p>

<p>People do seem to want to literally alter other person[s]' <a href="../../../a/r/g/Argue.html" title="Argue">arguements</a>; defeating them is simpler: thereby victory for the secondary editor.</p>
<p>I had entitled my comment specifically w/ "MSRP: $ ", in order to stress the absurdity of listing the otherwise already borderline absurd concept of "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturers%27_suggested_retail_price.html" title="Manufacturers' suggested retail price">manufacturers' suggested retail price</a>[s]" on this website. I do, factually, know what I'd copied.</p>
<p>Should the <a href="../../../t/i/s/Tissue.html" title="Tissue">tissue</a> pages list prices f/ <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facial_tissue.html" title="Facial tissue">facial tissue</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/i/Toilet_paper.html" title="Toilet paper">toilet paper</a>??</p>

<p>,... &amp;, we now return to our regularly scheduled television-commercial-article[s],... I would be less likely to worry about this article if ^^ that text ^^ would admit to being from the commercials. Quotation!! And historical prices would not matter much, if quoting from cancelled advertizing-campaigns. As quotation. Old campaigns. If someone says "Cocacola; $00.05", we, generally, interpret that as either history, when "Coke" had been "coke--ain" {{in addition to the "sugar-fix"}}, or someone is doing a "price-war".</p>
<p>In either case, "<a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturers%27_suggested_retail_price.html" title="Manufacturers' suggested retail price">manufacturers' suggested retail price</a>" seems unjustified, unjust.</p>

<li>Hopiakuta, if I understand what you're trying to say here, you are actually advocating for the deletion of the article <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manufacturers%27_suggested_retail_price.html" title="Manufacturers' suggested retail price">Manufacturers' suggested retail price</a>. Please note that that is <b>not</b> the subject of this "articles for deletion" (AfD) entry. If you wish to nominate an article for deletion, you should follow the process outlined at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion</a>.

<p>Exactly "not". Sorry. Every message that I put here quotes from this Bose wikiadvertizement: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>MSRP: $</p>
<p>^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>I, also, pointed-out my hearing Bose on Cnn: same monologue as this advertizement. I suppose that I'm the only one here to hear these commercials. If you took the various Bose scripts from television, overlayed them on top of this article: they would match. That's part of why I employed the similes of other ads. The prices are the other reason.</p>
<p>I'm increasingly wondering who these authors are. Why are they insisting on putting the television-script here? Why are the prices relevant? If they are historical prices from cancelled advertizing, then the historical relevance should be emphasized.</p>
<p>Otherwise they should be deleted. My opinion.</p>
<p>So, who are they? Are they of Bose advertizing? Next-door-neighbors to an executive? Cousins to an engineer?</p>
<p>Wiki should not be a television-commercial-reproduction, unless as historical-retrospective. I'm running-out of ways to say that. If I'm the only one who perceives the need for major reformat in that light, well okay. But, that is neither "delete" nor "keep". Humans are so often about "all or nothing". Well, sometimes it's appropriate; but, too much causes war, prison, other <a href="../../../a/n/a/Anachronism.html" title="Anachronism">anachronism</a>,...</p>
<p>as well as offensive Bose articles. That's, also, why my article was deleted. Because no one was willing to admit that any of it was worth the effort, not even the intent or perspective.</p>
<p>I suppose that I am incapable of perceiving like anyone else. Well, I'm stuck w/ this brain: no trades.</p>
<p>So, it's all about the Bose advertizing as article.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well I'm one of the main editors and I KNOW that I'm not being paid for this and I really doubt that Bose even knows of this article. Quite frankly if they did know about it and really cared about saving it don't you think that this article would have had many people loggin on defending the page saying that it should stay the same and out vote everyone here? Well as you can see that did not happen since it is really only myself and <a href="../../../v/e/s/User%7EVesther_244c.html" title="User:Vesther">Vesther</a> that have spent any time editing this page. All that we have ever tried to do is make the article really informative and interusting to read. It seams that the biggest sin we did was to use Bose.com as our main source of information. But every time that we had someone say that the page looks like an ad I know that I'd ask them to tell us where and to help us make it better. I'd never hear any response. The only reason the price was mentiond (as stated earlier) was in an effort to be thorough. It was mentioned in the specs section and it was mentioned in the criticisms section. It was not plasterd all over the place and like I mentioned with all the links above it doesnt seem to be that unusual inside of wikipedia. Here is an example, I'm going to quickly list Apple Computer articles that have prices included (and some even have Multiple different prices listed) <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_1102.html" title="IPod">IPod</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_mini_1d38.html" title="IPod mini">IPod mini</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_photo_be46.html" title="IPod photo">IPod photo</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_shuffle_8511.html" title="IPod shuffle">IPod shuffle</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_nano_a018.html" title="IPod nano">IPod nano</a> <a href="../../../i/p/o/IPod_Hi-Fi_7cc2.html" title="IPod Hi-Fi">IPod Hi-Fi</a> (which btw even references the SoundDock) <a href="../../../a/p/p/Apple_Mighty_Mouse_c253.html" title="Apple Mighty Mouse">Apple Mighty Mouse</a> <a href="../../../x/s/e/Xserve_RAID_2bec.html" title="Xserve RAID">Xserve RAID</a> <a href="../../../i/s/i/ISight_1268.html" title="ISight">ISight</a> <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_Mac_G5_d854.html" title="Power Mac G5">Power Mac G5</a> <a href="../../../x/s/e/Xserve.html" title="Xserve">Xserve</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_Pro_0184.html" title="MacBook Pro">MacBook Pro</a> <a href="../../../i/m/a/IMac_c0da.html" title="IMac">IMac</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/Mac_mini.html" title="Mac mini">Mac mini</a> <a href="../../../i/b/o/IBook_e557.html" title="IBook">IBook</a> <a href="../../../m/a/c/MacBook_b11e.html" title="MacBook">MacBook</a>. As you see this seams to be a standard inside of wikipedia and all I did was adhear to it since it made sense. And no I don't live next door to an executive or anything else you think that I am and I'm not even Dr. Bose himself! I just spent a long time doing this article and I think that it shouldn't be removed because some people don't like the company even if they do make products that deserve to be included inside of wikipedia! Please try to keep a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOV</a> mind set when reviewing other peoples work. I'm sorry that the articles you created were deleted but I would think that you of all people would have wanted tose who voted against you to have looked at your articles in a NPOV way. So please do the same when you look at others work&#160;:) I hope that I answered your questions and any others that people might have thought of&#160;:) p.s. I was the one who reformatted your original comment and put it in the vote section. I'm sorry if that upset you since that truly was not my intent. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 00:29, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Response</b> to Hopiakuta: I apologize for my misunderstanding. One problem with your statements above is that you don't give any specifics about the commercials you're referring to (like where and when you saw it, so that others might catch the same commercials; specific quotes that are supposedly identical to the article text; possibly even a video clip from a commercial on YouTube, although this last is admittedly not a usual form of evidence). But even if these commercials are saying the same thing the article does, that doesn't mean the editors got the information from the commercials. More likely, both are getting information from official Bose product brochures, which surely <i>should</i> say the same thing. (If they're using the same descriptive prose verbatim, however, that's a potential copyright violation, and is a concern.) In any case, I'm reasonably sure our Bose article editors aren't shills for Bose; they just feel strongly that this information belongs in Wikipedia, and understandably don't want their work to be discarded. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> to UKPhoenix79: Please don't confuse objection to an article with dislike of the subject. I happen to be a fan of Bose — I'm very pleased with some 20-year Bose speakers I have that have outlasted three stereo systems — but liking a product has absolutely nothing to do with whether a particular article on that product is appropriate for Wikipedia.<br />
It would be ideal for editors like myself, who believe in the potential for an objective, properly sourced article, to do the work to create it, but it's much more time-consuming to do this work than it is to collect brochure details and weblinks. For instance, when <i>I</i> fact-check a single statement from a source, I examine its supposed print and web references, note who wrote them, search for potential biases of the authors, examine the notability of the sources, and try to pursue related information to ensure that information is solidly backed up by folks without an agenda. I have neither the time nor the interest in doing so. My only interest, which I committed to by voting here, is to keep an eye on the article to see if it mutates into something useful to Wikipedia. (I see some tweaks have been made, but the major problems remain.) It is incumbent upon the editors interested in the subject to make this happen, because no one else will. This does not mean that outside editors can't judge the merits of articles on basic Wikipedia requirements, which apply no matter what the subject.<br />
In the specific case of audio reviews, my experience has been that professionals almost universally refuse to do independently monitored double-blind tests, which are the only way to separate true differences in audio experiences from the cachet of brand-name competitions and reviewers' personal biases. (The few I've heard of who've participated in these tend to be surprised at how thoroughly their own perceptions fool them when they know what they're listening to in advance.) For this and other reasons, I don't believe one can write an objective encyclopedia article on such products, except when discussing sourcable history and independently reported popularity, which are not the current focus of these articles. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 01:58, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm glad that your not like some who have turned a personal bias against a company to dictate their voting decision. After all I think that this vote has become mute after all the independent reviews found and everything else that justifies its inclusion in wikipedia. I have been holding off on doing any editing until the AfD has closed and we can get back to the article and make it better. Some people have actually for once given good suggestions on how to improve this and even given some suggestions. I only hope that we can keep some people interusted in the article afterwards so that we can all work together to make it better. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 03:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> This article is designed to be informative just like <i>any</i> good article should be. We simply got facts and put it in one place. It is not fan material since we also tried to have a detailed critisms section that has now been shortened (dont quite know why) and a section following each headphone only listing the known specs of the headphones. I have provided <i>TONS</i> of links to <i>MANY</i> articles out there that do exactly the same and even go farther then that.

<li><b>Copyright violation</b> - I voted fairly early in this debate, then changed my vote, and then since the discussion continues, I took a further look. There's been a lot of claims by the editors of this article that they have written this themselves and it is not Bose advertising. So I was very disappointed to find that this is not the truth. I'm not going to say that they have deliberately lied to us, but I can say I'm very disappointed. I took a random section (turned out to be from the Combat Crewman section) and copied a chunck of the text into Google, and lo, it turns out to be a complete cut-and-paste from this Bose advertising website <a href="http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&amp;url=/professional/military/crewman.jsp&amp;ck=0" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bose.com/controller?event=VIEW_STATIC_PAGE_EVENT&amp;url=/professional/military/crewman.jsp&amp;ck=0" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> So, <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a>, you've got some answering to do. You've been less than honest with us. I have seen some cleanup of the article, but the bottom line is this IS advertising, directly from the Bose site, and therefore constitutes copyright violation. Anyreason why it shouldn't be tagged as such? <a href="../../../a/k/r/User%7EAkradecki_16b8.html" title="User:Akradecki">Akradecki</a> 16:30, 8 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> That was a good catch and your right that should be edited, are there any other copy vios that you have found? But I'd like to ask that you <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a> since I have actually been <i>very honest</i> about everything I have said and I have not <i>ever</i> intentially lied to <i>anyone</i> here. I just seam to be the only person that edits this article that is willing to go through all this to prove the articles viability. To put things in perspective this particular headpnone your talking about is <i>only</i> avalable to the military and as the article says it's <i>not available to the consumer market.</i> So if this section was advertising its a very inafectual one at that. I have time and time again even before this AfD came up asked those that critisised the article to point out where and help us make it better only a couple actually replied, and we worked with them to do just that. I have never said that this page was perfact and it didn't need work I have instead only asked people to help us make it truly Great and I can only hope that you can help us do just that. I'm sorry that there was a copy vio and I can only hope that you'd believe me that it was never my intention to mislead anyone in any way. -- <a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUKPhoenix79_8f16.html" title="User:UKPhoenix79">UKPhoenix79</a> 03:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Obvious copyvio, or just a polished writer submitting their first article to Wikipedia? Lacking proof of the former I think we need to assume it is the latter. This is a very nice article, although it needs wikification and references as indicated above. If the author could include one or two references at the end of the article I think we would allow a fair amount of interpolation without complaining, as there's nothing controversial or questionable about the information itself. -- <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnopilgrim_d7d3.html" title="User:Technopilgrim">technopilgrim</a> 18:41, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I am the one who wrote this entire article. I wrote it somewhat from personally being in the places I wrote about as a juvenile but I tried my best to confirm all of the information with the help of the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections and also the department of probation. I linked to the homepage of the Idaho Youth Ranch which confirms some of the information. I can promise you that not a single word in this article is a copyright violation as I wrote the entire article myself. I know I lack sources that havebeen published in writting but I admit this on the talk page for the article. It definitly needs improvment and more sources, and I am working on this, but I am having trouble finding any documentation on these various places, although as far as oral information goes from the people that work at them I could easily get this. Every word in this article is true and I can promise this. It is also not a copyright violation I can assure you of this also. It just needs more sources. I am not logged on now but my user name is tuluvas2 and I will come back online later to confirm that I am in fact the one who wrote this article.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 72.24.244.223 (<a href="../../../7/2/2E/User_talk%7E72.24.244.223.html" title="User talk:72.24.244.223">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_72.24.244.223_5022.html" title="Special:Contributions/72.24.244.223">contribs</a>) 2006-08-05T18:09:08 (UTC)</small>

<li><b>Keep</b> but with massive cleanup and wikifying. I'm also questioning the "notability" of this thing, but there needs to be some work done on this article to meet the "standards."

<li><b>Keep</b> <a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 17:36, 9 August 2006 (UTC)I agree that juvenile facilities are highly under represented, not only here but in general. Part of the reason for this is due to federally and locally enforced confidentiality laws (especially in regards to juveniles) and the other part is most likely due to the fact that the select individuals who possess information regarding these facilities (administrators of the Department of Juvenile Justice and to a lesser extent probation officers) are not highly motivated to release it. In my (POV) experience the administrators of the Idaho Department of Juvenile Corrections are a fairly secretive group of people. This combined with the fact that the information does not (to my knowledge) need to be published by law leads to a surprising lack of information regarding the entire system. As for NPOV I can see how you would get this perception but where I drew from personal experience was more on absolute truths than information which could be subjective. For example, Five County Detention Center does have a shower unit like the one I described, and my own subjective experience cannot bias this objective statement. NPOV is generally only applicable to those things which can be measured subjectively (good and evil, beautiful and ugly) and in general can not be applied to things which are stated in fact (The stick is one foot long). If any information in the article I wrote is perceived as POV I would ask that it is removed, reworded, or has a source citied. Also I believe that it is important that Wikipedia keeps this article even if the article must be restructured, reworded, reformatted and re-referenced to make it comply with the standards of Wikipedia. I am currently searching for more sources than the minimal ones I currently have listed. I would also like to apologize for my (obvious I assume) minimal skills in formatting text on wikipedia. I am still learning and have minimal time to learn =).</li>

<li><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 19:44, 9 August 2006 (UTC) Okay sorry to continue adding posts but upon rereading the post by CrazyRussian I noticed that I mistook NOR for NPOV. This is the reason for my trying to explain why I did not think my article was non NPOV in the above paragraph, and also was my reason for cleaning up the article and removing any text I saw as even remotely non NPOV. Something which is original research is defined as anything to which one of the following could apply:</li>
</ul>
<p><b>1. It introduces a theory or method of solution;</b> 2. It introduces original ideas; 3. It defines new terms; 4. It provides or presumes new definitions of pre-existing terms; 5. It introduces an argument, without citing a reputable source for that argument, that purports to refute or support another idea, theory, argument, or position; 6. It introduces an analysis or synthesis of established facts, ideas, opinions, or arguments in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor, without attributing that analysis or synthesis to a reputable source; 7. It introduces or uses neologisms, without attributing the neologism to a reputable source.</p>
<p>I would have to say that the vast majority of the article does not fall under one of these classifications.</p>
<p>1. The article does not introduce a theory or a method of solution.</p>
<p>2. It does not introduce original ideas seeing as it does not really introduce ideas at all (assuming one would define an idea not as an objective fact but as theoretical pondering or thinking).</p>
<p>3. The article does not define new terms, I would say that some of the terms could be considered neologisms but there are reputable sources that would define them (For example “IDJC” and “JCC” and “commit” are not commonly used words, but a simple Google search will show several websites that use them in proper context.)</p>
<p>4. It does not provide or presume new definitions of any pre-existing terms.</p>
<p>5. It does introduce an analysis or synthesis of established facts, but they most certainly are not presented in a way that builds a particular case favored by the editor (or anyone for that matter). Also they are verifiable (Despite the fact that some of them are not currently verified in the article. As I said before more sources are needed, but they are out there I am sure, few as they may be.)</p>
<p><br />
6. I can see how the sentence "it is a highly subjective decision and fully up to the judge if a juvenile gets committed" could be considered original research under the 5th rule listed above seeing as I have no source and it could be considered to be an argument. For this reason I will remove that sentence and instead add only that it is up to a judge whether or not to commit the juvenile, as this states objective fact and does not try to present something that could be perceived as an argument.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>As I have said before I know that this article needs more references, and this is reason for improvement, but it is not in my opinion non-npov nor is it original research. It just states objective facts that need more sources.</p>

<p>I added a few informative sources to the list and referenced two things to a very reliable source. I know that many more sources are still needed but I hope that this adds some amount of quality to the article so that maybe people will think it is a good contribution to wikipedia and doesn't need to be deleted. Once again I am not sure if I am doing everything correctly or not and if I am doing anything wrong I would like it if someone would inform me so that I can correct anything I am doing wrong. thanks!

<li><b>Keep</b>, as no one has been able to provide any proof of copyvio after several days of listing in AfD, this rationale is without merit. Author shows a commendable commitment to understand and adhere to WP policies. Subject (prisons) is inherently notable, and my original comment about verifiability has begun to be addressed. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 17:42, 10 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../t/u/l/User%7ETuluvas2_e965.html" title="User:Tuluvas2">Tuluvas2</a> 14:41, 11 August 2006 (UTC) I have referenced even more things to reliable sources. I have found actualy a wealth of information on some of these programs, which I added links to at the end of the article. There is actually probably enough information from those links for somebody to add several paragraphs of referenced information to the article if they so desire, but at the moment I do not have the time to do so. Also due to my poor skills at formatting wikipedia I think that some of the reference subscripts are showing up a bit out of order. I don't know if this is the correct place to put this or not, but I think that the article is clearly referenced now. How do I request that it is taken off of the list for deletion page? Wait 5 days?</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - <b>solo says</b>: Well I didn't set out writing my page to 'prove myself more or less notable than anyone else' I was responding to the fact that OTHER people posted entry about my award-winning kids radio station and made reference to me and my radio achievements. I saw an empty link on my name and filled it with content in my own style. Doing that, I seem to have walked into a flood of resentment from some people.. I am not 'worried about my status' here. I am just posting what is known truth and frankly I thought people might be interested in the person behind the idea. <a href="../../../t/a/k/Takeover_Radio_034b.html" title="Takeover Radio">Takeover Radio</a> is a unique and enduring creation which is known to many thousands of people in UK and around the world --Philip solo 17:44, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> - <b>solo says</b>: Actually after reading all your rules and regulations and restrictions on 'expression' I have already reduced my article to mostly factual references (making it less personal as a result). I have included a lot of links to other RSL stations currently not listed here with entries which are valid material, which I intend to fill with factual entries and site links which is new valid content creation isn't it?. I must say you are an <i>unfriendly bunch</i> with new content contributors ..pretty much seems like a closed club where your rules on grammar and construction are more important to you than encouraging people to contribute .. I guess you have your own world and want it all so so, and anyone who arrives and doesn't fit in or gets too flamboyant in style is gonna take a hammering.. so be it...Perhaps if I take it down to a link to a blank page some of you will be happy then--Philip solo 01:58, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hello again 217.33.207.242 - in fact, you'll find that there are a lot of active footballers who contribute to wikipedia- the difference is, they don't necessarily think the team that they play for is notable enough to be included, and so include information about actually notable teams. I do understand that you shouldn't just include stuff that's found on google- I was recently arguing against deletion of another article where poor returns from google were one of the reasons being cited for deletion. But what is essential is that the information is verifiable, as wikipedia is a tertiary source. That means, it must appear somewhere- e.g. in a book, a reputable newspaper, etc., and usually not just as a footnote in passing. This team of bankers seems so non-notable, I can't even get a foothold on where to start. If we include it, then we might as well include the football team I play for as well. I'm sure I can happily make claims about our adventurous style of Total Football as well.--<a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobotforaday_000c.html" title="User:Robotforaday">Robotforaday</a> 11:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>No delete</b>. I say it's not the kind of thing to appear on google, but keep it unless the article can be proven to be false. There must be a way of verifying this through the end-of-season reviews of lower leagues, maybe they have a blog?

He is directly responsible for administering and facilitating a large share of the tournament operations, interleague and intersquad communications and runs the second largest educational supplement materials company in the area. Mr. Kerpen's innovations in the area of academic policy debate include published essays on his website and in magazines serving the activity, such as <i>Rostrum</i>, and also include developing new models of research and information distribution through the internet. Modern academic policy debate would not be anywhere near as advanced as it is without Mr. Kerpen's contributions.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Moreover, Philip G. Kerpen is a notable author of op-eds, white papers, briefing books and books, having worked for the Woodhill Foundation, The Cato Institute, The Club for Growth and The Free Enterprise Fund. He was instrumental in founding the latter, and was the primary mover in The Club for Growth. His recent works have included candidate interviews, candidate endorsements, political strategy decisions, major gift and donor relations, authoring of position papers and authoring columns for publication in several newspapers and opinion magazines. He has been published and interviewed in media as diverse as <i>Black Enterprise</i> and <i>The Wall St. Journal</i>, and recently, <i>Doublethink</i>. Mr. Kerpen is also a Contributing Editor to <i>The National Review</i> and a regular columnist in <i>The New York Sun</i>.</font></p>

Upcoming.org is ranked around 8,000th. Spraci is ranked around 148,000th. Notability is not determined by age alone.

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../../a/l/e/Wikipedia%7EAlexa_Test_2f44.html" title="Wikipedia:Alexa Test">Alexa Test</a> is not one of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> criteria. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:28, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So? The Google test isn't an official part of any criteria, either. It's still a reasonable gauge. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So giving the results of running the Alexa Test is not an explanation of why something does not satisfy the notability criteria. And as <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGoogle_Test_6be3.html" title="Wikipedia:Google Test">Wikipedia:Google Test</a> explains, the Google Test is <i>not</i> a reasonable gauge. <i>Counting hits is not research.</i> <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 17:47, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, give me a break. I'm trying to give a new user a pointer. If you actually read the page you keep posting, you'll also see that "Some editors use the Alexa ranking to determine whether Wikipedia should have an article, arguing that we should certainly have articles on top 100 sites, possibly have articles on top 1,000 sites, and usually not have articles for sites not in the top 100,000." I'm one of those users. Absolutely nowhere did I say it was an official criterion, just that if he wants to see why one is more popular than the other, that's where he can take a look. I also told him that he's welcome to nominate all those other articles for deletion. So how about you get off your high horse and let me try to give a new guy some help? <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 17:54, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are giving a new user a wholly erroneous pointer. Explaining that an article is not notable because a web site ranks low in the Alexa Test is an entirely false explanation, given that that isn't a criterion for notability. If you yourself are using the Alexa Test to determine notability, then you are applying a test that isn't a criterion, and (as discussed extensively on <a href="../../../a/l/e/Wikipedia%7EAlexa_Test_2f44.html" title="Wikipedia:Alexa Test">Wikipedia:Alexa Test</a> and <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia_talk%7ENotability_%28web%29_b1bd.html" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)">Wikipedia talk:Notability (web)</a>) shouldn't be a criterion. Please stop. You aren't actually helping the new editor at all. You are giving xem a false explanation. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:50, 3 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So you think this site <i>is</i> notable? You think it should be kept? Of course not; not even the original author thinks so. So what, exactly, is your point? The website fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, and Alexa's findings are in line with that. It's a pretty common test, not just something I pulled out of my ass, and it never hurts for users to have more information. If you don't like it, fine. Don't use it. But it's out there, and I have every right to tell him about it. And, yes, the link to WP:WEB should have been posted by the nominator. I thought he did, so I didn't include it in my original post. This was meant to be information <i>in addition</i> to WEB. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 18:57, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>ok Dark Shikari and Uncle G thanks for posting the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> link
<p>... it brings some sanity to this ...</p>
<p>I am not independant of spraci so I would accept that as a fair reason for it not being accepted (without providing other references)</p>
<p>If that is the real reason I'll accept that.</p>
<p>regarding the "because it's an advertisement" stuff:</p>
<p>I could say that those other pages are too and that kind of comment in this situation just gives a bad impression.</p>
<p>(an impression that "size of funding" influences "notability", which is bound to upset people)</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> page Dark Shikari and Uncle G mention explains the criteria so why not just point me to that right from the start?</p>

<li>Based on everything I've read, the need to reach consensus is at the core of the Wikipedia philosophy. We discuss until we reach consensus. Under what circumstances will a reasonable Zionist and a reasonable anti-Zionist ever agree on the content of an article called <i>Zionist Regime</i>? This is nothing but a revert war honeypot. Some people live for that stuff, while I'd personally like to see much less. That'll leave us more time to spend reaching <i>consensus</i> on issues that that actually bear upon real people.

<li><b>Weak keep.</b> I agree that it looks unlikely that the subject is notable, but this page is under construction and has even been noted as such with the proper template.

<li><b>Comment</b> - the article needs to more clearly establish the importance of the subject. I'm not sure that tossing it into AFD so quickly is a good idea.

<li><b>Keep</b> Nlu should post to talk that the author needs to state more clearly her special notability. Then allow the author to more clearly address that.

<li>But the thing is, as stated, I <i>don't</i> believe that the subject <i>can</i> satisfy the notability requirement whatever is added about her.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The article on Charlotte Martyn has two claims: 1) she's the Production Editor for ONM, and 2) she was a contributor to Games Magazine. <a href="http://forum.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20101" class="external autonumber" title="http://forum.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=20101" rel="nofollow">[59]</a> specifically admits she's one of the lesser members of the team, and being a contributor to Games (of which there are many) probably doesn't meet the threshold either.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>There is no clear indication of what is meant by Special Operations. The Joint Doctrine of the UK Armed Forces as developed by the Joint Doctrine and Concepts Centre does not include this, the division being <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_Kingdom_Special_Forces_7be0.html" title="United Kingdom Special Forces">Special Forces</a> and Regular forces.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>

<li>The UKSF Reserve logo is inappropriate, since the UKSF are dealt with in that article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The first main section covers SF, which are dealt with in the <a href="../../../u/k/s/UKSF_b625.html" title="UKSF">UKSF</a> article and should accordingly be removed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Brigade Patrol Troop is dealt with elsewhere, as is FPGRM. It should be clear from the FPGRM that their role is protection of the Nuclear estate, this is not an SF role. BPT patrol beyond the Forward Edge of Battle Area, this is a conventional activity in the strategic and tactical doctrine of the UK.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Mountain &amp; Arctic Warfare Cadre no longer exists and in any case was a training organisation. Mountain and Arctic warfare is not an SF role, but rather one of the prime roles of <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Commando_Brigade_2b04.html" title="3 Commando Brigade">3 Commando Brigade</a>.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Pathfinder Platoon is a <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parachute_Regiment_51c4.html" title="Parachute Regiment">Parachute Regiment</a> unit, part of 16 Air Assault Brigade, a regular army formation.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>8 Flight AAC is an element of the Special Forces Air Wing and therefore dealt with under the SF article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>148 Battery is an element of 29 Regt Royal Artillery, a Commando trained element of <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Commando_Brigade_2b04.html" title="3 Commando Brigade">3 Commando Brigade</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The section on Reserve Special Operations units refers to only one unit that is not handled under the SF article eg the HAC. 21 Regt and 23 Regt SAS, 63(V) Sqn R.Sigs a component of 18(SF) Sigs Regt and the SBS Reserve are all discussed in the SF article. HAC is an ISTAR asset which operates in beyond the Forward Edge of Battle Area, That is a regular army role and is fulfilled by other 'Green Army' Artillery units as well.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The elite units section does not justify why these units should be considered in a Special Operations context, accepting that at this time SOF remains undefined.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>With reference to support units. 18 Sigs Regt is an element of UKSF and discussed in that article. The remaining units are elements of <a href="../../../3/_/c/3_Commando_Brigade_2b04.html" title="3 Commando Brigade">3 Commando Brigade</a> and discussed in that article.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>The section <i>Former Special Forces</i> could be discussed under the SF article, not in a specious article. Notwithstanding that, Commachio Group was a precursor to FPGRM, its role was protection of the Nuclear estate. British Commandos were a Commando force and discussed under that article. Whether 95th Foot, as an early proponent of the skirmishing approach to <a href="../../../i/n/f/Infantry.html" title="Infantry">infantry</a> tactics could be considered as Special Forces or not is an interesting debate, I would tend to disagree but this is not the place for that discussion. 14 Int Coy could be considered as an SF unit, not a SOF unit.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is subject of an attempted mediation, discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Torinir/SOF_UK_Mediation" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Torinir/SOF_UK_Mediation" rel="nofollow">here</a> however the initial complainant has made no effort to actually engage in the mediation.

<li><b>Keep</b> The Mobile Construction Vehicle is perhaps the most important unit and it appears in all the command and conquer games except Generals. Very much can be written about the Mobile Construction vehicle.

<p>This is a non-notable local radio show available on only one radio station. It has been airing for 21 years, but that should not make this program notable. Many television and radio stations have had long running local programs that aren't notable and should not have their own article. A mention in the station article should suffice. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 04:05, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>As I am Jason Haap, I am troubled that Wikipedia would allow such defamatory material a place on their page. The material listed is not true. For example, I am not unemployed. I am not "self-styled" in that the moniker "The Dean of Cincinnati" was given to me by associates. (That final point is admittedly a bit absurd.) I am not a racist because one person says I am (Nate Livingston, who has said that about many activists in the Cincinnati area. I would like to note there are plenty of entries on his blog where I am praised -- all dated AFTER the post linked here.) Additionally, the "outrage" described about an old blog comment is nothing more than this single person -- who has trolled all corners of the internet trying to broadcast inaccurate information about my personal life. Though I am partially a public figure in the Cincinnati community, I hardly am such on a national or international level. Lastly, I do not deserve to be dogged this way by an angry politico in the Midwest -- at least not on Wikipedia's servers.</li>

He has received a lot of press coverage in the Ottawa area, most recently about the troubles he's having running for office as a public servant (he's employed by the province). He got a lot of coverage the last time around too, since he served as a bit of a lightning rod on a number of issues (anti-smoking by-law, bilingualism, rural discontent, etc.), and he didn't disappear from the media between elections the way some candidates do. Sadly, I think he meets WP:BIO. --<a href="../../../s/k/e/User%7ESkeezix1000_63e3.html" title="User:Skeezix1000">Skeezix1000</a> 20:36, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I'm sorry you feel that way. The article could use some additions. He is certainly more notable than say <a href="../../../d/o/n/Donna_Upson_60d4.html" title="Donna Upson">Donna Upson</a> who ran for mayor last time and survived deletion. The point is, Kilrea has raised quite a bit of controversy and is quite notable in the city. Anyone familiar with local Ottawa politics will know who Kilrea is because of this. I must say I am baffled as to why this is being deleted, but as I can see, it's just people who are not from Ottawa who are unable to understand the notability of Mr. Kilrea. --<a href="../../../c/u/r/Image%7ECurlingstub.PNG_870c.html" class="image" title="curling rock"><img src="../../../upload/thumb/b/b7/Curlingstub.PNG/20px-Curlingstub.PNG" alt="curling rock" width="20" height="15" longdesc="../../../c/u/r/Image%7ECurlingstub.PNG_870c.html" /></a> <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarl_Andrew_34dc.html" title="User:Earl Andrew">Earl Andrew</a> - <a href="../../../e/a/r/User_talk%7EEarl_Andrew_5969.html" title="User talk:Earl Andrew">talk</a> 04:54, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, in what way does he meet <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>? It doesn't seem that he "has been the primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person." As I said, he's mentioned in quite a few things, but not as the main subject. He has not had his own work published. He has not done important things in government, since he has never been in government. He may be notable, but that needs to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Saying, "If you lived in Ottawa, you would know why," is not a valid reason for keeping the article. If nobody can come up with sufficient sources, my delete vote will stand. <a href="../../../k/a/f/User%7EKafziel_f39f.html" title="User:Kafziel">Kafziel</a> 12:05, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Given his controversial stands on a number of issues, he has been the main subject of significant media coverage over the years. In many ways, the media has treated him as a spokesman for right-wing views on local issues.

<li>Those results are very different from the Google search I performed yesterday. I couldn't find a single article with his name in the headline.

<li>I agree with Kafziel that the statement "If you lived in Ottawa, you would know why" is pretty ambiguous. To somebody not from Ottawa, taking the article at face value, there is nothing remarkable about this person. So it would improve the article to cite these sources mentioned by Skeezix1000 in the article itself. --<a href="../../../a/t/r/User%7EAtrian_4bb8.html" title="User:Atrian">Atrian</a> 13:51, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

My whole reason for letting other editors know about this article and the corresponding AfD is because I was hoping they'd read the article, see the associations the artist has made, activities he has participated in, check out the sources I have cited, and then hopefully vote for a keep. However, in no way was I trying to influence anyone's vote (I have informed plenty of editors about other AfDs that they disagreed with me on), merely putting the article in front of them and seeing what they might think. I just think AfDs on music should be voted on by people who have an idea on what the music scene is actually like, not people who only know pop music and think because someone isn't on the radio, that it isn't notable. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 17:41, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thank you, Rklawton. We may disagree, but at least you are letting me disagree.&#160;:) And as far as why I responded, I respond when I feel a comment is based on bad logic. Yes, Wikipedia is not MySpace, but I feel that doesn't have anything to do with this debate. I don't vote <i>keep</i> or write an article on every band I come across. I would not have put the article up if I did not have sources and an assertion of notability in the article. Arguments like "this isn't MySpace" or "delete, I've never heard of the guy" don't seem relevant. <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../p/a/r/User_talk%7EParsssseltongue_45c2.html" title="User talk:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">s-s-s-s</font></a>)</sup> 14:57, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>First of all, I am a little disturbed that <a href="../../../p/a/r/User%7EParsssseltongue_2b9d.html" title="User:Parsssseltongue"><font color="green">PT</font></a> feels the need to argue with every person who votes for deletion. I understand you are trying to save your article from being deleted, but you aren't Floyd Landis. This debate shouldn't be taken personally. And if saying that means I am being incivil and not assuming good faith, then so be it. From what I can tell, Avery is not a nationally recognized artist. He isn't listed on any major music databases. I can't find references to him in any national sources on performance art or experimental music...maybe someone else can? However, I've seen numerous Wikipedia pages on artists who are known only locally or regionally. I guess it depends on whether Ryan Avery represents enough of a unique phenomena in Phoenix to warrant his own page. From what I can gather, he may meet that criteria. --<a href="../../../i/n/f/User%7EInfamous30_7393.html" title="User:Infamous30">Infamous30</a> 15:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Ryan Avery has permeated the culture of Art Link First Fridays, which has galleries that show artists from all over the country, not just from Arizona proper. It represents an art movement that just happens to be taking place in a city not steretypically art-centric. The claim "Local interest only" is only a superficial claim in this case, as galleries such as Perihelion and The Trunk Space frequently welcome artists from New York, California, New Orleans, etc. Anyone as prolific as Ryan Avery is within this community (see list at beginning of first "strong keep" entry, as well as the links within disputed article) have ties to, and/or has toured and traveled to many other states, making their impact more than just a "local" impact, without mention of the Mission in Portland he will be undertaking, or of Mark Mothersbaugh's diary entry, worthy of note as more than anecdotal evidence of his impact across the state/city. Otherwise, under such scrutinous criteria, those other local artists listed would be disputable as well (and--given ample evidence through more sources than just google or a recording artist database--they are not). In short, I argue "up-and-coming" versus "local interest only," being that his career has essentially just started, and has already undergone an exponential impact, with a diverse history in multiple art areas, given its incredibly short span. With regards to the responding to deletes, that is the modus operandi of civil discussion; comment or question, then response. If each delete request was not followed by a comment or elucidation as to the logic behind it, it would not warrant a response, it would be a simple "yes" or "no" vote. <a href="../../../d/a/i/User%7EDain_Quentin_Gore_951f.html" title="User:Dain Quentin Gore">Dain Quentin Gore</a> 07:42, 7 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, I am not a sock puppet. I don't use aliases on the internet, this is my real name and always has been. Dain Quentin Gore exists under no other alias on Wikipedia. In addition, I had to research the html uses, etc. of this site just to enter my vote. I had to copy/paste any markups I used such as "strong keep," and I avoid using excessive linking/hrefs to save time and avoid mistakes. This issue has made me join wikipedia because I have seen many artists sites here that have ultimately been kept under similar circumstances. I know about this topic through an email I received (not from Ryan Avery).

The two new Wikipedia editors who began their time on Wikipedia by voting <i>keep</i> first came to Wikipedia on their own. I had something to do with it only in the fact that I created the article on the subject that attracted them here in the first place, but there is no collusion between us.

<li>The article refers to an "inertial force". However, <a href="../../../i/n/e/Inertia.html" title="Inertia">inertial</a> motion is how an object moves in the lack of a force.</li>
<li>"The general principal states that gravitational acceleration is equivalent to inertial acceleration." -- The general <a href="../../../p/r/i/Principle_of_relativity.html" title="Principle of relativity">principle of relativity</a> states no such thing.

<li>"In Einstein's theory of gravity, gravitational mass is assumed to be equal to inertial mass." -- This is not assumed, but instead is a consequence of the equivalence principle.</li>
<li>"The gravitational mass of any object is determined by its gravitational field" is false. Gravitational mass is determined by how an object responds to an external gravitational field. (Note that this refutes the related quantum-mechanics based argument.)</li>

<li>
<ul>
<li>Einstein's GR is not the same as SR. I specifically stated I was not using GR in that sense, and it is only the same on an abstract level. Even if you feel GR is not the same as SR, the general principle implicitly says they are. The article title is Relativity (consistent with the general principle). The article does not attempt to prove the general principle.</li>
<li>Inertial force is a valid term. Forces that accelerate objects to inertial motion or change such motion are implicitly inertial forces.</li>
<li>I added end article references to the general principle of relativity. Einstein and others have formulated it differently in different writings but they all say the same thing. Your statements about free fall and being at rest on the earth are true, but they are no principle.</li>
<li>The equivalence of gravitational mass and inertial mass was added to Einstein's GR theory. It did not follow from any formulated principle. As I remember, Einstein agonized some over adding it, because it was uncalled for.</li>
<li>Both statements regarding gravitational mass are correct. One does not refute the other. There is no action at a distance. Knowledge of gravitational mass is transmitted through the field</li>
</ul>
</li>

<dd>The article is about physics, not about ancient history. If I stated that the Sumerians started painting their pottery around 2250 BC, that fact would need to be verified. Experimental evidence about the physical world is generally known, especially to individuals who would read a Wikipedia article about relativity. Special relativity is well known. The general principle of relativity is stated differently in different places, but is fairly well known in the history of relativity. It is often cited as the key idea that led Einstein to begin work on developing a general theory of relativity. Perhaps I can provide better references to that, but I do not think that is what you are looking for. I think you do not perceptually grasp relativity, and you want a peer-reviewed journal to explain mathematically why a square peg will not fit into a round hole. There may not be many, but I think readers with a high perceptual intelligence will have much trouble understanding this article. You seem to feel that common sense of intelligent people is original research. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 03:20, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Danras, perhaps you should look over my user page. I am not afraid of looking stupid, and I actually *am* knowledgable in the topic. I have a PhD in physics, I studied general relativity, and some fair amount of geometry since then, and I thought that EMS summed things up just fine. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:33, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You should be smarter than me. I only have a B.S. in Physics. I went to graduate school for Physics, but dropped out after a year. One reason is I was being taught too much mathematics and too little about physical concepts. Mathematics would be fun as paid work for say, NASA, calculating rocket trajectories, but it is work. In general, I thought math was more of a trade skill, useful for the hired help. From outside reading, I knew about quarks, the color force, and related concepts such as asymptotic freedom, but there was never any mention of quarks. One time Steven Hawking came and gave a general lecture. After it, in the elevator, I mentioned to Dr. So-and-so, the Asst. Physics Dept. head, my admiration of Hawking's work on the thermodynamics of black holes. He thought that topic was too advanced. In addition, some of the instructors treated me and other students like children.</dd>

<dd>Since you accept EMS's reasoning, I have no problem calling you stupid. I would say it your face. Your PhD status does not mean anything to me, only whether your argument has merit. I find that many do not accept the dualistic reasoning implicit in relativity and quantum mechanics. For example in QM, light can act as a particle and as a wave. Some concretize the dualism and insist light is "really" one or the other. They will get into an argument about it. If you give an "it depends" answer, you are being purposely vague, and not answering the question. Mentally, "dummies" cannot keep track of two interpretations at the same time, and one can spot them when they insist on simple, singlistic, semi-classical interpretations. Other interpretations are heresy, or at least non-standard, because they allegedly imply the falsity of accepted interpretations. There is a threat of social ostracism for those who think dualistically, as such thinking confuses high status dummies within the science community.</dd>

<dd>Mike Peel, I don't think any amount of references can save this article from a delete. Don't even bother asking for them, because all that you will get is a cascade of justifications and defenses, each more time-consuming than the last. The article is just plain wrong. Lets delete it because its wrong, not because its unreferenced. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 00:40, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Linas, I ridicule you publicly. It is a particular pleasure, because you say you have a PhD in Physics. You are going to take the ridicule, because you are more afraid of appearing stupid if you defend yourself. However, maybe you will tire of being a sissy and I can provoke you into defending your position. You are like a retart that claps its flippers and says, "It's wrong." --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 17:55, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Danras, please read <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>. The manner in which you are addressing Linas could hardly be described as <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVILITY_dc24.html" title="WP:CIVILITY">civil</a>, either. The thing is, Danras, there really is no need to "defend the position of orthodoxy", because the thoughts put forward in the article don't really pose any threat to its logical integrity. This "symmetrical relativity", or whatever its current epithet is, is just a series of misconceptions and blurrings of meaning. I understand, Danras, that you are of the opinion that mathematics is not necessary to do physics. That is fine (although totally contrary to what physical science has been since Galileo). But, even if one is using words to describe physical theories, certain standards of rigor and proof must still be adhered to, and the article does none of that. And Linas, I think that deleting something because it's just plain wrong is a splendid idea. I wish there was more of that.</dd>
<dd>Also, Danras, please don't put headings using "=" signs into AfD discussions, because they play havoc with the format of other, unrelated discussions. <a href="../../../b/y/r/User%7EByrgenwulf_3ce3.html" title="User:Byrgenwulf">Byrgenwulf</a> 18:56, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My manner of addressing Linas is civil where I live in the United States. I realize that you live outside the U.S., and in your culture, people may feel a deep sense of shame at criticism, but I cannot help that. I have no problem with being addressed that way. The theory presented is Relativity (consistent with the general principle). Its absolute truth is not really an issue, only whether it is consistent with the general principle. Other Wikipedia articles reference the general principle, so the principle is generally accepted. I do not feel obliged to prove the general principle and its associated theory, although I present evidence (binary stars, etc.) which support the them. I do not berate the usefulness of mathematics, but the general principle is a physical concept, not a mathematical one. You state that there are misconceptions and blurrings of meanings in the article, but unless you articulate what you mean, one would be dubious to believe that you know what you are talking about. --<a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanras_e82e.html" title="User:Danras">Danras</a> 05:26, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I read the AFD in question and there are many comments that state that the article was not cited and that many of the selections were the personal choices of the editors. A quick reading of the AFD will demonstrate that being the case. This is not the case for this article and is a key difference between the two articles. This argument also goes against the peremise of your original argument because the deleted artice was not well sourced as the proposed anti-semetic article was said to be. This does not support you position because a badly sourced artilce deleted as POV cannot possibly prove that a well sourced aticle can be deleted for that reason. --Edgelord 19:14, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What would you call it? The current title doesn't claim the listed games are the best ever, just that soemone has said so. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 23:52, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>"Greatest ever" is very POV. "Most highly rated computer and video games" would be good. Or "Critically acclaimed computer and video games" would be just as good as it defines who's doing the claiming. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 18:24, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Critically acclaimed does a much better job of setting the standard out there from the start. I like it. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i> 03:05, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lots of games are critically acclaimed. Only a few have major publications call the the greatest game of all time. The list would be ten times the length and much less maintainable if it were critically acclaimed games. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 03:23, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But lot of magazines apparently publish "best games ever" lists. As long as the criteria are narrow (as suggested will happen in this AfD) it should be fine. It's very superlative and the title is ultimately untrue. Lists are bound to change and be updated when the best game since sliced cheese comes out. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 15:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, that's why this is a list of best games instead of good games. Unless the criteria were far tighter than the title implied, List of critically acclaimed games would have many hundreds of titles. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 22:28, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>You're playing semanics. Of course the criteria would be mentioned in the lead of the article. "Most highly rated computer and video games" does the same thing without getting your whole red-herring about loosening standards. And apparently the critria are pretty loose for the current article. There are many unsourced and poorly sourced entries. Someone needs to do some pruning. Also, wouldn't it be better to put titles together instead of the willy-nilly fashion that they're arranged in? Also Some of they claim to be "#1" or the "best" in issue #whatever of some redlinked magazine with no indication that the top ranking goes into perpetuity. How do we know that Redlink Gamers is not some <a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanzine.html" title="Fanzine">Fanzine</a> produced by Martha Snodgrass of Moosejaw, Canada? The notability standards really need to be enforced. --<a href="../../../k/u/n/User%7EKunzite_345b.html" title="User:Kunzite">Kunzite</a> 22:58, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>STRONG Keep</b> title is not POV, since "that have been considered" is not point of view. The arguement for deletion is specious at best, since there are few to no examples of games of "disputed" greatness.24.245.2.230 02:01, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> everything has a source and saying the game was chosen as the best ever could NOT possibly be considered POV.<a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBackInBlack_047c.html" title="User:BackInBlack">BackInBlack</a> 12:45, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Individual articles can link what the basic public thoughts about the game were, but I don't really think we need an article like this. Gaming does not have as much as an influence on the media as other mediums (such as film), so it's not as widespread and we're going to end up getting far too many games to consider.--Mythi 05:32, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Two problems with this argument. First, the article requires verifiable sources so that means that only certain sites can be included. By not using small blogs etc this helps keep the number of games on the list down. I also strongly against the nom manistream agrument for several reasons. First, games have become much more popular over the years and as mentioned earlier a similar article about worst games has passed 3 AFD attempts. This shows to me that people consider video game lists important enough and mainstream enough to be on wikipedia. --Edgelord 19:03, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> per earlier reasons. Note that this article isn't POV. POV in Wikipedia *doesn't* mean that an article favors certain views over others. Wikipedia official policy in fact is preference for the majority view over the minority view so long as the minority view receives decent coverage, if the minority is vocal. In other words, what I'm trying to say is, for those of you who complain blah blah blah, go make another page labeled "Computer and video games that have been considered underdogs" or something. I'd contribute to that. -- <a href="../../../s/o/l/User%7ESolberg_69b8.html" title="User:Solberg">Solberg</a> 08:40, 7 August 2006 (UTC)Solberg</li>

<dd>No it's not. The first few sentences are facts. Look up the policy if you don't remember. The last bit follows because there should be a "vocal minority" view as stated earlier.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. I don't think the article promotes any particular POV, and every inclusion appears to have been from some article or poll or another. I think that it would benefit from some links to online poll results or citing specific magazine issues/articles, though. -- <a href="../../../s/t/u/User%7EStubblyhead_0a29.html" title="User:Stubblyhead">stubblyh</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">ea</font></a><a href="../../../r/a/n/Special%7ERandom_5382.html" title="Special:Random">d</a> | <sup><a href="../../../s/t/u/User_talk%7EStubblyhead_555f.html" title="User talk:Stubblyhead">T</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_stubblyhead_ad64.html" title="Special:Contributions/stubblyhead">c</a></sub> 16:55, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This article is in parallel with <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever.html" title="List of films that have been considered the greatest ever">List_of_films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever</a>, and uses the same criteria: best-selling (cf highest-grossing) and top lists by prominent magazines and other media (cf critically-acclaimed). If there are POV elements, then they absolutely should be cleaned up, but deleting the page is out of the question, unless the films article be deleted as well. --<a href="../../../c/e/v/User%7ECevlakohn_ab8f.html" title="User:Cevlakohn">Cevlakohn</a> 8 August 2006</li>

<dd><b>Comment (Keep)</b> Wow I randomly ran into this article, and some of these comments are interesting. Anyone here that claims to actually be part of the web community and hasn't heard of him is obviously not a real webmaster or he/she doesnt frequent the main forums. It's kind of hard not to hear about him, because sometimes he gets annoying on forums showing off his profile of sites etc. Although I personally dont like the guy myself, he is an actual webmaster, not like the 90% of kiddies that have a site or 2 and think they're webmasters.Sorry I cant login, I'm at a library and wikipedia wont log me in! 17:05, 10 August 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.7.253.254 (<a href="../../../2/1/6/User_talk%7E216.7.253.254.html" title="User talk:216.7.253.254">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.7.253.254_021c.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.7.253.254">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> precedent isn't binding in AfD. Wether or not it is notable should be decided on a case by case basis, not as a blanket assumption. Consider what wikipedia would be like under the "every high school is notable for being a high school" policy. With every single school accross the english speaking world having their own article. Thousands of articles that are utterly useless to everyone except those in the immediate area. Wikipedia would be one big education guide. Yes, I understand the argument that we spend a large amount of our lives in there but why does that make them notable? We also spend a large amount of our time sitting on the toilet in our house - do you think that makes it notable enough to write an article about? (extreme example obviously, if you try and pick holes in the arguement soley because of this example you don't have a leg to stand on) Some schools are notable, as a melbourne example the big private schools that everyone knows about are notable ie. <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scotch_College%2C_Melbourne_54a1.html" title="Scotch College, Melbourne">Scotch College, Melbourne</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne_Grammar_School_f74f.html" title="Melbourne Grammar School">Melbourne Grammar School</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Methodist_Ladies%27_College%2C_Melbourne_7118.html" title="Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne">Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne</a> and <a href="../../../t/r/i/Trinity_Grammar_School%2C_Victoria_aad8.html" title="Trinity Grammar School, Victoria">Trinity Grammar School, Victoria</a>.

<li>An article on Melbourne public toilets would indeed be a good thing, as a number of them are certainly of more than passing historical interest - however public hygiene facilities are of much less significance than schools, which are funded to the order of many millions of dollars, over many dozens of years, employ hundreds of staff, and impact large slabs of the lives of whole communities of people across many generations. --<a href="../../../c/e/n/User%7ECentauri_69b9.html" title="User:Centauri">Centauri</a> 11:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Schools and the education system are notable indeed. But like the few public toilets of historic interest, only a small subset of schools are notable on their own. So what is it about schools that makes them inherantly notable? The majority of school articles contain unverfied (and possibly unverifiable for wikipedias purposes, discounting <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>) information about the number of classrooms the names of many of the teachers and the students favourite after-school activities or other random, uninteresting, non-notable and often un-verifiable facts about the school. <a href="../../../v/i/r/User%7EViridae_a0d4.html" title="User:Viridae">Viridae</a><a href="../../../v/i/r/User_talk%7EViridae_b84f.html" title="User talk:Viridae"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 12:15, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

On the Italian article there isn't much more information, just where she studied, what languages she knew and a paragraph about the process following her and Miran Hrovatin's death. I saw the film about them (<i>Ilaria Alpi - Il più crudele dei giorni</i>, "<i>Ilaria Alpi - the most cruel day</i>") about two years ago and their story really fascinated me.

<li><b>Comment</b> Ok, can someone clear this up for me? I cleaned up the article to read less like an advertisement and more like simple information, but I want to know if this isn't good enough. If somewhere in the Wikipedia rules it clearly states that unless a band is momentus and signed to a large label it's viable to be on Wikipedia, then I want to know about it. Otherwise, what exactly is the issue? The EP will be released soon, I truly believe that at least a few people in Australia will be interested about the release date and content of the cd itself - regardless of whether we're signed or not.

<li><b>Comment</b> Alright, I've read the page on notability for music, and have found something that we definitely come under. 'Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city' - Test Theory is not only the only hard rock / screamo band in Darwin, the capital city of the Northern Territory - but the entire Territory. We are literally the only band playing this type of music, and are trying our hardest to build up the Northern scene enough to support more bands like us. What proof do I need to show the admins that we are the most prominent representation of our genre in our city? --Testtheory 05:38, 9 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The purpose of a list is to supply additional information beyond simply names. This list will do that. It is currently underpopulated because I am going through the effort of verifying the name of every individual added to this list, as well as others, as per wikipedia guidelines. Also, as the list grows, it will be clearly obvious that it could NOT be added to the San Francisco page without making that page itself unbearably huge. And, yes, the proposer of this deletion did make the exact same comments earlier. Evidently, s/he did not read the reply I posted then, which contained substantially the same information as this statement. MAYBE he will now.

The poster states that he himself has only been on wikipedia for approximately a month.

<li><b>Keep</b>, expand, and reorganize. As a purely alphabetical list, it would be redundant to a category on the same topic. However, if expanded so that each entry in the list explains what the individual's connection is to the locality, and organized in a meaningful manner, there is no redundancy; see <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_associated_with_Albany_County%2C_New_York_4646.html" title="List of people associated with Albany County, New York">List of people associated with Albany County, New York</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_associated_with_Columbus%2C_Ohio_b1c9.html" title="List of people associated with Columbus, Ohio">List of people associated with Columbus, Ohio</a> for my attempts at this. If all you have is a locality category, you have people who were born in a city but left it as a young child lumped in indiscriminately with people whose very reason for having an article is strongly tied to that city. Also, organizing chronologically helps turn the list into a history of the people of a place rather than a mere list of trivia or local vanity. <a href="../../../p/o/s/User%7EPostdlf_dca8.html" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> 16:29, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. This isn't a particularly good list of people from a city, but that's for the editors to improve. There are many lists like these on several city pages, and they need to stay on their own page, otherwise the city pages will get too long. Its not like people are going to be able to click on to a category of people from San Francisco on the main San Fran page, because it wouldn't apply to the city, nor could they type in "List of people from San Francisco" in the search and find the information they wanted if it was a category. If they wanted a category they would have to track it down from a notable resident or something. For ease of information, a separate page linked to the main one is preferable. <a href="../../../v/e/r/User%7EVertigo700_7fa2.html" title="User:Vertigo700">Vertigo700</a> 16:36, 7 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, lists of notable residents are a common feature of city pages on wikipedia. for larger cities, which tend to have a larger number of notable residents, it makes sense for organizational reasons to make such lists seperate articles.

None of which have previously existed in Tenerife before." This statement does not establish any substantial notability beyond that of thousands of other restaurants. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottW_8f9d.html" title="User:ScottW">ScottW</a> 22:42, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am the originator of this article. Notability is a really tricky one and certainly subjective. So what makes a restaurant notable?</p>
<p>On Tenerife, an island that I trust both the proponents for this article’s deletion have visited in some capacity, the food hadn’t changed for 500 years until the arrival of Northern European Tourists in the 1970s. Unfortunately for the island these tourists were not interested in local issues and only wanted what they knew, so within 20 years the food became Fish &amp; Chips washed down with lots of beer…</p>
<p>While some of the better hotels have attempted to provide a better experience it is still true to say that the food, the dining experience and design of Restaurante Los Roques is quite unlike any other restaurant on Tenerife and is most certainly notable for this. Just ask their customers. I’m one of them.</p>
<p>I’m also a little concerned about the whole issue of notability. This in my mind is the same as editorial policy. A task that really should be left to trained editors who would have to spend quite some time investigating issues such as these.</p>
<p>Has ScottW been to Tenerife? Visited several restaurants to judge our statements? Or has he in fact spent a couple of minutes sitting at a desk making a snap decision based on content found on the internet.</p>
<p>Is this really how Wiki intends to police its content? Because it will not be long before the content of Wiki represents a rather blinkered and self referential view of the world.</p>
<p>No need to mention the comment from Dlyons493, they obviously haven’t visited Tenerife. Potatoes are food aren’t they?</p>

<p>I prodded this earlier with the reason "Advertisement for non-notable software." and the prod was removed with the reasoning "There is no basis for judging this software non-notable. Has this commentor used the software?" The article doesn't establish notability, the term gogroups gets 41 unique google hits, of which I could tell that 3 were about this, which really isn't good for a piece of software. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 23:56, 3 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. Looks like article written by the product's creator. Most of the google hits do not refer to the software.
