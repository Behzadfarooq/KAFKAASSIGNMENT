<p><a href="../../../b/t/b/User%7EBtball_6537.html" title="User:Btball">Brian</a> 14:30, 9 August 2006 (UTC)btball Educator, George Counts (1932) had the audacity to ask of his fellow teachers, "Dare the school build a new social order?" For Counts, the answer was complex but definitely affirmative. Only through schooling could youth be educated for a life in a world transformed by massive changes in science, industry, and technology. The educational community for Counts (1933) "cannot evade the responsibility of participating actively in the task of reconstituting the democratic tradition and of thus working positively toward a new society."</p>

The Buddhist Temple of Chicago was founded as the Chicago Buddhist Church (CBC), October 8, 1944 by Rev. Gyomay M. Kubose (1905-2000) and mostly Nisei people in their 20's who had settled in Chicago towards the end of WWII. Rev. Kubose had been interned at Hart Mountain wartime relocation camp in Wyoming.
<p>The first location of the CBC was on the south side of Chicago. However, in the mid-1950's, so-called Urban Renewal of the neighborhood forced the demolition of the building the congregation occupied.</p>
<p>The congregation acquired a former Presbyterian church at 1151 W. Leland in the north side Uptown neighborhood. The building was being used as a warehouse by the Goldblatt department store across the street.</p>
<p>This structure and serveral neighboring buildings housed a thriving community, with the new name of the Buddhist Temple of Chicago (BTC), that welcomed all people, while maintaining its connections to the customs and traditions of Japan and Americans of Japanese descent.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2005 (Hanamatsuri), after many years of debating the pros and cons of renovating the existing building, moving to another location or building new, the BTC congregation bade farewell to its old building, which was demolished that summer and broke ground at the same address for its new temple.</p>
<p>The new building had its first service April 2, 2006 (Hanamatsuri) with the official dedication on May 21, 2006.</p>
<p>The current building was designed with a great degree of sensitivity to the religious, social, cultural and budgetary concerns of the community by Parallel Architecture, with Scott Prestangen and Tiffany Danielle as the principals. The design incorporates a hexagonal hondo (本堂) fashioned in tribute to the Rokkakudo built by Prince Shotoku in Kyoto. The Rokkakudo is significant to BTC for its connection to Shinran Shonin's (1173-1263) vow to spend 100 nights in that temple until he discovered his path to awakening. However on the 95th night, he had a dream about Prince Shotoku that led him to leave the Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei and become a follower of another former Tendai monk, Honen Shonin.</p>
<p>BTC derives its lineage from the Jodo Shinshu tradition and the modern revival sparked by Rev. Manshi Kiyozawa (1863-1903) and his students. Rev. Haya Akegarasu (1877-1954) was one of his students and the teacher of Rev. Kubose and of the second head minister Rev. Gyoko Saito (1927-2001). Rev. Ryojin Soga was another student of Rev. Kiyozawa and was the teacher of BTC's current head minister, Rev. Yukei Ashikaga, who joined the congregation in 1959 and became head minister in 1981.</p>
<p>Although BTC has lineage connections to Otani-ha Honganji (Higashi Honganji), BTC is administratively independent and has developed its presentation of Mahayana teachings in a way that accommodates Americans who may or may not have connections to Japan and/or to Buddhism, while respecting the lineage that reaches back to Buddha Shakyamuni through the seven Pure Land Masters.</p>

WLGN is now called "The Bull" after it was bought by Big River Radio Stations in late 2004-early 2005. WLGN is a "manless" radio station, which means everything is pre-recorded. Prior to 2005, one of the most popular radio show this station broadcasted was "Child Of The Sixties" hosted by Chuck Anthony. The show went off the air in early 2005. WLGN currently plays todays current country music hits, as well as a couple of local church services, one including the longest running show in Southeastern Ohio (St. Matthew Luthern Church at 10:15 AM).</p>

Essentially, FCP is the glue protocol to operate SCSI on top of a <a href="../../../f/i/b/Fibre_Channel_5c9c.html" title="Fibre Channel">Fibre Channel</a> transport. The main benefit is that zLinux and z/VM users can interoperate with industry standard SCSI storage. This is contrary to Ficon, which is used to communicate with ECKD storage, and is only used with mainframes.</p>
<p>zSeries FCP channels use the same hardware as FICON channels. The channel type is specified in the I/O Configuration Data Set (IOCDS).</p>

Ikona, the band.</p>
<p>The band "Ikona" was created in 2004 in Peja KOSOVO, playing covers and jamming in bars. At first the band had a female singer, bass player, guitar player and a drum player. After a year the band split up, and the control of the band took the guitar player together with the drum player. Now "Ikona" is: Kreshnik Tahirbegolli - vocals and guitar Lavdim Beqiri - drumms</p>
<p>The band is now recording early materials since 90's and are preparing an album influenced in ROCK and GRUNGE. The band is seeking to find more members to join but, Peja (KOSOVO) is a small city and the there are no so much instrumentalist available. Even though a big number of them are more concetrated in POP and FOLK commercialised music.</p>

Dear Tomananda:</p>
<p>Falun Gong practitioners respect Jesus Christ. I hope that you could have more respect for Mr. Li and Falun Gong because people with different beliefs need to respect each other, and because Falun Gong practitioners are the most peaceful group of people in the world. Despite the brutality of the persecution, they have been peacefully raising awareness worldwide.</p>
<p>The organ harvesting is true. About a week ago, I called the Urinary Surgery Department, Huaxi Hospital of Chengdu City, China. I asked a doctor over the phone if he knew that most of the organs that they used for transplantations were from live Falun Gong practitioners. He answered loudly (and blatantly), "I know, I know." Then, he started to call my names. In the end, he yelled at me, "Crawl away and die!"</p>
<p>My 28-year-old brother-in-law died in a Chinese labor camp in Nov. 2000 because he refused to give up his belief in Truth-Compassion-Forbearance. My sister was abducted by local police in China in Feb. 2000 for exposing the persecution done to the family, and has been missing. One of my neighbours was sentenced to forced labor for his belief in Falun Gong. According to conservative statistics, the Chinese Communist Regime has killed 60-80 million Chinese over the past 57 years of rule over China, one campaign following another targeting various groups of innocent people,making up lies about them and forcing the whole nation to participate in the persecution. For more details, please refer to the award-winning "Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party" (<a href="http://ninecommentaries.com/" class="external free" title="http://ninecommentaries.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ninecommentaries.com/</a>). Christians have also been persecuted in China. According to New York based "Committee to Investigate Persecution of Religions in China", at least 10,000 underground Christians died in Chinese police custody in the past 30 years. (<a href="http://clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2003/3/21/33576p.html" class="external free" title="http://clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2003/3/21/33576p.html" rel="nofollow">http://clearwisdom.net/emh/articles/2003/3/21/33576p.html</a>) Those who do not register with the official Patriotic Christianity is considered to be belong to underground churches, and thus, is practicing cults. By registering with Patriotic Christianity, one must agree to follow orders of the Communist Party, which promotes atheism.</p>
<p>About the health benefits, I personally know a few people in Canada who have been cured of medically incurable illnesses. A Vancouver practitioner named Sue Zhang once had Chronic Fatigue, and another Vancouver practitioner was bleeding most of the time of the year due to benign tumors in her uterus. Neither of them could work normally in the past. They are all very healthy today. So they are very thankful for Falun Gong. Sue Zhang, a senior technician at Simon Fraser University, can provide you with a copy of her Canadian medical record if needed. I studied medicine in China, and have investigated into the health benefits by talking to Falun Gong practitioners about their experiences. I read various religious scriptures, and found Falun Gong the most peaceful and benevolent belief. So I wish that you could respect Master Li and Falun Gong practitioners. I also hope that you could read Falun Gong books thoroughly, with open-mindedness, and without being influenced by the propaganda of a serial killer - the Chinese Communist Regime. If you can read with a good and pure heart, you will understand what Falun Gong is about and benefit from the reading.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>A speech on the subject of masturbation delivered by Mark Twain to the Stomach Club, Paris, 1879</p>
<p>"Some Thoughts on the Science of Onanism"</p>
<p>My gifted predecessor has warned you against the "social evil --- adultery." In his able paper he exhausted that subject; he left absolutely nothing more to be said on it. But I will continue his good work in the cause of morality by cautioning you against that species of recreation called self-abuse to which I perceive you are much addicted. All great writers on health and morals, both ancient and modern, have struggled with this stately subject; this shows its dignity and importance. Some of these writers have taken one side, some the other.</p>
<p>Homer, in the second book of the Iliad says with fine enthusiasm, "Give me masturbation or give me death." Caesar, in his Commentaries, says, "To the lonely it is company; to the forsaken it is a friend; to the aged and to the impotent it is a benefactor. They that are penniless are yet rich, in that they still have this majestic diversion." In another place this experienced observer has said, "There are times when I prefer it to sodomy."</p>
<p>Robinson Crusoe says, "I cannot describe what I owe to this gentle art." Queen Elizabeth said, "It is the bulwark of virginity." Cetewayo, the Zulu hero, remarked, "A jerk in the hand is worth two in the bush." The immortal Franklin has said, "Masturbation is the best policy."</p>
<p>Michelangelo and all of the other old masters--"old masters," I will remark, is an abbreviation, a contraction --- have used similar language. Michelangelo said to Pope Julius II, "Self-negation is noble, self-culture beneficent, self-possession is manly, but to the truly great and inspiring soul they are poor and tame compared with self-abuse." Mr. Brown, here, in one of his latest and most graceful poems, refers to it in an eloquent line which is destined to live to the end of time--"None knows it but to love it; none name it but to praise."</p>
<p>Such are the utterances of the most illustrious of the masters of this renowned science, and apologists for it. The name of those who decry it and oppose it is legion; they have made strong arguments and uttered bitter speeches against it --- but there is not room to repeat them here in much detail. Brigham Young, an expert of incontestable authority, said, "As compared with the other thing, it is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning." Solomon said, "There is nothing to recommend it but its cheapness." Galen said, "It is shameful to degrade to such bestial uses that grand limb, that formidable member, which we votaries of Science dub the Major Maxillary --- when they dub it at all --- which is seldom, It would be better to amputate the os frontis than to put it to such use."</p>
<p>The great statistician Smith, in his report to Parliament, says, "In my opinion, more children have been wasted in this way than any other." It cannot be denied that the high antiquity of this art entitles it to our respect; but at the same time, I think its harmfulness demands our condemnation. Mr. Darwin was grieved to feel obliged to give up his theory that the monkey was the connecting link between man and the lower animals. I think he was too hasty. The monkey is the only animal, except man, that practices this science; hence, he is our brother; there is a bond of sympathy and relationship between us. Give this ingenuous animal an audience of the proper kind and he will straightway put aside his other affairs and take a whet; and you will see by his contortions and his ecstatic expression that he takes an intelligent and human interest in his performance.</p>
<p>The signs of excessive indulgence in this destructive pastime are easily detectable. They are these: a disposition to eat, to drink, to smoke, to meet together convivially, to laugh, to joke and tell indelicate stories--and mainly, a yearning to paint pictures. The results of the habit are: loss of memory, loss of virility, loss of cheerfulness and loss of progeny.</p>
<p>Of all the various kinds of sexual intercourse, this has the least to recommend it. As an amusement, it is too fleeting; as an occupation, it is too wearing; as a public exhibition, there is no money in it. It is unsuited to the drawing room, and in the most cultured society it has long been banished from the social board. It has at last, in our day of progress and improvement, been degraded to brotherhood with flatulence. Among the best bred, these two arts are now indulged only in private --- though by consent of the whole company, when only males are present, it is still permissible, in good society, to remove the embargo on the fundamental sigh.</p>
<p>My illustrious predecessor has taught you that all forms of the "social evil" are bad. I would teach you that some of these forms are more to be avoided than others. So, in concluding, I say, "If you must gamble your lives sexually, don't play a lone hand too much." When you feel a revolutionary uprising in your system, get your Vendome Column down some other way --- don't jerk it down.</p>

Cameron Gilchrist famous for many many things. Arguably the greatest football player of all time. A certain World Player of the Year Brazilian star Ronaldinho said in an interview recentley with english paper "The Sun" "I really dont have anything on this incredible talent, without quetion he is the man". "People ask wether i have helped him out, you know given him any tips but to be honest when i met him he was the teacher and i was the very naive student in awe of his "God" like presence, he certainly taught me a thing or two". The young midfielder currently plies his trade with the Stirling Lions 19's Premier team after moving from Wembley Downs one and a half season ago in a big money transfer. Many beleive it is just a matter of time before he is captaning Manchester United and going down in history as the Greatest. Only time will tell...</p>

Long serving immigrant ship used to transport mainly Dutch citizens. I know that it started serving this role as early as 1948, transporting immigrants from The Netherlands to Halifax, Canada but may have served the role at an earlier time.</p>

<p>Panorex is a trademark name for a panoramic mandible xray. This allows dentist and oral surgeons to view all available teeth on one film and provide an accurate evaluation. This type of dental imaging is often used to determine whether the third molars (wisdom teeth) are not properly erupted/aligned, determining the need for extraction.</p>

Jeff Hunter was the man that started totse.com. He is regarded as a hero to many posters and even as a god by some. His identity is hidden from totse members and no one has apparently met him in person. The only real contact anyone has with him is email.</p>

Thomas and the Twins is the 33rd book in The Railway Series. It was written by Christopher Awdry and illustrated by Clive Spong.</p>
<p>Scrambled Eggs</p>
<p>Thomas is told that a bridge on the Branch Line is in need of repairs. As he is too heavy to be able to cross it safely, he is sent to Edward's Branch Line. When he arrives, Bill and Ben tease him until Edward sends them away to collect trucks. Later that day, a truck breaks down on a crossing on the Branch Line. Thomas, who is taking trucks down the line, smashes into it and gets covered in eggs, much to his dismay. When he returns to the yard, Bill and Ben continue teasing him.</p>
<p>What A Picture!</p>
<p>Edward manages to stop Bill and Ben teasing Thomas with the threat of not been seen by a party of railway enthusiasts. Bill and Ben are eager to be seen, even asking their crew to give them extra polishes. When the day comes, the enthusiasts fawn over the twins, until a shunter comes to ask Ben to help bring in a grounded ship. An enthusiast stays to takes pictures, but, as he is about to take his last one, Bill gives off a cloud of steam!</p>
<p>Trevor Helps Out</p>
<p>Trevor is sent to pull away a tree that was blown down near the line. As he works, Edward passes with some trucks, noting that the rails feel bumpy. As he returns that afternoon, he forgets about the line and goes over it, leaving the Guard's van behind. Trevor alerts Edward, who returns to couple the van back. Later that evening, the Fat Controller comes to Trevor's shed and offers him a repair at the Works, which Trevor accepts.</p>

<p>Month of May was formed back in August 2005 as a pop-punk band titled Dislocated Kate. It was a three piece, Jeff Ryan on bass and vocals, his brother John Ryan on drums, and Jason Moriarty on guitar. Due to conflict between John and the rest of the band only one song was ever completed. Desperate for a band of some kind, Jason came up with a new name, Month of May (or M.O.M.). Along with a new drummer; Alex Grabert, and guitarist; Adam Vasellina, Month of May finally had a working line-up. They are currently in the writing stage of their debut album, Shotguns and Romantics, which is scheduled for release in September, 2006.</p>

<p>This hardcore band from West Chester, Pennsylvania was founded in 1988 and continued with various lineup changes until 1996. In 1990, Edgewise released its first EP, "Silent Rage", on legendary Smorgasboard records, featuring Al Spina on vocals, Darren Saxton on guitar, Vince Spina on bass, and Jack Collins on drums. Influenced by bands like Cro-Mags, Youth of Today, and Black Sabbath, they combined screaming vocals with metal riffs to produce a unique hardcore sound. Shortly before release, Vince Spina moved to lead guitar and Matt Tincani joined on bass.</p>
<p>The Release of "Silent Rage" was followed by a tour of the eastern US in 1990 playing with notable hardcore bands including Turning Point, Judge, Integrity, Endpoint, and commercial punk rock legends Green Day. They played in clubs ranging from the Zodiac, the Unisound and Lost Horizon to Victory Records owned Club Blitz.</p>
<p>In late 1990 Edgewise returned to Why Me? Recording (Starkweather, Turmoil, Brody, Turning Point) to cut some tracks for compilations. Tolerance was featured on the genre defining East Coast Assault Vol. 1 on the Chord Magazine/Too Damn Hype Label.</p>
<p>In 1991, Edgewise embarked on a second tour this time heading across the country and playing shows with Lifetime, UpFront, Earth Crisis, Strife, and 411. Returning to Clubs like The Lost Horizon in Syracuse, NY but also hitting all agaes hardcore shows at the legendary Gilman St. Warehouse and Spanky's Cafe for a hardcore fest.</p>
<p>In 1993, Edgewise released its first full length LP, "Massacre of the Innocents", on Vince Spina's label, Harvest Records. Guitar player Darren Saxton and Drummer Jack Collins left the band prior to recording "Massacre of the Innocents", which featured a new drummer, Derek Wilson. Edgewise embraced a more guitar-focused, commercial sound for the album, whose guitar solos and layered tracks departed from the band's earlier style. Edgewise played only a handful of shows to support "Massacre of the Innocents", and the band was defunct soon thereafter.</p>
<p><br />
A new opportunity came in 1995, when European label Gain Ground offered to re-release the "Silent Rage" EP, and to release the band's second full length album. Edgewise reformed with former drummer Jack Collins on vocals, Vince Spina and Darren Saxton on guitars, Matt Tincani on bass, and Turning Point's Ken Flavell on drums. Their second, self-titled LP released in 1996 was perhaps Edgewise's best work, featuring a dark, metal-edged sound with brutal guitars and relentless vocals. During this period, the band also released songs on two compilations, including “The World Still Won't Listen: A Tribute to the Smiths" on Too Damn Hype/Chord Records and AngelFace on the 10 Years Later Comp featuring AFI, Rancid, Down By Law, and Seven Seconds. Edgewise was also featured on the Victory Records Area 51 comp and were in negotiations with the label for a contract.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the band’s second full length album was also poorly distributed, and Edgewise played only one show in West Chester Pennsylvania after its release. That was the band's last show.</p>
<p><br />
In 2003, Edgewise was revived when Thorp Records released a "Complete Discography" of recordings as part of its "Unsung Heroes" series. This album, featuring 28 tracks, pays tribute the band's cutting edge sound and contribution to the history of hardcore. The album has received favorable reviews from Aversion.com, Geekburger.com and is carried at VH1.com/MTV.com and VirginMegaStores.com in the UK.</p>

<p>John Page of Fender’s custom shop designed the Fender Bullet in response to the Fender production teams' call for the lowest possible cost production of an entry level guitar.They held the production costs to a minimum by making a pickguard from sturdy powder coated aircraft grade aluminum that incorporated the tailpiece right into the design. No routing was required for the body except for the pickups,pots and 3-way switch cavity. Manufacturing was a breeze as you just dropped the pickguard assembly right into the guitar body and screwed it down and bolted the tuner ready Tele-inspired neck on. No chrome plating, polishing, or beveling of the of stamped metal pickguard was required. June of 1981 introduced the Fender Bullet for less than $200. The pickups were leftover Fender Mustang models as 1981 saw that model discontinued as well as 3-bolt neck plates with the micro-tilt. They were now replaced with the old Fender 4 bolt pattern design. The first 6 months all guitars were made offshore in Korea. They were the first models to be made outside of the USA but over 50% of the costs were American incurred as well as being assembled at the CBS owned Fender plant in Fullerton California. So they were, and still remain, considered to be “Made In USA” as the logo states. The Fender decal was on top of the headstock finish as in older Fender guitars. After six months time passed Fender Bullets were manufactured “in house” at the Fender facilities by that late December and changes were now being added. Walnut wood strips that once were placed into the truss rod slots were now replaced by ones made from maple wood. By removing the pickguard and looking to see if the body is a low grade mahogany wood "Lauan" ply reveals it is a Korean made neck and body model.A great deal of those never-the-less were dressed and finished at Fender’s Fullerton California plant. Original Bullets also used plain plastic molded Stratocaster knobs with no painted lettering. The headstock logo coincided with the design for the Fender ad campaign that went…”#1 with a Bullet“,in reference to climbing the top one hundred musical chart of Billboard.The Fender Bullet is a re-shaped Mustang without tremolo or phase switching.The best Bullets are the first USA “stage two” ones that were made in late December of 1981 throughout ’82 &amp; ‘83. In 1983 the Fender Bullet Deluxe guitar and the Fender Bullet S-3 guitar models were economy Stratocasters. With their chrome tremolo bridges and parts and plastic beveled pickguards it made the costs too high to keep them in production so the Fender Bullet guitar got priced out. The original no frills Fender Bullet used all existing tooling already in operation at Fender except for a new pickguard / bridge die and the manufacturing of the bridge pieces. From an engineering point of view that was quite a reasonable feat. Contrary to expert observations, those very first models that ran from June 1981 to early December 1981 however are some of the most sought after ones despite their being made overseas. Because the necks and bodies were historically made for Fender for the first time outside of Fullerton California being imported in from Korea but mostly finished ,dressed and assembled at the Fullerton plant at a very limited run of 6 months makes those issues very rare birds. If you own one that is from the Fender Fullerton plant that is the same design as those Korean ones, then they too are even rarer and worth much more as later changes to the pickguard changed over to it being plastic and the tailpiece was a bolt - on to the body design.. Despite what you perhaps may have once read in guitar publications or where told by a “guitar collector”, these are great guitars and are catching on because of their unique R&amp;B tone and sound. That is attributed to the guitar’s unique metal bridge design and those distinct Mustang pickups’ response combined with the reality of a low supply and increasingly growing demand for them.Odds are you may never see one except on ebay as they are few and far between seldom seen. Many people have taken them apart and made “Frankencasters “ or exchanged the pickups or repainted them or used Telecaster bodies to upgrade them and re-decaled the headstocks and such ,so to find one original is becoming increasingly less eventful as twenty - five years have slipped by since it was introduced. It was not intended necessarily for children as it is a true 25 ½ scale.John Page’s non contoured telecaster styled body is unique to the Fender Bullet. John Page left his Page Guitar Works to become a guitar designer in Fender Research and Development with Fender legend Freddie Tavares and he was co-founder of Fender ‘s Custom Shop with Michael Stevens and managed it until 1998.He then started the Fender Museum of Music &amp; The Arts. He is starting again into building guitars after semi-retiring from that expertise. He will always be famous for the Fender Bullet he gave us. At the time it was introduced in 1981, it was a bare of frills guitar offered by the cost cutting CBS owned Fender guitar company. Now it is a much desired plain Jane in the world of super hyped guitars. It’s Telecaster momma will suddenly seem elegant in comparisons. They’re great bare knuckled American guitars from a company that was in transitions galore that year. It was more bang for your bucks and a genius design of less is more.</p>

The National Association of Guardsmen is an elite African American social organization that includes some of Americas most weathy and influential African Amerficans. Founded in Brooklyn 1933, the organization was a means for social fellowship and networking between Americas growing upper middle class segment. Its members were college graduates from historically black intitutions: Howard, Lincoln and Morgan State University. They sought to build an organization that would allow blacks of similar common interests to enjoy each others company and host gatherings. The organization has since grown across the country and has over 10 chapters nationwide.</p>
<p>Its sole purpose is social fellowship and networking. Membership is highly competitive and those who seek membership must have high credentials, not to mention a very big bank account. The organization contains businessmen, doctors, politicians, lawyers and other esteemed professions. Not only do these men have these jobs, but they are at the top of their fields as well.</p>

<p>Blinge 9 is one of the most original and authentic acts to come along since San Diego’s Crash Worship. Blinge 9 is the brain child of producer, filmmaker, and composer John Parker, and Guitar player Ronnie Thompson. Combining elements of hip hop, rap, metal, noise, and jazz, and abstract film to form a sonic and visual experience that is never the same twice. All Blinge 9 shows feature musical compositions performed live to a backdrop of avant-garde films from John Parker. Along with this stunning visual and audio aspect is the mind blowing element of incredibly well composed pop songs such as Smile, Airfall, and The End. which are also featured prominently in the live shows. Blinge 9 literally brings you the best of both worlds: Cutting edge avant-garde music and film, and radio friendly alternative rock songs. Blinge 9 is Similar in authenticity (as opposed to content) to the famous San Diego underground band Crash Worship. Crash Worship uses fire, water, and infectious tribal rhythm’s in their one of a kind live shows, that personally involve the audience in a way never seen before or since. Blinge 9 and Crash Worship are probably the two most truly authentic and truly original act playing in today’s underground music and art scene.</p>
