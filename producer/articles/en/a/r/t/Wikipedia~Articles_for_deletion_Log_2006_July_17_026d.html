<li>Lists are acceptable if they fulfil the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7EList_98bd.html" title="Wikipedia:List">purpose of lists</a>. This list's purpose is to be the companion to <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_computer_viruses.html" title="List of computer viruses">list of computer viruses</a> (as per <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Malware_4997.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Malware">Wikipedia:WikiProject Malware</a>), and is clearly to be an informational list. The scope of the list (see <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html#Appropriate_topics_for_lists" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)#Appropriate_topics_for_lists</a>) is neither too narrow nor too broad, given that the set of computer virus hoaxes is finite and small but not minuscule; and the list is easily sourced from sources such as <a href="http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/threatexplorer/risks/hoaxes.jsp" class="external text" title="http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/security_response/threatexplorer/risks/hoaxes.jsp" rel="nofollow">this one</a> and <a href="http://vil.mcafee.com/hoax.asp" class="external text" title="http://vil.mcafee.com/hoax.asp" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, thereby eliminating original research. That the article comprises temptation to write lots of perpetual-stub sub-articles is a reason to <i>de-link the names on the list</i>, not a reason to delete the article. Indeed, those titles should be redirects to this list. <b>Keep</b>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:38, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as a random and unhelpful list. It's main purpose would be to aid research into computer virus hoaxes, yet putting "computer virus hoaxes" into Google returns more helpful material.

<li><b>Keep</b> per the rationale given by Uncle G.

<dd><b>Comment</b> - Apples, oranges. There is speculative info for 2014, but the bidding process has already began, at least unofficially, and because of the continental rotation system, it's narrowed down to a few number of candidates. 2018 is far in the future but there is already debate over whether this will be part of the continental rotation. There's no such substantial discussion for 2022 and beyond. Also, the "if you don't like it, don't read it" doesn't work for me. If Wikipedia is filled with trivial and/or speculative information, it devalues the whole project as an encyclopedia.

<dd><b>Comment to the above Comment</b> Surely, there is no such SUBSTANTIAL discussion but THERE IS a discussion going on already. This aricle quotes such officials as the FFA President, for example, so you can't call it just a speculation if it comes from such a high-ranking official. And besides, there was a discussion to move the 2010 WC from South Africa to USA in case the South Arficans won't fix all problems on time, so you might as well delete "the 2010 FIFA World Cup" article until 2010. There is an alricle in Wikipedia called "the 2024 Summer Olympics", for example, and nobody has any problem with it whatsoever, so what's the problem with "the 2022 World Cup"? It clearly states that it "contains information about a future sporting event. It is likely to contain information of a speculative nature and the content may change dramatically as the event approaches and more information becomes available." Therefore, it doesn't devalue the project but gives the reader some insight about the future event, event which, unlike some national jump rope competition, billions of people around the world are obsessed with. So please, don't touch it but update as the time goes on.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>).</small>

<dd><b>Comment</b> You just made the case for keeping 2010 WC as opposed to 2022. There's enough happening for 2010 that FIFA has to make official announcements that it will stay in South Africa. As it is, the 2022 article is more about Australian soccer than the World Cup, and the opening sentence includes a "thinks" and two uses of "probably". There's no information about 2022 beyond "Wouldn't it be nice if..".

Perhaps <b>move</b> the information on the proposals for the Australian bid to an article connected to the FFA or the Socceros, although even then there'll be a fair amount of wild speculation to remove. As I see the "Future Sporting Event" warning, it relates more to an event the general details of which are known, but not the specifics (so we know that the 2008 Olympics will be in Beijing but not exactly how they're going to be run, we know that South Africa's scheduled to host the 2010 World Cup, but not who'll be competing apart from Bafana Bafana themselves).

<dd><b>Comment</b> That's actually might be an excellent suggestion - to make one page for all future World Cups starting from 2022 and beyond. I'd recommend to keep a separate page for the 2018 WC, though, as there is a lot of info already re: this event. Name this page simply "Future FIFA World Cups". There is enough info already available on 2022-2030 WCs to make one web page. There is even a site promoting WC 2030 in Uruguay (in Spanish, <a href="http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/" class="external free" title="http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/" rel="nofollow">http://uruguay2030.tripod.com/</a>), event that's still 24 years in future.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I think it's an idea worth cosidering, though the information that's in the 2022 probably belogs in the 2018 page under the Australian bid. Still, I disagree that the line between keeping 2018 and 2022 is thin; there's a huge dropoff in the amount of actual information. As it is, we only have the FFA represetative talking about <i>if</i> the 2018 Aussie bid fails <i>assuming</i> 2018 is still part of the continetal rotation. Too many variables and not enough definite facts or official statements, I think. And the 2030 page looks like more wishful thinking than an actual bid committee, though that might be because I can't read Spanish. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 08:18, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The thing of it is, I seriously doubt that there are countries who will bid for 2022+ that will not bid for 2018. If any country is considering bidding for a future World Cup, logic would tell us that they would bid for the next opportunity (that is, 2018), rather than waiting four more years until 2022 or later (this is assuming the continental rotation will end after 2014). Do you see what I mean? <a href="../../../i/a/n/User%7EIanManka_997b.html" title="User:IanManka">Ian Manka</a> <small><a href="../../../i/a/n/User_talk%7EIanManka_481c.html" title="User talk:IanManka">Talk to me!</a></small> 08:59, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> There is logic in that, but there always might be reasons to let one chance pass, for instance when there is another event already planned to be organised in that nation in that year (Olympics or a World Championship of another sport for instance), or maybe the nation wants to make a good first impression and first improves the infrastructure, stadiums etc... before submitting a bid. (Although I must admit the Australia case contradicts this.) Anyway, I wonder if this logic is really an important thing to consider: if an official source mentions a nation will be going for World Cup 2030, does it matter if we think they will probably also try for World Cups 2018, 2022 and 2026? --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelotas_8dc6.html" title="User:Pelotas"><font style="color:#4863A0;"><b>Pelotas</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/e/l/User_talk%7EPelotas_5294.html" title="User talk:Pelotas"><font style="color:#F88017;"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 09:42, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see the logic too, but for the purpose of Wikipedia, I find it irrelevant. You're making an assumption about the intention of the candidate nations, however logical it may be, and you're asking Wikipedia to be a crystal ball. No one will come out and say, <i>"We probably don't have a chance in 2018 but we're making a token bid in preparation for 2026"</i> and you'd be dealing with speculation, not facts. Again, what happens in 2022 depends too heavily on events that haven't taken place yet i.e. the fate of the continental rotation, whether an European or a non-European nation gets 2018, etc. Really, is it too much to wait, oh I don't know, another six years before creating this article?&#160;:) <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 09:55, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I worded that wrong. I meant, <b>even if</b> it is just a token bid before a country really makes a go at it, the information will not change, unless their bidding strategy makes a complete turn-around. Therefore, if Country X is making a token bid for 2018, and going for real in 2022, then their bid info would be the same. They'll still use Stadium A in City B.

<dd>I'm not trying to annoy anyone, but I don't completely buy that. The information WILL change, surely a nation will show to the FIFA Committee that it has improved a lot since four years earlier. Ofcourse since we're indeed looking into the future the difference is not immediately visible now, but surely you have to consider more than just the stadiums! Also quoting you twice: <i>Future articles aren't needed past 2018. Period'</i> I can indeed agree that that is seriously <i>worded wrong</i>. What possible motivation could you have to determine that 2018 is the limit for useful information? The page <a href="../../../2/0/2/2022_Winter_Olympics_2d67.html" title="2022 Winter Olympics">2022 Winter Olympics</a> exists and if you look at the information on that page well, there's no reference and three of the four mentioned cities are also on the <a href="../../../2/0/1/2018_Winter_Olympics_bd0d.html" title="2018 Winter Olympics">2018 Winter Olympics</a> page. However I still agree that a complete page on the 2022 FIFA World Cup is probably overdoing it, but I dont agree that the information should be neglected because it's further into the future than your 'allowed year' of 2018. --<a href="../../../p/e/l/User%7EPelotas_8dc6.html" title="User:Pelotas"><font style="color:#4863A0;"><b>Pelotas</b></font></a><a href="../../../p/e/l/User_talk%7EPelotas_5294.html" title="User talk:Pelotas"><font style="color:#F88017;"><sup><b>talk</b></sup></font></a> 22:34, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I can't word anything right. Sue me. What I meant by <i>Future articles aren't needed past 2018. Period</i>, is that, as of 2006 (and perhaps a few years later), there is no need for any article about hosting until either (a) the shortlist is announced for 2014, and prospective candidates who were using 2018 as a warm-up for 2022 are not on the shortlist or (b) it has been announced that the continental will continue until 2018, in which case, all relevant information will be merged into the 2022 article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I just don't know how to get this message across you guys, so I used that last argument that we simply want this article up. 1. About the standards of WP. Surely it should apply to ALL articles, not just this one, right? Therefore, first check out "2022 Winter Olympics" and "2024 Summer Olympics" articles. They contain the same speculative info as this one, yet NOBODY wants to delete them. Is it a double-standard or what? Now to 2. Article needs to be verifiable. The info contained in it is backed up by newspaper publication. If this is not enough for you, you may contact the Australian FA and verify their intention to bid for WC2022 in case their 2018 bid will fail. What other kind of verification do you need? <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 193.41.160.35 (<a href="../../../1/9/3/User_talk%7E193.41.160.35.html" title="User talk:193.41.160.35">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_193.41.160.35_d762.html" title="Special:Contributions/193.41.160.35">contribs</a>) 06:42, 21 July 2006 (UTC).</small>

<li>As regards other articles, that's rarely an argument that works (unless the articles have gone through an AfD and been kept). Ultimately there's a lot of articles on here that probably could be deleted but haven't been challenged yet. If you feel that the 2022 Winter Olympics and 2024 Summer Olympics articles don't belong then you can list them for deletion separately. As for the verification issue, I didn't make myself clear; what needs to be verifieable is the fact that it's likely that Australia intends to bid for 2022. As things stand all that can be gained from the newspapers is one statement by the FA chief exec that they <i>could</i> bid. Which still leaves us with speculation, and Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a crystal ball</a>.

<li><b>Comment</b> On the contrary, I believe that those two "Olympic" articles should be on WP as well for as long as there is at least one piece of info re:them. As for verification, then using your logic you may as well delete 2014 and 2018 WC articles since all we have there is just statements from respective officials that they "could" bid without any documentary proof that they will actually bid. --~~~.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Neither the article nor the church website are particually well written, nor is the church website technically very good. But so what? And hardly surprising from a village church, where the average of parishiners is probably in their 60's. Surely we should be looking at the facts presented.
<ul>
<li>church has a continuous 450 year history</li>
<li>church has a strong association with someone who was executed for their religious beliefs, surely notable</li>
<li>church was an early Baptist church, important for the history of that sect.</li>
<li>The whole story adds up to part of the history of Christianity, the development of religious freedoms, and on the way the growth of political freedom.

I am a member of the Board of the RI Jewish Historical Assoc. and we thought that this information would be valuable for people who are interested in history. If the powers-that-be think it would be better under Wikisource, that is fine with me. The entire idea was to get information out there for people to use.</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> It seem very strange to be call this a copyvio. Either you trust to anonymous and there was permission, or you don't trust him and there is no reason to believe it is copyrighted at all. The only source that this text is copyrighted if from the anonymous source. (and BTW all of wikipedia is anonymous, not signing in makes you less anonymous not more!). <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJon513_f8f5.html" title="User:Jon513">Jon513</a> 12:25, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as written because of <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. Wikipedia can certainly have an article on the Jews of Rhode Island. But it should not be a word-for-word reprint of a single existing article. Wikipedia articles should never have just one author. Geraldine Foster could be one of several <i>sources</i> for such an article. But as currently written, this article is not appropriate for an encyclopedia. <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> says wikipedia is "source-based research" -- not merely a reprint of a single source. I'd encourage the Board of the RI Jewish Historical Assoc. to collaborate in putting together something more appropriate to wikipedia to replace this. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScorpiondollprincess_f1a6.html" title="User:Scorpiondollprincess">Scorpiondollprincess</a> 14:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Ditto. All articles are out in the open for other editors to tear up (in a beneficial way) as the Wikipedia community sees fit.

<p>This is a group of webcomics hosted on a website called Fireball20xl.

<li><b>Comment</b> Seems I'm in a minority here. Thought it would just be a cool to have another webcomic-related article here. G'head and delete it, seeing as what I have to say probably won't matter squat on the fate of the article. I would, however, like to point out two things that I'd like to be mentioned for the record. First, I'd like to state that while The Spriters' Resource and TRG Productions do indeed get 85% and 7% of the website's hits, respectively, it had been failed to mention that TRG Productions <i>is</i> the most heavily visited subdomain of the site after Spriter's Resource, gaining more than the front page of the main site itself. Spriters Resource is exactly what it says: a spriter's resource. There are a decent handful of sprite comics with undeniably large followings, the webmaster of Fireball20xl, Bryon Beaubien, included. As a result, he made what I think is a wise decision and made a subdomian strictly for those who want to make good sprite comics/works to get the mateials they need to get started, as opposed to having the said following hang onto them asking for and/or where to get sprites. Additionally, the website that was linked states only how many hits the subdomains as a whole get. Look around Spriter's Resource. There are a lot of pages, primarily because the sprite sheets are linked to the sheets themselves (if I'm making sense). If it were like Shuyguy Kingdom (<a href="http://tsgk.captainn.net/index.php" class="external free" title="http://tsgk.captainn.net/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://tsgk.captainn.net/index.php</a>), it's quite likely that the hit count for Spriter's Resource would be considerably lower. Secondly, I would like to simply state what Alan Solivan had to say about this article get deleted (note that these aren't his exact words; he was much more diverse, so to speak, in his exact diction): <i>"This would be the second time Wikipedia had anything related to my work killed (the last time was because my site was only a 'small' porition of an even bigger one or some equaly trivial matter) and I'd rather not have to keep putting up with their being so severely ridiculous over everything."</i>--Cukeman 22:50, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> "The nom has been told that a dozen times already" is worthless when every AfD based on Alexa rankings generates several "delete per noms." Perhaps a better argument than "Because I told you so" is needed. A bad Alexa ranking is no reason to delete an article just as a good Alexa ranking is no reason to keep an article. Alexa rankings do not reflect whether any source material for constructing an encyclopaedia article actually exists. A highly ranked web site may well have no reliable sources, or a poorly ranked web site may well have numerous reliable, reputable third-party sources with reputations for fact-checking and accuracy. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 15:06, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>As the author of the Aigaion page I would like to ask for a reconsideration. I intend to update the page in the (very) near future to give a better description of Aigaion. It will probably look something like the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikindx.html" title="Wikindx">Wikindx</a> page. If pages like these do not fit in the Wikipedia policy, deletion is fine with me.</p>
<p>With kind regards,</p>
<p>Wietse</p>

<p>Hi, We are working on the notability&#160;:) We have an ever increasing amount of users and downloads, and I see no reason why this should decrease anywhere soon.. What would be the required notability? What makes the change between aigaion an for example <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikindx.html" title="Wikindx">Wikindx</a>? <a href="../../../w/i/e/User%7EWietseb_7016.html" title="User:Wietseb">Wietseb</a> 06:01, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. <i>We are working on the notability</i>. Notability first, article later.

</ul>
<p>OK, that 's clear. By the way: Aigaion is nothing to replace bibtex and we are not reinventing it. Aigaion is a bibliography management system just like Endnote etc and has excellent bibtex im- and export facilities. I have been looking for a program that offers these facilities on the start of my promotion, but failed to find a convenient open-source bibliography management system. Mentioning Aigaion here seemed the right place for me to spread the word. Unfortunately I was wrong there. Kind regards, <a href="http://aigaion.sourceforge.net" class="external text" title="http://aigaion.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">the Aigaion team</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/e/User%7EWietseb_7016.html" title="User:Wietseb">Wietseb</a>.</p>
<p>ps. I have updated the Aigaion page to give you a better impression of Aigaon.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Since my name has been invoked... =) It should be noted that not everyone has assumed good faith with Touth in the past; he/she has been called a vandal for repeatedly inserting additions to the <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_video_games_and_computer_games.html" title="Lists of video games and computer games">Lists of video games and computer games</a> article and other behavior. In addition, LGagnon above assumes that the "lists were created... with the sole intent of ... adding more lists to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_video_games_and_computer_games.html" title="Lists of video games and computer games">Lists of video games and computer games</a>." LGagnon doesn't know that for sure, although I agree it's a likely interpretation. I've tried to work with Touth on making sure his/her contributions to Wikipedia are appropriate (making these possibly superfluous lists is better than repeatedly adding non-list articles to a list of lists, which he/she did before). So I think Touth can be excused for feeling like LGagnon is out to destroy his/her work. <a href="../../../l/t/p/User%7ELtPowers_4e74.html" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> 11:21, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would like to note that I only accused Touth of vandalism when he clearly did it. He has blanked parts of the talk page to <a href="../../../l/i/s/Lists_of_video_games_and_computer_games.html" title="Lists of video games and computer games">Lists of video games and computer games</a>, and has often been unwilling to discuss his actions when there is controversy over them on the talk page, instead making edits that he has been asked not to make. And yes, I do know for sure that he was only creating lists to add them to that article; the "What links here" page for those articles link only to the lists article.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>And I'd like to point out that editing Wikipedia is for the sake of Wikipedia, not some individual's personal reasons. If Touth wants lists of games he likes, he can put them on his user page. He does not need to fill up Wikipedia's mainspace with listcruft just for the fun of it. -- <a href="../../../l/g/a/User_talk%7ELGagnon_b412.html" title="User talk:LGagnon">LGagnon</a> 17:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This seems to just be a list of anime that some group of people like. Granted, it's an excellent list of innovative, high-quality titles, and it would be a shame to lose it entirely, but it's ultimately opinionated criticism, and thus violates all of the central Wikipedia content policies - it is original research, non-verifiable, and has a non-neutral point of view. The article exists to keep down the size of the main article <a href="../../../a/n/i/Anime.html" title="Anime">anime</a>, where it's presented as if it were a recognized genre akin to "science fiction" or "romance", which it clearly isn't. Usage of the term "progressive anime" is inconsistent and uncommon at best - the majority of Google matches are copies of this Wikipedia article - and certainly doesn't map to anything that Japanese or non-Japanese viewers would consider to be a genre. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkling_df45.html" title="User:Inkling">inkling</a> 01:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - this page has been around for a very long time (September 2004) and only contains verifiable information. The television series centers specifically around this list of experiments, so removing the page will remove a large chunk of information pertaining to the show. The list is different than the <a href="../../../t/h/e/List_of_Lilo_%26_Stitch%7E_The_Series_episodes_b7ed.html" title="List of Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series episodes">List of Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series episodes</a> as the episode list contains airdates and shorter experiment appearance lists. As for the claim of fancruft, I and several other editors have strived long and hard to specifically keep it free of speculative list cruft. All the information is from the show and speculative descriptions are removed almost immediately. While some may view the table as incomplete, it will likely always remain incomplete as only a list of names was provided by Disney, not full descriptions. -- <a href="../../../g/o/g/User%7EGogo_Dodo_6e56.html" title="User:Gogo Dodo">Gogo Dodo</a> 04:35, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

This page is similar to the <a href="../../../c/h/a/Characters_in_The_Smurfs_b0ed.html" title="Characters in The Smurfs">Characters in The Smurfs</a>. Both could be viewed as fancruft as they are both long lists of seemingly (from the non-viewer POV) random fancruft.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Came across this page by accident and must say: I like the idea. To call for deletion IMHO is a harsh way of saying that the page design could be better. I'd suggest converting it to a sort of an index page and moving the text entries either to a seperate page for each creature or to a page with all creatures from one class (see Smurf-page mentioned above). Also, the manifold use of the cell linking to "Leroy &amp; Stitch" is more than redundant and only adds to the "chaotic" impression one gets. Just my two cents!!! -80.135.192.139 11:05, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> Regarding <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a>, I believe it DOES pass. <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> states that <i>"The product or service has been the subject of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the company itself."</i> Besides those references listed, I'm aware that the DIP method has also been written about in third-party, independent publications including a study by Georgia Southern College, published in <i>Reading Improvement</i>; by Mary Pride in <i>The Teaching Home</i>, a homeschool publication; by Ruth Tiechroeb in the <i>Seattle P-I</i>, a newspaper; it was featured in the Readers' Choice Awards in an issue of <i>eSchool News</i>; and California State University developed a video documentary about it called <i>Keyboarding to Literacy</i>. It is currently being researched by Harvard University, Brigham Young University, and Temple University (<a href="http://www.readinghorizons.com/research/studies/progress.aspx" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.readinghorizons.com/research/studies/progress.aspx" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>). While I know these aren't the <i>New York Times</i>, I firmly believe they are not trivial, either.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm actually satisfied with the references you have provided and I would actually be willing to withdraw my vote for deletion if you shifted the focus in the background section away from Charlotte Lockhart's credentials and instead provided an objective comparison of this reading instruction compared to other systems and note its advantages/disadvantages compared to other reading systems. i.e. answer the question - why should instructors use this method? At the moment, the background section reads a little too much like blurb from a promotional phamplet for comfort. -- <span style="border: 1px solid"><a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetsnipe_10c5.html" title="User:Netsnipe"><i><b><span style="background-color: #003333; color:White">&#160;Netsnipe&#160;</span></b></i></a><b><a href="../../../n/e/t/User_talk%7ENetsnipe_6c35.html" title="User talk:Netsnipe"><span style="background-color:White; color:#003333">&#160;<sup>(Talk)</sup>&#160;</span></a></b></span> 19:32, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> I've tried to improve the article a little based on your suggestions. Some of the "marketing" feel has been reduced from the "Background" section. (That was originally based primarily on a page on the publisher's website, which probably explains why it sounded that way.) I have also added some information about how the DIP method "fits" into the market compared to other programs. I'm not very familiar with the specifics of many other programs, so the comparison is probably a little weak--I plan on updating it in the future as I do more research.

<dd>Well, only the last paragraph is relevant to the analysis.

<dd>Actually, it isn't a music competition. It's basically a music variety show, which is accompanied by short interviews resembling notable chat-shows. If he has become a regular performer who appears on each DVD show as a regular cast member, then it hasn't been claimed in the article. The songs wouldn't have gotten on National media in Vietnam as <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paris_by_Night_9d1a.html" title="Paris by Night">Paris by Night</a> is a diaspora show which is hosted by <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Cao_Ky_Duyen_8b88.html" title="Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen">Nguyen Cao Ky Duyen</a>, the daughter of ex South-Vietnam Prime Minister <a href="../../../n/g/u/Nguyen_Cao_Ky_9562.html" title="Nguyen Cao Ky">Nguyen Cao Ky</a>, so I wouldn't be surprised if it was censored in Vietnam.

<dd>OK, It's not stated in the actual article, but he is a regular cast member for at least a year now.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Crackberry, please do not take offense. Quoting from <a href="../../../g/d/_/WP%7EGD_ec47.html" title="WP:GD">WP:GD</a> - "Please do not take it personally. Please remember that the deletion process is about the appropriateness of the article for inclusion in Wikipedia. A deletion nomination is not a rejection of the author or an attack on his/her value as a member of the Wikipedia community." The way that your article is formatted and the way that you promoted the link on the Blackberry page, and since you mentioned on my talk page that you were modifying the About page at the website to point to Wikipedia all adds up to me as advertising. But, remember that the way this works is that I only nominate the article, that does not automatically mean it will be deleted. Other members of the community will come here and give their opinions on the matter before an administrator makes a decision. --<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrian_G_856f.html" title="User:Brian G">Brian G</a> 19:32, 16 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<b>Comment</b> Are you saying that because i'm trying to replace the 'About Pinstack' page on our site by sending visitors to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstack" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstack" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinstack</a> that i'm advertising? Plagiarized??? I own everything on pinstack i'm really confused now about this service.</p>
<p>As i was explaining earlier I notice a few sites link to wiki for their about page as its a limitless Encyclopedia. It seemed very cool to have the site defined here. However, the LAST thing I want to do is break rules or for Pinstack to be viewed as if are trying to advertise. We use google's adwords for that. With that said how many people do you think will be searching for the term PinStack?&#160;:S The point of adding it was for users who already know know of pinstack. Please if it MUST be removed please do so asap! <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Crackberry (<a href="../../../c/r/a/User_talk%7ECrackberry_a668.html" title="User talk:Crackberry">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Crackberry_85af.html" title="Special:Contributions/Crackberry">contribs</a>) 10:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC).</small></p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I see no use in deleting this as a branch off of "Cleft palate". While it's probably someone's research paper, it is academic in nature and therefore gets a free pass by me. The page was prod'd with the editor citing it as "nonsense". With all due respect, I suppose I would call a physics textbook nonsense if I read it, also. Also keep in mind that <i><b>deletion is not a substitute for cleanup.</b></i> <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 05:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. What is the point of the article? That the incidence of "Cleft palate" might vary by population origin? Well that should be dealt with in <i>that</i> article. That the medical field may not be ready to respond to the needs of different cultures or native languages that are present within the US? Well, deal with that topic within some article about <i>providing medical services</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b> delete because it's abstruse? delete because it can be merged? It simply cannot--look at its size and look at the amount of references. Admittedly this is an obscure branch of human knowledge, but that is certainly not a grounds for deletion, especially for something of such an intellectual merit. What we need here is a paragraph dealing with this on the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft.html" title="Cleft">Cleft</a> page and then a <i>Main article: Clefting Prevalence in Different Cultures</i>. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 05:37, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> to <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft.html" title="Cleft">Cleft</a>.

<dd>Yes but that's assuming that everything outside of those "few paragraphs" is useless or unnecessary.

<dd>In our advance towards a larger and more comprehensive encyclopedia, what can we hope becomes of the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clefting.html" title="Clefting">Clefting</a> article?

<dd><b>Comment.</b> IMHO, what is being purged is useless statistics. I see a bunch of statistics about cleft palate without any <i>context</i> about what the statistics mean. Of course, that would require summarising other authors' articles about cleft palate and how the statistics can be interpreted. Also, the <a href="../../../c/l/e/Clefting.html" title="Clefting">clefting</a> article is another matter entirely, very properly split out because it is a separate subject (linguistics v. anatomy). —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 22:33, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>If you read the article, and put on your thinking cap and try to understand, you can make out the underlying theory. Some sentences are clear as day, though. "African Americans have a lower prevalence rate of CL +/- P when compared to Caucasians." Is there some clarification that could be done here? certainly. But what is needed is <i>more</i> content to show the said underlying theory. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 23:12, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Cleftcruft. The subject would be a suitable review article for <i>The Journal of Stuff To Do With Cleft Palates</i>, but not for a general encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Adam. This article does need wikifying, however, that is no merit for deletion. The statistics are important and help to clarify the underlying need for more research in prevalence rates of <a href="../../../c/l/e/Cleft_palate.html" title="Cleft palate">cleft palate</a>. As the first author of this article, I appreciate suggestions for change and not deletion. I am new to wikipedia and am trying to revise and clean up the page as best as I can as a new user.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. "The statistics are important and help to clarify the underlying need for more research." That's part of the underlying problem with the article. The purpose of Wikipedia is to inform rather than persuade; persuasive writing starts to enter the realm of <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">point of view</a>. Further, the information presented in articles is supposed to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> from published sources; a shortage of sources creates the problem of either a small article with minimal content (which winds up in AfD) or an article with <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> (which, if not cleaned up, also brings it back to AfD). —<b><a href="../../../c/f/r/User%7ECfred_e5e4.html" title="User:Cfred">C.Fred</a></b> (<a href="../../../c/f/r/User_talk%7ECfred_3ad4.html" title="User talk:Cfred">talk</a>) 00:56, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree with Fred that the article needs some <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">NPOVing</a>, some parts of it indeed read more like an essay (consider the first sentence, which states, without any citation, that the topic "...is an area in a need for rigorous research"). Similar problem applies to the last sentence in third para ("Research on clefting in different countries will help in the health care professional’s pursuit to understand different cultures." - <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_a_crystal_ball</a>). I suspect it is setences like those that Fred finds objectionable. But the article is not an essay, and after some style adjustments it will be quite encyclopedic - the two examples I quote above are exceptions rather then the rule in this article, and I mention them per Chm33 request for suggestions as to what should be improved. Again, the need to NPOV and adjust the style is not a reason to delete an article. As for statistics, Fred, I don't see your point: they are referenced with academic sources (Harvard style) (thus fullfilling both <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>) and I have never heard an argument that statistics are unencyclopedic or go against WP:NPOV.--<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus"><font color="green">Talk</font></a></sup> 01:31, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>The article may indeed need to be revised and edited of possible essay format per Piotrus comment. I appreciate the response to my need for suggestions of improvement. After improvements and style adjustments are made, there appears to be no justifiable reason for deletion. Information is backed by published sources and there is no persuasion involved. I still appreciate all suggestions for improvement during this process. --Chm33 01:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is not an appropriate encyclopedia entry--it is devoted to a minor and insignificant television character, apparently mostly to advertise the little-known actress who plays her, and secondarily to advertise the television show. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Quentinmatsys (<a href="../../../q/u/e/User_talk%7EQuentinmatsys_ebed.html" title="User talk:Quentinmatsys">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Quentinmatsys_a38b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Quentinmatsys">contribs</a>) 10 July 2006 (UTC)</small></p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Character was part of an important and highly publicized arc in the show's second season which involved her relationship with Marissa, and is referenced plenty outside the show as part of a 'lesbian relationship on TV' hallmark. Could do with more expansion and fair use photograph. Nominator also thinks that a convicted rapist of the same name with no current article should take preference over this character in the Alex Kelly namespace. However this is easily solved with a redirect between Alex the OC character (a redirect at <a href="../../../a/l/e/Alex_Kelly_%28The_OC%29_32a0.html" title="Alex Kelly (The OC)">Alex Kelly (The OC)</a> already exists which would work for this) and Alex Kelly the criminal. <a href="../../../m/r/s/User%7EMrschimpf_855c.html" title="User:Mrschimpf">Nate</a> 06:43, 11 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> It's definitely not advertising the character or the actress, and she did play a significant role during her time.

I forget her last name... in a few pages, I might support that, but barring that, I can't see deleting this. GassyGuy 06:26, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The article is not complete as clearly seen, there is plenty of notable information to be added inculding issues with the English FA and Adidas over copyright, a very controversial issue in the present day and time and more than enough to warrant a page on wikipedia about the forum. The SPPL part is fleshing out the article and what is the rubbish about the forum promoting itself by spamming, SP has never spammed nor never will and has had forums reported for spamming itself, it persues a hard line anti-spamming stance and for it to be accused of such without any evidence is slanderous at best, really think about what you say before you say it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The forum is also notable for the sharing of videos of football, with it recieving over 300,000 hits for videos during the world cup and such file sharing is also big in the news making it a notable forum. Finally if BigSoccer is worthy of a wikipedia article as claimed by an above poster who wants to delete SP's article, then why is SP not, it's the second biggest soccer forum compared to BS and is grower at a faster rate than BS has been for some time.</p>
<p>The forum is notable in various ways then, and is listed as within the 60 most popular soccer site on Alexa (outranking 90% of Official English Premier League Clubs Official Sites in terms of traffic), and within Alexa's top 11,000 over the past few weeks average, it's a major site that deserves a wikipedia article and if you let the article be finished then you will see it's notability and stop being so aggressive and making misinformed comments .</p>
<p>Also I notice some of you are BS members, I believe that ruins your supposed neutrality and thus shouldn't be making a move to delete this article, as it's clearly biased. <a href="../../../a/j/p/User%7EAjp100688_b575.html" title="User:Ajp100688">Ajp100688</a> 22:20, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Response</b> - For what it's worth, I am not an active BigSoccer member (I stopped posting a couple of years ago). And I never said BS was worthy of a Wiki article, but rather, that I was surprised that there isn't one. Big difference.</dd>
<dd>I don't know if a message board even warrants an article and I won't be starting a BS article any time soon, but I can see a case being made for BS. Not so much for its size, but its influence and access to people and information that other sites of the type usually don't have.</dd>
<dd>But I'm not going to write it because there just isn't enough third-party information out there. And whatever information is available will make it read like to this article; the introduction reads just like a press release, even if that wasn't the intent (and btw, "outranking 90% of Official English Premier League Clubs Official Sites in terms of traffic" isn't all that special when you put the number into perspective and is pure PR-speak).</dd>
<dd>Out of curiosity, how do you know which editors are BigSoccer members? <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 00:26, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> - I had a forum spammed with soccerpulse links, don't talk to me about evidence. And why should illegally sharing videos make a forum notable? Why should being a BS member matter? If one were an admin or moderator a case could certainly be made for them being biased. But I have no connection to BS other than going there for information. I don't see how this would make someone biased. Revolutionfan 03:41, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd><b>Response</b> - Well the original "rod" by you says "article that only promotes itself by spamming" - not exactly a fact is it?, just your opinion, and i believe that you do not realise the scale of football videos and compilation that is available from the site, it certainly has affected the way that fans view football. Not only are the videos only accessed by the 50000 members of the forum, but videos made available by members are uploaded to websites such as youtube, metacafe, etc. where it is being made available for a very large audience. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThevmail_50bb.html" title="User:Thevmail">Thevmail</a> 16:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>'<b>Response'</b> Finding out if someone is a BS member is pretty easy, just use their forum search to find the members username, as it'd be pretty uncommon for two different people to be using that username on different sites, it's likely to be the same person.</p>
<p>As for the information Alexa is a verifiable third party source that everyone recognises as being unbiased and useful, it backs up any statements made on the article in every way. If you wish for the article to come across as more neutral then it can be subject to a rewrite, thats not what Im arguing, what I'm arguing is it's right to exist, especially in the light of it's connections to Adidas and the English FA.</p>
<p>The outranking of official websites is very impressive I feel as they have an established brand name and userbase and should attract high rates of traffic and for an independent and largely unknown to the world website to be drawing traffic greater than them is a great achievement.</p>
<p>As for Revolutionfan, your bias shows through by just how agressive you are, firstly as for your accusation that your forum was spammed by SP, you should have reported it to the SP admins and they'd have dealt with it, they are hugely against spamming and as I have said have had forums closed for continued nonsense, secondly it depends what you consider spamming, if one of your members posted a link to sp saying come here and see such and such video, and it was a long standing memeber that was just generally trying to help someone, thats far from spamming, it's just linking.</p>
<p>Whatever spamming issue you had, and indeed if it was spam, it has nothing to do with SP as a site, as I've said many times it persues a hardline anti-spam stance. And the sharing of videos is not illegal, no one is making any money off the videos, none of them have been ripped from copyrighted sources such as DVDs (the forum even has a note saying any ripped DVDs posted will result in a ban for the user) and the actual content is not subject to licensing regarding it's distibution, only it's broadcast on TV stations.</p>
<p>Essentially I have given many good reasons why this site is NOTABLE and why it should exist on wikipedia, and you guys have given no real reason as to remove it, other than it sounds somewhat un-neutral, if thats the case then it requires a rewrite not a removal. <a href="../../../a/j/p/User%7EAjp100688_b575.html" title="User:Ajp100688">Ajp100688</a> 17:09, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>'<b>Response'</b> Yes, I am biased, because I WAS spammed (not linking, I'm not a moron so stop being so patronizing). I'm sure you'd be biased too if I had spammed your site. I run several forums and have not put any, nor plan to put any on wikipedia. I don't see how forums are encyclopedia worthy, especially the results of fantasy games (and its teams' logos) on them, which is just about the only thing in this article. Revolutionfan 17:37, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Response</b> Well for your information there are 210 forums which have articles on wikipedia, maybe you do not feel that internet phenomena are worthy of articles on wikipedia (how ironic since wikipedia is an internet phenomenon itself) but others maybe do feel so, i believe the article is in need of editing, not deletion. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThevmail_50bb.html" title="User:Thevmail">Thevmail</a> 18:14, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Response</b> Once again revolutionfan, read what I'm typing. The...article...is...not finished, the prediction league stuff was only added to flesh out the article as it was the first information available, the rest of the article is awaiting a write up, and scans of the official letters sent by the FA and Adidas etc. If you deleted every article before it was finished, wikipedia would be empty.</p>
<p>As for your supposed spammed forum, whats it's name&#160;? <a href="../../../a/j/p/User%7EAjp100688_b575.html" title="User:Ajp100688">Ajp100688</a> 18:17, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Response to <a href="../../../a/j/p/User%7EAjp100688_b575.html" title="User:Ajp100688">Ajp100688</a> A few things worth pointing out, not necessarily in favor of or opposition to the delete:
<ul>
<li>I searched the user names found here in the BigSoccer search engine and Revolutionfan was the only match. So I'm either doing something wrong or we disagree on the definition of "some".</li>
<li>I never questioned the validity of Alexa results.</li>
<li>I did, however, suggest that you put the 90% number into perspective. So that's 18 clubs out of 20, which sounds impressive on the surface. But you have to consider the following:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Most of the remaining 18 clubs have limited appeal beyond their own fan base. The majority of soccer fans in the world have little interest in West Brom, let alone its official website.</li>
<li>Even if a club has widespread appeal, its fans can find out everything they need to know without ever visiting the official site. There are newspapers, rumor sites and message boards that offer the same, if not more, information than official sites.</li>
<li>A message board, by its nature, attracts more traffic than a typical club site. People visit club sites for specific information or transaction (say, tickets or official merch). People return to message board to post and read responses. The act of composing and posting a single message probably requires just as many page views (which is what Alexa rankings are based on) as a typical visit to an official club site. When you factor in the return visit, browsing through forums and threads, there's no competition.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>So outranking 18 official websites isn't a meaningless feat by any standard, but it's not as impressive as you might think. I'm not saying Soccerpulse isn't a major site. I'm just saying that outranking official club sites doesn't tell us much one way or the other because it's not an even comparison.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>FWIW, TV broadcasts <i>are</i> copyrighted sources and posting them on the internet is just as illegal as ripping footage from a DVD. Any video posted in a forum without the expressed written consent of the copyright holder is "illegal video". I don't think it matters for the sake of this discussion, but it's worth pointing out. <a href="../../../y/t/n/User%7EYtny_f220.html" title="User:Ytny">Ytny</a> 18:30, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I deprodded another couple of articles (<a href="../../../a/a/r/Aaron_Livesy_9f41.html" title="Aaron Livesy">Aaron Livesy</a>, <a href="../../../d/a/n/Danny_Webb_%28Emmerdale_actor%29_7d81.html" title="Danny Webb (Emmerdale actor)">Danny Webb</a>) which had been prodded by the same user without an edit comment. I think that is rather bad form, and it shouldn't even be considered a valid prodding. Those were for another English soap opera character and the actor playing that role (on <a href="../../../e/m/m/Emmerdale.html" title="Emmerdale">Emmerdale</a>). <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">up+land</a> 08:55, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Actually, this entry helped me clean up a problem over on 43places: Big Shell <a href="http://www.43places.com/places/view/862683" class="external free" title="http://www.43places.com/places/view/862683" rel="nofollow">http://www.43places.com/places/view/862683</a> was originally created in Manhattan, as if it were a real place. I don't know if that helps you decide its fate, but it was useful to me. I agree that it's not a very encyclopedia-like page, but I'd like it if you kept pages like this in some form. I definitely use you guys as a definitive source when I hit problems on places that I've never been...</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>; this is <i>not</i> a game guide about a technique used in Counter-Strike. It is an article describing a <i>popular</i> type of Counter-Strike level. It gives a general summary of the concept with a screenshot. It doesn't tell you how to play and in no way attempts to be a strategy guide. Google test comes up with tons of hits for searches like <i>surfing "counter-strike"</i> and <i>surfing counterstrike</i>. No, you cannot go down to the library find published sources about surfing in Counter-Strike, but you can find thousands of Internet sites about it to establish verifiability. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 15:24, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be interested to hear a more detailed description of the nominator's reasons for wanting to delete the article; WP:NOT and WP:V don't tell me much. What part of WP:NOT does the article violate? I can see WP:V to a certain extent, since the information from the article is not found in reliable, published sources, but I'm sort of surprised that this article has been singled out in that way. Thousands of articles on Wikipedia do not cite published sources but are not nominated for violating WP:V. I've read the nominator's general response to this, which is something along the lines of "I'll get to those eventually," but I somehow doubt the nom intends to nominate <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a> for not citing published sources, or perhaps <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slashdot.html" title="Slashdot">Slashdot</a>. The sources that the article cites should be considered reliable in the proper context (talking about the Counter-Strike mod in question). This is not a vote, so unless the nom can actually describe how WP:NOT and WP:V apply here, I don't see how a bunch of "delete per nom, gamecruft" responses represent an adequate debate on the issue. <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 20:50, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Looking at WP:NOT now, I see that you're trying to use the reference to "game guide." Step back and look at the context, please. The policy is "while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction." The phrase "game guide," in this context, means "guide to playing a game." This article is <i>not</i> a guide to playing a game, but rather a <i>description</i> of a popular mod; therefore, WP:NOT <i>does not apply</i>. You're using the words of an official policy out of context as part of your personal mission against "cruft." <a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomTheHand_9a66.html" title="User:TomTheHand">TomTheHand</a> 21:29, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> How? I'm looking at WP:NOT right now and I'm not seeing anything applies.

<dd>Please reread the context of "game guide." It is in the context of "Wikipedia is not an instruction manual." Do you contend that the article is an instruction manual, or did you misunderstand WP:NOT? This applies to everyone who has said that the article violates WP:NOT.

<dd>I disagree with your reading of NOT to begin with (instruction manual is not ment to limit, but game guide is ment ot expand the concept of not being instructive in general by citing a specific instance); but I also believe that the maps are primarily instructive. They have exceptional utility in assisting game play.--<a href="../../../n/i/c/User%7ENick_Y._01a0.html" title="User:Nick Y.">Nick Y.</a> 17:22, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>What do you believe "game guide" means? I'd be interested in hearing your personal definition, based off of the following policy:
<dl>
<dd><b>Instruction manuals</b> - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice ( legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>Also, the article just contains a list of names of popular maps. I don't see how that is of "exceptional utility". Did you have this AFD confused with <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Individual_Counter-Strike_maps_3142.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Individual Counter-Strike maps">another one</a>?

As far as issues not addressed in the nomination, "counter-strike surfing" results in 1.27 million GHits, so it is at least semi-notable as a mod probably being played by thousands of people.

<dd>Um, see my edit summary for that deletion. As it explains, the WP:-namespace articles on the deletion process say not to use both, that AfD supercedes prod, and that prod should be removed if both occur on same page. You're really asking two question, though. The answer to the latent one is that I made this (and the related "Balfour's Law" wannabe-article) an official AfD instead of just a prod <i>specifically to create a vote history</i> that can be referred to later, both tactically, so that we can nominate for Speedy Deletion if the proponents of these "articles" simply recreate them later, and more strategically, to create a better body of precedent (on Policy/Guideline-actionable grounds - note my discouragement of relying upon NN for voting "Delete") for the removal of such bogus "adages" in the future, of which we are likely to see an increasing number in the months and years to come. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="../../../s/m/c/User%7ESMcCandlish_b2c7.html" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a></span> [<a href="../../../s/m/c/User_talk%7ESMcCandlish_294c.html" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>] [<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SMcCandlish_c0b8.html" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">contrib</a>]</span> <span style="color: #990000; font-weight: bold;">ツ</span> 17:05, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>- If your argument is that since there is already an article that has the word 'misconceptions' in the title it would be hypocritical to delete this one, then that's a novel approach and I wish you all the best with it.

<dd>This deletion drive is nothing but an attempt to censor some certain facts about Iran. And besides, it doesnt follow WP rules. There is no good reason for deleting this article.

<dd>The purpose of this discussion is to see whether there is a consensus to delete it, not to censor anything. If it follows all the Wikipedia guidelines then nobody reasonable is going to vote to delete it. At the moment it is is failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> explicitly and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOV_5a35.html" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> by extension.

<li>1) Your first point is not true - many people choose to delete articles for many reasons, including spite, animosity towards subject matter, POV, etc. even if said article is 100% valid, sourced, and true. #2) There is no way that anyone would allow this information in the main <a href="../../../i/r/a/Iran.html" title="Iran">Iran</a> article - that article is already very long and this information requires a separate article. #3) All the information here is valid and true.

<li><b>Delete</b> factual information is presented in a manner which is not neutral. Case in point - the conclusion that Iran does not support terror and that allegations to the contrary fall under "myth." Such is an ongoing debate and cannot be claimed to be 'myth.' The entire structure of the page lends itself towards bias, because anything can be claimed to be myth and then refuted with a source without having to present all opinions. The verifiable content of this article authors deem worthy of preserving can be better presented without the biased structure of this page, which can be used to conceal political opinion. <a href="../../../m/a/t/User%7EMatic3d_f10d.html" title="User:Matic3d">Matic3d</a> 16:38, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Yes, Zereshk informed me of this afd, and i am gratfull for it, i am intrerested in the topic. The article has already a precedence in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a>. The first case, the "Misconception: Iran used chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq war." and the second "Misconception: The word Iran and Iraq are related." are both very informative and well sourced, i see no original research, but a comendeble atempt at presenting sourced information. It is <i>possible</i> that a single or a few of the point in the article are OR or badly sourced, but that is a editing issue that needs to be fixed or removed from the article. It happens that people use a editing issue like "OR" to argue for the deletion of the entire article, when in fact, it is only a small part of the article that is OR. For those who regard the article as badly writen or pov, or anything else, i would like them to give a quote to demostrated the sweeping alegations. A small part of the article <i>possibly</i> being objectionable is nothing to worry about when the article is newly created (17 july). In fact, the articles 2nd (second!) edit is a afd, and in my view, that is a clear sign of the nominator not even bothering to improve the article, making me question if improving wikipedia is his real objective behind this nominations. Its worth repeating: the article itself has a precedence in <a href="../../../c/o/m/Common_misconceptions_about_HIV_and_AIDS_98d6.html" title="Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS">Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS</a>, rendeing "Unencyclopedic" claims voided. Thus, <b>Strong keep</b>.

<li><b>Apppeal</b> as per AableFan 10:23, 18 July 2006 (UTC) Bare with me, as we (The Chris Aable Fan Club) are new to this. I'm Paul Johnson, the president. I assume we delete the "scheduled for deletion" template if we appeal or vote? If not, forgive me, I'm still learning. This biography is useful, and many "smug" details have thus far been left out, but we will work on this so as to minimize offending anyone as best we can. I think Chris' philosophy of Self-Evolution is quite the contrary of being "smug" in that his lectures and speeches at CSULA, LACC, SMC, etc. emphasis that everyone is equal at least in the respect that we all have unique accomplishments that we should share in the spirit of "I can do this, and so can you". Black and white words in a few biographical paragraphs cannot completely capture true motivations, behavior and attitudes, so I would never jump to the worse possible negative conclusions based on a list of accomplishments or work history of any person posted. Please keep in mind that Aable was away from Hollywood during the mid 90s when much information about actors was being placed on the web by publicist. He was teaching sociology, philosophy and psychology at CSULA in the late 1990s and his actual letters of references (with phone numbers) from other professors can be viewed on the reference link of self-evolution.org He may be "nn" partly because he was born as Chris Brown, he had to use the screen name Chris Aable when he joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1988, as there cannot be two people with the same name, in this case, "Chris Brown" for the purposes of Television and Screenplay credits. He authored the book "Life Songs" and "A Value Guide to U.S. Coins" as Christopher Willis Brown in 1981 and the ISBN and copies can be found at the Library of Congress. Aable interviewed over a hundred celebrities when he hosted "Hollywood Today" - a TV show aired in over twenty cities, including most of Los Angeles and New York City. This can be varified through his guest's contacts or their agents, which included newsmakers such as Marc Christian, Gedde Wattanabe, comedians Gilbert Godfrey, The Lovely Carol, etc....Should we list all hundred of them? SYR Productions will be promoting and distributing these historical shows on the internet and DVD in 2007, this part sounds commericial so was purposedly left out along with many other associated facts. We have a fan club committee gathering this information. Board members are Paul Johnson, Steve Torpin, Terry Mills, Jose Silva, Mary Sutton and Barbara Mosher. We don't know how else to write these things without soundinig like a commercial, but we see actor's and producer's upcoming projects throughout Wikipedia. But more importantly, a little known but significant fact is that Aable was the original producer/writer of "America's Craziest Home Videos" long before "America's Funniest..." was known, and this can be varified by Mark Justin, who was a Project Developer at Fox Television back in 1987 and a guest on Aable's show. It can also be verified by John Cedar, Stephen Valentino, David Thursdale, casting director Steve Fugi and dozens of others, names listed upon request. Thanks for listening, and my apologies for the length - there's much to explain. I'm not saying he's Ayn Rand, Aristotle or Jefferson, but nevertheless everyone deserves to have some of their work mentioned when it has effected tens of thousands of people over the years, and will perhaps continue to do so. We could not locate any "copyright violations". If there are any copyright violations or other objections, please be case-specific and wewill be happy to delete or edit to meet all guidelines.</li>

<dd>Instance essentially means "level" or whatever. As for the application of standards, I don't know of any other way to go through this other than on a case-to-case basis. If you have any ideas on a broader application of standards, I'd love hear them. A single AFD for all maps/levels/instances listed on Wikipedia would be a massive and confusing ordeal imo.

<li>Why not have an article for each level of SMB3, in principle?

<li>Quick comment here, a better analogy than having articles for each level of SMB3 would be having articles for each boss of SMB3. I know it seems like I'm nitpicking, but I just think it's important to clarify this for the non-WoW players. An instance is more of a special area where the major bosses of WoW are encountered.

<li>I am not stating whether these are notable or not. My reasons for deletion are given above, you may address those if you wish. Things can be of interest to a large community but still be unencyclopedic, such as recipes, game guides, and such. Those things are "all notable to the substantial number of people", but are certainly not encyclopedic. The main purposes of these articles seems to be to provide information on "bosses", what items they drop, level recommendations, listing mission objectives, etc, which definitely falls under a game-guide, which WP is specifically not. Several of them even have "Strategy" sections, which is quite blatantly unencyclopedic. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 16:19, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

However, most have some background story-line information that should be merged with another article or should be expanded to warrant its own article.

<li><s><b>Keep:</b></s> Just to let everyone know, instances are not a "level" in the game. They are specific "dungeons-type areas" that are completely unique to your group. For example, when you enter an instance, it is completely empty except for you and your group (and of course the bad guys). This is to prevent people from attempting an instance and having all of the "mobs" cleared already. Instances are a HUGE part of WoW and are not there simply for level advancement, but the instances coincide with the history and the story of the game. For example, a lot of the instances are where you and your group/raid can relive some of the stories and legends that many of the players read about on the pages of Wik. It would just be a shame to see them go. WoWPlayer<a href="../../../1/3/1/User%7E131.7.251.200.html" title="User:131.7.251.200">131.7.251.200</a> 19:04, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> There are so many articles nominated here that I'm not sure which way to vote, because I'd have to lump them all in one decision. A page like <a href="../../../m/a/r/Maraudon.html" title="Maraudon">Maraudon</a> is primarily game-guide material, while an article like <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Scarlet_Monastery_4e0e.html" title="The Scarlet Monastery">The Scarlet Monastery</a> isn't. Similarly, if you trimmed out most of the Instance info from articles like <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackrock_Spire_71e1.html" title="Blackrock Spire">Blackrock Spire</a>, it would be worth keeping, or at least trimming down and merging into a list article. To delete them all would surely be overzealous, but not to edit these at all would be ill-advised.
<p>But I suppose that point is moot if you don't believe any of it should be here at all. This AfD's primary reasons for deletion are that it is a gameguide and that they have no references. For the game guide claim, I would argue that these are fictional elements in a notable video game, notable in regards to the game's design as well as to the greater Warcraft universe - not necessarily a gameguide. Inherently, <i>some</i> instancing and gameplay information should be there. For references, the game itself can be cited as a primary source, as well as other how-to guides, FAQs, and reviews as secondary sources, if it goes that far. --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 22:07, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, Wikipedia is a collection of human knowledge, and I fail to see that why you can have an article on specific episodes of <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a>, World of Warcraft instances need to be removed.

<li><b>Keep</b>: I came to this site looking for meaningful information about what Molten Core is, which I found in the article about the instance. I would have been very surprised not to find an article on the subject in an encyclopedia as big as WP, as I have come to rely on it for information on a great many subjects. Some of the instance articles could perhaps use a cleanup to make them more like information and less like a guide, but as they are now I don't see it being a great problem. Merging all the instance articles won't be possible without removing a vast amount of information, or making an enourmous article. I also join the poster further up, in saying that the person suggesting this deletion seems strongly biased against World of Warcraft for some reason, as evidenced by him mockingly mentioning "sweet loot for your raid" (which seems to be a quote from nowhere in the Deadmines article).

<li><b>Comment</b>: Your primary argument seems to be that these articles deserve to be included in WP merely because WP is "big" and has articles on a "great many subjects". However, WP aims to be a <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopedia</a>, which is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">not</a> necessarily the same as being big and having many articles. The argument for inclusion of an article must involve the properties of the article itself, rather than the properties of WP. As far as opinions go, I disagree with the expectation that one should find detailed articles on game maps in a general encyclopedia. I have no objection to pointing interested people to more specialised resources out there (which can be wiki-based even!), but we don't ourselves have to be such a resource. However, I would recommend people who have strong opinions on this matter (i.e., people who have voted strongly for or against in this AfD) to try and draw up some notability criteria for video game information. In this instance a little bit of instruction creep is preferable to a deluge of AfDs if it will establish clear consensus standards. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 22:01, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well you did post the AfB and so the majority of comments must be directed at you, eh? Poking aside, I've begun editing some of the articles for clarity and removing the "guide" information. I will update with lore and non-guide information (to maintain a level of "encyclopedic-worthy content. I would request a minimum period of 5 to 10 weeks to thoroughly update and modify the above noted articles so as to avoid their deletion. I do believe that World of Warcraft, it's lore and fantasy, and all non-guide information related to it, certainly meets or exceeds any notoriety standards that Wikipedia holds itself to, and that the articles are merely under scrutiny due to the excessive (though not IMO) amount of "guide" content. I hope to rectify this as soon as humanly possible. Note that I am not the original contributor nor editor. Seansquared 12:08, 20 July 2006</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Just something I've noticed since the AFD started is articles such as these seem to get worse over time. Judging by article histories and even just the activity on them in the past few days, most content is filled out by IP users with no interest in Wikipedia's policies of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:OR. Unlike other articles, these unreferenced level guides seem to get worse over time, rather than improve. During my time cleaning up/watching "List of Weapons in Halo 2", I found this to be the case as well, so this phenomenon is certainly not limited to any particular game. While this is not a reason for deletion by any means, it seems relevant to those who feel these articles can and will be cleaned up over time. <a href="../../../w/i/c/User%7EWickethewok_98f4.html" title="User:Wickethewok">Wickethewok</a> 03:57, 22 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>, I offer the following arguements: (1) These articles represent real knowledge about a long standing fantasy universe. This fantasy universe has been worked on for more than a decade by one of the most successful game companies in the world today <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blizzard.html" title="Blizzard">Blizzard</a> and it seems likely that this information will be of interest for many years to come. The information about the WoW instances is directly comparable to detailed information currently in the Wikipedia about such unreal locations as <a href="../../../l/%C3%B3/r/L%C3%B3rien.html" title="Lórien">Lórien</a> and many other fictional locations such as: <a href="../../../w/e/s/Westeros.html" title="Westeros">Westeros</a>, <a href="../../../g/a/l/Galactic_quadrants_%28Star_Trek%29_6812.html" title="Galactic quadrants (Star Trek)">Galactic quadrants (Star Trek)</a>, etc.). (2) These articles are not game guides in that they do not provide detailed maps showing the locations of monsters or detailed strategies for defeating said monsters. Instead they by-and-large fit the idea of an encyclopdia entry so that when someone says to you "Have you ever heard of the Motlen Core in WoW?" you can say "No... but give me 5 minutes on Wikipedia and I'll have some idea what you are talking about". (3) Any attempt at merging would result in an article which was too large as there are a great many instances in WoW and more are added as the game continues. (4) There are a number of works of fiction that have been published set in the "Warcraft Universe". If all these instance articles are deleted because they describe (some) things only found in the game WoW, what logic would justify keeping the other articles in Wikipedia which describe places that also don't exist except in works of popular fiction? Should the Wikipedia be biased against unreal game locations vs. unreal published fictional locations? Note also that there are plans (which may come to nothing) to release a big-budget movie set in the World of Warcraft universe. I'm not willing to ague which article about which minor feature of a minor game should be deleted but WoW is (a) the most popular game in the world for a year now (b) part of an established fictional landscape which exists beyond WoW and into other fields of art. Wikipedia clearly has room for articles which describe fictional locations. WoW's fictional locations are, in my opinion, important enough to maintain their existance in the Wikipedia. <a href="../../../c/g/l/User%7ECglassey_8e74.html" title="User:Cglassey">Cglassey</a> 20:58, 23 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> these pages due to their extreme notability and encyclopedic use.

All those things can be online, and maybe one solution is to have WP become the #REDIRECT jumping off point to other topic's wikis.&#160;-- <a href="../../../m/r/d/User%7EMrDolomite_0b0c.html" title="User:MrDolomite">MrDolomite</a> | <a href="../../../m/r/d/User_talk%7EMrDolomite_8f87.html" title="User talk:MrDolomite">Talk</a> 01:39, 25 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

As a demoscener, I hate to vote something else than keep when a demo regarded as classic by some has been nominated for deletion by an outsider. However, in this case, even subculture-specific criteria don't seem to provide enough proof of the notability. I think there's room for maybe fifty demos in Wikipedia (we currently have <a href="../../../d/e/m/Category%7EDemos_3c61.html" title="Category:Demos">12</a>), but it's questionable whether Timeless could be one of them. Let's see:
<ul>
<li>Awards: not applicable, since this demo never participated in a competition. (Americans didn't have their own demoparties yet in 1994)</li>
<li>Google web test: "Timeless by Tran" 11 hits, "Timeless Tran" 17 hits, "Tran Timeless" 34. The Linux port is called "SDL_Timeless"; the search with this keyword gives 25 hits. I would say that the infamous Google notability test failed.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hornet.scene.org:8080/ha/pages/hc/hc_results.html" class="external text" title="http://www.hornet.scene.org:8080/ha/pages/hc/hc_results.html" rel="nofollow">Hornet charts final</a> (1998, a ranking of PC demoscene productions based on public vote): not included in the "top 40 demos" list. Note that most demos in this list were rather new at the time, and the slightly older ones seem to be those who have a more lasting value (e.g. <a href="../../../s/e/c/Second_Reality_407e.html" title="Second Reality">Second Reality</a> and Dope).</li>
<li><a href="../../../m/i/n/MindCandy_373b.html" title="MindCandy">MindCandy</a> volume 1 is a famous 2002 DVD compilation containing 42 PC demos, 20 of which are supposed to be "oldskool" classics. Timeless is not included.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.textfiles.com/artscene/history/scenery/scenery/yearall.txt" class="external text" title="http://www.textfiles.com/artscene/history/scenery/scenery/yearall.txt" rel="nofollow">History of demoscene by year</a> from <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spaceballs_%28demogroup%29.html" title="Spaceballs (demogroup)">Spaceballs'</a> Scenery project mentions Timeless as one of the 12 significant PC-based releases of 1994. However, this doesn't rise it to the all-time top fifty.</li>
<li>In Talk:List of demos by year we were trying to establish some criteria for including demos in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_demos_by_year.html" title="List of demos by year">list of demos by year</a>. Timeless seems to have hard time even with the initial criteria suggested by <a href="../../../v/o/s/User%7EVossanova_19f2.html" title="User:Vossanova">Vossanova</a> for the list (only ***+ rating in <a href="http://www.hornet.scene.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.hornet.scene.org/" rel="nofollow">Hornet Archive</a>; just barely passes 30 votes in <a href="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2878" class="external text" title="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=2878" rel="nofollow">Pouet</a>; monostep and scene.org listings are not applicable because 1994 is too old for their coverage)</li>
<li>Google groups search limited to comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos, a major discussion forum for the PC demoscene in the 1990s. The search <i>group:comp.sys.ibm.pc.demos timeless tran</i> gives 38 hits. Comparison with some "definitely notable" PC demos of the same era: Second Reality by Future Crew 228 hits, Unreal by Future Crew 189 hits, Dope by Complex 90 hits, Crystal Dream by Triton 85 hits.</li>
<li>Conclusion: not "top-fifty" material even in the demoscene context, so I'm not going to vote for keep. --<a href="../../../v/i/z/User%7EViznut_68d9.html" title="User:Viznut">Viznut</a> 09:05, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Still, he has content that was broadcast on an Israeli national television station and that documentary was critically acclaimed, even if it was shown at a late hour. There are plenty of television programs in the states that are notable and are broadcast late at night. Even the fact that his movie caused scandals in Israel makes him notable. Just because you don't think such a person is notable, as evident from your two attempts to get this article deleted, doesn't mean others think the same, and they obviously do not as seen in the first deletion discussion. While he does not currently have a page on the Hebrew Wikipedia, if he has critical acclaim somewhere, he is notable for mention in the English language Wikipedia. <a href="../../../r/y/u/User%7ERyulong_3578.html" title="User:Ryulong">Ryulong</a> 22:50, 16 July 2006 (UTC)

This is like the third time I repeat: this is not only about the current situation, but about the history of proven or alleged Israeli war crimes, including this episode. Anyway, if it is deleted, I will make it again... either imediatelly, either as soon as U.N. issues a press release. <a href="../../../g/r/e/User%7EGreier_db9d.html" title="User:Greier">Greier</a> 14:57, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apparently, the chap above who did the Google search for "Old School Reference Index Compilation" didn't bother to Google for "OSRIC," as I found the OSRIC RPG right on the first page of my Google search using that search term. OSRIC is a ground breaking RPG platform based upon Wizard of the Coast's Open Gaming Liscence that allows for authors and publishers to create material for games that have been out of print for decades. Its truly becoming a phenomena that is rejuvenating "old school gaming," particularly given the ingenius way that the author(s) used the OGL to make certain old school game rules available for those who want to publish using them. OSRIC has its own website, and professional game publishers are even now in the process of publishig OSRIC-compatible gaming materials. It'd be a shame to see Wikipedia delete an entry for something that may well become the industry standard for publishing old school rpg gaming products. -John Stark</li>
<li>OSRIC does need and merit a Wikipedia entry, but the article should be more neutral and factual. <a href="../../../c/a/s/Castles_and_Crusades_753c.html" title="Castles and Crusades">Castles_and_Crusades</a> is a good example of content which would be appropriate.

<li>What's important about OSRIC is that it's got an open source license and that it creates a platform for any publisher to use it. It has already begun to create a market for this type of publication, with one independent publisher, Expeditious Retreat Press, announcing that they're going to publish under the system. So, while I agree that the entry should stay, I think that the entry as it stands doesn't really hit on the most significant aspect of what's been done. I imagine that as more is added over time, it will hit the more significant information. <b>--Mythmere</b></li>

<p>This doesn't make much sense, given that your first complaint was that a Google search didn't yield even a single hit for "Old School Reference Index Compilation." When I pointed out that doing a Google for "OSRIC" brings back a hit on the first page, you now seem to want to change the deletion standard from "no hits on Google" to "the only Google hit is OSRIC's own home page." Further, you assert another new deletion standard with your "when OSRIC becomes well known or an industry standard" comment, but that makes no sense at all. Wikipedia is FILLED with information and articles about subjects that are neither well known nor an industry standard. Indeed, isn't one of the points of having an encyclopedia to preserve and elucidate knowledge about obscure and little-known pieces of information for the general interest and edification of its readers? Your deletion standards are not very consistent.<b>***</b> John Stark 19:57, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I use wikipedia for RPG hobby related searches all the time. It's a great resource for learning about new games I'd like to try and old games whose history and trivia I'm interested in. I think the OSRIC article may need some work (that's why wikipedia is editable, right?) but in my opinion it's definitely a worthwhile article to have and shouldn't be deleted. If wikipedia's goal is to offer comprehensive information on subjects people are interested in, then excluding OSRIC makes no sense. OSRIC has averaged 40 unique IP downloads a day since it was released two weeks ago. To me, that says people are interested in it. Having a wikipedia entry provides a centralized (well known) place for people to get information about the game's history, goals, availability and ongoing projects related to it. I understand that wikipedia doesn't want to become a host for commercial advertisements, but seeing as OSRIC is completely free, I don't see how it would qualify as a commercial venture. Nobody is attempting to use wikipedia as a means to financial gain. I sincerely hope the administrators at wikipedia will leave this article in place and suggest that people who find the current form of the entry unsatisfactory make suggestions for improving it rather than just asking for it to go away.

<li>FreplySpang, the OSRIC entry passes the test for all three content guiding policies. It is verifiable, as I've posted links not only to OSRIC itself but discussion fora where it was announced; it is not original research in that it doesn't postulate anything; and finally, I gave it from a neutral point of view since a) I'm not the author, and b) no unverifiable claims promoting it are made. Given also that I've edited the article to include it's recent history, I see no real reason for the OSRIC article to be in the delete pile. SemajTheSilent</li>

<li>Delete, per nom -- The only publication of this program has been on forums, and was only released two weeks ago. The fact of the matter is that this is barely notable even within RPG circles, and is certainly not significant enough for inclusion in a general encyclopedia. Now, it could easily obtain significance or notability in the future; it is rather new, as stated. Another thing - the concern here is not really with articles being used for commercial purposes, but with having articles on subjects that simply are not important.--<a href="../../../s/e/a/User%7ESean_Black_d709.html" title="User:Sean Black">SB</a> | <a href="../../../s/e/a/User_talk%7ESean_Black_aa92.html" title="User talk:Sean Black">T</a> 23:14, 15 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Just to clarify. Am I to understand that the two main reasons for deleting the OSRIC entry are: 1) It's new and 2) it's not important? If these are indeed the reasons then 1) how long does something have to exist and 2) how few, or many, people get to decide what is important before an entry is allowed to live?

<li>No. The reasons for deleting it are that it is a mis-use of Wikipedia to provide primary source material (<a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia is not a primary source</a>.) and that it is <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>.

I've never heard of it, and the provided sources provide me with no evidence to believe that it is notable in any way. There are <i>thousands</i> of d20 products released every year; most are fairly worthless retreads of previously published material, and of those that have worth even fewer make a significant impact. I see no mention of significant sales, of being used as a source in other gamebooks, of winning substantial awards. Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of barely-or-unpublished d20 books.

<li><b>Comment</b>. OSRIC isn't a d20 book at all, and it hasn't achieved significant sales because it's free. Above user may need to re-read with more attention.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> The point is even stronger for games without a core system; if d20 books aren't inherently notable, how much more so books published without support from a major publisher/licensing scheme. And without a sales metric it's even harder to establish impact. All of my points stand, and have now been strengthened. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 22:27, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment'</b>. OSRIC isn't a game without a core system. It does have a licensing scheme (the OGL, which is not the same as d20).
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough that it has a license, but the OGL imparts no real accountability or business relationship between the product and a major publisher (nor is the OGL actually a system; it's a license vaguely akin to the GFDL). Without a substantial and active relationship with an important figure in the industry, heavy sales/downloads, earth-shattering importance for the evolution of roleplaying games, substantial coverage from the trade press or newspapers with national circulation, or historical importance, it doesn't meet the lowest notability threshold. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaptainktainer_964a.html" title="User:Captainktainer">Captainktainer</a> * <a href="../../../c/a/p/User_talk%7ECaptainktainer_87c5.html" title="User talk:Captainktainer">Talk</a> 10:35, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Yu-Gi-Oh! GX is a spinoff, therefore has its own sections. Character pages, etc. already exist on Wikipedia, and plot summaries detailing each minor character are written based on what has occured throughout the series. Links to appropriate pages in regards to trivia are made, and confirmation by outside sources is unnecesary as such references are made within the episodes themselves (such as Kabukid announcing Shizuka Gozen's name in full, despite her card not having that proper title). Calling the information redundant does not make any sense at all, as the minor character page for the regular Yu-Gi-Oh! series contains no indications whatsoever of the characters appearing in GX; there is no connection between the character groups at all. Furthermore, the characters listed in this article do not have their own seperate articles; they are merely <i>minor</i>, which is the entire point of this article being here in the first place. There is absolutely no overlap with any other articles, and information on these characters is listed nowhere else. Flagging this article for deletion is highly unnecesary when every other page follows the same format. 14 July 2006. -Benten</li>

<dd>that depends. If it's a personal movie created for some college class, we would still, the main point is notability and vainity concerns.

<li><b>Reply</b> -The original site didn't fold. The whole family was reworked, and now gamedex is used as the search engine for the many gametalk forums. And, yes, forums is plural.

<li><b>Keep unless notability not proven by end of AfD</b>: Given the prolieration of modern Gnostic movements, one main article is needed, but not many, many. The overall phenomenon "sounds" notable from what I'm seeing, but "sounds to A.

That could be fixed simply by citing some numbers (from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> sources) as to how many people are involved.

<li>1. This article says the term Gnostic Movement is not associated with contemporary Gnostic organisations - this is a POV only.</li>
<li>2. By placing the word Masters in quotation marks in this sentence 'currently there are a number of different lineages of "Masters"' is to imply that none are actually Masters - this is a POV and not based on factual evidence.</li>
<li>3. Under 'New Order Schools' there are numerous sweeping assumptions. Saying that something happened "most likely" because of such and such a reason is not a factual description of events, but a guess based on biased views and information. There is no evidence given for the numerous assumptions. What is the claim that there is not a Three Chamber system based on? - POV only</li>
<li>4. Why is Gnosticweb the only gnostic organisation identified and selectively highlighted in this section - this is provocation.</li>
<li>5. The section on Pseudo-schools is another section for provocation. Whilst some claims may be true it is generally written based on opinions, hearsay, gossip and rumours.</li>
<li>6. Branding individuals as mistaken mythomaniacs is attacking and another sweeping POV.</li>
<li>7. Generally there is no merit to this article other than to fuel debate and argument.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is unfortunate that this page was called Gnostic Movement because it did not provide any objectivity about this topic, merely a POV that lacked neutrality and resourceful information. Listing people as "self Proclaimed Masters" and following it with comments eluding to those people being mythomaniacs, especially those still living, could very well be considered defamation of character.

<ul>
<li>I think this article violates Netural POV. Despite a surface neutrality, it seems clear that it's been written by a proponent of one of the earlier schools of Samael Aun Weor, and intended to discredit any later developments in modern gnosticism. Examples of this include:</li>
<li>use of inverted commas surrounding words like "advanced" and "masters", colours the text with a sense of incredulity or even sarcasm, and seems intended to influence the reader's perception</li>
<li>the quoted material (from Zodiacal Course) appears selected less to shed insight into what the Gnostic Movement is then to subtly deride other schools that disagree with the author's POV</li>
<li>much explanation of why earlier schools view later offshoots as "only superficially affiliated of the doctrine of Samael Aun Weor" without any attempt to provide the alternative perspective(s)</li>
<li>the use of the term "self-proclaimed" master becomes almost derogatory by the article's end, and the implication is that they are generally "mythomaniacs" according to the "source" (footnote 4). Upon investigation, the source appears to be the website of a school that goes to considerable lengths to make clear their disagreement with later offshoots of modern gnosticism -- can we expect this to be a balanced and objective source? Particularily, again, as no efforts are made to offer a countering perspective.</li>
<li>from viewing the edit history and the discussion pages, some of which seems almost hysterical, and considering the lack of verifiable sources, it seems that this article will inevitably be hijacked by interested parties, and fails to provide an objective assessment of the subject matter.</li>

<li>The article starts out giving the appearance of being informational, but as it goes on beyond the introduction, it seems that the actual purpose of the article is to persuade the reader that certain schools are legitimate, while others are decidedly not legitimate. It serves little informational purpose beyond the introduction, which contains information already found within other articles.</li>
<li>Some statements made later on in the article, including some under, "New Order Schools," are unfounded and without any source of reference. For example, how can it be proven whether or not the new order schools carry a three chamber system? This term refers to a school system (stated by Samael Aun Weor as being a defining point of a true Esoteric institution) structured with an external (public), intermediate, and internal (esoteric) chamber system. By definition, if a school did have an internal chamber, this wouldn't necessarily be something known to those outside the school. The fact that this is used as a defining factor of "new order schools" shows an author interested in promoting something he is familiar with, while dismissing that which he is unfamiliar with.</li>
<li>Similar could be said about the "self-proclaimed Masters" section. Samael Aun Weor himself was a "self-proclaimed" Master (literally, he proclaimed himself a Master). There is no way to prove who is and who is not a "true Master" versus a "self-proclaimed Master," so a list of self-proclaimed Masters seems again only to serve the point of view of the author that these "Masters" are illegitimate.</li>
<li>There are other statements presented as fact which similarly there is no way to prove. I don't have time to go through all of it, but if you go through it, you will be able to spot others.</li>
<li>Finally, the article defines "Gnostic Movement" as something which belongs solely to Samael Aun Weor, when it is clear that there are other schools with the same name. Because of that fact, the whole hierarchical structure of the article is flawed. I suggest deletion because in my opinion, there is no way such an article can exist without being a battleground for an edit war on the part of the disagreeing schools.

</ul>
<p>For the average user in userland, ie non wiki geek (no derogation intended) it would seem that nearly everyone has been discredited.</p>
<p>999 who initiated the call for deletion is discredited for making a drive-by nomination, even though no previous history or association can be found.</p>
<p>The early 'voters' who do not appear as sockpuppets are discredited because they are making votes not discussions.</p>
<p>The sockpuppets are discredited because they are seen to jump in solely to ask for deletion or other, when they had no previous contribution history (even though some of their comments are definitely worthy of consideration).</p>
<p>Those who had previously made contributions to the article but have shown some kind of affiliation with the subject matter are deemed bias and therefore discredited. (Why would someone spend time and effort creating a wiki article if they had no involvement or interest in it?)</p>
<p>That leaves only...? Wish I knew how the system worked?</p>
<p>It seems there is more emphasis on who users are then the actual contents of the article!</p>
<p>My opinion now (if it counts for anything?) is I tend to agree with the author - have a NPOV stub or delete the article.</p>

<li><b>Very strong KEEP!</b> and tag for clean-up regarding the NPOV issues. Large movements like this one and prolific authors should have articles. These articles have lasted more than 6 months and are actively being improved upon by several editors. They are not stubs, and provide a lot of detailed and potentially useful information. They seem to me to be no different from the vast majority of contentious issues that have articles on Wikipedia. The movement may not be quite as notable as, say scientology, but in many respects these articles remind me of the articls on that movement, only people have managed to bring that one up to FA status. WP certainly has articles on less notable things. Plus, articles that start out reading like ads can and have in the past been improved to such a point that no one mistakes them for such. <a href="../../../o/n/u/User%7EONUnicorn_f26e.html" title="User:ONUnicorn">ONUnicorn</a> 15:25, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and tag for cleanup/npov.</b> POV isn't reason enough for a delete, IMHO. Honestly, the notability of the subject matter should matter a lot more. As noted above, there's a lot of history to this article and the subject matter seems notable enough for inclusion to Wikipedia. To delete an article because its easier than actually putting in the work to make it a GOOD article is, in my opinion, a less-than-optimal choice. As a matter of full disclosure, this article was prodded a while back and I removed the prod for similiar reasons (POV not sufficient for deletion).

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm going to nitpick here....Notifying a page's creator that the article is nom for AfD is not necessarily "part of the process," although it's considered a good thing to do. Also, the "Before nominating an AfD" section generally has suggestions, not guidelines that must be followed (most start out like "<i>Consider</i> adding," "<i>Consider</i> making," etc). I can say that I don't always do any of these things when nominating. And in fact, oftentimes if an article seems like an obvious candidate for AfD, I'll track down the author's other contributions to see if other pages are also obvious candidates (this isn't uncommon for vanity pages, for example). My point being that <a href="../../../9/9/9/User%7E999.html" title="User:999">User:999</a> wasn't necessarily acting in bad faith in nominating this, and it's not fair to him/her to assume that s/he was (<a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>). -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 06:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Keep.</b></s> <b>Strong, perhaps even speedy, keep.</b> Given the list of awards for her work as a video editor, she appears to be a "professional whose work is widely recognized (for better or worse) and who [is] likely to become a part of the enduring historical record of that field."

<li><b>Suggestion:</b> I'm not sure how Wikipedia handles a situation like this, but I don't think it is appropriate for TheRingess to be editing this article, due to his obvious bias against the subject, related to their shared spiritual path, which was discussed during the previous Afd (one would think this might give him a bias *toward* the person, but that doesn't seem to be the case.) He's also the one who began the original campaign against this article. Perhaps he'll voluntarily agree to focus his efforts elsewhere. —&#160;Jaime234 21:49, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

Of course, anyone can revert my material if it doesn't meet those criteria. Also, I would also add, that as long as I treat fellow editors with respect, I can continue editing. Perhaps, my initial nomination used language that was not entirely respectful, but I did apologize and everything seems copascetic. To prevent me from editing for any other reason, as I see it, would be censorship, which seems to violate the basic premise that Wikipedia is founded on. My vote is <b>Keep</b> and cleanup to provide dates and categories for the awards and references from sites that list the individual awards. Also, if a fellow editor feels that I am <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVandalism_79f5.html" title="WP:Vandalism">vandalizing</a> articles or in violation of the <a href="../../../3/r/r/WP%7E3RR_b9e9.html" title="WP:3RR">3 revert rule</a> then an administrator can block me from editing.

<dd><b>Comment</b> 'can' doesn't mean 'should'; no-one is saying you aren't 'permitted' to (your claims of potential censorship isn't necessary, as no-one has a 'right' to edit Wikipedia <a href="../../../f/r/e/Wikipedia%7EFree_speech_fd55.html" title="Wikipedia:Free speech">Wikipedia:Free speech</a>), just that it may not be the wisest decision.

<dd><b>Comment</b> <s>Once again, my own language seems to fail me. Jaime seems to have legitimate questions regarding policy. I was trying to point out that there are guidelines for when an editor might or might not be blocked. I also provided links to material that might aid in answering those questions. I am also attempting to point out that as with any other editor, my contributions are judged on their own merit. I am fully aware that editing Wikipedia is not a right. I did not "claim potential censorship". <b>To be clear, I was making no claim that I was censored or will be.</b> Speaking generally, not specifically and certainly not about my edits or my contributions, it seems to me that blocking any editor who has violated none of Wikipedia's guidelines, is similar if not the same as censorship. This is not the same as claiming that <b>I</b> am being censored, or that I am <b>accusing a fellow editor of potential censorship</b>. I wished to provide a fellow editor, with legitimate concerns, links to material that might help address those concerns.

<dd>You seem to be talking policy, but I'm talking pragmatics. As I said, thinking about what is best and not just what is 'allowed', as just because you can do something within the rules doesn't mean that you should do it.

<dd><s>Perhaps no one did, however, I interpreted the sentence "I'm not sure how Wikipedia handles a situation like this, but I don't think it is appropriate for TheRingess..." as both a request for information on how to prevent me from editing the article (a block), and as an accusation that I have or will edit the article inappropriately. Perhaps, if the person pointed out in what ways I was inappropriate and why they feel I will be, then I might understand better their concerns. In which case, if both they and I agree that the potential exists for me to make <b>inappropriate</b> edits in the future, I can agree that I should be recused. Right now, I do not think that I have done anything <b>inappropriate</b>. My edits should speak to that. If I am too close, then specific examples would also help me to see that.

<li><b>Keep.</b> But since I wrote the original article, I would vote thus anyway wouldn't I? As promised I have been making consultations. One of the most significant was with the author herself. A copy of her response is on my talk page. My conclusion is that to my own satisfaction, my own second version of the article describes faithfully factually and without error the summarised significance and history of Sharon Janis. My attitude on verifiability is that <b>every single statement</b> is fully verifiable for anyone who is prepared to make an effort and talk to people. On the advice of the "lady herself" the defence rests has no further comment to add.

<dd>as we pointed out before. The Wired article isn't credible per their management, and the Salon article isn't an article on the Lumber cartel. Its simply mentioned in passing and other then stating that they spoke out against the DMA, contains no other usable information in relation to this group. Simply establishing existence by a credible source does not give license to use whatever source you want to present facts about that subject.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 16:47, 17 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The Wired article requests information: if there were a real problem the article would surely have been pulled. The Salon article devotes an entire paragraph in a not-particularly-long article to the "Lumber Cartel", hardly a mere "mention-in-passing". Your querulous attempts to forbid the use of Usenet messages as evidence of their own contents (which is the real situation here: we're not using that content as further evidence of anything else; <i>that</i> argument lies elsewhere) is becoming tedious.

<dd>1 paragraph out of 3 pages? There are a total of 32 paragraphs in the article (some are longer some are shoter), which means its got a grand total of about 3% of the article. That is trivial, even if its not trivial, it establishes nothing other than the fact that a group called themselves that and had those opinions. The wired article does ask for information, but doesn't say whether or not that article was one they couldn't find sources for. However the fact that they're asking for sources in relation to that article does indicate they had trouble with the sources on it. They don't specify what they need sources on, or what the problem is, but it does taint the article and make it a dubious source.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:20, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>No, and you keep misunderstanding this (which makes one wonder if it's deliberate): Google Groups presents as an accurate archive of the messages which were posted to Usenet. The issue here is whether particular messages contained particular text: whether that text <i>itself</i> contains accurate information is another layer of verifiability altogether. The analogy could be drawn with messages in a foreign language: there's a step between ensuring that you have the correct message <i>in the original language</i> and ensuring that you have an <i>accurate translation</i>.

<dd>I'm not questioning the accuracy of the archive. I'm questioning the accuracy of the original posts. Using them from google groups would be no different than using them from usenet. Since google does nothing other than package them up, there is no difference. Prior to this debate WP:RS read that usenet posts were not to be used as primary or secondary sources (the wording has since been changed by someone involved in this debate) and since google groups doesn't do anything to the posts, its no different than usenet. This article does more than say "People talked about the lumber cartel on usenet". It goes on to make accusations against individuals based on "facts" provided in those posts. There is a world of difference there.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 17:23, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

It is not clear whether this is an article about 1) the Lumber Cartel or 2) about Usenet chitter chatter. If the former, then Usenet is not an acceptable source. If the latter then Usenet can be used as to show Usenet rumour, without any implication that it's fact. At the moment it is claimed that it is about 2) but in fact that material is used to substantiate 1) in complete violation of <a href="../../../v/e/r/WP%7EVERIFY_fd4c.html" title="WP:VERIFY">VERIFY</a>.

<dd>He put forth how many posts were made as some evidence of notability. I'm well within my right to call that into question. By your own admission this is only notable within a small group. Most notability guidelines read, that regardless of the subject require it to be the subject of multiple non-trivial articles, reports, etc. Its only non-trivial coverage is Wired, and even that is honestly trivial. While its mentioned in the opening its not really covered as the subject of the article.

<li><b>Keep</b>: This whole AFD is silly. Just because someone hasn't heard of a city or a road within the city dosen't give you the license to stick an AFD tag on the page.

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom. I can't - after some effort - verify the info given and have huge doubts that such a title exists to any credible standard of proof. Feels like smoke and mirrors to support a pretender to a title. Lots of the info is misleading. If the title were created by the English/British crown then the it could and would have to be proved which it hasn't. If it is non English/British then the Act of Union provision wouldn't apply. The Irish state doesn't recognise titles included former Irish titles and no Irish court will rule on succession disputes so claiming the 1957 International Recognition and Enforcement Convention is fluff. <a href="../../../a/l/c/User%7EAlci12_990b.html" title="User:Alci12">Alci12</a> 17:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Actually on one point you are wrong. The Irish state does recognise titles. The Genealogical Office has been involved in doing so for decades, and peers have sat in the Seanad under their full title and have contested seats in the Dáil. And issues of succession have gone before Irish courts in the past. Not too long ago the Oireachtas amended a law to regulate issues concerning the property inheritance of Lord Altimont. The Irish state has never abolished titles. It just does not <i>issue</i> them, an important difference. <a href="../../../j/t/d/User%7EJtdirl_d3f0.html" title="User:Jtdirl"><span style="color:green; background-color:pink"><b>Fear<i>ÉIREANN</i></b></span></a><a href="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" class="image" title=""><img src="../../../upload/thumb/6/63/Ireland-Capitals.PNG/15px-Ireland-Capitals.PNG" alt="" width="15" height="20" longdesc="../../../i/r/e/Image%7EIreland-Capitals.PNG_a525.html" /></a>\<sup><a href="../../../j/t/d/User_talk%7EJtdirl_d04b.html" title="User talk:Jtdirl"><font color="blue">(caint)</font></a></sup> 03:05, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>This page is formed from authorities in published works on public display in the Craigavon Museum and the Dublin Cathedral, it is full of citations namely the Royal Warrant, the Regimental Archives and several others; it does deserve to stand and is authored under a formal membership. The entries below are misleading, the 'real <i>earls of Dublin; this person clearly has no understanding of the subject at all as s/he states; it is therefore not proper for them to enter an opinion which is unfounded on proper authority. This page should stand alone as it has nothing to do with the British creations and the Irish creations are entirely lawful and recognised. To say this page contains no sources is to not read it, every line contains a source which is immediately verifiable and in compliance with the editing rules.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>This article is noteworthy as the author James Kane cites "This book charts the long and distinguished history of the Blackers of Carrick Blacker, which the reader will quickly realise was one of the most remarkable and influential families to settle in the province of Ulster."</p>
<p>I intend adding page some fascinating extracts about he civil wars, the Irish famine and the general history of the province through the eyes of one of Ireland’s most noteworthy contemporary writers. I have several pictures, maps and commentaries to add and this page will become a source of material like no other page.</p>
<p>This page should stay.</p>

No vandalism occurred, it was the insertion of valid one line remarks such as "This of course does not concern the Irish creations." and suchlike. It was only when offensive 'don’t vandalise my precious page' remarks flowed from that author that things got silly. Leave this work alone, it is self declaring and of inestimable value to the true historian searching for information about this family. Did you know for instance that Kate Blacker was the first person to take aerial shots of Everest? Well I have them to include here; did you know that Latham Blacker was the first person to survey Everest and the mountain is only known as Everest as his assistant finished the work after his murder? No well if you remove this page you will never know about these and many other fascinating things.</p>

<dd>It would help if you used one of the systems available in Wikipedia to link specific facts to specific references. As things stand, it's not clear which of your heap of references is being used to back up which claim. See <a href="../../../f/o/o/Wikipedia%7EFootnotes_5088.html" title="Wikipedia:Footnotes">Wikipedia:Footnotes</a> for more detail on how they are commonly used.

<li><b>Keep</b> Out of all of the Avenged Sevenfold songs with articles, you picked this one? This is probably their most notable song. Peaked at number two on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, number six on their Modern Rock chart, and even managed a number sixty showing on the Hot 100.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I understand. It very well may be a good faith nomination, but I am tired of seeing people on Wikipedia nominate articles for deletion for some elitist reason. Extra articles on Wikipedia do not hurt it, and only provide more information that makes people use it much more. For example, while a particular video game may not be considered notable, there is no harm in listing information about the game on Wikipedia. Maybe I just disagree with some of Wikipedia's principles. Regardless, I apologize for not being civil before. - <a href="../../../j/n/i/User%7EJNighthawk_9cf3.html" title="User:JNighthawk">JNighthawk</a> 15:56, 20 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The questions here are still complex, but there seems to be a strong consensus for one thing: the bulk of the information in these articles constitutes a "game guide", which Wikipedia explicitly is not. A smaller article listing the maps with a brief description would be allowable under the consensus I'm seeing below; individual articles about each level would not be, even in the case of maps which may be more notable than others.</p>
<p>I read "transwiki" as including both the statements: (1) "these articles don't belong here" and (2) "these articles might be useful to this other wiki". Thus, in my view, the discussion below indicates that there is a strong consensus that the information doesn't belong here. I am definitely willing to temporarily undelete in order to help someone perform the transwiki.

<p>This discussion is about whether or not the individual counter-strike maps, <i>as a class</i>, should be wholly deleted. The individual merits or demerits of any single map is not relevant (that would require its own individual AfD). We are talking about the <i>principle</i> of having individual counter-strike maps... whether that principle is in violation of the <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> policy, and whether <i>any</i> individual counter-strike map could be considered notable.</p>

</ul>
<p><br />
Please keep in mind that referring to debates that resulted in "no consensus" is not a sufficient reason for counting either a <b>keep</b> or <b>delete</b> vote. Neither does it count to refer to essays that are not actual policy (like <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">WP:NN</a> or <a href="../../../c/r/u/WP%7ECRUFT_eeba.html" title="WP:CRUFT">WP:CRUFT</a>). And in this peculiar instance, the nominator is actually opposed to deletion, so "per nom" votes would be ambiguous and also not countable. (You can find my reasoning next to my vote below.)</p>
<p>As nominator, I will be informing all users from the 3 aforementioned AfDs who participated with more than 2 edits, as they will likely be interested in this discussion.</p>
<p>Closing admin, if the result is to delete, take note that many of the articles have screenshots and images of the maps. Fair use may expire on these images. <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbergan_0309.html" title="User:Dbergan">David Bergan</a> 18:44, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> as nominator. I am one of the main contributors to the articles in question and the reason I am putting up this AfD is because we have been bombarded by AfD requests that have all resulted in "no consensus". But each of those discussions didn't directly face what I consider to be the main issue: whether or not the principle of individual CS maps is in violation of the policy. Other things were grouped in (like surfing) which muddled the main issue. And as the closing admin stated in the latest AfD, a vote of "no consensus" doesn't mean anything. I feel we need a consensus before I continue working on these articles, because either (A) a <i>delete</i> will be delete them and then I can't work on them or (B) a <i>keep</i> will make them immune from the threat of a future AfD. Since the discussion is still fresh in many people's minds, we should try to settle this once and for all.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>So much for my reasons for nominating. Now for my reasons for keeping.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding the "instruction manuals" violation, I maintain simply that these articles do not constitute an instruction manual. Take <a href="../../../c/s/_/Cs_italy.html" title="Cs italy">Cs italy</a> as an example. There is nothing in that article that explains how to play the map. In fact in the game Counter-Strike there never is any one "right" way to play a map. The game is exclusively multiplayer, and because either team can do an infinite number of things to which their opponents have to adjust, there is no possible "walkthrough", or "how-to" beat a map. What the article has is (A) a description/history of the map, (B) an overhead view of the map, (C) some screenshots, (D) professional criticism against the map being balanced for both sides, (E) listing of some trivia regarding the map, including the translation of an opera song that can be heard in one section. None of those five constitute an instruction manual for anything. They are a simple description, much like what we find in the article about the Roman <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colosseum.html" title="Colosseum">Colosseum</a>... (A) description/history (B) blueprint (C) pictures (D) architectual criticism (E) trivia. The latter article is not an instruction manual, and neither is the former.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "not notable," I maintain that the article's notability can be plainly ascertained from a count of users daily playing on public servers (something like over 1 million), or the hits from a Google search (de_dust = over 1 million). In the last AfD an argument was presented that this sort of counting doesn't automatically justify an article as notable. He has an office by a street that probably sees more than a million cars a day, but that doesn't make an article on the street notable. My response is that yes an article about that street would be notable... if he put together something like the 5 sections I included in the last paragraph. If he merely described the road, then it might have AfD issues (although I haven't read any policy or guideline that would immediately sink it). But if in addition he researched the local newspaper archives and dug up a history of the road, described the points of its uniqueness, and uploaded a couple pics and map of its location, it would clearly be notable. "Not notable" violations are things like "shirts in David Bergan's closet"... not things that a large part of the public encounters.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Regarding "cruft," I have 2 arguments. First, that cruft is a highly subjective term. Any specialist understands that things related to his specialty are more important to him than the average person. It doesn't matter if your specialty is fishing or quantum physics, there are a certain realm of topics that will be very interesting to you, that wouldn't be interesting to my mom. To accuse another's specialty topic as being mere cruft, shows little more than the obvious fact that you don't have an appreciation for that specialty. Counter-strike, being a world-wide professional sport now, has its realm of specialty, just as baseball or football. My second objection comes from a plain reading of the cruft page. That page defines cruft as "of importance only to a small population of enthusiastic fans," which in the interest of these maps is simply untrue. So many people play these maps that it is impossible to consider it a "small population."</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>And finally for those considering a <i>merge</i> vote, I respond that there is simply too much content for one article to cover it all. Discussing the uniqueness, history, and trivia of 22 maps (and hopefully screenshots, and overhead maps) would make a convoluted mess. I hope I have persuaded you to keep.

<dd>We're voting on the concept of "individual counter-strike maps, <i>as a class</i>." Sure some of the articles may be riddled with original research, but I don't see how the concept itself can be considered original reseach. Thus, an original research argument could work for an AfD of a specific article or two (or even, hypothetically, for every single one of these maps), but we would have to consider each article separately to do that. It just doesn't seem possible that the class itself could be considered original research. But maybe I'm missing something.

<li><strike>Keep all</strike> per nom. In the previous AfD I said to transwiki them to Wikibooks, but I'm led to believe that Wikibooks will not accept this sort of article. They should then remain in WP. I would recommend an individual article for the major maps such as the dust maps, and a general article for less well known maps, but as far as notability goes I have a hard time believing that these are not notable or that they are game guides. <span style="white-space:nowrap">— <a href="../../../k/a/u/User_talk%7EKaustuv_9271.html" title="User talk:Kaustuv">Kaustuv Chaudhuri</a></span> 19:16, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

"It is generally considered civil to notify the good-faith creator and any main contributors of the article that you are nominating the article." My method of discerning "main contributors" was just to take anyone with 3 or more edits in the previous AfDs... since those people are the most likely to have the strongest feelings on the subject.

<li><s><b>Strong keep</b></s> There is an article about every episode of Season 5 of 24. Yet we are debating to delete pages that explain _the most played_ maps in computer FPS's. These maps are ones that <b>ALL</b> serious gamers know about/heard of. There is massive ammounts of culture, references, and history behind these maps. They make up the heart of CounterStrike, the most popular first person shooter out there. And you guys want to delete that, yet making a page for _every_ episode of 24 and Simpsons is okay? Just think about what you guys are talking about, this is a ridicoulous arguement, you might as well delete about a 3rd of Wikipedia if you delete these. You have to understand, de_dust is the most recognized computer map of all time. Any serious gamer who sees it can easily say "Counter-Strike". When they reach this kind of popularity, it _IS_ worth keeping. There are articles on wikipedia that are a lot worse and need a lot more attention than this. In no way should these be merged or deleted, it would violate the goal of wikipedia in many ways, because these maps truly do mark a serious spot in computer gaming. Individual maps definately DO have their own cultural impact, ask any serious gamer about dust or aztek. Everyone who here is saying that this is becoming a game guide I guess is not a CounterStrike gamer, because if they were, they would know that each of these maps adds their own bit of tactics, ideas, and culture to Counter Strike. Considering the Google results for these maps, and that there is history about these maps that will be deleted if we merge them, I strongy oppose any deletion. --<a href="../../../r/a/k/User%7ERake_0dc0.html" title="User:Rake">Rake</a> 05:21, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<p>Comment: All seriouse gamers? I don't know any Counter-Strike maps, but I am a very serious gamer and have been all my life. Maybe you should say all serious <i>Counter-Strike</i> fans know those maps. Having pages for indivdual maps is like having seperate pages for levels in a game or for different chapters in a book.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. As someone who just went on Wikipedia to read this stuff. Counterstrike is one of the most popular online games, and these maps have been played by millions. I believe the popularity, the resourceful-and-thoroughness of many of them articles. To me, there's no doubt that de_dust, for example, is notable. Information about maps is not "a indiscriminate collection of information" (football grounds don't get deleted, as a contrast to a "real life" sport - <a href="../../../w/e/m/Wembley_Stadium_7314.html" title="Wembley Stadium">Wembley Stadium</a> gets less Google hits than <a href="../../../d/e/_/De_dust.html" title="De dust">de_dust</a>2), and these articles don't contain walkthroughs. They contain information on something that is notable.

<li><i>Comment</i> - I realise this (although I only count 19,000 hits for "pina cola" as a term - I believe that maybe if it received 331,000 hits about a craze, it honestly might be worth an article, like drinks such as a <a href="../../../c/o/s/Cosmopolitan_%28cocktail%29.html" title="Cosmopolitan (cocktail)">Cosmopolitan</a> have an article but no recipe), but it proves that something /is/ notable, is widely known (and, as such, people may search out an article on it) and as such not as fancrufty (Millions of pages really don't imply "cruft" to me). I honestly don't believe this is anymore fancruft or non-notable than an article about a sports stadium, which everyone would agree abnout it's inclusion. Saying that information here is making another Wiki redundant isn't of importance to this debate in the least - it does not add anything to the debate IMO. <a href="../../../h/a/l/User%7EHalo_f92c.html" title="User:Halo">Halo</a> 21:37, 18 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>Google states that it is not not notable (they exist, they are varifiable and they appear widespread all over the internet). It helps show that these things exist, it's notable, and it's all over the internet. There's several pages about dust2. Maybe you should read it yourself? "<i>It is also used to ascertain whether a topic is of sufficiently broad interest to merit inclusion in the wiki</i>". IMO, it does ascertain this. I mean, I could do the Google groups test too and several of these maps appear hundreds of times (thousands in the case of dust2). These things /are/ talked about, well known and are not fly by nights, and as such /are/ notable topics, and as such do deserve a page.

<li>It doesn't fit into any of the WP:NOT categories. These articles are certainly NOT game guides. They don't tell you how to win at the game, which is what the page implies. They are information about the maps.</li>
<li>It seems lots of people here are to jump onto cruft for anything non-physical, irrelevent of it's popularity. These maps have been around for 7 years, and are still extremely popular.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - Despite the fact that many people see no use for these articles, I don't believe that every article needs to appeal to everyone. These are not game-guides, these are descriptions of popular levels and what is controversial/complained about/unique about them. Sure these maps may provide very little use to people who have never played counterstrike (provoking a call of -cruft) but they provide just as much information as episode articles would to people who have never seen the show.

<li>Individual articles about episodes are just as bad&#160;;) To honor encycopedian style, one merged article would be far nicer. And as I like articles that are graphically beautified, I do think for these maps this has been overdone, 1 - max 2 screenshots per map should be enough!...

<li>I can't comment on the notability of these maps, since I am not a Counter-Strike player. However, I believe in a <b>strong keep</b> for de_dust, not just because that map is unofficially the "face" of Counter-Strike, but also because it clearly doesn't fall into the instruction manual category (screenshots are there for critical commentary and identification, even if it's a bit messy). The history about the various versions and comparisons of the map moving from game to game in the CS series is keep-worthy, though it could use some more sources and cleaning up. So yes, in principle, a noteworthy map should be covered by Wikipedia, but as for the others, they should be individually AfD'd (and if notable enough, given a chance to be edited into proper articles, otherwise merged). --<a href="../../../s/e/v/User%7ESevereTireDamage_33d2.html" title="User:SevereTireDamage">SevereTireDamage</a> 07:39, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree here. I would take it analogous to fictional characters, while main characters are considered to be wikipedia mention worthy every character of a fiction is not.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'd just like to point out one thing. If you don't like an article, you have the choice to not read it. It's not hurting anybody by existing, and if people are interested, it's there. If I'm not interested in reading an article, I <i>don't read it</i>. As for the arguments for moving it to a CS-specific wiki, I believe that having it in Wikipedia is a better idea. What I stated above, combined with the fact that Wikipedia is a central source of information. People will tend to come to Wikipedia for information before they go to a topic-specific site. This holds true especially if they're just looking for an overview. I stay away from the computer game wikis because I really don't want to read about strategies. These articles provide a decent general overview of the maps, as well as some little-known facts. --<a href="../../../v/a/r/User%7EVarco_d844.html" title="User:Varco">Varco</a> 06:21, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>With the same argumentation, if you don't like it, don't read it, I could also make an article about my hairdresser around the next corner, an article about the child of my syster and so on, however all this contents are non-encyclopediac and would definitly be deleted. Wikipedia for people looking for an overview... aren't the 24 maps with 3-4 screen shots, map critism and recensions not much too detailied information? For one thing I think its certaintly best to merge at least all de_* ce_* and so on togheter in articles. --06:28, 21 July 2006 (UTC) <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/e/s/User%7EJestix_6105.html" title="User:Jestix">Jestix</a> (<a href="../../../j/e/s/User_talk%7EJestix_e15d.html" title="User talk:Jestix">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jestix_e38f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jestix">contribs</a>).</small>

<p>I haven't been doing any work on wikipedia in ages (just busy), so I don't know how much cred I have at this point. However, most of my work dates back to before "Advanced Yoga Practices" came into being, so I'm at least not a new face. This is certainly not a new "branch" of yoga, Ohnoitsjamie. They haven't added any in a few millennia. So that's not a fitting benchmark. However, it's a fresh and innovative approach, it reveals a lot of information previously kept secret (one had to be initiated and stick around for years to get this stuff), and it integrates a lot of obscure, esoteric, and far-flung elements into one very well-written and exceptionally clear system purged of superstition, doctrine, and lots of the other junk that inevitably gets added on over the millenia. It's a brilliant work of integration, IMO. And since Yogani has been called "the first yoga eGuru, having come to prominence on the Internet" on a patently independently web site (<a href="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalserve.net/~sarlo/Yyoga.htm</a>), the topic deserves inclusion. Though I agree some work needs to be done on the article to make it a bit less boosterish. --O. Pen Sauce 03:02, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment.</b> Thanks for the contribution, O.Pen. Other editors please note O.Pen's contribution history: many quality edits in 2003-4 on articles relating to yoga and its schools, and no contributions either recently or to the article up for review.

<dd><b>Comment.</b> That was nice, thanks, especially 'cuz I feel like Rip Van Winkle here. Listen, I'll commit to doing a once-over on this article once it goes live to purge the hype. As you can see from my old edits, I'm one of the rare yoga practitioners with a balanced eye toward the different schools. The problem with yoga people is they tend to be dismayingly sectarian. This creates a problem for Wikipedia that I ought to start pitching in to help fix anyway, with respect to some of the other yoga entries.----O. Pen Sauce 14:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Advanced_Yoga_Practices_%28AYP%29_c542.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Reasons for not deleting</span></h4>
<p>AYP is a very new approach to Yoga and is catching on very fast among people around the world. It is a guruless system.. wherein you are given all the tools and enough guidance through lessons and a forum to take you ahead in the spiritual path.</p>
<p>All these yoga techniques have been around for ages, however AYP picks the best and most effective tools.. and has come up with a system that is the most efficient for both meditation and pranayam.</p>
<p>The reason for not having many hits when you google is because it is still new.. but catching on very fast. AYP online memberships in the AYP Yahoo groups and the AYP website forums total nearly 10,000 people. The AYP websites have been visited by over 50,000 people during the past few years, and are currently receiving over 20,000 page hits per day.</p>
<p>It may not be at the Wikipedia popularity level.. but it is getting there.. it can only increase with addition of new online lessons and the publishing of the remaining 5 books in the AYP enlightenment series.</p>
<p>Thousands of people who have been following AYP have had very quick progress in their spiritual path.. You can find testimonials of this <a href="http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html" class="external free" title="http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html" rel="nofollow">http://aypsite.com/Testimonials.html</a></p>
<p><i>"The creator of the article immediately set about linking numerous other Yoga-related articles to this one which supports the suspicion that the intention was promotional".</i> - The reason for this was because I was told to add link to other Wikipedia articles <i>{{<a href="../../../l/i/n/Template%7ELinkless_f9ea.html" title="Template:Linkless">linkless</a>}} template to orphan article).</i> Once I was done with that, I was told to link other Wikipedia articles to mine. <i>"The category and the tag both just mean that links to Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP) &lt;/wiki/Advanced_Yoga_Practices_%28AYP%29&gt; need to be created from other articles. You're on the right track, just add Advanced Yoga Practices (AYP) to other articles and that will do the trick."</i> I have been following orders. And now that I have done both way links I have been tagged as trying to promote AYP.</p>
<p>Finally <i>search for "Yogani," yields only about 730 hits, many related to a few books</i>.. is because Yogani wants to remain anonymous.. AYP is not about him.. it is about Yoga and getting the best and most efficient techniques out to everyone who may or may not have a guru.</p>

I would really appreciate if you would consider this topic for Wikipedia. If the writing does not fit in with the Wikipedia standard and style I will gladly re-write it. However, this was not meant to be an advertisement or a promotion. I just thought it would be a good topic for people looking for a fresh approach to Yoga and let them know that there is something available for people interested in spirituality who don't have a guru.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and patience. Shantiayp 21:11, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<b>Comment</b>: I cant really speak to whether the topic is encyclopaedic or not, because I'm not sure what the notability criteria should be here. I just thought I should share the information that, when I accessed some of the Amazon links to the books provided above, several of them had fairly high ranks. Ranks above 75,000 change frequently over time, but most of the books had ranks (either today or yesterday) below 300,000, and several had ranks well below 200,000, which is a commonly-used cutoff for notabiliity. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 04:46, 19 July 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Additional comments:
<ul>
<li>First see the talk page for the full history of this article. I attempted to fix some of the other problems of what was basically a <a href="../../../v/a/n/WP%7EVANITY_751a.html" title="WP:VANITY">vanity</a> article, then realized it was likely not notable, so I tagged it for notability issues.</li>
<li>When I learned how small the company really was, I tagged it for deletion.</li>
<li>I think Timbercon is on the cusp of notability -- if a very low standard is used. Following the letter of the law re: corporate notability requirements, they <i>technically</i> meet the <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28companies_and_corporations%29_0e74.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (companies and corporations)">requirements:</a> in this case, <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/documents/customerevidence/6716_Timbercon_Case_Study.doc" class="external text" title="http://download.microsoft.com/documents/customerevidence/6716_Timbercon_Case_Study.doc" rel="nofollow">a Microsoft ad</a>, a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/columnist/strauss/2003-11-17-strauss_x.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/columnist/strauss/2003-11-17-strauss_x.htm" rel="nofollow">Microsoft small business case study</a> in USA Today and a <a href="http://www.timbercon.com/News-Releases/Top-100-Lighthouse-Award.html" class="external text" title="http://www.timbercon.com/News-Releases/Top-100-Lighthouse-Award.html" rel="nofollow">ranking as 62 out of 100 in a local list</a> published by a <a href="../../../p/o/r/Portland%2C_Oregon_1e41.html#Media" title="Portland, Oregon">non-notable local publication without its own WP article</a>.
<ul>
<li>Re: non-notable media: note that the 3-person decorating business my spouse uses also more than meets the <i>technical</i> requirements since the owner has been written up in the Rome News-Tribune multiple times for his many decorating tips. (BTW, that's Rome, Georgia, not Italy.) I also don't think being the subject of a case study qualifies as notable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Since I'm not very objective at this point (after cleaning up Timbercon link-spam in other articles) and since this article is borderline, I thought it best to get others' views rather than pull the trigger with a PROD or CSD tag.</li>
<li>I have notified the other editors who have edited this article in the past.--<a href="../../../a/2E/_/User%7EA._B._b9cc.html" title="User:A. B.">A. B.</a> 21:57, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. At the risk of accusations of wikilawyering, I'll go at this one. First off, there aren't tens of thousands of fraternities in the united states. There may be thousands of <i>chapters</i>, but there aren't thousands of national organizations. BUC has 18 chapters, has external references <a href="http://www.theeagle.com/spotlight/music/2005articles/042105musicnotes.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.theeagle.com/spotlight/music/2005articles/042105musicnotes.php" rel="nofollow">[55]</a> <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drextras_3636_brief.php" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/directory/brief/drextras_3636_brief.php" rel="nofollow">[56]</a> <a href="http://www.skillet.com/news/piracy.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skillet.com/news/piracy.html" rel="nofollow">[57]</a>. It's the nation's largest Christian fraternity, which stands apart from the traditional outlook of a brotherhood. I do think that this article needs to be wikified and significantly shortened.

<li><b>Keep</b> because this organization appears to be established at a sufficient number of universities to be notable.

<li><b>Keep.</b> Why would BUC need to be deleted, but all of the countless other Interfraternity Council, National Panhellenic Council, and other fraternity/sorority entries be allowed to stay? It seems, though from an admittedly biased source, that someone simply does not want this article included. If you delete BUC, why not delete <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Alpha_Epsilon_f8ae.html" title="Sigma Alpha Epsilon">SAE</a>, <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Chi_b022.html" title="Sigma Chi">Sigma Chi</a>, etc? As for Wikification, again, if the standard is other fraternity/sorority pages, I think this article clearly meets Policy.

<li>KEEP -- I am the primary author of this brief article. As above: "<i>Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source.</i> ESA is a long standing, active organization which involves thousands of women. It has long been associated in charitable activities with the Lion's Club. If you want sources to prove its existance, the organization produces a written newletter called the "Jonquil" and has been referenced in newspaper articles in association with St. Jude's hospital and charitable efforts. <a href="../../../w/b/a/User%7EWBardwin_3eb9.html" title="User:WBardwin">WBardwin</a> 01:12, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>1000 chapters? If that's verified, this is an obvious speedy keep once the article is fixed. The article needs sourcing, badly, and cleanup. <b>Keep</b>.

<p>I say KEEP! This organization is just as real and notable as Girl SCouts, Phi Mu Fraternity, Lions Club or Sigma Chi. Maybe it needs some clean up, but the article is very valuable. Believe it or not there ARE other national/international organizations out there. A simple visit to their website or an email to Annie Greengrass, Director of Expansion would clear all this up. There are many people who like to get rid of any "competition" in the Greek world and do not like others learning about these non-college groups.</p>
<p>Actually I think those who want to delete this group are not aware of (or at least not very involved in)the Greek world and that’s part of the problem. Most Greeks would recognize that this group is in no way even related to them I’m sure quite a few college Greeks are also members of ESA. To compare it to <a href="../../../s/i/g/Sigma_Chi_b022.html" title="Sigma Chi">Sigma Chi</a> or <a href="../../../a/l/p/Alpha_Chi_Omega_7a88.html" title="Alpha Chi Omega">Alpha Chi Omega</a> is like comparing the Red Cross to State Farm Insurance In any case ESA does not compete with Fraternities and Sororities and as has been noted is not even a College club. It should be re-classified as a charitable service organization like <a href="../../../k/e/y/Key_Club_73ab.html" title="Key Club">Key Club</a> or the <a href="../../../r/o/t/Rotary_Club_af49.html" title="Rotary Club">Rotary Club</a> and then the article cleaned up and laid out according to the templates of those organizations. And once again I must emphatically say <b>Keep this article</b> <b>--<a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETreyt021_3281.html" title="User:Treyt021">Trey</a> 22:58, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<p><b>Trey-I respectfully disagree with your discrition of the group. But I do agree this article should be kept. While ESA is not a traditional college sorority, it IS an international sorority! It is every bit as active, viable and important as any other fraternity or sorority. Double membership in ESA and a college group does not change this. And while ESA is not a traditional college sorority, they ARE on some college campuses. This can be easily verified on their website as well. I believe it should stay under the category of fraternity and sorority. Just because it doesn't conform to what the media has deemd a stereotypical GLO, that doesn't make it wrong. In Indiana there are over TWENTY groups like this are national sororities, but people do not hear about them all the time because they are not collegiate. They are still sororities. And they ARE in competition on some campuses.</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jackjackattack (<a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJackjackattack_2f5b.html" title="User talk:Jackjackattack">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jackjackattack_5605.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jackjackattack">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Follow Up</b>. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> also provides, "<i>Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, <b>Juno</b> or Mercury Music Award</i>." (Emphasis added.) This band has won one Juno (in addition to many other awards). In total, I'd say they meet at least 6 of the criteria. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 23:30, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'm surprised this one is problematic, even. As noted, they've had some decent success. "26 Cents" was a top ten country hit (and placed on the Billboard Hot 100 as well). "Fly (The Angel Song)" was a top twenty country hit that placed also on the Hot 100. "Jimmy's Got a Girlfriend" didn't make the Hot 100 but was still a top forty country hit. I'd say these three chart placings show reasonable notability, especially since if I had access to Canadian charts I'd probably be able to demonstrate comparable if not greater success there too. Also, the article also claims they have a reality show, which I suppose would add to notability. GassyGuy 23:34, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> I have made my case for deletion already on the Talk page devoted to this biographical article. Kevin Barrett is a proponent of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Conspiracy_theory.html" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theories</a> about 9/11 who makes unsubstatiated claims and seeks media attention and publicity. He has no publications other than letters to the editor. He makes public appearances and appears on radio talk shows, making inflamatory claims about 9/11. The sources he cites are always within a small number of like-minded individuals who make similar claims, or write pseudo academic papers that purport to support the claims. There is nothing noteworthy about Kevin Barrett other than that he generates publicityabout himself. The Wikipedia project does not have the editorial resources to maintain articles on people like this, or to verify the accuracy of the information about them. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetzenberg_43b3.html" title="User:Metzenberg">Metzenberg</a> 00:00, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Unfortunately, I never fail to be amazed by the people who can't seem to differentiate between <i>notability</i> and <i>political disagreement</i>. <b>Kevin Barrett</b> is definitely notable; he has been significantly covered in recent news. Or maybe it's the case that these Orwellian thought-police do understand the difference, but hide under the notability cloak. In any case, if Wikipedia marches down the road of censored thinking, then it has outlived its usefulness. Perhaps its time for a new Wiki-based compendium of knowledge where the hurdle for deletion is much higher. <a href="../../../e/a/r/User%7EEarpol_de4c.html" title="User:Earpol">Earpol</a> 10:07, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree with this as being appropriate for deletion. Kevin Barrett is becoming more and more like the "<a href="../../../c/i/n/Cindy_Sheehan_da7a.html" title="Cindy Sheehan">Cindy Sheehan</a>" of the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_Truth_Movement_a967.html" title="9/11 Truth Movement">9/11 Truth Movement</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> He is an educator trying to teach critical thinking at a time when it seems to be a lost art and his class actually has very little to do with 9/11. The vast majority of "unsubstantiated claims" regarding 9/11 and the War on Terror come from the U.S. government.

<li><b>KEEP</b>What is the point of being a free encyclopedia if you are not encyclopedic? That is, you take in all viewpoints, and you engage in the free marketplace of ideas. As I read the piece, it seems quite innocuous -- you are simply reporting that he holds "conspiracy theories" and telling who he is. The problem is always, of course, that what one person calls "unsubstantiated" and "inflammatory" (see below), the next person calls "thoughtful" and "substantial." And what the mainstream calls "false" today, it might well call "true" tomorrow. Therefore, simply explaining who this man is and what he claims is definitely adding to a body of knowledge, harms no one, and gives information when someone wants to know. And THAT's a free encyclopedia.--69.85.11.68 02:22, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Before voting, read all the nominator's comments on the discussion page. In my opinion he is unable to objectively argue his nomination. His arguments are fraught with opinion and insults. Kevin Barrett may be a flash-in-the-pan story, but I strongly believe Wikipedia should not fall victim to subjective editing. If this article should be deleted, let someone who can separate their beliefs from the subject matter re-nominate, backed-up with a NPOV. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.122.56.150 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.122.56.150_63fb.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.122.56.150">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>Keep.</b> Wikipedia should not be used to censor "unpopular" opinion. I note also that 60% of New Yorkers surveyed do not accept the official version of the 9/11 Commission, so this hardly qualifies as unpopular, or crazy. The article is reasonable and does not attempt to make judgements on the merit of his claims, only to acknowledge the fact of it. Let's get rid of the thought police. We have enough of that in Washington and the MSM. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.77.137.6 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.77.137.6_7d71.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.77.137.6">contribs</a>).</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Contrary to the utterly unsubstantiated opinion of your editor urging deletion, Barrett’s claims are substantiated by voluminous evidentiary facts adduced and/or summarized by Scholars For 9/11 Truth. He raises crucially important issues which need to be rationally considered by citizens of the world, particularly those in the USA where this information has been politically taboo and censored by corporate media.

<p>Who cares. No one with any understanding of the way in which Wackypedia is edited and censored would consider it a serious source of information, particularly on a politically sensitive topic. Until Wikipedia names its contributors and editors and published a statement of its accounts with explicit information on all funding sources, it must be taken as a mere propaganda tool. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.69.227.181 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.69.227.181_ba2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.69.227.181">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> - I think those of you who see a conspiracy of "censorship" in this AfD nomination should note that almost all established editors here at Wikipedia have supported keeping this article. Even those of us who think very little indeed of this man and his theories believe it should stay. With that in mind, please be less quick to throw around words like "propaganda tool" and "censorship" in reference to this discussion. It doesn't help your position here. -- <b><a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumbleGod_ad8f.html" title="User:HumbleGod">H·G</a></b> (<sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumbleGod_dc3d.html" title="User talk:HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">words</font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_HumbleGod_9674.html" title="Special:Contributions/HumbleGod"><font size="0.5">works</font></a></sub>) 05:31, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I agree with everyone that this subject appears to meet our notability guidelines quite well and is most certainly deserving of inculsion. The only reason for the formatting was to help organize the discussion since a good deal of anon participants were altering other comments and accidently malforming the AfD. I'm glad to see people that are willing to defend the article, now I hope that they can contribute positively to the article. <a href="../../../y/a/n/User%7EYanksox_34ed.html" title="User:Yanksox"><font color="black">Yank</font></a><a href="../../../y/a/n/User_talk%7EYanksox_f66e.html" title="User talk:Yanksox"><font color="red">sox</font></a> 10:49, 18 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
