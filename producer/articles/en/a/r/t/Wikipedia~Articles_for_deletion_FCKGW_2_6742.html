<p>The result was <b>KEEP</b>. The raw vote totals are 4 Delete, 2 Keep, 6 Merge, with two Keep or Merge. Since I <i>don't</i> want to merge the article (see below), I'll use the discretion granted by the latter two and count those as Keep, giving 4-4-6 as the Delete-Keep-Merge totals. There is clearly no numberical consensus to delete, and the Delete arguments are not made strongly, mostly being variations of "per nom", although the nominator does make a good case.</p>
<p>As to merging: first of all, some of the Merge votes are "merge with something", which hardly really counts; the merge target seemed to eventually focus on <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_XP_1c6b.html" title="Windows XP">Windows XP</a>. I don't see this as a good merge target, at all. If this material doesn't deserve its own article, how does it deserve pride of place in an important article such as Windows XP. Merging it into <i>that</i> article would be a significant <i>promotion</i> of the material, and I don't think that all of the Merge commentors thought that through. Further, Windows XP is an important article that potentially contains or could contain a lot of important material, yet has to be kept down to size. Merging in this material would potentially force the removal (or the non-addition) of more important material. The material could perhaps be severely redacted before the merge, but it's not clear to me how to do this, what material could be deleted; it all seems of more or less equal importance. This could be a failure of imagination on my part. Anyway, I don't see Merge as a good result.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don't want to wimp out with a No Consensus. Ten of fourteen commentors thought that the masterial should be retained in some fashion, and that, along with no great weakness of arguments, leads to a Keep result. <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 07:13, 22 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Article about a CD key once used for pirated copies of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft_Windows_48e2.html" title="Microsoft Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. Previously <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_FCKGW_140a.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/FCKGW">kept as no consensus</a>. If there's notability here, it's lost on me. It used to be, before Microsoft started cracking down on such things that you could search for serialz or warez and find your heart's content of CD keys for Windows - so I'm not sure why this one really matters. You probably still can for other things. The only source is from a warez website, so that's not exactly reliable. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 20:28, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep or Merge into... something</b> - While the exact term "FCKGW" was not covered in the media directly (probably for legal reasons) the fact that a copy of Windows XP was pirated more than a month before its official release was. This article would probably work best as a section of an article on Windows piracy, or Microsoft PR nightmares, or something along those lines; while it is a notable event, it is probably not notable enough for its own article. As to the notability of "FCKGW" specifically, Microsoft <i>specifically</i> banned any serial keys containing that string for <i>all</i> their products, even Office. It may be hard to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a>, but the act has promoted "FCKGW" to notable status in many circles. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 23:32, 15 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I can see obvious reasons FCKGW would be banned as being part of a key having nothing to do with piracy (fill in the missing letter U, as appropriate). But is that really a notable event? Everyone has blacklists and I'm sure Microsoft has other strings that they blacklist from being in their product keys as well. As for the piracy ... in my college days, having a copy of a program before it was released was nothing. Guys on my hall played <a href="../../../a/g/e/Age_of_Empires_84ac.html" title="Age of Empires">Age of Empires</a> for a month or so before it came out. (Obviously, now, I have different values and opinions than I did at the time.) I don't know ... maybe it's a minor internet meme or something ... but it just sounds like a warez group wanting to promote itself. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 23:59, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>At the time it was definitely notable, as it affected numerous other pieces of software that (arguably) had not been pirated with that key. As far as being a warez group promoting itself, that would be unnecessary, given that the group received all the attention it could ever want via media coverage of the initial piracy incident. "FCKGW" was just the most memorable part of the key they used. -- <a href="../../../i/k/n/WP%7EIKNOWBEST_f5b0.html" title="WP:IKNOWBEST"><font color="black">Y<b>|</b></font></a><a href="../../../y/u/k/User%7EYukichigai_df60.html" title="User:Yukichigai">yukichigai</a> (<sub><a href="../../../y/u/k/User_talk%7EYukichigai_f252.html" title="User talk:Yukichigai">ramble</a></sub> <small>argue</small> <sup><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Yukichigai_f895.html" title="Special:Contributions/Yukichigai">check</a></sup>) 01:06, 16 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> there are probably three unique sentences here that aren't in other articles. Being released early wasn't anything notable. Microsoft has a six week lag from RTM to Retail. All the beta testers - public and private (few hundred thousand), plus every Microsoft employee/contractor/vendor (about 200,000 people), so having a copy of XP before it was "released" was pretty boring. The only notable thing was that this key was a volume license. Big woop. <a href="../../../s/c/h/User%7ESchmuckyTheCat_0da1.html" title="User:SchmuckyTheCat">SchmuckyTheCat</a> 04:50, 16 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> - While I believe that this should not be a stand-alone article, I do believe it should be kept. Perhaps merge with <a href="../../../w/i/n/Windows_xp.html" title="Windows xp">Windows_xp</a>. I think this article has enough merit to keep, but a blurb about a specific CD Key for Windows XP should belong within the main article. Perhaps under a heading for "Windows XP Release".
