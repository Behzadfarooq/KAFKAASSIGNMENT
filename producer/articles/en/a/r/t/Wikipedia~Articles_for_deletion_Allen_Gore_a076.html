<p>The grandfather of <a href="../../../a/l/_/Al_Gore_0261.html" title="Al Gore">Al Gore</a>. I nominate it for deletion not because I personally think it should be deleted—although I lean in that direction—but because I think that it should be looked at as a case and would be useful as a precedent for similar articles. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 13:56, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>No vote</b>, but isn't 8 hours from creation to VFD notice a little fast? --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 15:04, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, no, it's not. Lots of articles get VfD'd within minutes. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:05, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Uh, yes it is. Obvious nonsense, obvious vanity, and borderline/actual libel; those rightly -- or should rightly -- be listed ASAP, to discourage trolls. But a stub, its virtual ink hardly dry on the virtual page? Practically, the creator should have made some case from the get-go for notability, but to swoop in and slap a VFD tag on something ambiguous without allowing even minimal time for expansion, it seems to me, discourages new editors -- a general violation of <a href="../../../p/l/e/Wikipedia%7EPlease_do_not_bite_the_newcomers_ec77.html" title="Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers">don't bite the newcomers</a>. Still no vote, BTW.--<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> 02:49, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><a href="../../../w/i/n/WP%7EWIN_cc97.html" title="WP:WIN">Wikipedia is not a genealogy database</a>, and, to quote <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Alberta_Williams_King_d669.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Alberta Williams King">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Alberta Williams King</a>: "Most notable people don't deserve separate articles on close family members unless they are notable in their own right". <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gore%2C_Sr._e6dd.html" title="Albert Gore, Sr.">Albert Gore, Sr.</a> establishes notability in the person's own right. Allen Gore does not. And you just know that someone is eventually going to redlink "Claiborn Charles Gore" and "Elizabeth Robinson", causing the inappropriate genealogy database to grow yet further. <b>Delete</b> and remove the dangling hyperlinks from <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gore%2C_Sr._e6dd.html" title="Albert Gore, Sr.">Albert Gore, Sr.</a>. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:13, 2005 Feb 11 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Someone already did link them, actually, before I removed the links. One thing I think about, though, is the question of whether deleting such an article stunts Wikipedia's natural growth. If different people are indicating an interest in starting these articles, is that in itself a <i>de facto</i> indicator of notability? I don't know. I think that for exceptionally famous people, arguably including Al Gore, close relatives within one generation are probably notable enough by association to warrant inclusion. But within two generations? I don't know. Seems like we'd have to draw the line somewhere. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 15:19, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Being a realtive of a notable person does not automaticaly make one notable. And as for Everyking's idea that the creation of the article indicates notability, well, if that's true we might as well shut down VfD and give vanity and vandals run of the place. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 18:46, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Which is a massive oversimplification of what I said. I did nominate the article for deletion, after all. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 19:35, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Everyking did say "If <i>different</i> people are indicating an interest in starting these articles", which is a point that is addressed in the deletion policy (and which is distinct from "if several related people keep re-creating the same article" and "if <i>someone</i> out there is interested enough to start the article".) However, does anything indicate that there was more than one person who thought Allen Gore needed an article? -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:28, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I think an interest in creating articles like this is more of an indication of the editor's obsession with completism than an indication of the subject's notability. -<a href="../../../s/a/t/User%7ESatori_3f9a.html" title="User:Satori">Satori</a> 21:53, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. He might not be notable, but the information is verifiable and would likely be of interest to readers. - <a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimonP_1010.html" title="User:SimonP">SimonP</a> 22:07, Feb 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, being a grandfather of someone notable does not make the grandfather automatically notable. The article doesn't mention any achievements by Allen Gore. We've been through this before on the MLK family and relatives (voted Delete). My vote stays the same on these. <a href="../../../m/e/g/User%7EMegan1967_dd60.html" title="User:Megan1967">Megan1967</a> 23:13, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>.Al Gore's father was as U.S. Senator and therefore notable, but from the article, it doesn't look like Grandpa Gore was notable except as the grandfather and father of prominent politicians, and I don't think that is enough. I'd revise my vote if more information is developed during the next few days. --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 00:49, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>A Google search turns up very little, all based on his being the grandfather of Al Gore. As best I can tell, he was just an ordinary guy. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 01:20, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, I don't we need to take "merge" too literally. On a real merge, you have to worry about the history, for GFDL purposes. But when what is being merged is one sentence, keeping the history isn't much of an issue. In the process of working it into the other article, the sentence probably gets transformed a bit, anyway. In those cases, "Merge" is more "Delete, and work the content in somewhere else". --<a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBM_ad68.html" title="User:BM">BM</a> 13:17, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. According to this Washington Post article, Allen Gore was a humble farmer from Possum Hollow Tennessee. Albert Gore Sr was the first member of the family to go to college.<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/gore100399a.htm/3" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/gore100399a.htm/3" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Unfortunately, Allen Gore is not notable other than the father of Albert Gore Sr. and the grandfather of Albert Gore Jr. <a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECapitalistroadster_f16b.html" title="User:Capitalistroadster">Capitalistroadster</a> 09:21, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Kudos to <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> for proposing this as a test case and doing so in a very professional manner. I also can find no evidence that he was notable in his own right. <b>Delete</b> with a soft recommendation to then redirect to <a href="../../../a/l/b/Albert_Gore%2C_Sr._e6dd.html" title="Albert Gore, Sr.">Albert Gore, Sr.</a> in order to discourage recreation of the article. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 23:54, 12 Feb 2005 (UTC)</li>
