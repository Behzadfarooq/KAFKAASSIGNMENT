<p>The article fails <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, and is fancruft. A collection of conjectured aspects. The article has (cough) "references", but the references are merely points to mentions in fancruft, or spin off fiction (perhaps an author mentioned a rank of "Master Chief Petty Officer of the Starfleet" in one book, and that's therefore justification for conjecturing a rank, where the rank lies, and designing a badge for the conjectured and non-canon rank). The article even states, in one section that <i>"The following are several variations of Admiralty insignia, as proposed in fanon sources of the <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_Expanded_Universe_15ca.html" title="Star Trek Expanded Universe">Star Trek Expanded Universe</a>"</i>. It's full of weasel terms and original work (classic weasel phrases such as <i>"... it is plausible that ..."</i>, <i>"... may be explained by ..."</i> and <i>"It has been also speculated that ..."</i> Completely original research, much of it badly referenced (if at all) and unverified. <b>Delete</b>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 11:03, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>STRONG KEEP (with a cleanup/expansion of article)</b> This article is enourmously referenced and contains no less than <b>17 directly cited sources</b> for the ranks contained within. For that reason <b>ALONE</b>, one cannot seriously talk about deleting it since it is very clearly not original research and provides reference material to back up the claim. The ranks mentioned have also appeared in countless books, manuals, and comic books with some (like Branch Admiral) making live action apperances. In addition, this is but a section of the muc larger article on <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_ranks.html" title="Starfleet ranks">Starfleet ranks</a> and was sub-paged since that article is getting too long. Perhaps a cleanup is needed, but certianly not a deletion on an article which has been worked on for over a year by several different users. I also invite voters to view the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" rel="nofollow">AfD debate on Starfleet ranks</a> which resulted in an overwhealming "Keep" vote.
<ul>
<li>This is a <b>synthesis</b> of various facts, assembling in such a way as to form a collection of conjecture.

<li><b>Comment</b> On looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starfleet_ranks_and_insignia" rel="nofollow">other AfD</a>, it seems to have been based on different concerns — they weren't worried about <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, they were worried about <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTABILITY_ce8c.html" title="WP:NOTABILITY">notability</a>. All the info the other article contains is from official sources. It does link some fan sites, but as useful resources, not as references. So I don't think it sets a precedent for this article. <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, sources aren't enough, they must be <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. "Conjectural", "speculated", "it is plausible", "suggests that", "<a href="../../../f/a/n/Fanon_%28fiction%29.html" title="Fanon (fiction)">fanon</a> sources" means that unfortunately this subject is not suitable for an encyclopædia article. (Clearly a lot of hard work has gone into it though, so why don't you submit it at the <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" class="external text" title="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Star Trek wiki</a>?) <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:25, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The sources look pretty reliable and actually most of them fit the definition of "primary sources" on the very page you reference. Pocket books novels are the main source, followed by at least two live action productions where these insignia apperaed, not to mention material from <a href="../../../f/a/s/FASA_d928.html" title="FASA">FASA</a> roleplaying which is considered quite well referenced. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 11:58, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are the published sources <i>non-trivial</i>? In other words, do they actually have significant coverage of the rank, or do they just mention that some <a href="../../../r/e/d/Redshirt_%28character%29.html" title="Redshirt (character)">redshirt</a> holds it, or show them on-screen with the insignia? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 12:09, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Without getting too deep into it, some ranks which are <i>heavily</i> referenced are <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Admiral_e30a.html" title="Flag Admiral">Flag Admiral</a>, <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_captain_%28Star_Trek%29_8c08.html" title="Fleet captain (Star Trek)">Fleet captain (Star Trek)</a>, <a href="../../../c/o/m/Commodore_%28Star_Trek%29_14fb.html" title="Commodore (Star Trek)">Commodore (Star Trek)</a> with those holding no less than 8 to 10 mentions in Pocket books and FASA manuals. "Second Lieuenant Commander" is a costume error which appeared on the show and Branch Admiral is visable as being worn by <a href="../../../d/e/f/DeForest_Kelly_b914.html" title="DeForest Kelly">DeForest Kelly</a> in <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encounter_at_Farpoint_adb8.html" title="Encounter at Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a> and also mentioned in FASA roleplaying. The "alternate rank pins" are from several sources, such as comic books and tech manuals covering material over a 20 year period. Hey, I am not saying this article couldn't use a major cleanup and some really good ext (I would do that if I had time), just to delete it...that seems like destroying other people's hard work espeically when we went to the trouble to source and reference <i>everything</i>. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 12:14, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But you're using these references - and of the ones I could check, they just seem to be trivial mentions rather than articles / books / sections discussing these ranks - to construct a conjecture of what each rank means, and what its place is in the Star Trek universe. That is original research, which the article is comprised of, from top to tail, and will always be, due to the inherent nature of the topic. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:33, 30 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I dont know what "trivial references" you are speaking of. A rank being mentioned 8 - 10 times in five or six different sources (such as <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flag_Admiral_e30a.html" title="Flag Admiral">Flag Admiral</a>) is a well sourced occurence. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 12:43, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Thats not really a valid reason to delete an article. You admit it has sources, but state it shouldn't be on here because this isn't a Star Trek fan site, but there are hundreds of other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> articles as well as numerous <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Wars_fcb0.html" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a> articles as well. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 11:34, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - You are right there are lots of other <a href="../../../s/t/a/Star_Trek_7a4f.html" title="Star Trek">Star Trek</a> pages which are probably equally irrelevant.

<li>It should also be noted that he had permission to do that after the article was undeleted.

<li>Cat, I am not arguing that the article is not sourced. It is. But the sources are for points of fact which the article uses to conjecture a multitude of fanon Starfleet ranks, and how they relate, both to one another and with the canon ranks. The synthesis of material for your own original work <i>is</i> original research. Did you even bother to read the nomination? <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 12:27, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Fannon if notable is acceptable. The insignia mentioned here is from sources like star trek encyclopedia, a semi-cannon source. The ranks never appeared on the show itself but instead appeared on novels. Something mass published like a trek tech manual meets wikipedias notability criteria. NOR <b>cannot</b> apply since its sourced. Cannon/noncannon is <b>not</b> a deletion criteria.

<li>Wikipedias deletion criteria is not based on cannon. The number of articles there are is irrelevant. There is nothing wrong with memory alpha, however its existance is not a deletion criteria. It would be vanity to have an article per conjectural rank however.

<li><b>COMMENT</b>: I must state that the motivation for this deletion appears to be over a previous VfD which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" rel="nofollow">undeleted</a>, with the nominator stating that this prompted the deletion nomination on this article. This very much appears like an effort to delete the parent article since the sub-article was undeleted and the nominator had an issue with this. If so, this entire VfD should be cancelled as there appears to be conflicting interests at work here. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 11:19, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I'd say there was a clear conflict of interests here. On one side, we have people trying to improve the encyclopedia. One the other, we have people trying to insert crap like this (not merely aspects of a fictional universe, but <i>conjectured</i> aspects, no less). The two positions cannot be reconciled. Either we're writing an encyclopedia, or we're indiscriminately collecting <i>conjectured</i> aspects of a fictional universe. I know, it's a tough call.

<li>As an example of what I'm talking about, the first rank mentioned is warrant officer. This entry is based on an insignia on one character's shirt collar, followed by conjecture (with no sources) on what rank he might be. This is classic OR synthesis (relying on a primary source and then drawing conclusions based on that source). This method is pursued throughout the article and is its fatal flaw. Also, I'm calling the article, not the novels, fancruft. Normally I try to avoid such terms but as this seems a classic case. <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 17:26, 30 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>2. <i>merely points to mentions in fancruft, or spin off fiction</i> clearly shows that they do not understand that the non TV fiction is completely valid and some of those elements have had a major impact on the star trek universe.</li>
<li>3. the sources of the star trek books may not be "cannonal" but that only means that they were not adopted into the official time line. but yes some research <i>may</i> be needed if you want to check those sources. but since when have books been OR?</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - re-adding a comment I made further up the page, in case it hasn't been noticed in all the noise here: "[This] is a verifiable phenomenon (some people like to conjecture about Star Trek insignia for some reason). But as this is not a very notable phenomenon, it doesn't need its own article. Once rewritten, merge back into the Star Trek canon article or a canon section of the Starfleet ranks and insignia article (it will fit if it is made small enough - the large version of the article doesn't belong at Wikipedia)."

<dd>So if I create a rank insignia for a TV show it becomes notable even if the rank appears for a few frames.

<dd>If a rank is created in a Star Trek book, then that can be noted. If an insignia design is given in a book somewhere, then that can be noted as well. If someone writes about a rank insignia appearing in a Star Trek show or film, then that can be noted somewhere. If a website writes lots about different actual and theorised Star Trek insignia, that can be noted somewhere. The insignia can be covered to a certain degree, but the real thing that a Wikipedia article should be focussing on is why this topic is important enough to warrant an article. What impact has this topic had on society in general? Who has written about this topic and why? If no-one bothers to write about it, then it shouldn't be in Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> Maybe the article needs tidying up and some outright speculation removed, but it doesn't need to be deleted. In a lot of cases, if something is non-canon then it's non-notable, but I don't think that's the case with Star Trek - there is so much non-canon information, and some of it is very well known, and I think it's notable in it's own right. The only reason to delete it left is it being badly sourced, but that's not a good reason - we delete articles that aren't sourced at all and can't be sourced, we don't delete articles just because they're not well sourced at the moment. --<a href="../../../t/a/n/User%7ETango_1fa6.html" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> 20:22, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Major rework</b> There are several sections of that article that I believe should go:<br /></li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>- Admiral's insignia section: conjecture on an outside website is still conjecture.<br /></dd>
<dd>- Ranks made by a pin company: If such insignia haven't been shown in a comprehensive work like the Star Trek Encyclopedia, I'm suspicious... it seems like Krusty-branding something for a quick buck.<br /></dd>
<dd>- Costume errors: I do NOT want to see that level of detail in Wikipedia articles. Would you want a Wikipedia article on a certain war movie to show a picture of a background officer's decorations, then spend a paragraph describing how certain ribbons are in the wrong order?<br /></dd>
<dd>Those sections do not meet the article's own standards of "have been mentioned so frequently in literature and fan sources". Some of the other ranks and insignia in the article have a certain level of authenticity, being mentioned in novels or official publications. But leaving the bad sections there brings down the credibility of the whole article. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 12:05, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>None of the article is credible, as it's inherently comprised of conjecture. Reducing to non-original research would leave us with a list of 17 links to occasional references to (mainly non-canon) ranks; many of the links are internal anyway, which is <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">self referencing</a>. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">type</span></a></small> 13:49, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Five of the references are to Wikipedia articles. For example, reference 1, which discusses the non-canon badge of a Lieutenant Commander, is to <a href="../../../i/n/_/In_a_Mirror%2C_Darkly_%28Enterprise_episode%29_4b7a.html" title="In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)">In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)</a> (the second part). This article then contains no mention, at all, of the Lieutenant Commander rank. The episode itself, as far as I can tell from the synopsises I went through (<a href="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/episode/9515.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/episode/9515.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>, <a href="http://www.treknation.com/episodes/enterprise/season4/in_a_mirror_darkly_part_two.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.treknation.com/episodes/enterprise/season4/in_a_mirror_darkly_part_two.shtml" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, and <a href="http://www.greatlink.org/showepisode.asp?episodeid=1350" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.greatlink.org/showepisode.asp?episodeid=1350" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> (and its sublinks)) make no mention of an alternate Lieutenant Commander rank/insignia. So there is clearly conjecture as to the nature of this rank, what it means, etc. I only checked this one in great detail, but a brief run through the others doesn't suggest they are much different. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">Proto</span></a><i>::</i><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none">►</span></a></small> 15:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

In the actual episode the mirror (our) <a href="../../../h/o/s/Hoshi_Sato_6496.html" title="Hoshi Sato">Hoshi Sato</a> is said in dialog "to retire from starfleet with the rank of Lieutenant commander". This information is acquired from the database of the future defiant captured by Tholians in the (evil) mirror universe. That is in dialog and her bio is actually put <a href="http://images.wikia.com/memoryalpha/en/images/7/77/Sato_biographical.jpg" class="external text" title="http://images.wikia.com/memoryalpha/en/images/7/77/Sato_biographical.jpg" rel="nofollow">on screen</a> (there was in fact a post-production commentary about it). I can go into greater detail if you like. So the rank did exist by the time of her retire. However we do not know if the rank existed prior. Hence it is not necessarily canon. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 17:46, 4 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Mainly non-canon" and "many of the links are internal" implies that some of them are valid. We need to look at these ranks, keep the ones based on official sources and remove the rest. Whether the valid ones stay on this page afterwards, or be merged into the main ranks page, is another question - that depends on how many are left.

<dd>Does the ST Encyclopedia really have four different versions of original series flag officer insignia? Sounds damn messy if it does. Re: those fan sites (refs 18 &amp; 19 in the article) - I had a look there, and didn't see any mention of their sources - but if they're from the ST Encyclopedia, that's what should be listed as the reference. Since you've got the images in the table here already, there's no need to reference fan sites which show the same insignia.</dd>
<dd>Based on the comments made here, you'll need to remove all the speculative content if you want the page to survive in any form. (I've known abusive commissioned officers and warrant officers - Kosinski's "disrespect to superior officers" isn't enough to base any claims on where he fits in, or what the next insignia above and below him are. ) <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 16:13, 4 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am not certain. I believe there are different competing sources. There are three versions of star trek encyclopedia. Each updated and sometimes existing data is altered. There are also star trek tech manuals and etc. I believe it is from that kind of citation. I do not posses all the books linked there. Husnock owns all of the books (including the ones I do not have) but unfortunately he is currently deployed and is far away from all his resources. If anyone else has the cited books that would make it easier.</dd>
