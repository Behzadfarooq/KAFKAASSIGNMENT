	    <p>Seems completely inappropriate to delete it because the game has a website (<a href="http://www.lostcolonygame.com" class="external free" title="http://www.lostcolonygame.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lostcolonygame.com</a>) where the developers describe the game, report status, post pictures/screenshots, and host an active forum community. They are releasing incrementally updated pre-release game clients for the public to try out. Given that there is a website, even if Google can't find it, and there is a game client to download, it certainly seems incorrect to say that its a hoax. I vote DO NOT DELETE.

<p>A quick view of the edit history for this article and the official "lost colony" site will make it obvious that a prolific repeat-editor of the article "stateofshock" has a clear association with the company publishing this game, financial interest in the game and quite a blatant conflict of interest -as described in wikipedias strict 'conflict of interest' policy</p>
<p>read here-&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest</a></p>
<p>this is not a 'vote' on weather the article should stay or go, it is a violation of a fundamental rule intended to maintain wikipedia as an impartial &amp; factual source of information.</p>
<p>Editing articles about which you have financial interest is clearly against the rules and i'm afraid should necessitate an intervention every time.</p>
<p>-especially when the whole product is widely believed to lie somewhere between vapourware and an outright scam which systemshock is attempting to 'cover up' here with his multiple edits and also do the same on is own site's forum through banning users and deleting threads that seriously question this.</p>

<ul>
<li>I very much disagree with you that the article should be deleted, but I will start with what I do agree with. Your conflict of intrest argument is correct, StateofShock is a developer of the game and I have said in the main page of the deletion/lostcolony article that I don't agree with SOS making thoes widespread edits that put up info that is more in tune with an advertisement than an wikipedia article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>HOWEVER, I totally disagree with your argument that it should be deleted because some people think it is a scam. There is NO evidence to support that, it is pure speculation. Yes, the developers made some miscomunications about the game, which were rectified on the site and they did take pre-orders before their beta testing, which is why most people speculate it as a not real, but that is in no way verifyable evidence that the game is a scam, it is just some peoples POV on the game, their own speculation, NOT facts.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the article appears to be written like an advertisement, then add a tag that says it requires a cleanup so it doesn't appear that way. If there is information that is not correct or not verifyable, then delete thoes bits of the article. The article itself has merit on wikipedia. TheSittingDuck 19:21, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: As a representative for the game itself, Lost Colony, I am all for deletion of this Wiki article as there are 2 people operating a crusade against it. There's no way we can fairly provide information about the game while both Vashner and OMaHTLD are making up for invalid points and turning them into "Notes" or a hope for "Community Controversy". It's all speculation. All they have done at Wikipedia, according to their logs, is to pick on this game and to stir up more controversy. Yes, there was a thread posted on GarageGames which was CLOSED because of the speculative nature. Lost Colony is VERY much involved with the community, you can see that from our website. All of this fuss is a waste of time and it appears that no one is going to do anything about it. The notes and community sections on the discussion page is more like a "SOAP BOX" than serving a purpose of what the Wiki is about. Enough already. I say get it off Wiki if this is the way it's going to be. Stateofshock 22:05, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
