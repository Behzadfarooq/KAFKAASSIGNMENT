<li><b>Keep</b>Its an association similiar to RTC or BAFTA, i think this is notable as it is a major spawning ground of talent for the british film and television industry, particularly when every school in america has an article and i doubt this notable to anyone outside the US if that. this is notable within the UK.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Form all stations into one article, but don't delete.

This should extend to student and community channels too, even if it only needs one entry for both of these categories. I also fear Capt Jack is correct when he says there's evidence of America-centric behaviour when it comes to Wikipedia, especially in what is allowed to stay and what gets dumped. Also <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMER-C_4926.html" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> please just detail your reasons for deleting the article instead of replying to every vote to keep the articles in question, it does you no credit at all.<font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Kind Regards -</b></font> <a href="../../../h/e/l/User%7EHeligoland_92a7.html" title="User:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Heligoland</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../h/e/l/User_talk%7EHeligoland_4c54.html" title="User talk:Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Talk</b></font></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Heligoland_a022.html" title="Special:Contributions/Heligoland"><font face="Arial" color="#27408B" size="2"><b>Contribs</b></font></a> 11:18, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>KEEP &amp; REWRITE</b> Utterly shocking that this is up for deletion. This is ENTIRELY AGAINST <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>, because NaSTA is a national organisation (the clue is in the acronym), and has been discussed <i>countless times</i> in the national press (if proof is needed, I can provide it). This article must be kept, it can be dramatically improved if needed, and there is no good reason at all to delete it. I'd like to add that the comments made by <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> about UK student TV have been particluarly offensive and ignorant. I know we should all 'assume good faith', but his tone is totally out of order. Honestly this makes me furious, is he suggesting that UK student TV IN IT'S ENTIRETY should be removed from Wikipedia? NaSTA is <i>not</i> an informal organization (that was a mistake in the entry), it is a long standing union of student TV stations, recognised in the UK television indstry. Granted, the article as it stands is pretty poor, but given time it can be expanded into a useful, valid, relevant entry. Being ignorant of this organisations existence is no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJMalky_d682.html" title="User:JMalky">JMalky</a> 11:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Times link refers only to NaSTA as an external link at the bottom of a list; Independent article<a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article347910.ece" class="external autonumber" title="http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article347910.ece" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> appears to be a list of student TV stations, mentioning which ones have won the NaSTA awards - in addition, this article is an inside job and not actual journalism - it is described as a "plug" (i.e. an advertisement in disguise as, or embedded in, an article) on the Nasta forums<a href="http://www.nasta.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=621&amp;sid=baf18e82cf8f2f4cd5bbbca2672f1d87" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.nasta.org.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?t=621&amp;sid=baf18e82cf8f2f4cd5bbbca2672f1d87" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> where it is made clear that the author of the article is in the employ of one of NaSTA's TV stations. The Independent article is consequently an unreliable source (also, media coverage does not automatically translate to encyclopedic notability). NUS is not a news source, and the mention in the link given is trivial - a brief description and an external link <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 04:12, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>KEEP</b> There only a very small number of student TV stations in the UK, and ALL of them are watched by industry profesionals looking for fresh talent - especially at the time of the NaSTAs. and the NaSTAs are SO much more than awards - it's a conference, where we can all meet each other, and meet key industry people etc. NaSTA exists (ask Greg Dyke, he'll tell you!) - and there is no reason it shouldn't exist on Wikipedia...! <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdamhunt_fa0d.html" title="User:Adamhunt">adamhunt</a> 12:56, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see how this fails WP:ORG - it's a large formal organisation (hundreds attend the conference, it covers well over a thousand members of student TV stations), and I've seen a few national newspaper articles (often in the media supplements) on student TV that are centred around NaSTA. I've not got links as most papers don't publish every article (especially features) on the web. It's certainly regarded in the TV industry as the thing to watch for new television talent, and considering that many smaller university-specific student bodies are regarded as notable, this large multi-university media organisation surely must be. The article as stands doesn't do NaSTA justice, I'll try rewriting when I get some time.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomisaac_a693.html" title="User:Tomisaac">Tomisaac</a> 00:13, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>One more comment, from WP:ORG "Organizations are usually notable if the scope of activities are national or international in scale and information can be verified by a third party source" - NaSTA is certainly national in scale, we have third-party sources, (NUS, papers) therefore is notable.<a href="../../../t/o/m/User%7ETomisaac_a693.html" title="User:Tomisaac">Tomisaac</a> 00:14, 18 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, a message was sent out to alert existing Wikipedia users who are aware of NaSTA, in order to let them help safeguard the entry against rampant, uninformed deletionism. There is no guideline against that. Everyone realises that this is not a ballot. On the basis of discussion, it's pretty clear that the entry has been proved valid, as per <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>, but it could certainly use beefing up. While the article subject is most certainly encyclopedic (as the 'pedians above me have proved well, I think), the information as it stands is somewhat lacking. Also, it should probably be moved to <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Student_Television_Association_b887.html" title="National Student Television Association">National Student Television Association</a> and <a href="../../../n/a/s/NaSTA_0ebd.html" title="NaSTA">NaSTA</a> made to be a redirection to the former.
