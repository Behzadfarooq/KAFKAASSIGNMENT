<dd><i>The following discussion is an archived debate of the proposed deletion of the article below. <span style="color:red"><b>Please do not modify it.</b></span> Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">deletion review</a>). No further edits should be made to this page.</i></dd>
</dl>
<p>The result was that no valid conclusion regarding <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EConsensus_ada0.html" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> can be drawn from the debate as it exists. This is not a "no consensus" closing, and <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_binding_decisions_c105.html" title="Wikipedia:No binding decisions">no precedent should be drawn</a> from this nomination.</p>
<p>In the absence of clear policy of factual outcomes, the outcome is determined by <i>vox populi</i>. But a deletion discussion is a <i>sampling excercise</i> to determine consensus, not a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Census.html" title="Census">census</a>. Anything that skews this sampling is a <a href="../../../b/a/d/Bad_thing.html" title="Bad thing">bad thing</a>. There is a clear line between drawing attention to a debate and <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">freeping</a> and that line was clearly crossed in this case. Let there be no mistake: This is behavior that is not tolerated.</p>
<p>However, having examined the interactions on the talk pages at <i>great</i> length, it is impossible to determine what effect this outcome has had on the debate. While the majority of those contacted did not comment, the effects of a message on a talk page are often felt far beyond those who comment directly. Thus this debate is broken beyond repair.</p>
<p>With regards to the arguments raised regarding maintenance and red links, it should be noted that <a href="../../../l/i/s/Wikipedia%7ELists_%28stand-alone_lists%29_504a.html" title="Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)">Wikipedia:Lists (stand-alone lists)</a> states clearly <i>Ideally each entry on the list should have a Wikipedia article...</i> The current list violates the policy on <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>, however these flaws are correctable. Sources are a necesarry <b>but not sufficient</b> condition for inclusion however.</p>
<p>The most positive outcome would be that the tremendous energy devoted to this deletion debate be refocused on attempting to make this list first conform to all policies and guidelines, and then considering a renomination for deletion if required.</p>

A list like this should be treated with care - it is not the only controversial one. I see that a page like <a href="../../../o/l/e/Oleg.html" title="Oleg">Oleg</a> doubles up as a list of every famous Russian called Oleg, and as a redirect page to rulers called Oleg. Calling tango singers "tango musicians" may sometimes be inappropriate (some of them may find it funny themselves) and in the case of my addition to the list, <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Leshchenko_5a53.html" title="Pyotr Leshchenko">Pyotr Leshchenko</a> - who rearranged texts of Russian romance songs to make them conform to Argentine tango, but <i>never (re)composed anything</i> rather contoversial. Most of the singers who are (also) mentioned as tango musicians seem to have done some acting in films. Perhaps that made them "tango <i>musicians</i>" in the popular mind?

<dd>Tobias, please refrain from such personal attacks. I haven't even read any Tango related articles before I nominated this, while going for cleanup of random articles. And I looked at the other article you have mentioned, which is under afd by someone I have never even communicated with. Whether you are under block or not is not a something I know or want to know. So, UNLESS you can show I am part of the global anti-Tango conspiracy, please refrain from making ridiculous claims. I hope you would retract your comments. As I said, my contribution list is open for you to look and find any relation with Tango.

<dd>If you really were not invited by any anti Tobias, or anti tango.info wikipedians, then at least at that front it is fine. Since I have read somewhere that a community my recent attackers belong to use other channels of communication, a contrib list does not really help. But I trust you.

I am really struggling to understand. There have been tango singers in human history, that's pretty clear, what would be wrong with a list that listed a selection of the more notable ones (notable enough to eventually deserve an article, perhaps) and provided some brief biographical details?

<dd><b>Comment</b> <a href="../../../t/a/n/Tango_%28music%29.html" title="Tango (music)">Tango</a> is a popular form of music in the Spanish-speaking world. A tango singer is as definable as a pop singer or an opera singer or a rock singer, or any other type of vocalist that you can think of. Let's not crumble in the face of a trick task, which would be defining "tango singer". Also, we need to come to terms with the fact that lists can and will exist peacefully on Wikipedia. See <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>. Lists are good. People like them. People learn from them. They are accepted. And this is about as legit a list as any other that exists on Wikipedia. Here is a series of axioms for people who like logic:</dd>

<li>This list is of a useful and notable subject</li>
<li>This list can be more than a category (with annotation and explanations)</li>
<li>Any list fulfilling these two requirements should be included</li>

<dd>The membership criteria is essentially "they deserve an article". There's a lot of red links but that is basically because this entire subject seems to have been completely forgotten about. Unfortunately, the upshot of "they deserve an article" is that the real notability concerns are decided by <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but it's inappropriate either to copy and paste that entire definition of notability or to give a link into Wikipedia space. As a compromise what I've done is moved the list to "List of notable tango singers" and put in a scary hidden comment (you'll only see it in <b>edit mode</b>) that basically says "put in a referenced assertion of notability, or your entry will be removed from the list". In this kind of list that's the best that can be done - that doesn't mean it's a write-off. It certainly seems to pass the criteria on <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> which are the ones that really matter here. In fact (and as a person who hangs out at <a href="../../../f/l/c/WP%7EFLC_1027.html" title="WP:FLC">WP:FLC</a> a lot I have some experience in this) this must already be one of Wikipedia's best referenced lists! <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 05:37, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Correct! It is NOT simply a vote, and therefore Tobias's votestacking and the folk who turned up as a result of it, needs to be discounted. You haven't addressed my concerns to my satisfaction, far from it. Correct again, the questions that face this list are the same that face others, but this particular list and its creators, fail to address them successfully. This list would be marginally notable and marginally encyclopedic, even if thoroughly sourced, which it is not. (most lists are not, I comment delete on most lists, but not all) Your argumentatively replying to every comment is not going to work, I don't think.

<li>I don't wish to offend anyone, and I'm sorry if you object to my watchlisting this page.

If I wasn't so weary from writing out my rationale so many times, I'd be happy to tell you again. I realize that I'm half-obsessing on this AfD, but do you have any specific concerns that you would like me to address so that we can call this process a consensus and not an instance of votestacking? <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 17:35, 13 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Go mark (with a reply that the comment is from a votestacked person) all the comments that are from people Tobias notified, that would address one of my concerns, and help the closing admin out a lot (that admin can then evaluate if the comment is just a flippant driveby or a comment that adds to the discussion in a significant way and should be counted toward consensus). The other concern really boils down to this, why is this list on a very obscure topic encyclopedic? Lists of random things are not. Why wouldn't a category do the trick instead? Easier to maintain and a better approach. I only support lists when a clear case is made that the list transcends what a category can do. (for example this one: <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system_f6fc.html" title="List of European Union member states by political system">List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system</a> which adds a lot of information beyond a mere list, it's really an article in disguise) Further, almost every person on this tango singer list is redlinked, meaning that their notability is not even known, much less established satisfactorily (I don't consider the cited sources as verifiable enough to confer notability, sorry) This list, on further reflection, smacks of OR in that the list composers are deciding who is notable and who isn't. ++<a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 18:19, 13 July 2006 (UTC) PS I take no offense at your watchlisting an AfD, I do that too! My issue is that you shouldn't repeat the same points to try to rebut.
<ul>
<li>Honestly I don't think that the closing admin needs any help, because at the moment it seems to be quite on the side of "keep". That was a long comment with many points, so I'll just state a few unrelated sentences.
<ol>
<li>Tango is <i>not</i> obscure in Latin America.</li>
<li>Redlinks allow for the creation of other articles</li>
<li>An expert in Tango music can decide which names are too obscure. Or we could just use google.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Now as far as your votestacking allegations go, I see a slight bit happening with Tobias alerting fellow editors, but I see no problem with alerting all contributors to the page, which is what I did. Hence the raison d'etre of {{adw|pagename}}. Oh and one more thing. I am very consciously making the same points over and over because, well, they're true. Unless they are addressed by the other party to my satisfaction, I'm not going to stop my line of attack. <a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdambiswanger1_7181.html" title="User:Adambiswanger1">AdamBiswanger1</a> 18:34, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My comment was placed because Tobias alerted me. So what? Does it count any less? Are my opinions less important because I didn't have the page in my watchlist and I only found out by an alert user? Tobias was just letting people that potentially cared about the article that they should express their opinions. Mine must have been good enough for two other editors to cite it for their own votes. <a href="../../../s/e/b/User%7ESebastiankessel_8c89.html" title="User:Sebastiankessel">Sebastian Kessel</a> <sup><i><a href="../../../s/e/b/User_talk%7ESebastiankessel_cf55.html" title="User talk:Sebastiankessel">Talk</a></i></sup> 18:27, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>My worst fears about this AfD are coming true. Everyone who voted "keep" will now have to explain how and why they came here. Adam alerted me, I had no idea he was in favour of or against deletion reading his warning. I just feel passionate about this page because when I had finished my <a href="../../../p/y/o/Pyotr_Leshchenko_5a53.html" title="Pyotr Leshchenko">Pyotr Leshchenko</a> article, I was glad to find this list, because I knew that putting him in the tango musician category would be too controversial for some Argentine tango purists (=an ambiguous expression, I know). On the active end, no, I did NOT invite anyone here, even though there may be a few people here who already wrote on my talk page (and definitely NOT about tango). Pure coincidence. I did not want to vote on the other AfD, but as more people there switched to here when the outcome became doubtful, I decided to have a second look there and Mikka convinced me. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 20:23, 14 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>No one accused Adam of votestacking. His polite request was fine. Tobias's request to come and defend, was however not. That's the whole point of refraining from internal spamming. Had Tobias not spammed people with a request to come and "defend", no one would be questioning the keep votes at all. <a href="../../../p/s/c/User%7EPschemp_0806.html" title="User:Pschemp">pschemp</a> | <a href="../../../p/s/c/User_talk%7EPschemp_0325.html" title="User talk:Pschemp">talk</a> 23:02, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>From what I can see, Tobias didn't seem to "spam," he notified users that ought to be notified about this. It doesn't look like many of them came, anyhow.

<li>I think the policy is he should not have used the word "defendernos", except on the Argentina project page. However, we all know that such notifications are usually only sent to people who the notifier knows will vote his way. Of course it is only a survey I am now talking about, but have a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Deir_Yassin/Requested_move" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Battle_of_Deir_Yassin/Requested_move" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> where a user managed to get seven oppose votes in one night against a revert of a name change he did while he was in a period banning him from amongst other things, renames of articles. Of course he did not tell anyone he contacted to vote "oppose" but do you really think he contacted anyone he did not know for sure would vote "oppose" (and on a subject like that one, it is rather easy to know)? And as for what happened here, as<a href="../../../s/y/p/User%7ESyphonbyte_a97f.html" title="User:Syphonbyte">syphonbyte</a> said, the Argentinians are conspicuous by their absence. --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 17:33, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

(being original and requiring work to create) For a comparasion, see the article <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_100_Greatest_Guitarists_of_All_Time_7882.html" title="The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time">The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time</a>, I think that <a href="../../../r/o/l/Rolling_Stone_3229.html" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a> would not appreciate if wikipedia created an article for notable guitarists that just happened to contain everyone on their list.

<dd>So basically: you are damned if you use a notable source and you are damned if you do not. I see by the way that Pschemp and Lar have come here. Ragib?--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 19:11, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, and I forgot. If one of these websites you mean is Tobias's site, I have no doubt that when he returns from his new block, he will state that he is prepared to put the list into the public domain, if that is the problem. Plus: names of singers can be appended to this list as articles about them get written - and some of these articles have already been wtitten and the names appended - so where is the copyright then? --<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 20:23, 14 July 2006 (UTC)

<dd>It's okay, you can chill about the copyrights. A list is copyright but the fact that somebody exists on a list is not. That's one of the reasons that our "list of missing encyclopedia articles" contains a bunch of encyclopedia indexes mixed together. Some of the individual indexes would be copyright, but the collective one is not so. Those lists may be reconstructable from the data, but what is presented is a new list that isn't a simple reproduction of any of the others. The Turkish and Russian tango singers on the list are a guarantee of that. If you don't think "notable" is a strong enough inclusion criteria then where would you set Wikipedia's article inclusion guidelines? All of the articles <i>clearly</i> meet the demands of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> for their work in this field. <b>Please view the page in edit mode</b> where this necessity is reiterated to editors. It would be a violation of <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> to inform readers that "in this context, <i>notable"</i> means that <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is fulfilled", and that is such a long document there's absolutely no point summarizing it. But seriously, isn't the fact that a reliable source has classified them or identified them as a notable tango singer enough? I suspect you'd probably drop in horror at <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_notable_brain_tumor_patients.html" title="List of notable brain tumor patients">List of notable brain tumor patients</a> which is actually a <a href="../../../f/l/_/WP%7EFL_362d.html" title="WP:FL">featured list</a>! Additionally, as the summaries get filled in, ultimately there'll be no need to assert notability from the fact that they are in the list... or rather there <i>will</i> be, because that list is just an index to a series of articles, and precisely those articles from this index will appear as the references for those individuals, but it maybe won't be so obvious as using the flat "appears on this list" template. Besides, what if I renamed those source list references to "this person has a biography on todotango.com" and "This person has had recordings of their singing published (Source: their appearance in the tango.info database)"? Since tango.info only has one url to access the singers' database, that's the only one that would be cited anyway... I hope you see the ridiculousness of the situation? I know Tobias isn't the most popular editor, and yes, it wasn't his greatest ever idea to go messaging, but he certainly didn't contact me. I am here - and I put all that work into this article - because I was surprised (in fact, at turns, outraged) at this nomination, and believe it goes firmly against the guidelines at <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a>. I imagine Tobias was absolutely furious. Being unpopular is one thing, then having an AFD brought against a pretty solid article (although in the state it was in at the time it was nominated, I can understand the decision to bring to AFD... but would rather that the nominator had reviewed <a href="../../../c/l/s/WP%7ECLS_1606.html" title="WP:CLS">WP:CLS</a> thoroughly since that was what was implicitly invoked, and would be genuinely surprised if the nominator had not then chosen to send this to cleanup) must have felt like getting spat on. That's probably why he has got so defensive and engaged in methods that are now ticking other people off. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheGrappler_4371.html" title="User:TheGrappler">TheGrappler</a> 08:56, 15 July 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> "A list is copyright but the fact that somebody exists on a list is not", that I would agree with, as per my original comment. But there is a big difference between mentioning in a specific article that the subject is on a list, and having an article which lists everyone on that list. The latter is reproducing the list, in my view, whereas the former is not. The list of missing encyclopedia articles is a little different, as it is a list of facts, but a list of notable singers is a subjective list and as such is covered differently. With regards to your ridiculous situation, the fact that the bulk of the article comes from just one or two references (and uses the entirety - not a sample - of those references) only increases my copyright concern. If the goal of this list is to have an article for each one (and remember WP:MUSIC is a guideline, it is possible for a singer to "pass" WP:MUSIC and still be deleted in an afd), then it would appear to be covered by a category and possibly this list would be more appropiate as To-do items in project music.

<li><b>Additional Comment</b> Also, if one of those lists comes from a wikipedian's own web site, then even if it was PD'd, I would have concerns about an editor creating articles which use his own web site as the primary reference, as there could be difficulties with OR, as it would be a list of notable singers - where notable is defined by one of the wikipedians editing the article.

<dd>Wonderful, indeed. I retract my contention about an anti-Tobias atmosphere and kaboom! they are here. I have just written that the Argentinians are conspicuous by their absence (they still are, in fact) and yes, someone arrives on the scene accusing the opposers of being racists. Of course, calling "tango" a "very obscure topic" (and i quote VERBATIM) does not help at all.--<a href="../../../p/a/n/User%7EPan_Gerwazy_8ca1.html" title="User:Pan Gerwazy">Pan Gerwazy</a> 00:00, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b>. Furthermore, it could be fleshed out a bit. There seems to be precedent for pages like this. It's a bit irresponsible to put this page up for deletion based on a claim like, "it's not clear at all what merits membership to this list," when the <i>*title*</i> of the article is List of *Tango* singers. Tango, as in the music. If this were a page about singer-songwriters or blues musicians or Rock guitarists, I wonder if it would be up for deletion? Yeah, Tobias has been prolific and quite enthusiastic about Tango but just because the guy made a bunch of pages, it's like we're going to nit-pick every single one, like we're looking at chads in Florida? --<a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntelopeInSearchOfTruth_05c2.html" title="User:AntelopeInSearchOfTruth">Antelope In Search Of Truth</a> 03:51, 17 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete and create a List of notable tango singers</b> - there is merit in this list since it has annotations and references. However, there is no criteria for inclusion so it is open-ended.

<li><b>Comment</b> - So much red ink makes me feel queasy! Despite the first paragraph there is no notability statements/references for most of the people.
