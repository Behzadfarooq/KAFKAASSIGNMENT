<li><b>Delete</b> as per Zoe. Almost every hospital will have a lot of search results, but that does not make them notable. A hospital might be notable if it does unusual work or is a highly regarded research institution. Allen Hospital is not that kind of hospital, and is rather small, too. There's 6,000 hospitals in the United States, and probably 5 to 10 times that many in the world. In addition, articles on hospitals need periodic updating, which would be an enormous task with so many articles. Lists of hospitals by state would be large, but far more manageable. Even a table with basic information, like the city, number of beds and any specialties, like neonatal, would be preferable. -- <a href="../../../k/j/k/User%7EKjkolb_e2d0.html" title="User:Kjkolb">Kjkolb</a> 17:57, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>KEEP</b>. While I see that some people find this to be a non-notable hospital, I'm sure that it matters to the community which is served by it. As for the argument that someone will have to monitor the hospital listings and monitor, isn't that what Wikipedia is, a community of people who contribute where and when its needed? C'mon, small communities matter, too. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 20:25, 30 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Most of the 50,000 hospitals across the world qualify for a WP article under our usual notability standards.

<li>There is no such policy, which is why I used the term "standards". When something has or is affecting the lives of thousands, we generally consider it to be <i>notable</i>. We are currently working on a <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">policy for companies</a>; using the same principles, a hospital with 230 beds and 900 babies delivered each year will more than likely pass such criteria. <a href="../../../o/w/e/User%7EOwenX_7b06.html" title="User:OwenX">Owen×</a> <a href="../../../o/w/e/User_talk%7EOwenX_e744.html" title="User talk:OwenX"><big>☎</big></a> 00:48, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I won't comment about how many people has used my services, and I'm not arguing that a hospital is more notable than me. The question is, how MUCH more? The only arguments I'm seeing for it's inclusion is that A. It's verifyable (which I am too) and that B. Lot of people have used it (which is true of each and every one of my dorms bathrooms).

<li><b>Comment</b> Is notability the chief criteria for keeping articles on Wikipedia, or are we here to voice our comments based on the merit of the subject? If Wikipedia is simply a place to record the notable, then does that make Wikipedia nothing more than a validation of popularity? If so, then the value of Wikipedia is greatly deminished and I for one hope not. <a href="../../../s/k/o/User%7ESkoblentz_f993.html" title="User:Skoblentz">Stu</a> 02:11, 31 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Notability isn't the chief criterion; it's not officially a criterion at all, although it has been a de facto criterion AFAIK since Wikipedia began, certainly for the last two years. Notability is <i>not at all</i> the same thing as popularity. Notability is "The state or quality of being eminent or worthy of notice." Popularity is "The quality or state of being popular, especially the state of being widely admired, accepted, or sought after." In the United States, <a href="../../../o/s/a/Osama_bin_Laden_a745.html" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> is not popular, but is very notable. The composer <a href="../../../a/r/n/Arnold_Schoenberg_ee5c.html" title="Arnold Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a> is also unpopular but notable. It is possible to establish <i>somewhat</i> objective guidelines for what constitutes notability within a given field, and this has been done for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">music</a>, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">biographies</a>, and some others. There are however many fields where Wikipedians are unable to agree on such criteria, and on these, articles must be decided on a case-by-case basis and the decisions can be contentious in the case of borderline articles. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 02:39, 31 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><i><b>I</b></i> would like to be able to know more about the history and role of this particular hospital. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 01:35, 5 November 2005 (UTC)

<li>(1) few other users are likely to have this need, (2)you can't find that out from the information that is here, and (3)if the history of other institution-stubs is evidence, you're not likely going to be able to in the future. I'm also questioning if you'd really like to know more about this specific hospital, or if you'd like to know more in theory about hospitals in general. Can you clarify your position? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">Denni</a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font color="#228822">☯</font></a> 04:21, 5 November 2005 (UTC)</li>
