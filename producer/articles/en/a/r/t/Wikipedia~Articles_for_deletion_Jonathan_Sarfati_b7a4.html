<li><b>Delete</b> By a bit of online research I'd say he is a very minor-character in the world of <a href="../../../c/r/e/Creationism.html" title="Creationism">Creationism</a>. I also think if someone with a bit of knowledge about Aussie Creationism could step up to validate his notability it'd help.

<li><b>Delete</b> He does seem to be a minor figure in creationism. He is a minor author on the subject. He is also a minor figure in chess. From what I can tell his standings appear to be somewhere in the thousands world wide and has never been much higher. Scientifically he has a few articles but so do many. The article is definately way too long for such a minor figure. My take is he is a minor figure in several areas. Seems to be a smart guy with a moderate level of success in an odd array of fields. All of these minor achievements are well spun together into a compelling biography that makes him look important.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - Look, the page is a damned war zone, with huge boxes all over the page about banned editors. The entire article is POV.

<li><b>Comment</b> Uh Ross, the vast majority of the sources are from AiG and its breakaway group. The only genuinely independent sources are for chess aside from some minor criticism. And no, AiG and other creationist ministries are not reliable sources by default.

<li><b>Keep</b>. He is notable. The article is supposed to be about Sarfati, which includes his beliefs. His beliefs are presented as his beliefs, not as truth, and the sources used must surely be considered reliable sources of what his beliefs are. Yet this is somehow claimed to be POV, despite there being a section titled "Writings and criticism", responding to his beliefs. I struggle to find an evolutionist on Wikipedia with a section titled "criticisms" or similar, but on Wikipedia it's considered POV to simply describe a creationist's beliefs. And some of the criticisms are presented as truth, such as "those scientists do not demonstrate any manifestation of religious faith". The only POV in this article is an anti-creationist one. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhilip_J._Rayment_3d07.html" title="User:Philip J. Rayment">Philip J.
