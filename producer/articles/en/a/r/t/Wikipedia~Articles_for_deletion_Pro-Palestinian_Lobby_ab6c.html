<p>The article doesn't make it clear if such a thing actually exists or just is some conspiracy.

<li>That is a summary of the various different groups that were referred to in the media as a/the "China lobby".

<li><b>Delete</b> Reeks of conspiracy theory and POV-pushing. Looking online, although the phrase "pro-Palestinian lobby" is used by various places (and even some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>), usually it's either shorthand to refer to people espousing particular views in an organisation, conference, etc (who and what views varies, and is generally only obvious from either the context or due to a qualifier), part of a description, or used to contrast with the supposed pro-Israeli lobby. Unless someone can cite a reliable source for the information in the document, it needs to go. - <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 20:15, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The phrase has been verifiably used. It is no worse than the China lobby. The page has plenty of potential for development. Some people here seem to think that the very existence of the page is POV, but I disagree - lobbying is an inherent part of the political process and does not carry intrinsically negative connotations. Would you say that a page on people who lobby for the disabled "reeks of POV" or describe it as "POV screed?" Hope not. This is no different. If you think the page is biased change it, but it should certainly exist. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 18:55, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Borderline at best. The phrase "pro-Palestinian lobby" has been used in places meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as shorthand for "the members of some organisation lobbying for some pro-Palestinian (or anti-Israel) action" (where the organisation and actions are implicit from the context) but that doesn't make it worthy of an article IMO. The question is, is it used in the sense described in the article? Remember, the article as it stood alleged that varous groups made up something called the "Pro-Palestinian Lobby", and were all busy spreading Palestinian propaganda. There have been some small improvements since, but I think you can see why I thought (and still think) it has serious POV (and verifiability) issues. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 22:03, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or turn into a category.</b> I think that this is a legitimate grouping. While there is no roof body, this does not change the fact there is a lobby. A lobby doesn't have to be a formal organization. For instance, the US Tobacco Lobby, while containing some organizations dedicated to lobbying, also may be supported by actual companies like Big Tobacco, who are, as such, also part of the lobby. Or for an example relating to Wikipedia, we have our Jewish lobby, our Arab lobby, we have our anti-globalisation lobby, marxist-lobby, and quite a few others. They are just groupings of users who band together and try and have a certain POV (dirty term) be the norm in certain articles. So depending on your definition of lobby - mine being one which I believe is well-definied - there is a pro-Palestinian lobby. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 09:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Most of these groups could care less about the Palestinians. Do they protest against recruitment of Palestinian youth for suicide bombing? Do they protest when Palestinians are mistreated (remember <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_September_in_Jordan_1667.html" title="Black September in Jordan">Black September in Jordan</a>, or Kuwait after 1990, or other Arab countries where they are kept in misery, their rights severely restricted, etc. ←<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumus_sapiens_f37b.html" title="User:Humus sapiens">Humus sapiens</a> <sup><a href="../../../h/u/m/User_talk%7EHumus_sapiens_e014.html" title="User talk:Humus sapiens">ну?</a></sup> 20:36, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I guess most of they don't, because they are lobbying e.g. the US government, who can't do anything directly about any of that stuff.. they probably lobby the US govt for aid money though, which is not in itself anti-israel. <a href="../../../z/a/r/User%7EZargulon_46a4.html" title="User:Zargulon">Zargulon</a> 20:44, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Wrong. Please take a look at the article: this is not about money, but rather about politics. Funny you should mention money: until Hamas came to power, these groups were silent about rampant corruption and outright larceny of money appropriated for Palestinians.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The lobby simply exists, and deserves an article. It recently organized an international conference in Stockholm that raised $500,000,000 for the Gaza Strip alone <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4156688.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/world/4156688.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.

<li><b>Delete until properly sourced</b> Why not move onto a sub page of the user until some real sources are found. It's just unsourced and as such it appears to be OR. Again, find real sources. I say this as the primary author (so far) of the articles <a href="../../../a/r/a/Arab_lobby_in_the_United_States_f3ca.html" title="Arab lobby in the United States">Arab lobby in the United States</a> and <a href="../../../i/s/r/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States_1a95.html" title="Israel lobby in the United States">Israel lobby in the United States</a> -- these two may be attacked as NPOV but no one is claiming that I just made up both subjects because I relied heavily upon reputable sources. --<a href="../../../b/h/o/User%7EBhouston_eea6.html" title="User:Bhouston">Ben Houston</a> 03:10, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

Moreover, as I see it, the Arab lobby is associated more with past events, whereas the Palestinian lobby has began to have some momentum only after 2000 and its future lies ahead. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 09:33, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Aha, now it becomes really interesting. That conference was organized by the governments of Sweden, Norway and Spain. So they constitute this Pro-Palestinian lobby?
