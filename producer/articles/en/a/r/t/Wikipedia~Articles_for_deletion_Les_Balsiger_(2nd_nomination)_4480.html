<p>An editor argues that this is an attack page. I disagree and vote <b>Keep</b>, given the news sources cited in the article. But we should take allegations that something is an attack page seriously, so I'm bringing it here. Note that this is a different Les Balsiger than the subject of the first AFD. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 00:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> This is an attack on this person by some one who is obviously Catholic and disagrees with him. One of the citations is a blog, which is hardly proof of anything and the other citations are all from religous organizations except one which was reporting and attack on this man. He is of no note and this all happened years ago. And if it is a different person the result will be that people who google the name will be confused, it is hardly a name like smith or jones. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_140.211.55.195_9555.html" title="Special:Contributions/140.211.55.195">140.211.55.195</a> (<a href="../../../1/4/0/User_talk%7E140.211.55.195.html" title="User talk:140.211.55.195">talk</a>) 00:33, 11 January 2007 (UTC).</small>

<li><b>Neutral</b> there was POV disparagement in the 'fifteen minutes of fame' opener which I have removed. --<a href="../../../s/l/f/User%7ESlf67_d959.html" title="User:Slf67">Steve <sub>(Slf67)</sub></a> <a href="../../../s/l/f/User_talk%7ESlf67_bed3.html" title="User talk:Slf67"><sup>talk</sup></a> 00:35, 11 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>"Fifteen minues of fame" was just a cute wording not a disparagement; non-encyclopedic style anyway, so your deletion was sure OK. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:04, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the press coverage of this individual is sufficient to make the topic notable. As for POV concerns, those can be addressed, that is not sufficient justification for deletion. <a href="../../../t/s/o/User%7ETSO1D_9399.html" title="User:TSO1D">TSO1D</a> 00:39, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Although the article itself could use a little clean-up, I don't view it as an attack page.<b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b> 01:24, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>This is old information from 1993 and is implying that he "led" a major attack on catholicism. We deleted a page about him before what makes this difference how does user Nawlinwiki "know' that is is not the same person.

<li><b>keep</b>; verifiable and certainly the event was notable. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:02, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> Placing an artricle for deletion with vote "keep" is not best approach IMO. A better solution would be to block the anon for trolling, if he fails to understand wikipedia policies or at least to register, so that it could be possible to tutor him in his talk page. `'<a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> 03:10, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> Notability and verifiability requirements met with non-trivial coverage by multiple, reliable sources. Deletion is rarely the best option for <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> or <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> issues. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 03:34, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> As usual, I'm with Vic. This person was, given the sourcing, notable, and his actions were certainly verifiable. Remove information that violates BLP guidelines, but not sourced information. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 03:55, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Notability has been established and it is sourced. However, it is totally unbalanced, but POV can be addressed. -- <i><a href="../../../a/y/l/User%7EAylahs_cb4e.html" title="User:Aylahs">Aylahs</a> <sup><a href="../../../a/y/l/User_talk%7EAylahs_26bc.html" title="User talk:Aylahs">(talk)</a></sup></i> 05:08, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> The "campaign" (if you can call it that) is notable. I'm not sure, though, that there is enough for a reasonable article about <a href="../../../l/e/s/Les_Balsiger_65cd.html" title="Les Balsiger">Les Balsiger</a> himself, though, as the only sources of information about him are newspaper articles telling about the campaign. It might be better to consider moving the article to a different name ... like the name of his organization or something. --<a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 05:17, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> perhaps move it to his organization would be a better idea I agree with BigDT</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as per <b><a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGanfon_9d3c.html" title="User:Ganfon"><font color="blue">Gan</font></a><a href="../../../g/a/n/User_talk%7EGanfon_eeee.html" title="User talk:Ganfon"><font color="green">fon</font></a></b>. <a href="../../../i/c/e/User%7EIcemuon_5e0d.html" title="User:Icemuon">Icemuon</a> 13:19, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>The ... uh ... nominator is arguing keep, so surely <i>something</i> is wrong with what you wrote here. Do you mean <i>Keep per nom</i>?

<li><b>Comment</b> I think its quite a good article and perhaps if it can be restructered and properly contributed to, it can be kept. Rasillon 20:45, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, it is well-sourced and the subject is notable, I also agree that this is a rather unorthodox AfD - this isn't the place for content issues.--<a href="../../../d/m/z/User%7EDmz5_fdd8.html" title="User:Dmz5"><font color="red"><b>Dmz5</b></font></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dmz5_ab69.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dmz5">*Edits*</a><a href="../../../d/m/z/User_talk%7EDmz5_6fa7.html" title="User talk:Dmz5">*Talk*</a></small> 05:45, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, he seems notable enough. I made some changes in the article to make it more neutral in style. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_Dufour_1d44.html" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> 06:07, 12 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - not quite as well known as <a href="../../../f/r/e/Fred_Phelps_24e6.html" title="Fred Phelps">Fred Phelps</a> but IIRC there are plenty of printed references to him and his activities. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragomiloff_1fd6.html" title="User:Dragomiloff">Dragomiloff</a> 06:03, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>move,</b> do not keep as is unless there is some nformation about the person. As he apparently was acting for an organisation, perhaps the article could be retitled to either "The Protestent" or "Printed Page Ministry". It is the actions not the man who seems to be notable. I cannot determine whether the splinter group with which he is affiliated has a name--it it does, that would be the best title. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 23:20, 15 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
