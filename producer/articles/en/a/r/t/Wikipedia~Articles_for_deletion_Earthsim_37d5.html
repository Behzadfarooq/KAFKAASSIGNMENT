<li><b>Do not delete</b> As an Earthsim user I can say that Earthsim is not really a screensaver, it's a virtual globe system that just happens to have a screensaver option. The whole thing is actually pretty unique. I think the notable bit comes from it's creator, Servan, the Direct 3D guy. Simon531.

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I believe that the article itself is likely more of a stub than an article, but I do not believe that it warrants deletion. I ask that those who are in favor of deletion visit the actual website, and educate themselves about the premise of this virtual globe. It is true that it is a commercial application, and as many commercial endeavours one of the goals is of course to turn a profit. On the other hand today's children are growing up with MTV and console games filling their time, and education has taken a distant back-seat to many other leisure activities. As a parent, and as an educator, a tool like Earthsim is invaluable to engage children into a learning process that utilizes the same elements that their console games utilize. There is no doubt that the current Earthsim is presenting a tiny fraction of Earth science that can be covered. There is also no doubt that this tool could benefit from closer ties with educators for the purpose of content development. Most importantly there is no doubt that any project whose goal it is to provide you with an entertaining method to teach your kids a thing or two about Earth science, any such project deserves your support. Please consider that the WP recommendation is revision before deletion. Perhaps this article could be revised in such a way to outline the science education goals of Earthsim to make the WP entry more relevant to WP's mission. 64North 22:50, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a <a href="../../../t/e/r/Tertiary_source.html" title="Tertiary source">tertiary source</a>. What this means is that we can't go to the actual website and use that as a source (because the source is primary). We need <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verification</a> from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">third-party reliable sources</a>. The WP recommendation is indeed revision, but only with material derived from secondary sources, not primary ones. If secondary sources cannot be found, then deletion is the correct answer. Wikipedia's mission is not to push a point of view (that Earthsim is better than MTV or console games), unless somebody else writes about it first; otherwise, this violates <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. It is also up to the people who don't want this deleted to provide these sources, as they want the article not to be deleted. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 23:38, 5 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reply</b> I really do understand the tertiary source concept. I also understand the NPOV and didn't mean to imply the article should reflect my personal opinion. However, my personal view was stated in regards to deletion to illustrate a potential benefit of Earthsim that may merit to keep the article around if the article were to be edited and perhaps marked as stub. I also believe that the user who asked for deletion did so in such a way that does not follow accepted Wikiquette and he certainly did not follow nomination guidelines which state that someone should "investigate the possibility of rewriting the article yourself (or at least creating a stub on the topic and requesting expansion) instead of deleting it". Be that as it may, the issue is Earthsim itself, and not the behavior of the one who started the deletion process. I am certainly giving the requester the benefit of a doubt as his way of expressing himself may not have been intentional but rather caused by his <a href="../../../b/i/p/Bipolar_disorder.html" title="Bipolar disorder">Bipolar Type I</a> condition. For those who are familiar with WP's inner workings. What would need to be done to convert the article into such a stub that the entry would for the time being be spared from deletion, and deletion can be revisited at a later date should no sufficient progress toward expanding the article be made? 64North 01:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>To expand on that, I see some voted Delete per <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a>. However, <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> states that software entries are notable when "The software is among the core products of a notable software developer or vendor". Considering that Earthsim is a core product of <a href="../../../s/e/r/Servan_Keondjian_29a2.html" title="Servan Keondjian">Servan Keondjian</a>'s <a href="http://www.qubesoft.com" class="external text" title="http://www.qubesoft.com" rel="nofollow">QubeSoft</a>, and Keondjian himself is notable for he is largely responsible for all things <a href="../../../d/i/r/Direct3D_e505.html" title="Direct3D">Direct3D</a>, those votes that reference <a href="../../../s/o/f/WP%7ESOFTWARE_f4ad.html" title="WP:SOFTWARE">WP:SOFTWARE</a> should really be changed to "Do not delete", no? 64North 01:07, 6 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm afraid not. Even if Keondjian is notable (and I believe he is), he does not automatically confer notablity on whatever it is he does. Believe it or not, this is how it works for everybody. It is the sorry truth that very notable individuals usually stand a better chance of being covered by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">respected sources</a> even if they don't deserve it, so it might <i>seem</i> like anything that <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Jobs_f8a1.html" title="Steve Jobs">Steve Jobs</a> does automatically qualifies as notable, but in reality, he just gets followed around by thousands of respected newspapers and articles hanging on his every word. Unfortunately, Mr. Keondjian must work a little harder for his coverage - but if what he is doing is truely notable, it will come - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 20:43, 6 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I think you're misunderstanding what a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reference</a> is. A trivial mention of what games ATI certifies doesn't say anything about Earthsim (and certain does not say anything _in_ the article). A reference should support the article's contents. In addition, blogs are not reliable sources either (that applies to everything from virtualglobes) because anybody can upload them without any quality control whatsoever. The CPU mag mention seems promising - all we need is some more articles like that. <a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 21:24, 9 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
