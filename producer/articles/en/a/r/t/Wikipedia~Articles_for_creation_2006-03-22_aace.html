<p>The fabled neckbeard is an important part of our history. Many men such as the likes of sean connery have pulled off the neckbeard due to their obvious use of previously secret techniques.</p>
<p>The trick to the growing of the neckbeard is all in the flexing. Do you think neckbeards just happen on their own? You've got to WORK for it. Flex those neck muscles Take a look at any of the women around you. Look at how thin and dainty they are, especially in the neck region. They've got no neckbeards because they haven't been flexing their necks. Now you may be thinking what about the italian women? Ahh, but you see, the italien women also have well defined sinew and muscle in their necks. Evidence of good flexing habits, which thus leads to the production of the voloptuous neckbeard.</p>
<p>This is definitive proof that neckbeardedness is directly proportional to the amount of neck flexing one does.</p>

<p>Im not quite sure what it is im looking for but i would like to see an article about this bird. I do know that it is the rarest of the kiwis and that they are noticable for an extremely curved beak. They arent much over 4 lbs, and no more than 1 ft tall and a wingspan of 1.75 in. They can lay only 1 egg 2 if lucky and the breeding season is September to December. The typical diet is the insects and berries located on the island they are found on and the lifespan of the bird(in the wild) is up to 20 yrs (in captivity) 25 yrs.</p>

<p>Mucositis occurs when cancer treatments break down the rapidly divided epithelial cells lining the GI tract, particularly in the oral cavity, leaving the mucosal tissue open to ulceration and infection. Mucositis can occur anywhere along the digestive tract from the mouth to the anus. Oral Mucositis is probably the most common, debilitating complication of cancer surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. It occurs in 20-40% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone and up to 50% of patients receiving combination radiation and chemotherapy, especially those with head and neck cancer. Drugs such as doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and capecitabine are commonly used in breast cancer and frequently associated with oral and GI mucositis. The consequences of mucositis can be mild requiring little intervention to severe (hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and malnutrition) that may result in fatal complications.</p>

<p>TOM PEARSON IS an extremely interesting person, which is good. He loves white daffodils- indeed these are his favourite flour which is also very good. of interest, he very much loves to act which is extremely important information.</p>
<p>Hmmmmmmm....... he makes very good tea (though i must add that this tea on request must be closely supervised by the person who has requested the tea)- it is probably best to ask for a tea with 2 sugarless non sugar- this is a very good idea. \</p>
<p>The tango is groovy, so do the tango and eat a mango, not a banana or go for a sultana.</p>
<p>He is 26 years old and has a keen interest in THE Intentional Fallacy, this is one of the reasons why he is an extremely good actor.</p>

<p>This is a variable species of frog reaching 45mm in length. It is normally brown on the dorsal surface with large lighter or darker patches or raised dots, in some speciemens these patches can be very indistinct to almost non-existant. A triangle shape of the same colour as the patches is present on the snout another larger triangle shape is present behind the eyes, almost looking like a reflection to the one on the snout. The iris is a rusty colour in the upper-half and brown-grey in the bottom. There is a white bar that extends from infront of the eye around the tympanum and to the arm. The upper lip is marbled black and white. The pads on the fingers are small. The underbelly is white and the throat in males is darker.</p>

<p>Despite it's name this species occurs as frequently in Sandstone Heath habitats as it does in Wallum Swamps. It inhabits coastal ares from Stradbroke Island <a href="../../../q/l/d/QLD_c6f4.html" title="QLD">QLD</a> south to the Jervis Bay region <a href="../../../n/s/w/NSW_7fd5.html" title="NSW">NSW</a>.</p>
<p>The call of the male is duck like similar to the of <a href="../../../l/i/t/Litoria_latopalmata.html" title="Litoria latopalmata">Litoria latopalmata</a>, however slower. Males will call on warm night, in Spring and Summer, often after rain. Breeding takes place in anything from large swamps, to creeks, to temporary puddles, which may depend on follow up rainfall to see the tadpoles reach metamorphosis.</p>

<p>SVI (speaker verification and identification) - one of the variants the persons identity may be confirmed. Verification returns the "YES" or "NO" reply, and is used for the systems where only one person has access. Identification is a more complex algorithm - it verifies the identity of the person matching it with the pre-defined idenitity of a group of persons. Identification is used in systems where more than 1 person has access.</p>

<p>Mario Bouvier is an Argentine national, who has since moved to Great Britain, where he now resides. He is best known for his dramatic interpretations in the all-spanish version of William Shakespeare's Hamlet, or Hamleto as it is known in Argentina. Born in 1969 in Rosario, he studied Dramatic Art at the UBA, Universidad de Buenos Aires. Graduating in 1995, he soon became a mainstay in Argentine Theatre, both as a writer and as an actor. "Hoy estoy con ganas de amor", (I'm in a mood for love tonight) his first play was a smashing hit, with drama critic Gerrard Martinez saying "...it is amazing how such a young kid could really touch one's sole, through such a performance..." He has published a few of his plays in a collection, named "Triunfos y Fracasos" in 1998. After the September 11th tragedy, Mario Bouvier was so villified with human nature, that he refused to perform anymore, and moved to Salisbury in Great Britain where he is now hard at work in what he considers to be his lives mission. A full length play explaining to all how love is the most important thing in the world. Although it is rumored that his play, entitled "We Are All The World" is completed, he has stated on numerous ocassions that he will not present his play until an Iraqui Seize fire takes place.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-22_aace.html" title="Edit section: Verde Hot Springs, Arizona">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Verde Hot Springs, Arizona</span></h2>
<p>The Springs were known to many Native Americans for centuries. Calvary Scouts knew about it in the 1880's.  An article from the Prescott Courier December 19, 1903 gave a report of Ex County Supervisor John Wood, who had been using the hot springs for three years. He was rather feeble at the time, and had an Apache Indian known as "Jack" show him the Springs. Jack was about 50 years old, was an ex-army scout, and had been born in the Verde Valley. Mr. Wood's story tells of how the Apache's were subdued by then, but they held the Verde Valley in high esteem because of it's abundance of fishing, hunting, water and the Springs. Legend has it that Indians, when even at war, never fought near the Springs, as they considered them sacred. Mr. Wood noted in the story how remote the Springs were, the water being about 102 degrees, and the 5 acre lagoon of the Verde River. The P &amp; E Railroad was in Mayer, about 25 miles away down a wagon road. This was Dugas Road we know today. As of the date of this news article, Arizona Public Service had yet to extend the road all the way to the Springs. It was this road that the Power Company used to haul all the equipment and generators to the Power Plant in Childs, using 20+ mule teams. The General Crook Trail was in use, but not to the Springs as of yet.Verde Hot Springs was originally known as 'Indian Hot Springs' in the 1880’s and also 'The  Verde Valley Hot Springs' as late as 1903, in various newspaper records of the time. An old miner carved the cave as a home sometime in the 1890's. Sharlot Hall Museum had a picture of him, with his long white beard standing in the front entrance to the cave, but could not find the picture years ago when I went looking for it again. Anyone have it?The Hotel was Incorporated in the State of Arizona by 3 Prescott people, A L Hammon, Robert E Morrison, and E H Meek on October 3rd, 1919. The hotel was finished within the next four years, as there are records from the Prescott Journal Miner, a newspaper out of Prescott at the time. On May 1st, 1923, in the society pages of the paper listed several people visiting the hotel from back east. This is possibly where the photos were taken, but nobody knows for sure.Prescott Journal-Miner published a story on May 2nd, 1923 about the Resort. It stated that Mr. and Mrs. P. A. Warner of New York returned yesterday from a visit to the Verde Hot Springs with E. H. Meek, proprietor of the resort. They found the drive over the 70 mile road to the springs quite easy, the road being in excellent shape except for one or two small places. It is this reference to "the resort" that confirms the hotel was already built by this time.However, by 1924, the place was loosing money, and in June 1924, the Corporation Commission held a hearing which declared the hotel defunct.Good ole Robert Morrison paid the $106.85 in delinquent fees, and they were back in business. As a speakeasy for sure, and probably had a few “fast nurses” there from the Prescott Doctors. People wouldn't travel down the old Dugas Road just to sit in hot water, but they would to drink whiskey and play poker. That’s what they did. There are no records of nefarious Chicago gangsters; it was just the locals having a good time. Sorry, Al Capone was never at the hotel. That’s been a passed down “story” for years about the place, but in interviews and extensive record searches; of even the Capone files, he was never in Arizona, except on a train headed for Alcatraz. The time between 1926 and 1935 was written intermittently in the Society papers of the time, usually listing some big-whig from New York visiting the springs. Floyd Williams and E A Kastner were President and Secretary of the Corporation as of February 1, 1928. Louis H Bunte, a well known Attorney in Prescott was the Statutory Agent. There was an office in Room 9, Lawler Block, Prescott Arizona.An advertisement of the late 1920's, possibly the 1930's said the following:" Verde Hot Springs. Situated as it is, the Verde Hot Springs offers to one seeking health, peace and quiet, an ideal Resort.   In the beautiful Verde Valley, accessible by stage or private auto, is this homelike place, noted for its recuperative possibilities, where the best of everything abounds.   The service is un-excelled, being given every consideration, a first class cook, good beds, baths, wonderful scenery, superb climate and amusements such as fishing and hunting to suit ones pleasure, -and above all, the superior curative waters, especially good for the nerves, kidneys, liver, stomach, asthma, catarrh, and rheumatism"One curiosity was a story in the Prescott Journal-Miner of September 1932 that referred to the resort as both Verde Hot Springs, and The Verde Indian Hot Springs. It seems both names were still universal. The story goes on to say the Springs have no equal, with the Verde River, 3rd largest in the State, teeming with fish, and with no closed season flows past the door of the hotel. Splendid boating and swimming is also to be had and the hunter finds game both large and small. The Hotel was managed by Mrs. Honora Nolan who personally directs the cuisine. Accommodations of the most modern may be had in the Hotel and supplementing the main hostelry are small guest cabins. Mr. E. A. Kastner was a prominent stockholder and also owned the Piggly Wiggly in Prescott, and was available to answer local questions.Arizona Corporation Commission files state that a record of the Stockholders Meeting was held at the Piggly Wiggly in Prescott on September 18th, 1932.About 1936 to 1941, the hotel fell on increasing hard times. The nation was building for war. It was sold to a group of Chiropractors, who let people run around in the nude! What a site indeed. Blanche Bonet told me in 1992 that the Chiropractors tried to have a convalescent center for returning G.I.'s, as did Castle Hot Springs, but the nudity was sort of a put off for some. But the healing health waters were the main attraction, since alcohol was now legal. E H Meek died in July of 1945 at the age of 79. He was born in Nova Scotia on Christmas Day of 1865, and was a lifelong members of the Elks Lodge. Mr. Meek was also a stockbroker, his office later became the Elks Lodge on East Gurley Street in Prescott.Sometime around 1946 is when George Funk started to visit the springs on hunting expeditions. He used to take his daughter there for the curative properties. Mabel Funk had Multiple Sclerosis.In 1948 or 9, Mabel Funk, a Photographer from the Arizona Republic and Blanche Bonet – two sisters bought the place with money from their father, George. It was hard for Mabel to keep being a reporter. One of the last photo-ops she ever did was the historic Navajo Hay Drop in the winter of the late 1940’s. Anyway, they ran the hotel as a hunting and fishing site for years. Blanche lived on for very many years in Camp Verde, she being the billing clerk for the town ambulance service as late as the 1990's.They sold to Elmo and Anna Dunagin sometime in 1952. They were hunting partners of Mabel &amp; Blanche’s father. Mabel’s MS had gotten too bad for her to be at the springs, and her father worried about her.In June 1956, the Dunagin’s sold it to Mildred Welch, who in turn sold it to Joe Romeo. Couldn’t have made that name up, but that’s his name.So we have it July of 1958, Joe Romeo owns the place. He adds 3 feet of concrete decking to the springs and rebuilds the bathhouse walls that sort of stand today, He also added a wire footbridge over to the island. But as fate would have it, he too was loosing money. He was also turned down for a full liquor license in January of 1959, and could only sell beer. He didn’t have the $1,600 for the full license. The Hotel had a full liquor license for years before that. He protested, and finally got a Wine &amp; Beer License. No liquor.He was reprimanded a few times by the Forest Service for charging for camping across the river from the springs. He launched a campaign to close the Mt. Ranch Road (Old Dugas Road) but lost that fight also in May of 1959.On September 3rd, 1959, Joe Romeo transferred the Hotel into the Verde Hot Springs Lodge, Inc. The Hotel was listed as being in a fair state of repair, with fire hazards and a satisfactory toilet. Whoo hoo. Gotta have that.On November 16th, 1960 there was a report to rebuild the bridge to the hotel that was washed out by flood. This is the big concrete slab you see on the path from the old campground. The Tonto Ranger District gave permission, if the Ranch and Arizona Public Service chipped in. They didn’t.On Thursday, January 25th, 1962 it was reported in the Verde Independent that the Hotel was burned to the ground by fire January 19th. Joe was in town at the time. He was caught stealing power by wiring around the meter, and a short in the electrical heaters upstairs caused the fire.Joe was broke, had no hotel, and no backers to rebuild the hotel. He tried a few things, but local bankers would not lend him a dime on property he legally leased from the US Forest Service.  Romeo tried for years to get things rolling again and again. He was also a Bartender at the Elks Lodge in Payson during 1965 to 1967. Don't know if there was a link, but the original incorporator E. H. Meek was also a lifelong Elks member.By 1968, with a Bible Church wanting the property, and Romeo with no money for reconstruction, a demolition order was given. Rebuild or loose the lease. The Church in the end didn’t have good enough plans for the Forest Service. The Hotel was getting filled with Hippies, "listening to Arlo Guthrie music and smoking pot", so the order was given June 9th, 1969: “Obliterate Hotel and Bathhouses. Dump Debris In River”.There went the structure, and more history lost.The rest will be told in future stories that are emailed to us, as we hope to keep the place alive for years to come. Welcome to the Springs. Enjoy!!!</p>

<p>The act of taking a web-site and porting the technology and filters, etc. as well as translating all of the copy and content from English into French. A common use might be to refer to the "Frenchification" project. From the verb "to Frenchify", as in "I am going to Frenchify my web-site."</p>
<p>The corollary is that if you were translating a web-site from French to English, you would be performing Anglification, as in "I am going to Anglify my web-site."</p>
