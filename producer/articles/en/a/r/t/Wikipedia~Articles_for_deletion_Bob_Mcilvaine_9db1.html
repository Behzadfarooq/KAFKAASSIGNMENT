<dd>So he's on a barely notable panel, may be featured in a non-notable movie and is one of thousands of 9/11 victim's families. That doesn't establish notability. In the articles that you mention he's generally one of several people quoted for a particular position. Further, I've been quoted in a handful of newspaper articles do, does that make me inherently notable? <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 13:35, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

User:GabrielF, in initiating the AfD, originally stated incorrectly that he has 183 hits on google, he also failed to mention that this page has 17 sources, including the NYTimes, CNN, The independent, USA Today, even the ultra conservative freerepublic.com.

<dd>I am glad that we have established that this source is mentioned 17 times, in: NYTimes, CNN, The independent, USA Today, even the ultra conservative freerepublic.com. You can spin that fact anyway you want, but the idea that this person is non-notable fails. "I bet you you have more quotes out there from the spokesperson of the department of motor vehicles." What does the motor vehicles have to do with this article? Clever analogies do not prove your point, therefore the person is notable, and therefore the basis of this AfD is questionable. I suggest this article be <b>Speedy kept</b>, since the one policy reason for the AfD have been shown to be fallacious at best, malicious at worst.

<li>Please check my comment below - in a nutshell, the profusion of links at the bottom is basically fluff, with many of the links not mentioning the article's subject <i>at all</i>. Of the major news coverage, two give him 1-2 sentences of coverage, and only the MSNBC interview transcript has him as the primary subject of the coverage.

<li><b>Keep</b>. From what I can tell, he hasn't actually been the subject of any of the articles, just a source. He also apparently hasn't done anything like founding an organization or some other thing that would make him of note. However, he does meet one of my personal criteria: Would somebody see his name in the news, wonder who the guy is, and come to Wikipedia to find out? I also disagree strongly with the notion that he couldn't be notable because of his opinions. <a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWilliam_Pietri_7db0.html" title="User:William Pietri">William Pietri</a> 15:03, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was impressed by the apparent size of this article, but after looking through it, it's apparent that it's largely fluff. The citation of "sources" is misleading. Most of the articles linked only mention the subject's <i>son</i> and not the subject of the article himself. Of the ones that do mention the subject himself, two are effectively listed twice: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/elec04.prez.main/index.html" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/elec04.prez.main/index.html" rel="nofollow">A</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/main/" class="external text" title="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/05/main/" rel="nofollow">A Prime</a> are two different links to the same article, and so are <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lt.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0412/17/lt.01.html" rel="nofollow">B</a> and <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/22/pzn.01.html" class="external text" title="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/22/pzn.01.html" rel="nofollow">B Prime</a>. The stories by the major news outlets mostly give Bob McIlvaine 1-2 sentences of vague exposition. Most of the rest are links to articles on the websites of obscure political fringe groups. It's apparent to me that Striver just googled the guy's name without doing much checking of the content behind the links that popped up. In short, this guy would be notable if his views were getting a significant amount of play, but I'm afraid at this point his views are mostly relegated to obscurity. <a href="../../../m/y/_/User%7EMy_Alt_Account_c155.html" title="User:My Alt Account">My Alt Account</a> 18:45, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>COMMENT</b> Striver would like you to think that, but it really isn't true. If you look in detail at the many articles Striver mentioned you'll see that he is usually a tiny quote in a large article. <i>The Independent</i> article for example (not accessible online) contains SIX PAGES of rememberences from a number of people. The 3/5/2004 CNN article has a one sentence quote from McIlvane and he is one of four 9/11 family members quoted. I can't find the 3/18/05 CNN article but the selection quoted on the website Striver is using as a source doesn't mention Mcilvaine. The BBC article has a one sentence quote from him and he is one of six people quoted. The NYTimes article is a one sentence "Quote of the Day" feature and only says that he attended a 9/11 commission hearing. None of these are notable. <a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabrielF_84d5.html" title="User:GabrielF">GabrielF</a> 21:13, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I am glad that we have established that this source is mentioned 17 times, in: NYTimes, CNN, The independent, USA Today, even the ultra conservative freerepublic.com. You can spin that fact anyway you want, but the idea that this person is non-notable fails. The person is notable, and therefore the basis of this AfD is questionable. I suggest this article be <b>Speedy kept</b>, since the one policy reason for the AfD have been shown to be fallacious. I would also like to bring up the fact that the person who initiated this AfD.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Mcilvaine&amp;diff=74257365&amp;oldid=73944276" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bob_Mcilvaine&amp;diff=74257365&amp;oldid=73944276" rel="nofollow">[4]</a> Did not follow the suggested guidelines of <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_1f6c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion</a> suggested guidelines state, in the very first two sentences: "Before listing an article for deletion here, consider whether a more efficient alternative is appropriate."

<li><b>Delete</b> (and let the sockpuppet party move to another 9/11 conspiracy AfD debate) The links given in the article do not constitute coverage where McIlvaine is the "primary subject of multiple non-trivial published works". Pretty much anyone involved in the 9/11 associations will eventually turn up as quoted in various places. The whole list of references should be trimmed of all such references. Not much would remain, especially since at least two of the articles listed there do not contain his name. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 20:59, 7 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

My idea is that if an article needs tens of sources just to prove that its subject is notable (and fails to do so in view of a majority of people in its AfD), then the subject is <i>not</i> notable enough. About this person in particular, I suggest looking at a similar example: <a href="../../../j/u/a/Juan_Carlos_Blumberg_ae33.html" title="Juan Carlos Blumberg">Juan Carlos Blumberg</a>. For a few months he was just a father who'd lost his son to criminals. Appeared dozens of times in TV and newspapers, but he wasn't notable, just one more of a series of victims, until he led a march demanding security which gathered 200,000 people. <i>That</i> is notable. —<a href="../../../p/a/b/User%7EPablo-flores_ce81.html" title="User:Pablo-flores">Pablo D.
