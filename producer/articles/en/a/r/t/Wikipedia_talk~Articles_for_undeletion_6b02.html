<p>Administrators do not have special insight in undeletion - I think it would be better to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Temporarily undelete pages upon nomination.</li>
<li>Allow all users to comment.</li>
<li>Undelete upon request.</li>
</ol>
<p>The difference between this and DRV would be that this page would be o consider product-based nominations for undeletion, as opposed to process-based, which is something we sorely need. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 15:10, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The "Oh noes it didn't get deleted, try again" stuff at DRV is the biggest problem; it's like a court of infinite appeals. <span class="ipa"><a href="../../../a/l/p/User%7EAlphax_a96c.html" title="User:Alphax">[ælfəks]</a></span> 15:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>This comes close to one of my major complaints about the current deletion system - AfD can be rerun endlessly on product-based reasons - articles that survive one or two AfDs are frequently given a second or third until they finally go. But undeleting on product-based grounds is forbidden. AfDs are "valid" and thus not overturnable if they vote delete, but can be redone freely if they vote keep. That's a fundamental and dangerous imbalance. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil_Sandifer_756a.html" title="User:Phil Sandifer">Phil Sandifer</a> 19:21, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I doubt that there would be enough undeletion requests to merit different processes for each XfD.

<p>So the proposed answer is to create three new processes (this one, miscellany for undeletion, and an undeletion committee election process) and a committee?</p>
<p>How about you figure out what's the easiest way to undelete things: a single page where you can list any deleted page with any reason and if someone who can do undeletions agrees, he can undelete it. But then someone else might come up with another reason to either undelete the thing or keep it deleted and post that reason, which would lead to the old deletion review. Wouldn't it just be better to change DRV to say it shouldn't be about blindly following process, but about the deleted content itself? - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 15:48, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Committee sounds awful. The word makes me want to spork my brain out. But if anyone has an obviously elegant proposal for one, that might be fine.</p>
<p>There are many DRV regulars who want it to be purely for AFD process review. So, make it just that - and make AFU for merit review - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 16:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simple proposal: we should NEVER delete/undelete an article on ground of process violation alone. Its deletion status only chnages if the article itself merits it. If bad admins delete bad things 'out of process', slap the admin if you must (personally I'll give them a barnstar), but don't polute the encyclopedia with wonkery. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 17:01, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Nonsense. if a process isn't followed, and an article is deleted, and someone protests it, it's impossible to get a fair hearing about it under current situations.

<dd>That's grossly disingenuous of you. You know very well DRV resists all possible changes furiously.

<dd>This is true. Look at all the "DRV is not AfD" comments during some reviews. Unless DRV is willing to change to a consensus-based model that looks at more than strict vote counts and ignoring discussion (and my attempts at the talk page have been futile), it becomes a good thing that we're discussing this. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 20:59, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Nobody has tried to fix DRV. They tried to delete it by fait accompli this morning, and that got immediately, and appropriately shot down. As will this, as it doesn't address the core problem. As in, what is the problem with DRV? That has yet to be addressed, let alone to be proven. You can't just go off on a tangent and start addressing how to make this proposal work, if you haven't given us any evidence that this proposal is even needed. And if bandlydrawnjeff has his way, every nonsense article ever written would still be here, so he doesn't want DRV to work, as it would invalidate his contention that every article should be kept. <a href="../../../z/o/e/User%7EZoe_6ab7.html" title="User:Zoe">User:Zoe</a>|<a href="../../../z/o/e/User_talk%7EZoe_73f7.html" title="User talk:Zoe">(talk)</a> 21:33, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First, enough lies about what I'd do if I "had my way." It's old. Second, what'd wrong with DRV? It doesn't take arguments into effect, thus rendering it a majority rule body. Since it's majority rule, it often ignores its calling when dealing with issues of process. So even if the process is broken or ignored, DRV doesn't actually have to take it into effect if enough warm bodies show up to ignore it. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 22:11, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Undeletion takes three "aye".</li>
<li>Majority undelete means undelete</li>
<li><i>(contentious bit, but too bad)</i> The closing admin (<i>it's gonna be an admin</i>) is allowed to allow or disallow votes on the grounds of extreme cluelessless, malice or apparent external votestacking. "Extreme cluelessness" includes reasons that are against policy or are according to a process rather than merit.</li>
</ol>
<p>How's that? The first two were the old VFU rules, the third is a great big "don't be dense" clause. Merit based implies clue rather than process. And, really, a crappy borderline article coming back is not in fact fatal or even harmful to Wikipedia if it's not a copyvio, libel, etc - <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Gerard_df91.html" title="User:David Gerard">David Gerard</a> 21:00, 10 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure if this is needed. The process for merit-based undeletions at the moment seems to be 'go to DRV, mention that you've got new info and make a show of being credible, get it relisted, and survive the resulting AfD'. The only difference between AfU and AfD is in the currently-deleted state of the article. It may be better to simply allow AfDs on deleted articles (under certain restrictions, which no doubt the community will decide on eventually), than invent a new process; and that's almost what we've got at the moment, with DRV acting as a filter. So my proposal is: DRV should allow relistings off just the promise of new info, as long as there isn't a suggestion of gaming the system (and we've got a policy against that, anyway); possibly add a new 'speedy relist' if the DRV workload's getting too high. --<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">ais523</a> 17:07, 11 September 2006 (<a href="../../../a/i/s/User%7EAis523_9dee.html" title="User:Ais523">U</a><a href="../../../a/i/s/User_talk%7EAis523_6ca0.html" title="User talk:Ais523">T</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ais523_df26.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ais523">C</a>)</p>

<dd>You seem to forget that afd is broken too. The purpose of this thing is to create enough concurrently running processes that every editor has one they really like (and you already have 3 for article deletions). If you disagree with this proposal, just create your own process instead of changing the existing ones, the people who actually need to use the processes aren't important. - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobet_31bb.html" title="User:Bobet">Bobet</a> 17:15, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This isn't redundant with AFD, it is redundant with <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>. There are at least three other viable, and more likely to succeed, methods of getting articles that merit inclusion in place.</p>
<ol>
<li>Just write a new article. (Assumes page not protected deleted.) If it is substantially different then prior deleted versions, then G4 doesn't apply. Write it well, so that it won't also be deleted.</li>
<li>Ask at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for a user space copy of the prior version, fix it, and then move it to article space. (Assumes page not protected deleted.) If it is substantially different then prior deleted versions, then G4 doesn't apply. Write it well, so that it won't also be deleted.</li>
<li>Ask at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> for a user space copy of the prior version, fix it, and then ask DRV to review the fixed version. (Assumes page was protected deleted, or the changes are not substantial.) If the changes address the deletion reasons, DRV is likely to let the article back, possibly relisting depending on how well they address it. If the changes don't address the reasons for deletion, DRV shouldn't let it back.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't see AFD or DRV as broken. I also don't see any serious attempt to use the talk page of DRV to change DRV. <a href="../../../g/r/b/User%7EGRBerry_fe84.html" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 19:11, 11 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I agree totally. This page would never ever have been thought of it people were not so up tight about G4. Admittedly, part of it in my view comes from the lack of knowledge about what came before as if a non-admin wants to recreate a page they have to go through a complex process to see what it used to be before getting a chance to improve on whatever that was. Makes for an altogether unnecessary process. I would say G4 on its own is necessary for blatant ignorance of AfD discussion comments but not in the extensive way it is used. <a href="../../../a/n/s/User%7EAnsell_Esperanza_65be.html" title="User:Ansell/Esperanza"><span style="color:#0000FF;">Ans<span style="color:#009000;">e</span>ll</span></a> 09:36, 17 September 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Ah, so we have a cultural problem that people are overusing G4? That's not a good thing; G4 says "substantially similar" for a reason (and obviously a short but sourced article is not substantially similar to a oneliner stub). What I think we should do is create a {{notg4}} with some friendly text like "you just deleted &lt;page&gt; under G4, however please note that it was different so would you please undelete it again, thank you" - and drop that on the talk page of admins that are mistaken in their G4 applications.

<p>Anyone mind talking me through the nuts and bolts of it? I'm interested in the "Undeletion Committee (elected by a quorum of administrators)", how that's going to work.

<p>What he said. It sounds plausible - DRv for process failure only, AfU as an appeal on article merit only. If your article was deleted <i>in process</i>, you can rewrite the article better, or go to AfU. AfU decided by a group of (say) five or ten <i>good editors</i>... but how do you select these good editors? Who will bell the cat? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 06:14, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If I understand this correctly, there is the feeling that <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a> has waxed overly democratic and has failed to undelete certain articles that should not have been deleted. Any examples of this would be nice, though.</p>
<p>By "undeletion on article merit", am I correct that it's about important facts that were overlooked or not present in the AFD debate? E.g. someone writes an article like this</p>
<pre>
Julius Ceasar is this cool guy from Italy and he had a horse that was white.
</pre>
<p>Now I'm sure that'd end up deleted, and someone will go to DRV and claim <i>"Hey wait a second, he was also Emperor of Rome for ten years or so!"</i></p>
<p>Of course I'm exaggerating. But if DRV would refuse to undelete such, it needs serious troutwhacking. If I misunderstood the reason behind this proposal, please enlighten me. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 15:43, 12 September 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think that's correct (notwithstanding the typo of <a href="../../../c/e/a/Ceaser.html" title="Ceaser">Ceaser</a> *grin*). The problem seems to stem from the fact that DRV is <i>described</i> as being democratic and about process violations only, when <i>in practice</i> it frequently allows merit discussions of sufficient weight to be cause for undeletion. Borderline meritorious articles sometimes get relisted, sometimes get encouraged to rewrite the article in a better/non-copyvio way. My two cents, anyway.. -- <i><a href="../../../n/a/e/User%7ENae%27blis_3d56.html" title="User:Nae'blis">nae</a>'<a href="../../../n/a/e/User_talk%7ENae%27blis_9b41.html" title="User talk:Nae'blis">blis</a></i>

<dd>In Radiant!'s original example in this section, the article should be deleted. Anyone who wants to write another article can; G4 only applies to exact or near-exact recreations.

<p>Ok, I like this idea in principle and think it might work. Certainly the lack of ability to examine content on DRV is a serious issue. However, if someone has issues with a deletion both for process reasons and content reasons does that mean we would need two separate discussions of it, one at AfU and one at DRV or would they somehow be combined?</p>
<dl>
<dd>Why wouldn't AfU be for content discussions, and DRV for process discussions? For the first few weeks, there may be some speedy venue changes, but I'd imagine people would get used to it pretty quick. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:44, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>It's a bad idea, and confusing to novice editors, and for many deleted articles there is a conflation of process and content, and DRV has recently been reworded, and it turns out that the header of DRV didn't match actual practice, and as said above you can simply rewrite a better article, and nobody has yet demonstrated the need for this process, and yes you are a process wonk. <a href="../../../r/a/d/User_talk%7ERadiant%21_b4e9.html" title="User talk:Radiant!"><b><font color="#DD0000">&gt;<font color="#FF6600">R<font color="#FF9900">a<font color="#FFCC00">d<font color="#FFEE00">i</font>a</font>n</font>t</font>&lt;</font></b></a> 23:23, 14 September 2006 (UTC)</li>
