<p>Also, this hadith have made Sunnis to reach the following conclusion in regards to interpreting dreams:</p>

<li><s><b>Weak delete</b></s><b>Neutral</b> It is verifiable and it is notable <i>in the context</i> of the Shi'a/Sunni debate but not on its own. As noted in all of the other AFDs for all of these articles to give the context needed would be duplicating information all over the place. How can a tautological statement be so controversial (Some of the shirts were X short and some of them were longer. Huh?)? Are there other references to people's clothing in dreams in Islamic texts? kotepho 00:12, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>It is also notable in Sunni and nothing more context. Didnt you note all the sunni links to the hadith? They view the hadith as one of the major merits of Umar: <a href="http://www.swordofallah.com/html/companionshome.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.swordofallah.com/html/companionshome.htm" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>, <a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/20_umar_bin_al_khattab.htm#Holy%20Prophet's%20Assessment%20Of%20Umar" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/20_umar_bin_al_khattab.htm#Holy%20Prophet's%20Assessment%20Of%20Umar" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>, <a href="http://www.bogvaerker.dk/Bookwright/Umar.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.bogvaerker.dk/Bookwright/Umar.html" rel="nofollow">[8]</a>, <a href="http://www.pbuh.us/prophetMuhammad.php?f=Re_10_UmarIbnalKhattab" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pbuh.us/prophetMuhammad.php?f=Re_10_UmarIbnalKhattab" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.</dd>

<dd>Its Sunni alone notable, its dream interpretation notable, its Sunni-Shi'a debate notable. Heck, its much more notable than <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_1%7E5.html" title="Matthew 1:5">Matthew 1:5</a>. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 00:36, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It is only notable in the context of other things. As I said in the other AFD put <a href="../../../5/_/_/Matthew_1%7E5.html" title="Matthew 1:5">Matthew 1:5</a> up for AFD and I'll vote to axe it. Why can't this be covered in <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> and <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_view_of_Umar_bcd7.html" title="Shi'a view of Umar">Shi'a view of Umar</a>? As it stands just reading the article you are not likely to know who Umar even <i>is</i> from just reading it and if you add the needed context to all of the other ones you end up with having to add context to multiple articles instead of putting them all in one place. kotepho 01:45, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Basicly, both Shi'a and Sunnis use the hadith, so it does not belong to either "Shi'a view" or "Sunni view" of Umar, in that case it would be duplicated in both of them, and its better to just link here. Also, the narration has to detailed content to be added in the main article, it would be tossed out in a minute. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:18, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Also, it would need to be duplicated in disscusions in <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Uthman%27s_modesty_4228.html" title="Hadith of Uthman's modesty">Hadith of Uthman's modesty</a> and the hadith of Abu Bakrs belief. In short, when a hadith touches many subjects, its better to have give it its own article and have the details covered there, and just linking to the hadith from other articles. For example, the <a href="../../../h/a/d/Hadith_of_Umar%27s_speech_of_forbidding_Mut%27ah_b0bc.html" title="Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah">Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah</a> tuches subjects like <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahih_Bukhari_0b24.html" title="Sahih Bukhari">Sahih Bukhari</a>, <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stoning.html" title="Stoning">Stoning</a>, Abrogation in the Qur'an, <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikah_Mut%27ah_1acf.html" title="Nikah Mut'ah">Nikah Mut'ah</a>, <a href="../../../i/b/n/Ibn_Abbas_d33f.html" title="Ibn Abbas">Ibn Abbas</a>, <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a> and so on... Its best to just give the hadith here and link to it, rather than duplicating it everywhere. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 02:23, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have changed my vote to neutral as I do not believe I have enough knowledge of the subject matter to decide where it goes.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b> despite bad faith nomination. Looking at an earlier version of the page, there was a citation. It was explicitly mentioned under the <b>Reference</b> section. If you had a question about the source, the corresponding talk page should have used. However, this article should not exist, nor should other hadith articles. Despite Striver's example of Matthew:5 or whatever verse he keeps flaunting as precedence, I still don't think each individual hadith needs an individual article. Perhaps <a href="../../../z/o/r/User%7EZora_4918.html" title="User:Zora">Zora's</a> suggestion to create a Hadith cited by Shi'a article should be considered and these hadith could be merged their, instead of having thousands of individual articles floating around. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 13:37, 12 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>So, pepsi, do we duplicate it all over the place? What article should it be merged to? Remeber that all the info about the Shi'a and Sunni view of the hadith needs to follow on the merge.

<li><b>Delete or merge</b>. We're missing a whole layer of articles necessary to make individual hadith articles worthwhile. There is no way that will help users systematically understand these hadith in context which might explain the importance of this.
