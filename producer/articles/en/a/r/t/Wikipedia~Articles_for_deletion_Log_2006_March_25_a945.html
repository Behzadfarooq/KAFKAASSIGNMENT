<li><b>Keep</b>. According to <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, a band is notable if it "Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise notable." In this case, there are two members (Alex Marquez, Dennis Munoz) who have previously been members of notable bands (in Marquez' case, 3 notable bands). I expect the music this band will make will be unlistenable crap, but it's not appropriate to indulge my (or anyone else's) taste to exclude the band when it clearly meets the stated criteria for inclusion. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 01:06, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Windseye kaleidoscopes are no longer being made. These kaleidoscopes have been featured in Cozy Baker's book, "Through the Kaleidoscope" published in 1985 and featured at many arts and craft shows throughout Florida during the 1970s and 1980s. The kaleidoscopes developed pushed the envelope of creative design in kaleidocopes and were the forerunners of many existing kaleidoscope designs available today.

<p>Approxiamtely 40,000 of Windseye kaleidoscopes were created and made available in over 500 galleries and gift shops around the world in the 20 years of production. First and 2nd place prizes were won at the Coconut Grove Festival, FL, in 1982 and 1983. The kaleidoscopes were featured in many newspaper accounts during the 1970s and 1980s. Notability is a subjective word; the kaleidoscopes did exist historically, were unique and innovative, and more significant than arbitrary subjective judgments.

Ok, here's some notability: <a href="http://members.tripod.com/kaleidoscopemuseum/djohnson.html" class="external free" title="http://members.tripod.com/kaleidoscopemuseum/djohnson.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/kaleidoscopemuseum/djohnson.html</a> And check out the original Cozy Baker book on K'scopes... "Through the Kaleidoscope" Note that acknowledgement on this page regarding the marble kaleidoscope design--- the use of marbles was a first in 1979. All other scopes using marbles were based on this design. Over the years the design evolved to accomodate marbles of different size (7/8" to 1 1/2"). (I'll find more references and when I am resident at home with a scanner I'll scan in newspaper and magazzine articles.) Windseye 18:42, 25 March 2006 (UTC)Doug Johnson</p>

<p>All binocular style kaleidoscopes created within the last 30 years or so stem from the models created starting in 1983 which include the BINOC with two wheels, the SUPERBINOC made with dichroic mirror on the sides and in the wheels, the ROLABINOC suing an oil filled object case, and a MARBINOC feturing a large handmade marble.</p>
<p>Use of dichroic mirror as integral to the mirror system as well as in the object cases of the scopes, be they wheels, kevels, oil filled tubes, satellites, gyrosats or whatever, originated with Windseye in 1978-- all use of dichroic mirror in the last 28 years was inspirewd by the creations of Windseye.

<li>Considering that the existing practice for byelections is to discuss them in the article on the preceding general election rather than separate articles, there would also be the option of merging this into the 2003 Green candidates list. Maybe not the best option, but I offer it for discussion. At any rate, I'd favour <b>merging</b> this somewhere if possible, but <b>keep</b> if there isn't a viable merge option. The consensus <i>has</i> tended to favour <i>permitting</i> some kind of coverage of electoral candidates. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:01, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. If you delete this article, you'd better go through all the other campaign articles and delete the pages for "marginal" candidates that lost - like Natural Law party, which is way more marginal than this one. BTW, the national Green party fielded candidates in every riding across Canada - to me that makes the Green Party influential and notable. Furthermore, the Green Party aims to have serious political effects and is succeeding - the other parties are picking up planks out of the Green Party platform - unlike the situation with those other marginal parties.</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Fielding candidates in open democracies like the US and Canada is so easy that I hesitate to label someone as notable just because they were on the ballot. There are two candidates in this race who are even more obscure than Tretter (for a total of six on the ballot), though one of them seems to hold some sort of record for number of elections lost, which might be a claim to fame. In the US, the Libertarians routinely field candidates in most congressional districts. I wouldn't describe them as notable. <a href="../../../f/a/n/User%7EFan-1967_4c2f.html" title="User:Fan-1967">Fan1967</a> 19:55, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Yes, it's an exhibition, but bearing in mind that it is for public institutions (i.e art galleries) I think that it should be considered differently from a commercial work.

Finally, <b>Massive Change</b> has managed to receive some measure of international recognition.

<li>We do need some central discussion. We seem to decide these matters, by who happens to show up for each AFD, which is not good, as we've been very inconsistent. A middle-ground guideline (or extension of an existing guideline) is what's needed.

<li><b>Comment</b> please, I beg of you Buffy fans, do not take this as an attack against the show. I've seen it, I thought it was good, I have nothing against it. I have nominated similar articles for deletion that were about shows that I was a huge fan of. And giving an element of a show it's own article doesn't make it more or less important or even signify any such thing. I bet Buffy wore shoes on more than one episode, but you don't see List of Buffy's shoes, do you?

<p>Personally I think it was OK to start with and still deserved to be kept, but I just made a major updating of the article anyway (so check it out again) including a table listing all their appearences and all their songs. They were a pretty big part of <i>Buffy</i> IMO, and this article is very useful to people want to know more about this fictional band, or track down the real thing. Also they were pretty good -- <a href="../../../p/a/x/User%7EPaxomen_1d28.html" title="User:Paxomen">Paxomen</a> 05:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> As an Oz-tralian myself who well remembers the Chamberlain case, and also no particular fan of Buffy (looks around nervously for possible bolts of lightning from the heavens - or hells), I say it's a still a notable enough article which may need a bit of clean-up (agree with Ned that non-Buffy references belong in <a href="../../../a/z/a/Azaria_Chamberlain_disappearance_b947.html" title="Azaria Chamberlain disappearance">Azaria Chamberlain disappearance</a>, not here) but doesn't deserve deletion.

<li><b>Keep</b> The article I wrote about Brian Head Ski Resort in southern Utah was tagged for deletion by OhNoItsJamie about an hour ago. I find it rather unfair that he referenced Wikipedia notability criteria in his given reason for the tagging. There is no notability precedent for ski resorts or anything similar, and as far as general notability goes, I find that this resort probably passes muster, seeing as a Google search will reveal several unaffiliated webpages written about the resort.<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrillemeister_2179.html" title="User:Brillemeister">Brillemeister</a> 05:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: 60,000 google hits is enough for me. Besides that, its Utah's highest-elevation resort, was the location for a recent missing skier situation, and is probably the most significant resort in southern Utah, an area known internationally for its national parks and outdoor activities. Plus, with Utah's reputation (or slogan) for the "greatest snow on earth" I think most ski resorts in the state qualify for notability. --<a href="../../../h/e/t/User%7EHetar_0d92.html" title="User:Hetar">Hetar</a> 07:06, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I vote to keep it. Wikipedia is a prominent resource precisely because it is ecumenical, allowing both canonized intellectual entries while acting as a critical gloss on pop culture items. This has firmly entered pop culture since its explosion on ebaumsworld website, where there is a video clip of kids getting an unwitting grandmother to ask for "a lumpkin". This jest is specifically about her ignorance of vernacular, vulgar or not, and the purpose of Wikipedia should be to provide a resource with knowledge to eliminate our ignorance. This should be broad-based knowledge, whether highbrow, lowbrow, tasteful, or tasteless. This is not a case of promotiing a term of hate, discrimination, racism, or something similarly damaging. I can see the argument against Wikipedia allowing those sorts of things, as they abrogate people's fundamental rights, but this is mere squeamishness. As long as the wording of the entry is not vulgar (which it currently is not), I think it should stay. <small>—This <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.55.47.129 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.55.47.129_19e0.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.55.47.129">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as unverifiable, with elements of patent nonsense. The Times article is real, but the article distorts it significantly; other sources show how far off target the article appears to be -- <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_012805_hurt.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_012805_hurt.html" rel="nofollow">[7]</a> <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0129-30.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0129-30.htm" rel="nofollow">[8]</a> for example give different accounts. Bottom line -- all that's verifiable is that it was a military code phrase; just what it refers/referred to has only been fuzzily described at best, and there's no verifiable evidence that it's currently used for any purpose after its public disclosure. And "unconstitutional" because it may violate a statute? That's patent nonsense. There's probably an article to be written about the code phrase, but this article is written about a "program" that doesn't exist, according to the article's own references. <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 14:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey 'tito' I'd like to lnow what do you mean with 'weasel words' and 'unsourced'. I already posted the RAE and blog links who prove that the word exists, and since racial slurs are also 'weasel words', they should be deleted too, isn't? Please do explain yourself or retire this article from deletion. It hurts no one, it can be improved, that's true and maybe you, in a gesture of greatness and sportmanship could help.

<p>Mods, please remove the deletion warning. Improve the article, don't delete it. The reasons have been listed above and this is only a personal vendetta of sorts because some people feel uncomfortable with the word 'culturoso'. If wiki articles on racial slurs exist, this one should be able to exist, as an endemic word of sorts, at the very least.

<li>So, you're implying that we're comfortable with racial slurs but not comfortable with "culturoso", and that's the only reason they're on here? I searched the RAE website and couldn't find anything on this term. Upon further review, though, I'll change my vote to <b>weak keep</b>, because there is a lot of relevant context that I missed. But that kind of accusation doesn't help things. <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a> is what matters here, and I really doubt anyone here has a personal vendetta against this word. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font></a><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font color="blue">master</font></a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Grandmasterka_b497.html" title="Special:Contributions/Grandmasterka"><font color="green">ka</font></a> 07:38, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>I'm not implying anything. I'm very sad that the librarians in Wiki.es couldn't act professionally and erased the article (and called 'vandals' all the people who even dared to send the article to consideration) due to personal reasons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I saw that they also erased the word 'joto', who's a mexican and latinamerican slur for gay people because some person felt uncomfortable with the word. The world knows that I feel uncomfortable being called a beaner or a wetback, but that doesn't mean the word shouldn't be listed there, if all, as a warning notice of intolerance of sorts.</p>
<p>Regarding you not finding the word 'culturoso' in the RAE, I'm sorry and I don't mean this in any disrespectful way, but I did a search in the following adress <a href="http://buscon.rae.es/diccionario/drae.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://buscon.rae.es/diccionario/drae.htm" rel="nofollow">[10]</a> and found this "culturoso, sa.</p>
<pre>
1. adj. despect. coloq. Arg., Cuba y Ven. Que aparenta tener alta formación cultural."
</pre>
<p>Perhaps it has something to do with the fact you're not a native spanish speaker, but the word exists and it's out there and its relevant in Northern Mexico and Southern California, at least.</p>
<p>As for the word popping up in google.com.mx and the 3rd result being the wiki.es article, I read something in that discussion regarding how they were going to link that article (the mods, I mean) so it would be considered for deletion on other wikis. Is that fair? Or a personal vendetta?</p>
<p>I leave that to your consideration.</p>
<p>Improve, don't delete.</p>
<p>I'd like to cast a vote to keep and improve this article, thank you.</p>

<p>Since there is no way to prove "officially" (1) whether or not the Masked Magician ever changed his name to Val Valentino, this page should be deleted.</p>
<p>I would recommend restarting the Masked Magician page as opposed to creating a Leonard Monatono page, because the "magic community" only <i>speculated</i> that Lenny was the culprit -- they never had firm proof.</p>
<p>~)~</p>
<p>1) There is no way to prove this on the Internet, even through the background check sites. (2) I believe that such a verification must be done at the Los Angeles County Clerk's Office, but I also believe that the investigator would have to prove that sh/e is related to the subject that s/he is investigating. Therefore, none of us can <b>ever</b> verify the name change and the page stands for deletion.</p>
<p>1A) However, if the Masked Magician <i>did</i> change his name, odds are that his birth certificate was sealed, so <b>no one</b> could prove that the change did or did not occur, even if they <i>were</i> related.</p>
<p>2) Intelius, at least, says that there are no records for a "Leonard Monatono" (in whatever fashion you would want to spell it <i>and</i> using a wild card) anywhere in the United States. However, a complete background check for Val Valentino of Las Vegas, Nevada (where the Masked Magician is purported to be living) does not reveal whether or not a name change occurred, <b>ever</b>.</p>

<dd>It is ridiculous to suggest an article for deletion simply because there is one unverifiable source. The rest of the page concerning his life is well-written. Why remove an entire article simply because a name change can not be proven? There is no way to prove that there was or wasn't a name change. Why not just add something to the effect of "Valentino may have changed his name" rather than state, as a matter of fact, "he DID change his name?" It would be much simpler, and the NPOV tag that you disagree with so much would not have to be added. Jogabbeyjr 06:32, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> per Jogabbeyjr; assuming arguendo that the subject is notable and that the article is generally sourced, deletion does not seem at all appropriate where the content to which an editor objects (as unsourced) can be changed readily and without respect to 95 per cent of the article. <a href="../../../j/a/h/User%7EJahiegel_783f.html" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 06:41, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Two more things on that note: 1) <i>Yes</i>, there's an official website, but the bio there is full of pompous, unverifiable B.S., so it's useless to our cause. 2) Am I the <i>only</i> user here who has used "may" in an article before and been chastised for printing speculation? The "may" solution is easy, but are you going to stand by and defend its usage when some other well-meaning editor comes by and deletes it because <i>they</i> feel it's "speculation"? <a href="../../../d/r/y/User%7EDRyelle_2a29.html" title="User:DRyelle">Daya</a> 07:07, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>OMG, why are you going to delete a page because "There is no official proof?" GEEZE. Go look on any other Masked Magician sites, and it says it's Val. omg, whoever wants to delete this page obviously has too much time on his hands, and obviously has nothing better to do. You must have something against this owner, because that is RIDICULOUS. Who do u think you are? Some perfectionist? Jesus. Just keep the freaking page. It's RIGHT. If you honestly don't think it is, then you need to watch Live with Regis and KElly WHERE HE ACTUALLY SAID HIS NAME WAS VAL. omg, so you're not going to TAKE THE OWN GUYS WORD?

His birth name and/or current full legal name should be included in the article, but I don't see what they have to do with whether the article should exist or what its main title should be. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 01:26, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>KJF512 is actually on my side, but he was confused on who wanted the delete.&#160;:&gt;</li>
<li>The page appears to be a copy-and-paste from IMDb because I wrote both biographies, but with just a little change. I also wrote the bio on TV.com, but it appears completely different because it's quite subjective and rather early. (I wrote TV first, then made it objective for IMDb. Later, I wrote the one for Wiki afresh and have tried -- vainly -- to get IMDb and TV to change.)</li>
<li>The inability to prove what precisely his name is is half the deletion question. (The other being that I cannot cite 99% of the information I put into this article, rendering it unverifiable.)</li>
<li>I am in favor of resurrecting the Masked Magician page and tossing this one. (It was dumped in favor of this one by request of <a href="../../../d/b/e/User%7EDbenbenn_44bf.html" title="User:Dbenbenn">User:Dbenbenn</a> in February.) Do we all agree that this is a good idea?

<li><b>Comment</b>: This "new vote" makes no sense. The votes are clear above, and do not need refactoring. Four of the five users listed above as "Position Unclear" explicitly voted <b>keep</b>; the fifth (Kyle, is clearly voting <b>keep</b> by implication of his comments. While I don't believe this is a bad-faith nomination, it appears to be by a user who is unfamiliar with both <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">criteria for deletion</a> and the AfD process. I would suggest that this be speedily closed (as <b>keep</b>, or at least <b>no consensus</b>), and the issues about sourcing, the name change, the article title, etc., be taken up on the article's <a href="../../../v/a/l/Talk%7EVal_Valentino_d0d9.html" title="Talk:Val Valentino">talk page</a>, and not here on AfD. <a href="../../../m/c/b/User%7EMCB_427d.html" title="User:MCB">MCB</a> 05:36, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

A large percentage of the players (75%+) are from Toronto or somewhere nearby, and I thought it would be very informative to people who search it just like I did.

<p>Both Toronto poker and Toronto poker network should get a speedy delete for lack of notability, amazingly endless vandalism and dishonesty. This site is not an online poker cardroom, but rather just an affiliate doorway to a cardroom. There is no there there.

<dd>I agree with deletion of the article right now. I disagree with the idea of locking it for the future. The communication from the user on my <a href="../../../t/k/e/User_talk%7ETKE_bf64.html" title="User talk:TKE">Talk</a> page shows good faith by the user that it's not blatant spam. I've been perusing the site, and it's as legit as any other gaming website. The user also admits that this is the first time doing anything with Wikipedia, and perhaps they didn't pick the right topic and their revisions weren't vandalism as much as confusion. I pointed out on their talk page about what is drawing the RfD; it's notability is second to the rapid changes to the article, which quickly became mush.

<dd>The page is blatant spam, and the user is blatant vandal and spammer. Saying he is editing in good faith is outrageous. He has created duplicate articles; blanked and removed afd tags; replaced links to official sites for personalities to his garbage site; created duplicate articles with the same spam garbage; and then most obviously, the site being promoted is not "legit as any other gaming site". That is absurd. There is no "gaming site". It's just an affiliate doorway to Island Poker. Enough time has been wasted on this blatant and dishonest vandal spamming. The user should be blocked and these idiotic articles never allowed to return. <a href="../../../2/0/0/User%7E2005.html" title="User:2005">2005</a> 22:10, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable website. Vanity article by User:Wyvern920 (and sock puppet Nojkceb). Alexa has no traffic data for it. -- <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> 06:34, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>RHaworth, I have been involved in some of the editing of Wyvern920.com so I am indeed connected with the site. However, I do not see this entry as shameless self-promotion. As we try to grow Wyvern920 into a more widely read news-humor blog I think a wiki description and history are acceptable. I do see your point that the article might appear as a mere vanity article, but since a rather small number of people know the complete, detailed history of the site, I think it is appropriate that we do the writing. Any suggestions as to improve the entry would be appreciated. --Nojkceb 07:40, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> I can understand why you would want to delete this page, as it may seem pointless. Yet there is no harm in having it up, it is just a character that our D&amp;D community has built, and we would like to let other people take a look. It has a decent amount of writing, and there doesn't seem to be a major reason to delete it, although it does seem pointless to you. -Sniper28</li>
<li><b>Question</b> Also, I wanted to know how to make the second part of celer's physical description to be not italicized, and if that can't be done I wanted to know how to make the entire thing italicized.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not disputing that the <i>PC Format</i> bit is unverifiable, because it is verifiable. However, what else is there, besides just the inclusion on a bundled CD? Some random forum posts aren't generally suitable for inclusion here because who posted them isn't verifiable, nor are they likely to be reliable and/or reputable (by Wikipedia standards) with respect to the topic at hand.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Further Comment</b> - This will probably end up as a no consensus as I'm too late. Being placed onto the the disk of a gaming magazine doesn't make anything inherently notable. If being featured on a coverdisk is notability, then pretty much every single player Quake level is notable. I'm a keen gamer and keep tabs on the Counter-Strike and Half-Life communities, if this was a big machinima launch, I would have heard of it. Look around on Google and there's about 150 unique links for "over the counter-strike", this machinima is hardly covered anywhere, a single line news post here, a forum thread there. There aren't any reliable reviews for this, off the top of my head I can think of a handful of single player Half-Life maps which have garnered more attention than this and still aren't notable enough. And I'm pretty sure whoever wrote this massive article has direct ties to the guys who made the movie, it's a vanity piece. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 04:17, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Good point. Should Lukas publish 6 books and file a lawsuit to claim his throne, I would support his notability. Or if a movement backing his rights to the throne becomes notable. Until then, let's give the 8 year old a bit of privacy. <a href="../../../g/r/u/User%7EGRuban_6db9.html" title="User:GRuban">GRuban</a> 18:24, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>That's setting the bar way too high for me. As for his privacy, well, he may not have chosen to be born a prince, but it's a cross he will have to bear for the rest of his life.

<li>I think the point Gene Nygaard was making regarding Edward III's descendants was that merely being one does not make a single one of those millions of people notable. If they have articles here, it's because they're notable for something else. Also, regarding GRuban's point, I agree—to a point. I agree that Lukas et al have to do something notable before they merit inclusion, though I agree with JJay that it doesn't have to be six books and a lawsuit just because that's what Henri did. Finally, regarding the boy having been born a prince—no he wasn't, he was born the grandson of someone who was a Tsar decades upon decades ago. If he's notable as a "prince", then where do we draw the line to prevent millions of Edward III's descendants from making vanity articles? --<a href="../../../i/c/a/User%7EIcarus3_dcf6.html" title="User:Icarus3">Icarus</a> 23:53, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>Exactly—that is my point. I don't know whether I am descended from Edward III, but maybe I should start working on the tens of thousands of descendants of his ancestors who were monarchs in various still-existing monarchies (as well as various no-longer-existing ones such as Kiev and Italy) which I do have in my genealogy database, if that makes us all notable. I should even get to count kings of Castile or kings of Essex or whatever, since Spain and the UK are still monarchies, don't I? <a href="../../../g/e/n/User%7EGene_Nygaard_634f.html" title="User:Gene Nygaard">Gene Nygaard</a> 15:48, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

To delete it for not being there would be wrong, because, well there is lots of evidence; however I understand John's concerns about vandalism. It is an encyclopedia article on something that is changing constantly - bars / pubs open and close all the time. It has produced some notable music acts that are referenced in Wikipedia.

Note that the vast majority of callsigns back then were issued in sequential order starting with WxAx and then WxBx; i.e. the WNBA callsign was most likely just the license issued between WMBZ and WNBB, which probably could have included Pacific ships or Atlantic ship-to-shore stations at that time. In short: WNBA (AM) only existed in the late 1920s for 3 years at most, was of no particular notability, and will probably never have or need a Wikipedia article.</li>

<p><i>BEC</i></p>
<p>Promocija knjige o dogadjajima na prostorima bivse SFRJ</p>
<p>Ambasador SRJ u Becu Mihajlo Kovac ocenio je sinoc da je objavljivanje knjige "Putovanje u zemlju ratova - dozivljaj stranca u Jugoslaviji" znacajno jer je oznacilo "razbijanje crno-belog" klisea o dobrim i losim narodima, agresorima i zrtvama. Prilikom prezentacije knjige, austrijskog autora Kurta Keprunera, Kovac je kazao da knjiga daje razlog "da se ne nadje mir u snovima". Jugoslovenski ambasador je dodao da mnogi Austrijanci sada verovatno nece prihvatiti takvu knjigu, ali da ce Austrija u buducnosti biti zahvalna ljudima poput Keprunera. Predsednik Austrijsko-jugoslovensko drustvo (AJD), koje je organizovalo promociju knjige, Peter DJokic predstavio je njenog autora koji poslednjih 12 godina zivi u Nemackoj i koji je delo napisao inspirisan licnim poznanstvima i iskustvima na prostoru bivse Jugoslavije. Kepruner je kazao da je u bivsu Jugoslaviju dosao pre 10 godina i da su ga dogadjaji u toj zemlji inspirisali da u jednoj knjizi ovekoveci svoja vidjenja cetiri rata. Kepruner je, izmedju ostalog, podsetio na "brutalne primere" medijskih manipulacija sredstava javnog informisanja u Austriji i Nemackoj. On je naveo primer kada je grupa hrvatskih fanatika, potpomognuta policijom, 2. maja 1991. godine u Zadru izvela pogrom, poznat kao "Dalmatinska kristalna noc" kada je demolirano i opljackano 116 srpskih lokala. Taj dogadjaj zapadni mediji su precutali iako je Jugoslavija bila u sredistu zbivanja, istakao je Kepruner. On je, navodeci i druge primere medijske manipulacije, kritikovao zapadnu stampu zbog iskrivljene slike o uzrocima i akterima krize u bivsoj Jugoslaviji. Kepruner je, takodje, ocenio da ne bi bilo pravedno svu krivicu pripisati stranim sredstvima javnog informisanja i zapadnim politicarima, jer deo odgovornosti snose i lokalni akteri.</p>

<dd>In short, it is a news in which ambasador of SRY in Vienna talks on promotion of a book of Kurt Kepruner, in which it is explained that events such as Dalmatinska kristalna noc were not promoted in western media, and in fact it is referred by Kepruner as a "brutal example" of media manipulation in Austria and Germany (i.e. the selective presentation of information). So, it is no surprise you cant find any reference to this event in western media. This book, I think, can also be quoted as a source - I will find more details. The sources DO NOT HAVE TO BE ONLINE (and this book is not online). <a href="../../../p/u/r/User%7EPurqer_1569.html" title="User:Purqer">Purqer</a> 05:48, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b> - I'm shocked that someone would want to delete this article. Although, I do have a problem with the name of the article, it should be called "Dalmatian Kristallnacht", that is the more correct term of what happened. Also, the incident is probably not as important as other incidents that lead to the Balkan wars, but it certainly deserves an article. Secondly, there ARE Google results, but just as Purqer said, the info doesn't have to be online in order for the article to exsist. I suggest to all people who's best argument is "No Google results" - read more books, and spend less time in front of the computer.

Even though the event is sad, it was talked about in only 4 lines of the transcript, which could suggest the importance of the event, even to the Serb side. Damage to anyone's and everyone's property was widespread during the war, with cities being razored to the ground, so I don't know why this particular event should stand out..</li>

<dd>First, determine if the event is worthy of an article in itself (as opposed to a being just one of a zillion atrocities committed by all sides in the former Yugoslavia during that period); determine what it is called by other people than Milosevic; and get independent verification of the events described. Are there any neutral (neither Serb nor Croat) descriptions of the incident? "Well, too bad" indeed. (I do note that the that translation sourced from the Free Republic mentions the event, and footnotes the reference to two books written a decade after the purported event.) --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 04:54, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>By the way, Milosevic is not the one that described that incident as "Kristallnacht", it was described in "<i>Travels in the Land of War: Experiences of a Stranger in Yugoslavia</i>" by Kurt Kepruner (Austrian-born author from Germany). Here's what he wrote: <i>The Tudjman regime began with a purge of all non-Croats in state offices. Serbian journalists in the media were fired. Serb teachers were fired. The Croatian media organized a campaign against Serbs and everything Serbian, Yugoslavia, and the JNA. Croatian superiority and racism were promoted.</i></dd>

<dd>Kepruner was told: “<i>Serbs are inferior to Croats, they have smaller skulls and smaller brains. Croatia is for Croats only, while Serbs are deemed a minority. Armed Croat interior ministry troops were encouraged to attack Serbs. The Serbian Cyrillic alphabet was outlawed. Serbs were evicted from government housing. Streets were renamed after Nazi/Ustasha leaders such as Mile Budak, a racist ideologue of the NDH regime. The Croat police and military forces began wearing the “U” symbol which had the same symbolism as a Nazi swastika. The police tolerated private acts of ethnic cleansing and terror against “Croatian Serbs” which Kepruner described as a “Dalmatian Kristallnacht”</i>".</dd>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> This article is nothing more than one of those sordid pieces of propaganda that served to justify Milosevic's wars in the former Yugoslavia and bring Serbian minorities in a state of nationalistic histeria. Furthermore, and more shockingly, the reference is being made to a Kristallnacht in which Nazis carried out pogroms over Jews and destroyed their property. That is unforgivably scandalous and should be enough to see the article dispatched into a cyber-oblivion. Also, an event of this magnitude would have undoubtedly caught the attention of the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague.

<dd>Your reasoning is flawed. In fact, for events in Gospic the Tribunal was involved, and Norac was persecuted. Not so for events in Zadar and Trogir. That only speaks of the selectivity of ICTY - it does not claim to be competent for NATO war crimes, nor for what happened in May in Zadar nor it does investigate crimes against Serbs nearly as much as it should. It has even admitted that, saying that Serbs are responsible for not givnig enough evidence (!!). The paralels with Nazis are quite in place, knowing what Ustashi have done in WWII, and they were drawn by a German for that sake, and also by Feral Tribune, a purely croatian newspaper. The regime of Franjo Tudjman, that changed a name of a square in Zagreb from the square of victims of fascism to square of <a href="../../../m/i/l/Mile_Budak_46e4.html" title="Mile Budak">Mile Budak</a> - was in many ways, to Serbs in Croatia, reminiscent of NDH. In fact, <a href="../../../e/d/o/Edo_Murtic_5c34.html" title="Edo Murtic">Edo Murtic</a>, a prominent Croatian, has reported that Tudjman has told him that he intends to finsh what Pavelic has started, and that 250,000 serbs can pack their siutcases (1/3 killed in NDH, 1/3 expelled in 95, 1/3 to be assimilated). That he in fact expelled more than 1/2, and that from 12% number of Serbs fell to 3% is well known. EurowikiJ has an agenda to hide this side of the story, as have the Croatian users, but Croatian POV is certainly quite biased. The term 'hrvatska sutnja' is a well known term for the attitude of coverup in Croatia - do not make waves, and the crimes of Croatians will be forgotten - they think. Well, not so on wikipedia. Wikipedia policies say that ALL sides of a story should be presented in a NPOV way, and should not be supressed just because some nation with nazi-past wants to hide it. It is a valid article just as any other, and persecution of Serbs were real - the Serbian victims of the pogroms in Croatia will have their voice!

<li>Nobody is saying that there was not such persecution; certainly there was, by all sides. There are two questions here: is the deliberately inflammatory neologism "Zadar Kristallnacht" or "Dalmation Kristallnacht" an appropriate title for the event, given that neither of them have other than minimal use <i>in English</i> (the language of this encyclopedia)? And is there enough information about this event to warrant a seperate article rather than a piece in a more generic article about ethnic cleansings during the post-Tito years in the former Yugoslavia? --<a href="../../../j/p/g/User%7EJpgordon_73d0.html" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a><a href="../../../j/p/g/User_talk%7EJpgordon_1c5c.html" title="User talk:Jpgordon">∇∆∇∆</a> 19:51, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>there is plenty of information about the event - even on internet, just type "dalmatian kristallnacht". there is a whole book on the events in dalmatia - quoted as a source in the article. Note that the author of the book is neither Serbian nor Croatian, but an Austrian. He has used the title Dalmatian Kristallnacht, among others, and that alone makes it an article deserving its place. There is also an article by Sultz, or what was her name, quoted also in references - and that is online, in english, and there are plenty of other google hits. There are numerous accounts of these events in Serbian and Croatian media. <a href="../../../f/e/r/Feral_Tribune_3c4d.html" title="Feral Tribune">Feral Tribune</a>, A CROATIAN newspaper has called these events kristallnacht. So, the events are well documented and substantial. The fact that something is reported in media/books earns this thing a place here, according to the stated policies of wikipedia. The "Zadar Kristallnacht" was perhaps a bad choice of a title, but Dalmatian Kristallnacht - as the events are refered to commonly - has plenty of hits on google. Had the article been titled like this, google check would have given you satisfactory support and this whole deletion would not have been proposed - note that NONE of the original reasons for listing this in AfD hold with the title Dalmatian Kristallnacht - plenty of google hits, lots of testimonies by third parties (neither Serbs nor Croats), even a book, etc. As for the use of Kristallnacht itself, it is not an English word, but it is used in English for the events in Germany. The title is derived from this, so that is why it should be called Dalmatian Kristallnacht (and indeed is in articles in english) rather than Crystal night - it is a language question. That you might find the title inflamatory, is your POV, the only thing that matters is that there are events which are reffered to by this name (Dalmatinska Kristalna noc in Serbian and Croatian, and the proper translation, which is indeed used in English, is Dalmatian Kristallnacht, as you can see from Google hits). Many other pieces of POV in media that Serbs find inflamatory exist - for instance, detention camps in Bosnia of Bosnian Serbs were called "concentration camps" even though they were quite different, not withstanding the atrocities, but they were not concentration camps as there were in WWII, then calling some events massacres, and not the others. The inflamatory language was used to demonize Serbs, and that is quite widespread. So, inflamatory language exists and it is POV to judge what is inflamatory and what is proper - wiki should just REPORT things, as they are called by others, report, not judge. And in this case, Dalmatian Kristallnacht is how it is called - by Serbs, Croats, and indeed by third parties. That is name of the event, that you find it objectionable is not an issue.

<dd>Not to rain on your parade here Pirkovank, but i get really annoyed when Serb extremists try and equate modern state of Croatia with NDH. Croatia was thoroughly de-ustashized in the 45 years following WW2, same as Germany, and noone in the right mind can claim that those people acted out of the same motives as the fascist government of NDH. It's the same bullshit Serbs have been trying to push for the last 20 years. While it is true that some of the radical elements entered Croatian politics after 1990., mainly through former post-WW2 emigrants from US and Canada, it is malicious to say that their respective ideologies shaped Croatian politics in the 1990s. A certain degree of right wing influence did exist, but Tudjman was a former partisan and a marxist for chrissakes! Only in his later years, when he started to push for more Croatian autonomy in the Yugoslavia did he come under persecution of communist authorities, as did so many emminent Croatian politicians, most of them marxists themselves. The term Croatian Silence refers to the period between 1971 to 1991 when all political activity towards greater autonomy for Croatia within Yugoslavia was deemed "dangerous" and "disrupitive". Your twisting of the term is not only malicious, it is offensive to the greatest degree! And besides, who can argue that in 1990 the goal of Croatian politics was, as ever only more autonomy? No ill intent towards the Serbs was implied. It was Slobodan Milosevic and his cronies that decided to use the political climate of the end of the Cold War to try and realise the dream of Greater Serbia, and are therefore DIRECTLY RESPONISBLE for all the wars of Yugoslavian sucession. In fact, were it not for Milosevic and the Greater Serbian extremists, Yugoslavia could have seceded peacefully, much like Czecho-Slovakia. And that's THE TRUTH. And no amount od manipulation of facts on the part of your buddies here can change that fact. So, while i do support the notion that no truth should be hidden in Wikipedia, the malicious bias of this article make it most deserving of DELETION. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 21:37, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And I get really annoyed when Croatian extremists try to equate the position of all Serbs with that of Greater Serbia - Serbs in Croatia were truly frightened from what was going on, and you can choose to be blind about that but that is how it was. You claim that noone in the right mind can claim that the motives of Tudjman were similar to that of NDH. And then you proceed to claim that actions of Serbian side, and opinions of those who speak merely of SERB SUFFERING AND PERSECUTION are those who want Greater Serbia. Well, to me that proposition is just as laughable and in sick mind as the other claim seems to you. You just fail to see the other side of the story - you are probably brainwashed and think that all Serbs wanted greater Serbia. That is far from truth. In fact, Serbs in Croatia were frightened - and how they could not have been, when their houses and churches were painted with neo-nazi grafitti, when their houses were blown up and their parents or granparents HAVE LIVED THROUGH THIS in WWII and were expecting the worst. Your suggestion that it was they who wanted Greater Serbia was insultive and malicious. But you fail to see that. That Milosevic wanted Greater Serbia is a Croatian myth, all he wanted was power for himself, and serbian nationalists (and there were some who actually wanted Greater Serbia, just like there were those in Croatia who wanted NDH back - but they were far more minor from what your Croatian propaganda machine has brainwashed you into thinking) blame him for that. What happened and how and why Yugoslavia fell apart is far from undisputed and Serbs and Croats will probably never agree about that. Your POV is not more justified that that of Serbs just because it is yours. Wikipedia has contributors who disagree about many issues, and the principle that opinions should be presented nevertheless. You want to exclude the side of the story that you dont like. Learn some tolerance - there are people who see things differently than you do, not because they are for Greater Serbia, but because they have different point of view and come from different backgrounds and you should respect that, and supress your bias and hatred.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b> or at the very least merge. This is really quite typical of Greater Serbian propaganda, trying to blow up individual incidents out of all proportions to make it seem like the Serbian side is the victim of organized persecution and therefore justified in its actions. Let's not forget, May 2nd 1991 is the date of the Borovo Selo incident where nearly 40 croatian policemen were killed or wounded and their bodies mutilated while trying to disarm armed Serbian rebels who had killed 2 of their colleagues a day before, while they were on routine patrol. The bloody images were aired on Croatian Television later that day which started riots in many Croatian cities. While the loss of life and property is most regretable, most of those responsible were brought to justice. It certainly cannot be argued that the event was planned or that it represented any kind of "ethnic cleansing" type activity on the Croatian side. The claims of the "british reporter" are also very much biased. While it is true that many Croatian cities saw the emergence of NDH related graffiti in those days, any sociologist would argue that it was done out of spite, pure frustration. People tend to choose strong symbols when put in similar situations, but that does not necessarily mean they believe in ideology behind it. It's a statement of revolt, of spite, and desperation. Besides, present day Croatia has only 5% representation of the extreme right option in its parliament (and even this does not represent the most extreme elements) while present day Serbia has these political options represented around 30% . It goes to show that this so-called "Neo-ustashe" ideology did not stick nearly as well as those Greater Serbian propagandists want you to think. But I digress. In any case, this theme does not deserve a separate article and should be deleted or merged. --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 21:19, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Why is this article a Greater Serbian propaganda, while it merely speak of suffering of Serbs. To you, everything written from point of view of Serbs is Greater Serbian propaganda. One might say that everything written from your point of view is Ustasha propaganda - and indeed that is how it seems to many Serbs. Cool down, and try to understand other point of view, and learn to be respectful even if you disagree. As for your rationalizations, put things into perspective. The original Kristallnacht had a killing as its cause - a killing that was USED BY NAZI MEDIA to provoke rampage on Jews. Dont you think Germans were just as revolted, frustrated, did it out of spite towards jews due to this propaganda before Kristallnacht happened, just as you say Croats were. Does that excuse them from responsibility. You speak of Borovo incident, yet title of article here is Borovo massacre - should that perhaps be deleted as Croatian propaganda with inflamatory title? If that was the cause (moreover, the hysterical reporting in Croatian media) than that should be part of the article. You fail to see that the whole story of Grater Serbia was in fact used (and is still used) by Croatian media to cause this frustration and hatred towards Serbs, just as Serbs have been frightened by NDH - and indeed, they had real reasons to be frightened. If media is to blame for what happened in YU (and I think they share great part of responsibility as they spread hatred on all sides) that should also be explained here. There is never going to be any compromise if people just stick to their POV instead of reporting things and events in NPOV - and in the case of ex-Yu war, there is another side to the story that you refuse to hear and want to erase.

<dd>Here's the thing - articles that can't be supported by verifiable sources are considered original research. You can look up the NOR policy of Wikipedia to understand why that's a strict no-no. And frankly, even those few sources that you do cite are strongly biased and can't be taken at face value. There are no official reports on this, no hard numbers, no nothing. Just another myth Serbs use today to excuse themselves of all responsibility. And you may be surprised but I'm really quite familiar with the political situation in modern Serbia and have visited several times in the past few years. I think I can objectively say that the Serb nation today, if it were viewed as a person, suffers from a case of amnesia, denial and PTSD. There's a strong political movement to blame everything on Milosevic as if noone else had anything to do with the genocide and the nationalist expansionism and everything else. There is also a very strong media campaign still ongoing that tries to equate the position of Serbs, Croats and Muslims in Yugoslavia, so as to make it like everyone is equally to blame for everything that happened. The truth however is, that Serbs controlled virtually ALL the military capacities of YNA and were therefore in a vastly superior position in 1991, they were the fiercest in their agressive expansionist nationalism and were by far the largest of all Former Yugoslavia nationalities. It was only due to a lack of political vision on the part of Serb leaders, and a lack of loyalty on the part of the squabbling clans within Serbia proper that the whole Yugoslavia wasn't absorbed in a matter of months. But then we wouldn't be having this conversation now, would we? In any case, I don't even try to claim that there are no level-headed people in Serbia today, as in those days, but the fact that the Serbian Radical Party can get 30% of the vote in 2005. means that nothing has changed significantly in the past 20 years. Serbia needs to face up to the facts, nothing can change before that happens. And by supporting flawed, biased and unnecessarily inflammatory articles like this one that serves only to propagate modern Serbian myths you are directly preventing that from happening any time soon. I mean, for fvck sake, even completely neutral observers in this very thread are claiming this is nothing but pure propaganda, what more do you need?? --<a href="../../../d/r/2E/User%7EDr.Gonzo_7efd.html" title="User:Dr.Gonzo">Dr.Gonzo</a> 21:24, 28 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>First of all, this topic is clearly not original research. Read what NOR says, and you will see it plainly, as others have already noted. Second, you just have admitted that even in your twisted understanding of Serbian issues, Serbs have their POV that is different from yours. For all wikipedia is concerned, it does not care who is right - all that matters is what is out there, it should not even attempt to determine what the truth is - that would be OR. It has to report about ISSUES. And the issue clearly exists. That so many Serbs feel that they are not treated fairly in the Western media is no secret. For instance, some polls put number of Serbs who think ICTY is biased against Serbs at close to 90%, while supporters of what might be called nationalist position have less than 40% now, which is indeed up from 25% 6 years ago, largely due to the tribunal bias. Serbian Radical party, FYI, does not earn votes on nationalist issues so much as on economic issues and percieved corruption of new government. I for instance am neither their nor SPS supporter, but am much more symphatetic to their point of view than in the 90s, as are many other. The thing which is not understood by people like you is that Serbs are not denying their responsibility, but objecting to the twisted view that they are to blame for everything, and that Croats and all others were innocent, or vastly less responsible than Serbs. That is simply not true - Tudjman has openly admitted that there would be no war had Croatia not wanted it. Croatians were those who choose the path of breaking constitution, arming and attacking federal government. Nationalist euphoria existed in Croatia, and it was the cause of break-up just as much as any other. But Serbs are blamed 3 times more than they are supposed to, while others are amnested. That creates the atmosphere of victimhood in Serbia and is precisely what you, if you were wise, would like to avoid. After the I world war, everyone was blaiming Germany and Germany was unjustly treated. And what happened? Cant you learn from history. The lies in Croatian media, constant presentation of twisted version of history and brainwashing (like the absurd claims that, for instance, in Vukovar 8000 JNA soldiers died or that they have destroyed more tanks and airplains than NATO did in Kosovo War, for instance), are meant to homogenize new Croatian state, but these lies cannot be accepted as history here. Your bias is understandable, but it does not give you the right to be the judge of what is truth and to impose your POV as only worthy of a word here. That is clearly against NPOV policies. History is always twisted to serve political purpose - so Tito equated genocide of Ustashe with crimes of his rival antifascist Mihajlovic, and promoted equality in crimes even if that was far from truth. Now again, history is being twisted and crimes of Serbs are inflated, while suffering of Serbs and crimes against Serbs are not to be talked about. Of course Serbs will object. There were more than a million Serbian refugees, more than any other nation in YU wars, the Serbs are the largest victims of ethnic cleansing, especially in Croatia and now in Kosovo. And then you want to scilence the truth about crimes commited on Serbs. Well, if you cannot understand why people who opposed Milosevic in the 90s now object to this twisting of truth (in fact you cant beleive it, according to what you say), this should give you a hint.

<dd>I beg to differ on the NOR issue but thats for this arbitration to decide. In any case, I find it interesting that you so readily proclaim me a victim of "brainwashing" but you certainly don't think there is anything wrong with your information or your bias? Also, you are trying to implant the notion that Wikipedia is somehow pro-Croatia and anti-Serbia biased? Do you even realise how rediculous that sounds? Someone else already said it better - POV + POV doesnt equal NPOV. Therefore, any strongly biased article like this one (which also bears an unnecessarily inflammatory title - Kristallnacht, an obvious reference to the Holocaust, as to imply that Serbs suffered the same fate at the hands of Croats in the last war) needs to be radically NPOV-ed or deleted. And since you and your buddies obviously won't let it be NPOV-ed, then there is only one choice. Nobody is denying the Serb Krajina tragedy, what we are denying is that it played out quite as you want to portray it. Croatia has moved on, when will we be able to say the same thing about Serbia? Oh, and by the way, the Vukovar casualties number is agreed upon not only by Croatian historians but most of the foreign researchers who have studied the topic. Only Serbian historians deny it... Why? And why oh why do we always come back to the Ustashe? Ever heard of the Godwins Law?

<dd>Every person has a bias, and I have lived in Serbia, you have just visited it, and I have lived outside Serbia so I think I am relatively well informed. What surprised me when I came to West is that CNN is worse in its methods of propaganda than RTS or other televisions in ex-yu. Brainwashing is universal in the world. What makes me think you are brainwashed is your conviction - but of course, it is hard to tell. Wikipedia is certainly not inherently pro-Croatian or pro-any side, and it should not be, as the very NPOV policies make it in principle more objective than any other media wich all - CNN, NYTimes, BBC, or HRT or RTS or B92 or Feral in fact all have some agenda and wikipedia has only users wich come from all around the world. The good thing about wikipedia is that it allows every side of the story to be presented - according to NPOV policies. And this is exactly why this article must stay. The only reason some articles in wiki are biased in this or other way is that some people push their POV, but the community, given large enough number of participatnts, will eventually ensure that this is avoided. You are strongly pushing Croatian POV, and this is why you oppose this article. You claim that someone will not allow this article to be NPOV-ed, while it is exactly you and your buddies who does not allow articles about Vukovar battle or such to be NPOV-ed. Have you even made a single edit to it to correct what you think is wrong? You are assuming something, that is assuming bad faith but that is wrong attitude. In fact, many people just dont understand the other side and if you explain your POV then a compromise can be found. Read what NPOV means - it says that claims should be attributed, not claimed by wiki. It exactly means PRESENTING different POV-s with relevant sources. Of course, things are not so simple, but a compromise can be worked out with good will. But you refuse to allow even existance of this article - note that POV is a separate issue here. You cannot get rid of the other side of the story, no matter how you want to hide it. You can attribute POV, but not delete it, since Serbians are a large group of people whose sufferings are relevant as are their opinions and perceptions. As for what you say about Vukovar, its simply ridicilous. It is exactly Croatians who have an agenda of making this into some wild inflated heroism story - and what other historians are you talking about. Who has an interest in that - there are many questions but you cant deny that Serbs have much better sources about their losses. Anyway, there are many topics which are hot and disputed by opposing sides, and wiki NPOV policies are clear. If there is no concensus (and there is not despite what you try to say by involving some western historians who after all, got it from you - it is all media war after all, historical distance is not there for no reason and many topics in history are disputed for decades if not centuries) and therefore, the best one can do is EXACTLY to present both sides. It would be far better if for instance Vukovar battle article would be divided into two - Serbian version and Croatian version. So, a reader can see what each side CLAIMS. That would simplify situation/avoid edit war there. Wikipedia does not judge what is true, that is OR. It just presents things, and in wars, recent especially, there are always two sides and two stories. That holds for many other topics, and not just YU-wars, and this article should not be an exception. As for the title, dont you find Borovo massacre inflamatory? Yet that is the title - and there are many more here. If there is bias in western media, that does not mean that WIKI should be biased, and in fact it is not. If policies are to be followed.

<dd>I don't assume anything and if you take a better look at my edit history you'll see I tried to reach a consensus with serbian Wikipedians on numerous articles and numerous ocassions. But then those users turn to plain vandalism and rv wars. It's unacceptable. A user called Medule in particular has been very troublesome in the past few weeks and has earned himself a ban so he(she?) now edits under a number of sockpuppets. I've been involved in the revert war on Battle of Vukovar article not because I think Serbian view should not be represented, but because I try hard to stick to the <a href="../../../n/e/u/Wikipedia%7ENeutral_point_of_view_50c9.html" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> policy, in particular to avoid <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Content forking</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html#Undue_weight" title="WP:NPOV">Undue weight</a>. It's the same reason why I believe that this article should be deleted and merged, because there's no need to create a separate article about an incident that is (in the context of the Croatian War of Independance and Wars of Yugoslav sucession) - insignificant, to say the least. After all, it wasn't me who started this arbitration or requested the deletion, but I do have an opinion and I hope it counts when it's time to make a decision. Oh, and by the way, I don't find the title of Borovo selo massacre inflammatory because it gives an objective definition of an event. Or maybe you want to deny the fact that the bodies of those policemen were unnecessarily and brutally mutilated? Which was caught on tape no less? Oh, but you readily support calling this article "Kristallnacht".

<li><b>Strong KEEP</b> This incident must remain documented. It is appalling that someone may consider removing the information about a controversial issue. The very notion only demonstrates that the Dalmatian Kristallnacht is alive in the public mind and its concealment profits the negotiators of hate and violence. Just as humanity cannot forget the evil of the Nazi regimes in the 30’s and 40’s, it must also never overlook the resurgence of Nazi ideologies in the world of today. The suggestion that this is an example of “Greater Serbian propaganda” is about as valid as the suggestion that the articles on the Holocaust represent “Greater Jewish propaganda”. It is crucial that the Yugoslav wars’ descriptions on Wikipedia remain impartial by providing information on the atrocities committed by all sides in the conflict. kilternkafuffle 06:15, 28 March 2006 (UCT)</li>

<dd>What in the world does <i>science</i> have to do with this? (Speaking of flawed reasoning.) That doesn't compare to a widely reported conflict such as this one.

(These are the only sources I can find that archive their news back to 1991 for free...)

<dd>well, science is an example of something that does not give rise to that many emotions, and therefore, you can find many obscure topics in this very wikipedia, most of them never get a line in NYTimes, and yet, noone thinks they should be deleted just because NYT does not write about them. As for your second claim, that is exactly the essence of the problem. Western media DID NOT REPORT about such events. Thats not because events did not exist, thats because NYT had an agenda. NYT in fact does not report many things which happen in the world, and yet that does not mean the things are not happening. Do you think Abu-gharib would be reported if photos have not leaked? What gets into NYT depends on many things, editorial policy including, and Serbs didnt get their share of the story. I read NYT all the time, and am aware of things happening in my country, and have a pretty good idea how much of it gets there and why. So, blowing up of 116 cafes didnt get reported - thats what the Austrian guy was objecting to if you read the link - he wrote a whole book about it. And thats what Serbs are objecting to. That NYT is biased is no excuse to exclude Serbian side of the story. And if you think NYT is not biased, you are quite naive, I can tell you that. Pirkovank 03:15, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Times magazine is even worse. And remember - these events are not reported ONLY in Serbian media (in fact, they were not reported there as much as some other events), but also in Croatian media, and in few Western sources - most notably, in the mentioned book written by AUSTRIAN. So, it is not invented. And as a matter of fact, how many murders, crimes etc. do you think happen in some obscure places and do not get into limelight? The treatment of Serbian side was like that - noone cared about crimes on Serbs. This is just one in a very, very long list of examples. And yet, if you search a bit, you will find plenty of evidence - even from western sources, even from ICTY, about crimes against Serbs that never did and never will get a line in your beloved and trusted Times magazine.

<dd>I agree, and I'd add two further comments. We should be very cautious about treating as facts news reports from either Serbia or Croatia during this period, given the degree to which both countries' media were under state control and used as propaganda outlets. I'd definitely be happier if we could verify this event using non-Yugoslavian sources, e.g. State Department Human Rights reports or Human Rights Watch reports. Also, I agree entirely that the article should be rewritten - it's very non-NPOV and I think it's particularly objectionable that it should use the term "Kristallnacht" as a synonym for "pogrom". It's plain propaganda and cheapens the memory of the original Kristallnacht. -- <a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChrisO_f9d7.html" title="User:ChrisO">ChrisO</a> 23:29, 31 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I completely disagree. The events which took place in Srebrenica are called "genocide" - you might, and in fact people - Jews and other - as well say that this cheapens the memory of the original Holocaust. But that was not reason for consideration here. In fact, the naming convention is pretty clear - these aspects ARE NOT to be considered when naming an article. They are pretty precise as to how to proceed when choosing a name, having alternatives (and we do not have that even - Zadar Kristallnacht was inferior to Dalmatian Kristallnacht as first had almost no references, and second is how it was called IN ENGLISH). NPOV-ing is a separate issue. Let me just say that what ChrisO said about Serbian/Croatian media is absolutely not true. Neither media in Croatia, neither in Serbia, were ALL STATE CONTROLLED - thats nonsense, though it is a prejudice in which many westerners who do not understand these issues believe. In fact, in Serbia under Milosevic press was relatively free, only the MAIN RTS was state controled. A lot of criticisms and attacks on Milosevic were present in the media. The same holds for Croatia - Feral Tribune is one notable example. Also, we should not trust BBC or CNN as they in fact have bias, and it is comparable to the bias of what you call state media in Serbia/Croatia at the time - believe me, I was surprised to discover how much manipulation there is myself. Also, wiki policies make it plain that one should not judge, but report about ALL things in NPOV way. That dominant western media were more/less interested in something is really not an issue here - there are events called Dalmatian Kristallnacht, they deserve an article, and all other issues can be solved IN THE ARTICLE within the guidelines of NPOV policies. Policies for NPOV and naming exist precisely to give guidelines in cases like this. However, this is obviously a separate issue - there does not seem to be any concensus here, Serbian contributors are for Keeping and Croatians are for deleting, that should be clear - so per policy, there is no concensus, the article stays, but of course, it can be NPOV-ed like any other article. And there are much worse examples of POV in wiki present then this. Pirkovank 01:22, 1 April 2006 (UTC)

<p>The incident got it's name from the media.

<li><b>Comment</b>: It was not clear to me why you wished to remove this article. The phrase <i>Yet another word processor - 112 Ghits</i> didn't 't make it in the slightest bit clear WHY you wanted it deleted.The product is still relatively unknown, but what's the harm in it having its own entry in Wikipedia?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Perhaps the prod comment was a bit terse - apologies. As I see it, Wikipedia articles record things that have already become notable rather than things that may become so in the future. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 20:19, 25 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Fair enough. What DOES <i>112 Ghits</i> mean though? Whether or not Wikipedia only records notable things or not, I don't know. I've always thought an article on everything in existence was the aim?
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Shorthand for Google hits. No, I think wiki is like life, it rewards the famous rather than recognising the deserving. See <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENot_131e.html" title="WP:Not">WP:Not</a> (Crystal Ball). <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a>

<li><b>Delete</b> it basically got slammed on slashdot as imature. It seems that these days everyone is writting Ajax word processors, <a href="../../../w/r/i/Writely.html" title="Writely">Writely</a>, <a href="../../../z/o/h/Zoho_Writer_c9d4.html" title="Zoho Writer">Zoho Writer</a>, seem to be leaders of this pack.

<li>Put a short mention of this to <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michael_Robertson_d295.html" title="Michael Robertson">Michael Robertson</a> (or somewhere else where it makes sense), then <b>Delete</b>. This is a new website/product that has yet to prove itself to be notable or popular; creating a new article just after the launch may be a bit pointless. Welcome back when there's actually some point in having a complete separate article about this. Let the time tell. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 18:45, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I did create the entry, so I won't actually vote, but I see it just as a seed. If the app does work then let it live; else, delete. A couple more weeks of life should be enough to estimate this more adequately. BTW: Google hits alone I don't believe is sufficient to judge it less than a week after its appearance; rather Wikipedia searches could be a criterium Evillan 04:20, 28 March 2006 (UTC) .</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not sure what you mean by "if the app does work", or why that should be a criteria. Hitler's <a href="../../../f/i/n/Final_Solution_bd4d.html" title="Final Solution">Final_Solution</a> didn't work so well and it has an entry, while personalized mittens work quite well for my son at school, but there is no entry for them. Clearly historical significance (even recent history) needs to be the greatest factor in determining WiP page worthiness. I've used ajaxWrite, but it's a long ways from replacing MS Word or even OpenOffice.org.</li>

<dd>At first glance the idea of my entry of "independent operability" may seem self serving. I understand. However, I am nicely retired and most likely would not work again if I was "vain". I hereby CONTEST Wikipedia's policy of blanket banning all "vanity" entries as that is the sign of a system that only supports those who have nothing to "brag" about in the first place and keeps many power producers from bothering to do anything anymore. I produced the technology of late to help others and I am highly disgusted at the insane interest in attacking it particularly when it seems that not a person attacking seems to have a slight clue (and some even admit it) as to what it is about and this fact alone warrants the removal of all the comments forthwith. This is NOT a comment place for bubble headed Madonna groupies. Large money has gone into this important project and not a dime has been spent on me. The project cannot live without funding so I hope a small note of my name and the patent will be a gratitude for the years of work many have put into it. I bet none of you remember Phill Pharnsworth do you? Well you're USING his invention RIGHT NOW. And I DON'T plan on beeing an UNKNOWN for my work.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>This is supposed to be an encyclopedia, you know the thing that teaches the children? If all of you knew what you are attacking you would be sorry. This is why I had no compunction about nuking the first comment from the peanut gallery that opened the mouth before thinking (and I made certain to take out all the usual detractors that in fact DO know of my work and attack it for selfish reasons (such as the ELF, Unibomber, &amp; other sorts of lunatic TECHNOPHOBS).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Let me teach you a thing or two about the first step in becoming smart. If someone says something and it is not CLEARLY NONSENSE, and you DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. PLEASE, DON'T COMMENT ON IT UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT OR AT LEAST BE COURTEOUS ENOUGH TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS FIRST. And to the HACKER WANA-BE WHO USED THE TERM "PATENTCRUFT", I REST MY CASE ON MY (WHAT YOU CALL AMUSING) COINED TERM "PATENT HATTER", there's one RIGHT THERE (and there's quite a few of them out there indeed). BAN HIM! You ALL sound like DINOSAURS MATING. If there are stupid patents allowed, blame the patent office, not ALL inventors please because THIS one is NOT. Stop being childs.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>P.S. To the one constructive comment as to independent operability being "self replication". It IS self replication. A more specific form of it that NEEDS to be TAUGHT to the masses for Mechagenics to be understood. It's INDEPENDENT REPLICATION (and I did not coin the term, it's been around a long time). I will dutifully edit the entry to correct on that. Thank you so much for pointing out that thoughtful fact. Also patents are ALL PUBLISHED (pursuant to your comments on the entry being not "sourced"). Where's the moderators around here? I hope a few have a little brains on this, thank you very much. Also, five days seems a bit short a time for proper debate on this.

<p>fram fraberj - Independent operability is used extensively in nanotechnology (which is closely related to Mechagenics which is MY coined term for MY technology set forth explicitly in the patent, notice I did not ask that it be added). As an example of "secondary sources" using the term: Marvin Minsky (AKA: "Father of AI") used the term in this well known and broadly recited statement within the art: "Independent operability will make fission look like a mild irritation". Edd Regis, the most well known writer in nanotechnology, in his book "Nano" devoted that, his most noteworthy book mostly to the discussion on independent operability. In fact much inspiration for my developing it sprung from that book. K. Erik Drexler (HONORARY doctorate, for what? no one knows!) the loud mouthpiece before congress on nanotechnology and all his pretty picture filled books and political flashy jive but no substance (BUT PLENTY OF MEDIA NOTE!) used and promoted it extensively on his net site for the Fifth Foresight Institute (or is it sixth now?) he used the term many times (before I DID it first and he got very upset at that point and decided to quit using the term in any of his new writings or on the site). Richard Feyman in his book "Plenty of Room at the Bottom" may have it in it (I've not read it) but he has used it in public MANY times, I can't believe NONE of you have heard of it before. You can't have been reading much nanotechnology without running into it. The book Nano is FULL of the term, it's in the glossary for gosh sakes! As for the question of "vanity" the first version of my article purveyed was drawn from the works of Alex Nicholson (author, engineer, material specialist) NOT MYSELF, but when all the monkeys started throwing the p@@p I took over and added the long version to satisfy you guys' (&amp; gals') objections. Here's the picture in a nutshell: It's well described in the book "Nano" (get it at the local library) and many other sources (and if you read them you will find that it very much is a BIG DEAL if that's what you are looking for in "notable", should be from merit had per function that you guy should ascertain) and if you go to uspto.gov site you can READ THE CLAIMS in the patent (LAST TWO LONG ONES) and you will see that the robotics division of the patent office indeed allowed it as it is described in the patent and it is a big one (86 pages), published world wide through the Patent Cooperation Treaty and last but not least I have both still photos and video of the device (tell me where to post it and I will). I do interviews and did two radio shows on WJFK. And so once and for all, FOR ALL both smart and dense, here goes a clear "romper room" definition: A machine that can have babies. Lots of NON independent replicators are about like Cornell's' (type "Cornell replicator" at Google and go right to it and note that one infringes on my patent if you can read the claims you'll see THAT'S of NOTE!) that is, ones that have parts that must be manufactured by man or beast (like life form commandeered versions). It exists my friends and someday with the power it bestows you will be asking the walls for chairs, and like plant life chairs will grow out of walls from tiles delivered through plumbing to your home of objects you shopped for on the net. It's the final error corrected control and creation of "stuff" in the home and elsewhere. Ask a cup to turn into a plate and it will if made of this replicating stuff and if sitting on a counter made of this stuff it will morph into it. It's instead of pixels on the screen controlled by computers now its the tiles in the world around you in a great hardware matrix being controlled by computers that are made up of the tiles by your verbal request. And finally (for you pure science buffs) its the addressable verbal control of mass structure to the atomic level; we are replacing the atom unit with another type of unit that is subject to verbal command and the like. You will copy THINGS like you copy software, by verbal command. A HARD INTERNET. Further it is error corrected and seldom subject to error and someday because of this VERY SOON there will be great automated factories that blast out tiles with lasers and e-beans to be delivered automatically to your home through plumbing (even frozen foods) and your house, chair, car, sidewalk etc will be made of them in a big physical LAN (Internet) of electrically conductive interlocking tiles and we will all live happily ever after REAL, REAL SOON. That is, if I can GET THE MEDIA AND YOU GUYS TO GET AT IT TO GET THE WORD OUT AND FUNDED AND ON LINE ect., ect., ect,. That's why it's called the INFINITY DEVICE (if you want to see the book written by Alex Nicholson called THE INFINITY DEVICE let me know where to upload it. (very much a technical bore for expert and novice alike but someone had to do it) It is and always will be ALL THAT WILL EVER BE NECESSARY once it attains evolution (has not yet, but soon will)... The Infinity Device... Any more questions?</p>
<p>Thank you so very much,</p>

<p>P.S. I think the above writing alone by itself, if you think about it (and call it a rant if you like), is far worthy of note on its face as a literary work, particularly with the patent backing it (and all the above &amp; more is in the description in the patent). I bet no one EVER told you guys ANYTHING LIKE THAT! HA! Even Orson Wells! My investor tells me he can't sleep at night after talking with me. I'm writing a movie about it: War in the Nanosphere. I play many musical instruments and did the sound track too. I have THOUSANDS of innovations. Several HUNDRED are in the patent alone (actually there were three of them, the patent office was caught with their pants down not knowing quite how to deal with it and blew the first one, they even allowed lists in the descriptions finally). Well, I guess I've bragged as my investors wanted me to do, this new "globalization" market will either get it or not soon with that new attitude which is what I suspect is the problem. Do you get the picture yet? Hey, this isn't advertising guys or vanity or whatever, it's HISTORY BEFORE YOUR EYES IN THE MAKING.

<p>Looks like kotepho is the only one doing any of the needed research here, asking the right questions, unlike the rest of you. As stated by the British House of Lords, "Copying an invention by taking its 'pith and marrow' without textual infringement of the patent is an old and familiar abuse which the law has never been powerless to prevent." (Per James, L.J., in Clark v. Adie (1873) L.R. 10 Ch. 667). But this "vanity" attitude is working a round about rendition of the above, needs to be revised to NO ADVERTISING or plugging unimportant work. This is NOT simply a new patent for a Bobby Pin. There should be a certain time place and form for those who excel to state their qualifications if of substance because the way things are going with this new globalization that's the only way they will ever be known. I know this from my own lived practical experience. You can't count on donations and others to PR you. That's what happened to Phil Pharnsworth, the principle innovator behind the first television, now few know him and he went broke when his idea was stolen and your computer monitor, whether CRT, LCD or DLP or the like IS based on the same principle. NOBODY CARES ABOUT US INVENTORS! Seriously. You guys don't seem to. Well I plan to change this whole weird way of thinking that you HAVE to modestly wait around until someone ELSE acknowledges your capabilities even if I have to be accused of vanity or rants thank you very much. This is THE NEW INVENTOR'S LIBERATION MOVEMENT starting right here. I could care less what you all think. And that's the truth. Why should I? Ban me if you like, make my day! I'm no sucker! NO MORE MR NICE GUY TO YOU ANARCHIST! I waited TEN YEARS! The PARTY IS OVER! With all due respect, I would submit that you folks should maybe consider the VALUE of the MATERIAL being brought to the table here rather than WHO brought it and HOW it was SAID or HOW it was brought. That seems to be getting lost in the wash of all this politically correct fascism! It seems clear to me, that even though there is a stated policy that this is "not an experiment in anarchy" some editors may secretly be pursuing just such, certainly "infoanarchy" to use a term used herein if not some other nefarious underhanded far flung buphoferouse boofaophery spewed far and wide all over globalistic creation! For example sanstien had his insulting comments about "confusing babble on patents" before I could barely get the article up clearly indicating that he had not a clue on nanotechnology or even cared to look into it. Attacked it on sight! THAT is what fired it all off. And you are threatening to ban me? RIGHT! BAN HIM! I was real nice up until then and you know it if you got your facts strait. How about banning deville with his insulting "it is a collection of insane ramblings"? That's pretty rude! Nothing technically constructive there. And how about the nutty comments from Gruban and the others with peanut gallery jive? And gee jetman123 UNWARRANTED?!?! I approached this with a world of dignity until sandstien blew off his mouth... I won't put up with that sort of indignity from someone who didn't do his homework. Please! What about george bills? you said nothing of substance so why say it? I nominate to DELETE ALL OF THE ABOVE FORTHWITH! Technically, if you guys/gals had an iota of ethics you would realize that's true now wouldn't you? Then we could all settle down and get to the business at hand instead of this craziness, but you know it's just not gonna happen I think because I can smell it like a rat SOMETHINGS AFOOT! Now in all fairness I REALLY LIKED Brian Shlosser42's "time cube" comparison. THAT was something of SUBSTANCE! It was constructive dialog wasn't it? A fair comparison on the face of it. However, I will point out that the same similar type of absolute bedlam went on at the patent office that seemed to have gone on with this "Time Cube" weirdness when I filed the first patent until a showed up with a video of the device of it "reduced to practice" and they all shut up and gave me all the claims I asked for because unlike "perpetual motion" and "tellatransportation" or maybe "Time Cube" (whatever the heck that is) it is broadly agreed that independent operability could actually happen (they thought it would be twenty years down the road by the way). So unlike "Time Cube" (which by the way made its way somehow into this Wikipedia didn't it?) you have NOT ONE but TWO IMPARTIAL THIRD PARTY OPINIONS: the PATENT EXAMINERS for BOTH the patents at the patent office and FURTHER AS WELL all the "prior art" both patents knocked down as set forth in the patent (tell me WHY patents are not OK again?, RIGHT), plus an OPINION "LETTER OF OPERABILITY" from a renown impartial patent documenting firm devised JUST FOR THAT: Nolte Nolte &amp; Hunter P.C. (sent to Gruban), A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE DEVICE IN FULL COLOR siting there plain as day UPON ONE OF THE PATENTS. The patents withstood over ten years of legal onslaught (definitely not new untried science) the term "independent operability" was used by Marvin Minsky (father of AI), used in the best selling book by Ed Regis (top Nano writer) sited to Gruban. Even Einstein pointed out that it would be a big deal when he used the term "independent self replication". The invention even survived the onslaught of the "Don and Mike" show as they tried to cast it as "junk science". They admitted: "You beat us into the ground." I got a tape of that if it means that much but it's just part of the continuing credibility of the science as it lives and the term which you guys seem to be conveniently trying, for some reason to ignore. Seems the LEAST you can do is this: I'll give you guys permission to rewrite the article the way you guys like if it states substantially the same thing in the same or similar way as "Time Cube" with my name used just like Gene Ray's is in a very modest way and let me know where to place the description of its function, add the picture of the device and lets give it the go. I mean, Gene Ray's article is IN THERE is it not? I mean come on guys lets be fair now. All my other competitors in academia are in there: Richard Feynman, Norio Taniguchi, K. Eric Drexler, Robert Freitas, Ralph Merkle, Sumio Iijima, Richard Smalley, Erwin Müller, Gerd Binnig, David Britz, Heinrich Rohrer, Raymond Kurzweil, Paul Alivisatos Chris Phoenix, Mike Treder, Tim McKnight, Phaedon Avouris, James Fraser Stoddart, why can't I have equall standing herein with my competitors? Is it because I'm a n "inventor" HA! Hence my coined DIRECT term: PATENT HATERS. Not some politically correct blithering blather of a name tha's indirect. I think you guys are taking "sourcing" to a new extreme too, wreaks of prejudice here. This is not unproven NEW science nor junk science, I'm the foremost authority on top down nanotechnology and self replication. I'll admit, I'm not much of a writer so I'm new to this (first article) so give me a little help guys. It is NOT vain to stand up when you have beed dishonored, particularly when being PROFESSIONALLY IGNORED. when that occers all bets are off and you hit the dirt. Further, for your information you anarchists would have been dead of some disease before 25 or living like Mennonites like all the rest of us would be too if it were not for the protection of patent rights for innovation. And let's not mix this up with copyright protection (that's why I disapprove of the term "intellectual property" as well which generally lumps the certainly more important innovation of patentable innovations with books, movies and music which are just communications when you get down to it). It's unconscionable that books, movies and music can bring criminal penalties for infringement but patents far more important to day to day living may not but in fact find themselves under direct attack for some misguided notion that it is somehow helpful to the less better off for inventors to not get paid for their work. You don't chop the head off of the able to feed it to the disabled but you do help them but don't KILL THE ABLE while you are at it, thank you. The term I coined and like to use is "technophobe" because it is more in your face as it should be. It really affronts those that are JEALOUS of those who can innovate which is what all this is all about. It does not mean I advocate LESS protection for books, movies and music I just want the same or better for patents which is rather sane. When's the last time you heard of someone giving donations to an inventor? Rarely. You guys and gals won't because it's clear YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW WHO I AM DO YOU? Worse... YOU DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE TO KNOW EITHER if you go along with this program. Since 1994 I've had this work published and it's been published world wide and NOT ONCE has anyone sent me one red cent as a "donation". Don't get me wrong, I'm not for protecting the MORBIDLY RICH like Bill Gates or Trump but the urge to prosper well, i would submit is NOT GREED (Ihave to pay for MY kids too thank you. That's why Communism failed. NO MOTIVATION. What you do is tax the heck out of them at the millionaire point, up to then NO! Gives everyone a dream to be rich someday but not MORBIDLY RICH which IS greed. That directs peoples hopes and dreams in the proper fashion. You don't "tax the rich feed the poor until there are no rich no more" (song "Change the World" Alvan Lee, in the sixties) instead you "tax the rich feed the poor until there are NO POOR NO MORE! Now that's just right. Get it? Have a VERY nice day.</p>

How many of the Pokemon characters, porn stars, and low-grade pro athletes whose notability is recognized here will be able to make parallel claims in 40 years?

<li><b>Keep</b>. WP:MUSIC was formulated with present-day acts in mind. The Defiants would not be notable were they have to started their career in, say, 1998. But the early 1960s was another era, and areas like Litchfield (and other parts of the rural Midwest) were at that time culturally disconnected from the larger music scene. In those days Minneapolis was the nearest larger town, an 80 mile drive along Highway 12, a two-lane road with <a href="../../../w/h/i/Whistle_stop.html" title="Whistle stop">whistle stop</a> towns every 6 miles or so. That Litchfield had a rock band at all is itself notable, and though the article does not assert this, the Defiants were perhaps the first such band in Litchfield. A formulaic delete based upon blind application of WP:MUSIC would not serve the project. I do agree that the article is badly in need of cleanup, something that is likely to come with time. <a href="../../../u/n/i/User%7EUninvitedCompany_c154.html" title="User:UninvitedCompany">The Uninvited</a> Co., <a href="../../../u/n/i/User_talk%7EUninvitedCompany_4866.html" title="User talk:UninvitedCompany">Inc.</a> 17:59, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

Just because the Defiants were a garage rock band in the 60's does not exempt them from meeting that criteria. Other contemporaries of theirs meet the criteria (<a href="../../../3F/_/%26/__%26_the_Mysterians_3ed7.html" title="? &amp; the Mysterians">? &amp; the Mysterians</a> from podunk Saginaw, MI for example). No reason the Defiants should get a free pass to circumvent this. Also, the claim that their one single is still "in print" is without any sourcing, so it can't really be considered a valid external demonstration of notability. Just mentioning that their one single appeared on a number of compiliations or anthologies isn't sufficient... this needs to be sourced. If someone can list even a few compiliations or anthologies this song appeared on I'd be willing to reconsider the notability issue, I personally couldn't find any (only found one 45 issued by Studio City records, 1965).

<li><b>Delete</b>, clearly crystal ball, but this brings up a question I have. Recently I have seen a lot of {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_game_5940.html" title="Template:Future game">future game</a>}} and {{<a href="../../../f/u/t/Template%7EFuture_album_2ae4.html" title="Template:Future album">future album</a>}} tags on articles. It's been worrying me that these are clearly violating <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> by their very existence. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?

<li>Well if the game or album has been officially announced, and there is <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a> information, I dont see a problem with such articles.

<li>Agreed, if there is verifiable information, I can see the use of such a tag. Perhaps I should say more and state that most of the pages I've seen with this tag are totally crystal-balled out.

This is as notable as people that win the lottery - except it would be a small lottery since there was no money involved here. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 14:50, 25 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge</b> Boone is actually a professor of chemistry, not a professor of mathematics, so someone who has more chem knowledge of chem than I should maybe look at his list of papers. However, almost all the google hits turn up either other Steven Boones, forum posts, or this Steven Boone in the context of GIMPS. "Steven Boone" + "chemistry" turns up 341 hits, the first his home page and the next two talking about GIMPS, so it seems the only context he is known in is GIMPS. <a href="../../../j/o/s/User%7EJoshuaZ_a034.html" title="User:JoshuaZ">JoshuaZ</a> 17:42, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. I actually think this wasn't a great debate. For a start, she seems to be no less notable than her father who wasn't nominated.

<li><b>SAVE</b> Being 469th in line to the British throne is, in my opinion, more than notable enough to warrant keeping an active article on Miss Knatchbull. It seems the only notable argument as to why she should be removed is that there are 250 people preceeding her in succession to the throne who do not have their own articles. In this case, the solution is not to remove Miss Knatchbull, but to create articles for these 250 people! If we removed certain articles simply because there are other 'more relevant' ones that have not been documented, we could contest thousands of the articles on Wikipedia just based on our personal opinions of their 'relevancy'. - User David 18:15, 27 March 2006</li>
<li><b>SAVE</b> - agreed as above. Exactly the point I should have made. I hope people judge this deletion decision not on the vote count, but on the quality of the arguements. How about - Nlu,Dlyons493,Deville and moreover Golfcam, you sicko - let's create threads for the 468 people in front of Ms. Knatchbull. Also, it's her birthday on the 30th so do please be kind. #REDIRECT QwentyJ</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, you're right that people should "judge this deletion decision not on the vote count, but on the quality of the arguments [<i>sic</i>]." Of course, the quality of the arguments is indeed speaking for the article's deletion. --<a href="../../../n/l/u/User%7ENlu_4d5f.html" title="User:Nlu">Nlu</a> (<a href="../../../n/l/u/User_talk%7ENlu_b319.html" title="User talk:Nlu">talk</a>) 19:09, 27 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Which arguments are you referring to, Nlu?</dd>
<dd>The first one presented - that being in line for the British throne is simply not worthy of a brief article? On the contrary, there already exists an article 'Line of Succession to the British Throne', which lists the 906 royal inheritants, many of whom have their own articles. Indeed, the British throne and its succession is an historic facet of British society with significant interest among British people. So there is clearly a current interest in the subject.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Or perhaps the second argument, that Miss Knatchbull should not be included because there are 250 people ahead of her (including number 76) without their own articles? But surely if we are trying to assemble details of the succession to the throne, and there are gaps in the sequence, it makes no sense to delete the ones we already have? Rather, we should create details for the ones we are missing. I fail to see a clear argument for her removal, bearing in mind that Wikipedia is already engaged in an effort to create details for the succession to the British throne. - User David 21:06, 27 March 2006</dd>

<li><b>Response</b>: Wikipedia is not Yahoo, but to find a New York recording studio type "New York Recording Studio" in the search box. Spending two minutes reading a long, unsorted list isn't an improvement. Notable studios that lack articles should have stubs created as that's the time-proven way to generate more quality articles.

<li><b>Delete</b> I know cytse in person. It was 2 years ago when I was bored and set up a site like this with a friend. I would consider him a great person, but not to the extent that it should warrant a wikipedia entry. I thought it would be deleted soon, but to our surprise it was edited on...

<p>Wikipedia does contain facts and information about many, many people that have passed on. Roland's running in a Montana State race is not his only claim to notability. To many people, Roland, a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, Leech Lake, was an important man, giving a difficult message from his heart in effort to help his family and friends. A quick search of his name, Roland Morris, Sr., brings up several various websites discussing his message, including his testimony before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in 1998. I don;t know what local tribe sites you are mentioning. I haven't seen any. I do see several references to him from national organizations such as CERA, UCE, and UPOW, and well as many national Indian Sites, such as Indian Country Today and others. At his death, he was recognized and spoken fondly of by leaders in our western Montana home community. Some have called him a hero. Many, even his opponents, have noted his extreme courage and integrity. Currently, a documentary on his life is being shown on cable TV in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I hope that the Wikipedia staff will allow his life to be accurately documented for those that are interested. Thanks, Morris Family 16:53, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>If it were only the Morris family's loss, that might be so. Interestingly, the above writers ignored many of the events listed in Mr. Morris' life that made him notable. He testified before numerous State committees through the years, as well as the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in April of 1998 and the Minnesota Attorney General in 2000. He was also allowed a private meeting with a member of the President's Domestic Policy Council in 2002 in Washington DC, and spoke at the National Press Club in 2004. A person doesn't get invited to testify before Senate Committees, speak to a presidential aide, or speak to the national press unless they have something to say, and are respected by these entities as someone knowledgeable and notable. Through the years, he has also appeared in numerous newspaper articles across the country. The last article he appeared in was on Friday, May 14th, 2004, in the Washington Times. While it is true that not everyone in the world has heard of Roland Morris, he was a notable figure.</p>
<p>But what many that knew him found the most inspiring was that Roland lived a rough, criminal life for his first forty or so years, including jail time, and then turned it all around the way he did in his last 17 years. To go from abject poverty on the Rez and time in the county workhouse to meeting privately with a presidential aide isn't a real common thing. It only happened because he had something notable to say. He was a tribal member that was very unusual in the message he had to give.Morris Family 17:28, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts. When I search</p>
<p>MSN, using "Roland Morris, Sr." (In Quotes) I come up with eight different sites, the entire page, specifically mentioning him. Only one is CAICW. A couple I recognize. The others I don't.</p>
<p>Yahoo, the entire first page, seven different sites, a couple are repeated, only one is CAICW. On the next page, another six different sites. Some of these I know, but many I know nothing about, other than that they are quoting Roland Morris. Other mentions scattered on next pages.</p>
<p>Google - all on the first page are Roland; eight different ones, only one is CAICW. All on the second page are about Roland, scattered mentions on subsequent pages. I know this doesn't happen at all with my name. And this doesn't include sites that might respond to his full name, Roland John, or to activities he was invovled in, or misspellings of his name.</p>
<p>Rewriting is acceptable. I was simply trying to do this process quickly, and so used (with permission) material already written.

<dd><b>Comment</b> I would urge you to look at other Wikipedia articles, particularly biographical ones on recognized figures, to get a measure of the standard style of WP articles, and format the nominated one accordingly. The "headline" is especially unusual for a WP article. Also, if you attach links and new information to the article (where they count), you need only notify other editors that you have done so on this AfD debate, rather than posting all the links here. Editors will be happy to check out the page again. It may well be (especially if the page is deleted) that it is ultimately more appropriate to wait for a more neutral contributor to formulate and submit this article anew in the future. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#000000">Dei</font><font color="#FF3300">zio</font></b></a> 15:02, 29 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> Sigh... probably a bad faith nomination intended to further push back the date this can ever actually be considered for deletion, but who knows. I encourage people not to kneejerk react here. This article is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>, it's as simple as that. Check the sources, none even mention GNAA except in webforum sections, which clearly does not meet <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>. Recently there was some drama over people wanting to add that "GNAA is in decline" and people reverted it as vandalism. Eh... this shows the whole problem with original research. Who are we to believe in a content dispute? There are no sources whatsoever to check... it's just conjecture and opinion verses more conjecture and opinion. Even Slashdot has never written an article about GNAA (by acronym or full name) no one but Wikipedia can be duped into covering these guys. I asked two months ago for an actual reliable source about GNAA... and absolutely nothing has emerged.

<li><b>Delete</b> immediately, and protect deleted page. The actual content of &gt;75% of the article is speculation, rumour, and personal opinion.. with so much associated controversy, phrases such as "generally assumed", "tend to" should have been extirpated rather than poorly cited from an article as high-profile as this. This article is the lowest of the low as far as Wikipedia is concerned, in terms of user disagreement and persistance in trying to get the article back up at any opportunity, and the fact it is creating so much negative opinion is too strenuous on Wikipedia's wagon of faith.

<li><b>Keep</b> Should be a speedy keep like the last time. 9 AfDs is riduculously excessive, especially after the 6th was proclaimed to be the last and was highly trafficed. Although the full name reveals few Google hits and GNAA is overbroad, "Gay Nigger" reveals plenty. Also, if the stuff about the professor's speech is true, we have for the GNAA what we have for few Internet phenomenons: Academic commentary.

<li><b>Delete</b>. It seems to me there are two issues here, verifiability and notability--is this a <i>real</i> group? (and what do we mean by real?) and (more importantly) is in notable enough for an article. I suppose that I'm willing to allow that it is verified: someone is trolling pretending to be this group. But is the phenomenon notable? On this score, I think not. Who has ever seen first hand any of this trolling? And, more to the point, has it been deemed notable enough to rate a single article anywhere in the mainstream media? There are lots of people and groups that are the subject of a handful of real news stories that are still not wiki-worthy. <i>A fortoriori</i>, GNAA isn't either. <a href="../../../b/u/c/User%7EBucketsofg_06fb.html" title="User:Bucketsofg">Bucketsofg</a> 18:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. So basically the reasoning here is that this article on a trolling group will encourage others to troll? What specious logic that is. People are going to troll regardless of whether there's a group who does it; they've been trolling for long before the GNAA existed, and they'll be trolling long after the GNAA goes away. The group seems notable enough, though the article appears to need some sources for the first couple sections. -- <a href="../../../w/w/a/User%7EWwagner_2d3c.html" title="User:Wwagner">Wwagner</a> 18:10, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

As such I don't think that this present content about one course should hijack the entry. <a href="../../../b/e/j/User%7EBejnar_f26b.html" title="User:Bejnar">Bejnar</a> 19:02, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">This comic should not be deleted. Wikipedia has retained Elijah and Azuu on that bases that it is the #1 strip style comic on Drunk Duck. DD has two catagories for comics strips and graphic novels. Since Charby is the #1 Graphic Novel on DD, and even more popular then Elijah and Azuu, it should logically also be retained. -EEN <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.75.124.5 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.75.124.5_15de.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.75.124.5">contribs</a>).</small></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">I agree witht the above. This comic is entertaining, and has wonderful art, but due to the vastness of the archives, numerous people ask the same questions over and over on the site. A wiki will solve this problem. People can instead of asking a question, first check the Wiki, and THEN ask the question. I don't understand why this has been put up for deletion. -Milknut <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 71.193.135.216 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_71.193.135.216_34ae.html" title="Special:Contributions/71.193.135.216">contribs</a>).</small></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">CTV is an incredibly popular comic, especially taking into consideration the drop on DD readership after the crash.

<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> Reasonably written and informative. Despite the author specifically disliking promotion, it has easily made it to the most read of all drunk-duck story-based webcomics. Also, isn't there a little more to whether something is encyclopedic than mere number of google hits? It is relatively unknown, but rabidly followed by those who have found it. It is, in my opinion, an interesting anomaly of sorts and quite at home with having a wikipedia article.</span></li>

<dd><span style="font-size: 75%;">Oh, and when googling it is easy to forget that Charby the Vampirate will, unlike, say, Secret of Mana Theatre, turn up only results SPECIFICALLY about charby the vampirate, as Charby is a rather uncommon name, and vampirate is a compound word if not coined by the author, certainly very far from common. To get a more fair comparison to other, aparently acceptably noteworth webcomics, you should search for the entire phrase. For example, "Charby the Vampirate" returns just over 600 pages. "Secret of Mana Theatre" returns a masssive 630, and depending on whether you search for "TIN The Incompetent Ninja" or simply "The Incompetant Ninja", you get either a colossul 220, or up to an incomprehensible entire 770 pages.

<p><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep.</b> Charby is a very well-detailed comic, and has become very popular. It is definitely worthy of a page. --Andsean 00:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC) -Just because the article says that it's "relatively unknown in the webcomic community" doesn't mean that it's not worthy of a wikiedia page. If you keep this page it will help improve CTV's popularity. I also find that CTV is an incredibly detailed comic and has many devoted fans (check the forums) and yes it even has it's own forum! Amelius is and incredibly talented person and mannages to maintain CTV while also working on Unlife is Unfair, so I therefore believe that the CTV wiki entry should NOT be deleted. ~Kioushan <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 69.199.86.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.199.86.187_7788.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.199.86.187">contribs</a>).</small></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;">When compared to other comics it can be seen that Charby is above average in plot development, artistic quality, and character organization. Though this is largely a matter of opinion, many have proclaimed that Charby is their favorite. The comic updates regularly as promised and Amelius is more than willing to communicate with her fan base, a quality that’s not all to common with artists of her caliber that will ensure her comics growth. Charby also has a relatively active and growing fan forum demonstrating the growing potential of this comic and need for a Wiki reference.Daggertooth 01:19, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> There isn't any reason I can see to get rid of this entry, the subject is (as stated previously) large and features a lot of points of interest that a wiki entry would be useful to keep track of. The claim that it's relativly unkown should not be considered a prominant enough complaint to warrant deletion. This is a popular comic, and there are many lesser known tv-series/games/comics/people featured on wikipedia. I had thought the point of this site was to inform. Not just to inform on the overly popular subjets. --SeanJKS</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep.</b> Despise the slight error in Cyril bio (he wasn't killed), I beleive this should stay up. Charby the Vampirate is a good enough comic to deserve a wiki page, and, despise the authors modest personality, needs a little more publication. I'm sure her loyal fans (which are many) would love to see this page stay.</span></p>

<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>KEEP</b> There is no valid reason to delete this entry as outlined in the Wikipedia Deletion Policy. The Article is well written for covering the amount of information it is covering. The comic is increadibly popular, one of the most popular comics on Drunk Duck, it's popularity should not be an issue. This article on "Charby the Vampirate" should be kept.--Neilak20</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b> This webcomic has fulfilled all the requirements that have been put forth. it is a perfectly stable comic with a rigorous update schedule, it's drawn by a hard-working artist, and it has a very valuable and (obviously) very loyal fanbase. There are many other webcomics listed on this site and there has been no viable argument for its deletion other than mentioning the artists own distaste for self-promotion. As this article was not even published by said author, this argument is obsolete. --~SilverWolf~</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Strong Delete</b> - I came across this checking out the Whatlinkshere from Elijah and Azuu, which has been on my watchlist for a while pending an AFD. I was doing research on the thing before possibly AFDing the thing. Drunk Duck itself has an Alexa rank of over 100,000. Drunkduck is described in its article as being a small community, if that is correct, then the community reading Charby the Vampire is going to be even smaller.

<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Strong Keep</b> - Well, where do I begin. Charby the Vampirate is an incredibly origional comic, that has more readers than any other comic on the prestigious site, DrunkDuck.com. I can understand why you wouldn't want to have an article about an "unpopular" webcomic, but this is far from upopular. Since the author is not doing this for personal gain, because she does not like promoting, I think this will be a valuble recourse for many Charby fans' needs. I think we should keep this Wiki article here. - Shippo no Neko 17:57, 28 March 2006 (UTC)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;"><b>Keep</b>: I see no compelling reason to delete. Hanchen, you would make a similar argument even if it was hosted on <a href="../../../c/o/m/Comic_Genesis_e932.html" title="Comic Genesis">Comic Genesis</a>.

<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">As useless as you think Alexa is, Comic Genesis obviously generates a lot more traffic than DrunkDuck does. I had a look around drunkduck, it's a tiny community, there's only 1000 people in their forums. I'm sure that's not a great indicator of how popular the drunk duck community is, but there are less members there than the forums of a singluar unreleased mod for Half-Life 2. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 22:52, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 75%;">DD just crashed about 2 or three months ago and was until recently only supporting a few new fuctions as it was recoded with new options. 1000 people re-joining a forum in that short a time span isn't anything to scoff at.

<p><span style="font-size: 75%;">Point of Observation - Being the Top comic on DD was enough to get Count Your Sheep into Keenspot which I most will agree is no small feat. That would suggest that top DD position is something of a notable acomplishment unto itself and that DD has some notworthy standing in the comic community even if it isn't the number one comic hosting site. Charby did win several of Drunk Duck's Evil Empire awards before DD crashed and erased everything on that site. Lastly its 600+ issue full color archive is an impressive accomplishment by anyone's standards and that Charby at least has some impressive staying power with fans that most other comics lack. Charby and its characters are easily more popular then several obscure villians from main stream comics which have somehow gotten their own wiki entry despite extream obscurity and unpopularity mearly by the association with a large name publisher.</span></p>

<p>Alright, here's the deal with this one: It was on Pages needing translation to English, in Portuguese. I did not think the subject matter was notable enough after reading it and checking the claims, so I prodded the article. A fly-by editor removed the prod, and later while I was waiting the two weeks for it to go on AfD, another user did a rough translation of it.<br />
<br />
I admire the work that was done by a couple of editors in translating it, but this does not appear to be notable enough. He published one book about <a href="../../../b/a/t/Batman.html" title="Batman">Batman</a> and I could not verify any of the journalism awards it says he's won.

<p>self-confessed autobiography by the drummer of a band which does not have an Allmusic profile. Says virtually nothing of note independent of the band itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see the problem here. If you think there are songs not in triple meter, just remove them and optionally say on the talk page why.

<li>The problem is that the definition of triple metre is, IU think, inaccurate, and the verifiability, is suspect, and there is nothing terribly unusal about triple metre (meaning that it has a vast number of potential entries), and it was previously deleted under another title, and it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> sice there are no sources stating that these songs are in triple metre.

<li>This is an article we should <b>delete</b> - too many songs can be found of this kind. This meter is often encountered in rock - there's problems defining that meter as well.

<p>We deleted Songs in triple meter partly because it was unverifiable (since the music was not, for the most part, published in sheet form so could not be verified), partly because it was potentially vast (triple metre is not that uncommon). Additional concerns with this article are that: 12/8 is not, to my knowledge, triple metre, it's a compound double; I'm not even convinced 6/8 really qualifies since music in 6/8 is often beaten in two-to-the-bar, making it a compound double (certainly the 6/8 sections of the Agnus Dei in Beethoven's Missa Solemnis which I'm singing at the moment are two-to-a-bar). Unless and until we can have an authoritative scholarly source for the contention that these songs are in the time signatures claimed and that these time signatures are, in fact, triple metre, I say delete. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 20:59, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see the problem here. If you think there are songs not in triple meter, just remove them and optionally say on the talk page why.

<li>The problem is that the definition of triple metre is, I think, inaccurate, and the verifiability, is suspect, and there is nothing terribly unusal about triple metre (meaning that it has a vast number of potential entries), and it was previously deleted under another title, and it's <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> since there are no sources stating that these songs are in triple metre. Apart from those, and the fact that it's listcruft, there are no problems of which I'm aware:-) <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 23:11, 25 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I can see how there are controversial cases where a scholarly opinion is needed to verify triple meter, but for most works, especially outside modern academic music, I think everyone would agree whether they're in triple meter or not. The song itself serves as a published source, like when we cite a novel as source when giving a summary of that novel. Personally, I have little interest in lists of songs by decade and meter, but I don't see the list as fundamentally unverifiable, or unfixably inaccurate. Maybe it should be deleted as recreation of deleted material, but it seems like the "similarity of content" criterion would be hard to assess for an ostensibly objective list. --<a href="../../../a/m/c/User%7EAmcbride_b12f.html" title="User:Amcbride">Allen</a> 00:33, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>But what constitutes triple metre? The author of the article says that 6/8 and 12/8 are triple, but as far as I can tell they are generally treated as a compound duple. That's the problem: the sources cited do not actually say that the song is in triple, listening to the song and deciding it's in triple based on what you (perhaps wrongly) think triple is, is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If a secondary source could be cited which attests to these being in triple that miught be different, but there is no such source. <a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid; padding:0px 2px 2px 2px; color:white; background-color:darkblue; font-weight:bold">Guy</span> you know?</a> 10:12, 26 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Google hits are not the sole criterion of notability. The concept is, however, used extensively in Science Fiction - much fictional interstellar travel requires the concept, even if not explicitly labelled as a 'vacuum propeller'. Did you check the link and the books?</li>

<li>It's not original research, as far as I can see - see the references in the article. Perhaps I'm missing something, but could you explain why you consider it to be original research?

To be clear, the concept is that of using free space as a working fluid to allow transfer of momentum. Vacuum propellor is simply a shorthand way of saying it. So the concept may not be in Superman comics or Star Trek episodes, but it is used in mainstream, well published science fiction. By the way, by author, I meant of the article, not the concept. <a href="../../../w/e/s/User%7EWest_London_Dweller_79a2.html" title="User:West London Dweller">WLD</a> 02:20, 26 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> Sorry, but this is not compelling. You cite two cases of authors describing a vacuum propeller. Stephen Baxter's novel you admit describes something different than the article - wings instead of a propeller. I am very familiar with Iain M. Banks's works and his culture novels do not describe anything like a vacuum propeller that I can recall. You'll need a specific citation to convince me. If you could provide a reference to the works of an author like Banks or Baxter who uses a vacuum propeller (and that is what the article is about, not "the concept is that of using free space as a working fluid to allow transfer of momentum") then do so in the article - it does you no good here.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Hi Gwernol, please don't take this the wrong way - I can see the way this vote is inevitably heading, but I'll cite the use of the concept in Excession, Chapter 7 (p.246 in my Orbit edition). The <i>Yawning Angel</i> and <i>Charitable View</i> are chasing the <i>Sleeper Service</i>:

<dd>"Sums, sums. How much mass had there been aboard the damn thing? Water; gas-giant atmosphere, highly pressurised. About four thousand cubic kilometres of water alone; four gigatonnes.

<dd>In other words, we have a machine that does not use reaction mass to generate velocity in a vacuum. Granted, Iain M. Banks doesn't call it a 'vacuum propeller', but I think the concept applies.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>DELETE</b>. The anons rather patronising defence aside, just look at the article! It's first-person research (it even says "I hope") and waxes lyrical about how underappreciated women are. This article, as the deleters make very clear, is in need of beginning over from scratch. Seqsea, note that an AfD does not "salt the earth" forever: a non-substantially indentical creation is not subject to this AfD in any way. But as the article stands, it is hopeless, it's only content being exactly as charged by the deleters. Thus, without prejudice to a proper job, delete. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 17:23, 1 April 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>The article is not a POV soapbox, however, I can see how much younger people, who can't relate to the historical significance of women having been shut out of working in the news media, would think so. I can also understand why the article has limited appeal in attracting younger people to contribute to it so that it can become an article worthy of keeping. Documenting discrimination against women in this, or any other, field of endeavor is not a violation of POV. Confusing POV with documentation of discrimination isn't acceptable and thus is no valid reason to delete this article. This article is a work in progress with an aim toward attracting others to contribute to it - just as so many others on Wikipedia have done. Wikipedia needs all kinds of people, not just the young, so if you are young, why not restrain your POV and allow this article stay for a while longer.<b>KEEP</b> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 151.213.236.187 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_151.213.236.187_eccb.html" title="Special:Contributions/151.213.236.187">contribs</a>).</small></li>

The article used to be a lot longer and more detailed (to comment on being "very modest") with useless information about his family life, copy editing experience, etc. After the article was proposed for deletion, the author (using an anonymous URL) pared it down to what you see now. This is a lot better than the other quite wordy, <a href="../../../v/a/i/WP%7EVAIN_5b75.html" title="WP:VAIN">vain</a> version.

<p>This appears to be a page created by it's name sake. It is my opinion that this individual is not notable enough to warrent an article.

<li><b>Keep it!</b> I work with Ruth on a day to day basis and i would say she is wholly deserving of an entry on wikipedia! And I tell you something else, there is no way she wrote that article herself - it's full of spelling errors! Ruth's English lit degree, her spells as editor of hype and student plus her internship with the Observer assure me that she has nothing to do with this. Everything in this entry is accurate. She might not be renound across Scotland quite like an MSP but she is extremely well known within the Higher Education sector and that is a credit to the hard work she has put in this year. Credit where credit is due - keep the article, I think it's great. Kezia Dugdale</li>
