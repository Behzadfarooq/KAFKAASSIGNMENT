<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Transwiki</b> to Wikisource. While I am normally reluctant to vote delete on a Wikiproject associated article, I think that this is not appropriate for Wikipedia.

<li><b>Keep</b> for reasons below:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd><b>fuddlemark:</b> The suggestion that this information is out of date or unreliable is erroneous and without foundation. I update this article regularly and in advance of all changes released by TransLink. Wikipedia is intended to be dynamic and not static. Further, other articles use the route data, such as <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_South_East_Queensland_railway_stations_c468.html" title="List of South East Queensland railway stations">every railway station</a> and some other minor pages. This is not a mirror as you suggest, but a reference source by which the appropriate TT can be found at a glance. <b>Aplomado:</b> None of this information is indiscriminate - it is logically ordered and does not meet anything in. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, except potentially a travel guide and that is pushing it. This is an highly accurate list of public bus routes, not mere phone numbers or a FAQ. <b>Sendai:</b> The actual TransLink page is linked in the first sentence. <b>Capitalroadster:</b> See above, it is very easy to keep this up to date, and I am willing to do so. Wikipedia is not non-changing.</dd>

<dd>Further, similar lists exist for <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Melbourne_bus_routes_a2a9.html" title="List of Melbourne bus routes">Melbourne</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Perth_bus_routes_75a2.html" title="List of Perth bus routes">Perth</a>, albeit with lesser detail. This is a functional and useful article which I and other refer to on a regular basis. Wikipedia encompasses a broader concept of what is encyclopaedic than that which is traditional, and thus incorporates articles all over the world about public transport services, such as an analogous page for every Australian urban rail system and one for every line and station. Most importantly - the previous incarnation of this article (renamed from (Brisbane) to the more accurate (South East Queensland)) was permitted to survive.<a href="../../../s/m/2/User%7ESM247_5173.html" title="User:SM247">SM247</a> 11:43, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I would not support keeping the current bus timetable on Wikipedia, but this is similar information to many, many other public transport system articles. IMO, an article like this (accurate, maintained, sourced real information useful to people) should not be deleted; at worst, it should be moved to another Wiki, but I'm not even convinced of that in this case. <a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMorven_1e3d.html" title="User:Morven">Matthew Brown (Morven)</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/r/User_talk%7EMorven_2a5f.html" title="User talk:Morven">T</a>:<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Morven_de06.html" title="Special:Contributions/Morven">C</a>) 14:48, 3 May 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> With regards to JustinC: the proposition that current information is not valid content for a dynamic online encyclopaedia such as Wikipedia is so misconceived that I do not know where to begin.

<li><b>Comment</b> This page and its predecessor were singled out. Why not also list for deletion the equivalent pages in other cities? Melbourne has an actual page for each of its tram <i>routes</i> for goodness' sake.
