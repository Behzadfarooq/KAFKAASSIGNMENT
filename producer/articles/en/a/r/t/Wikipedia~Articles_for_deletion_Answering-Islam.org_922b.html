<p>That is a hate-website against Islam. We have no idea who is running that website see [<a href="http://answering-islam.org/about.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://answering-islam.org/about.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>]. The website is created for a reason to write against Islam and mix lies with other things to present their points.

<li><b>Comment</b> and <b>weak delete</b>. First of all, I notice that some, but not all, of the users favoring deletion are Muslims or somehow associated with Islam. (Note: I only mention this here because of the potential for a one-sided POV on the side of the deletion-favorers). That being said, so little has been said on the website, and so little defense of its notability has been done, that perhaps we should mention the website as being among the work of Islam's detractors or critics in the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islam.html" title="Islam">Islam</a> and <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Islam_00d9.html" title="Criticism of Islam">Criticism of Islam</a> articles for now, and create an article when there is more reason to believe in the site's notability. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 16:50, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm not going to even think of visiting this website from work, so I can't vote either way on this, but I'd recommend that the nominator reword his nomination.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> not much citing of the web site from other sites though if someone can find some stuff I'm happy to help build up the article. That aside - I would protect their right to say what they want so if this site is used as a link in other articles then I would keep the links in place BUT the site itself need not yet have its own wikipedia article. I love how they "seek to demonstrate flaws of Islam using biblical arguments." Oh boy - that cracked me up, talk about the Blind leading the blind. Both the Bible and the Quran are more or less fictional works interweaving allegorically interpreted tales from earlier works with historical events and contemporaneous knowledge.

<li><b>Delete</b> hi all, I think this article should be deleted. it just shows a website and its motto. I think its not needed in wikipedia. if it is needed only because it was on alexa rankings or some other pretty useless reason. then please tell me, can i make articles on islamonline.net (which is in top 1000 ranking), islam-qa.com(top 10000),islamicity.com(top 10000) and many more. I will start building article on this website organisation soon. <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 18:39, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: This is essentially the same argument he made on <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Faith_Freedom_International_b670.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Faith Freedom International</a>, with cut-and-paste techniques and taking out the Alexa number. I answered his assertations on the FFI AfD. I stand by my <b>weak delete</b> for Answring-islam.org and my <b>keep</b> for Faith Freedom International, by the way, since there is more of a case for the notability of the latter. — <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERickyrab_21c2.html" title="User:Rickyrab">Rickyrab</a> | <a href="../../../r/i/c/User_talk%7ERickyrab_2fd1.html" title="User talk:Rickyrab">Talk</a> 19:50, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Thanks for making the stubs on that mate. I really appreciate it. it just shows there are people on wikipedia who have neutral point of view(copy n pasted. I dont like t write again if i have to say the same thing. why bother when we can make our lives easy, unless cheating or illegal stuff). <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMak82hyd_866c.html" title="User:Mak82hyd">Mak82hyd</a> 20:00, 9 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>
