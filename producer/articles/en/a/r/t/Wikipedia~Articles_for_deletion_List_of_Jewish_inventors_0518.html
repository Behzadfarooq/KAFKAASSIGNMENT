<p>After attempts at reform on the talk page - of which were ignored - I have decided to put this list up for deletion on the basis that it is highly extraneous, unprecedented by any other nationality, religious group, or ethnicity, and frankly listcruft. As a category, this would be appropriate, seminally. However, as a list it is too broad, not well defined, and all in all highly unnecessary. Anyway, <b>Strong Delete</b> and possible reform into category. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:22, 7 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Lots of people. Same as with all the other info in this encyclopedia. I get 1.5 million google hits for inventor and religion. How do you explain that? The fact that you don't like the information, does not mean that it is not useful for many people. Was your nom in bad faith? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:44, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Google hits have no basis for this - as there are many google hits for academics and political party as well - but I highly doubt List of Republican inventors will ever be made.

Plus, this has no bearing on the reason for deletion of this thread. <i>It may be a way to just circumvent the opinion on this AFD</i>. Especially calling this a bad faith nomination though I clearly explicated my reasoning and ATTEMPTED to ask for reforms on the TALK page. It also may be further attempts to keep all the excess lists worked on and created by the people who hold a virtual monopoly on these pages - in other words, not allowing any outside view. If we want to bring out credibility, then please note the behaviour of User:Arniep during the times previous AFDS on Jewish lists were brought up. Nonetheless, I do not see his behavoir or my suspected behavior to have any bearing on the keep or delete basis of this list. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 20:20, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Please note all the reasons I have listed above - then explain why you claim that is the <i>only grounds</i>. Also, deleting a list because one does not wish to start a revolution of ethnic battling on wikipedia with List of German inventors, List of Chinese inventors, and List of Native Inuit Eskimo inventors and because a category is clearly the appropriate usage here is in no way a <i>rotten reason</i>. It is surely more "rotten" to just vote keep on all lists you may have a preference for regardless of others attempts to improve (I mentioned before I will make as many stubs as I can for these) or revise (move to a category) them. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 20:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Lists certainly do have usefulness. Categories are limited to the number of people that can be shown on one page, whereas lists can be scanned easily. Lists allow you to see names in context with descriptions and explanation, categories do not. I hardly see how your "ethnic battling" argument holds ground when you yourself recently created <a href="../../../s/l/o/Category%7ESlovak_inventors_6b98.html" title="Category:Slovak inventors">Category:Slovak inventors</a> and <a href="../../../s/e/r/Category%7ESerbian_inventors_9e67.html" title="Category:Serbian inventors">Category:Serbian inventors</a>.

<dl>
<dd>I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't make the categories. Besides, I said before that I AGREE with categories - they are helpful - and I will gladly make one for that list for deletion. What I meant by ethnic battling is that LISTS of this specific nature do not have a basis for existing since they are all separate articles - made to explicitly highlight themselves. Categories on the other hand are PART of a larger category. You don't expect that if a list of Jewish inventors survives the Germans, the English, the Catholics won't want to make their own lists and TONS of other peoples with specific adherences?! THAT indeed is a creation-war on ethnic lines (and other lines, like sexual preference). It will spark <i>listmania</i> which many users here don't appreciate or like much. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:04, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>A category is not the only appropriate answer here. First, you only attempted to make stubs because the list existed, which is somewhat ironic, considering you want it deleted. Second, how are anons, now banned from creating new pages, supposed to add new people to categories? -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 20:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I thought the anon ban was only temporary. But anyway, there are many things anons can't do but we're not flipping Wikipedia upside down just to give them more priveleges. I don't think many people are complaining anons can't upload images. Also, there exist lists for these people. They are called lists by country and Jews have plenty of them. All that is needed is to place a red name in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a> or <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_British_Jews_c846.html" title="List of British Jews">List of British Jews</a> and it will get the same treatment as here.

<ul>
<li>Well, it's helping you to make stubs. That's one good reason. That's called improving the information available at wikipedia. Your second reason is false. If I want to add a Jewish inventor to a list, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a> points me to other lists, namely this list that you want to delete. There are no names in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Jewish_Americans_450a.html" title="List of Jewish Americans">List of Jewish Americans</a>, which I believe is one of the results of your reform process. Any name added to that list would likely get reverted as vandalism. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 21:26, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Maybe you misinterpreted me. My point was that nationaltiy articles already exist for red names for Jewish people, so there's really no point of having this list. You can easily add these names to the sublists of Jewish Americans or to all the other Jewish country lists. As a matter of fact, they will probably be made faster on those. BUT if you DO want a separate area just for Jewish inventors (which ok..theres no problem there) then what's wrong with a category? Everyone else does it. <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntidote_a07c.html" title="User:Antidote">Antidote</a> 21:40, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>what's wrong is your continuing concentration on deleting Jewish lists and your voting multiple times on them (see <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_comment_Antidote_Voting_fad8.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Antidote/Voting</a>).

<li><b>Delete</b> because the connection between "Jewishness" and "inventors" is highly subjective and seems to be more of a <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychological_projection.html" title="Psychological projection">psychological projection</a> of something (maybe anything?) in some people's minds, than anything truly scholarly. <a href="../../../i/z/a/User%7EIZAK_fd83.html" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> 14:53, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>surely the same reasoning could be applied to American, Slovak or Serbian inventors. I don't usually look for inventors by nationality, I generally look for them by subject area. Arniep 20:41, 13 December 2005 (UTC)
