<li><b>Comment</b> First of all, I would like to remind everyone here that the Wikipedia serves a different purpose than you all think. It is not a dictionary where you can find hogwash neologism uttered by a corrupt, technically illiterate, low-profile and nonserious <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">Indian</a> politician. If any low-<a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">caste</a> user likes this word then he may have it listed in the <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">wiktionary</a>. Remember, this is an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopaedia.html" title="Encyclopaedia">encyclopaedia</a> and has been created to share great knowledge. I do not see the reason why such things should occupy valuable space on the already overloaded <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> server. Another point to note that even if the word exists (though I doubt it), it is an abbreviation and the 'article', if continues to exist (if some ignorant fools have their way), should not have anything more than who was the hick who coined the term and what is the expansion of this word. The vandal <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a> (who is also a <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandala.html" title="Chandala">Chandala</a> / <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandal.html" title="Chandal">Chandal</a> by the grace of <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> as he has confessed on <a href="../../../k/h/a/Khatri.html" title="Khatri">Khatri</a> talk page) is notorious for cleverly defacing the pages of almost all the upper <a href="../../../c/a/s/Caste.html" title="Caste">castes</a>. I find it inappropriate fo him to question the origin of certain castes when he has no sound basis for that. How can he add "historians are not certain of the origin of these people"? He can discuss such things at the repective talk pages of these castes and not on this boorbaal (or whatever it is) page. I would like to ask him: "Are historians sure of the origin of your caste (<a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandala.html" title="Chandala">Chandala</a> / <a href="../../../c/h/a/Chandal.html" title="Chandal">Chandal</a>)? If so, how? If yes, why do you not write about it on its page? It would be better to <a href="../../../b/l/o/Block.html" title="Block">block</a> him for good so that his dreams of becoming the first <a href="../../../s/h/u/Shudra.html" title="Shudra">Shudra</a> admin gets shattered. Friends, I don't blame him for all this. <a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">User:Holywarrior</a>, being from an <a href="../../../u/n/t/Untouchable.html" title="Untouchable">untouchable</a> caste of <a href="../../../i/n/d/India.html" title="India">India</a>, must have faced discrimination and humiliation from these castes whom he collectively refers to as Bhurabal. Consequently, he has become mentally deranged. Man, get treated for <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisocial_Personality_Disorder_ecd3.html" title="Antisocial Personality Disorder">Antisocial Personality Disorder</a> or <a href="../../../s/c/h/Schizophrenia.html" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> or whatever you have. I would be back with some proofs of his great deeds of vandalism. <a href="../../../v/a/n/User%7EVandalPatrol_9ecd.html" title="User:VandalPatrol">VandalPatrol</a> 06:22, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li>How about deleting Wikipedia/RC patroller-Everyone seems to be having dubious records there.How can one deny affiliation from this and Vnadal Control Units are the first target of Vandals/Scoundrels to get listed there so as to impersonate as respectable editors/admin and also acts as a link page for vandal interaction.I am not a bit amazed to see development on Bhurabal page and comments here.Perhaps this has become modus operandi of vandal groups in which admins too are participating.Sad but true.<a href="../../../h/o/l/User%7EHolywarrior_ee67.html" title="User:Holywarrior">Holywarrior</a> 07:50, 21 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
