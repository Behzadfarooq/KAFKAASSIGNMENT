<li><b>Keep</b>. Despite the internet culture, theatre and Broadway still count for something. Furthermore, I'm offended by a blanket statement dismissing stage actors as non-notable. Ms. Alers has been in a number of major Broadway shows.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I understood what you meant when you wrote "<i>stage-only actors...don't register as notable in my mind"</i>. Let me be clear, in my opinion if the Bio page does not address the stage then it should be revised if not completely trashed. I would certainly not use it as any kind of yardstick for judging the achievements of Ms. Alers. That is my opinion. I would ask that you do not use the word <i>unencyclopedic</i> as an assertion of fact when you are really just stating your opinion. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 04:15, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Your nom dismissed an entire profession as "non notable". You then compounded it in your second comment.

<li>So if there was an article here for a janitor and I brought it here for that reason, that means I have no respect for janitors?! Come on... If WP:BIO said "all stage-only actors are in", I wouldn't be typing this now. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 04:54, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wp:Bio is a set of extremely inadequate guidelines. It does not address the stage and it does not address janitors. Based on your own statements, you have very little regard for stage actors. Your nom has neither examined Ms. Alers' standing within the theatrical profession, nor explained why an actress who has appeared in a number of Broadway shows- the major leagues of her profession- should not have an article here. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:05, 15 February 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, you're equating my saying something is non-notable to me having little regard for that thing. My mother isn't sufficiently notable for Wikipedia - that doesn't mean I have little regard for her. You seem to have little regard for the WP:BIO guidelines which I think is more germaine to this argument. Here's a reason she shouldn't have an article. All these people have as many or more credits listed at IBDB.com and are red links: Stephen Lee Anderson, René Ceballos, Gilles Chiasson, Aiko Nakasone, <a href="../../../j/a/r/Jarrod_Emick_8d06.html" title="Jarrod Emick">Jarrod Emick</a>.

<li>I'm going further and saying <i>no one</i> writes articles on stage-only actors. I didn't find a single counterexample except this one. I stopped after five examples out of boredom. With Wikipedia now having been around this long with this many contributors and this many articles, I think that shows a clear pattern. Even if someone starts writing articles about stage-only actors, it doesn't sound like they should start here. All but one of my examples above have IMDB credits so they're more deserving of articles first. There's more chance that the billions of people outside of New York City may have seen or heard of them - that's just a fact, not disrespect. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 11:38, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I've been very clear about my opinion of the guidelines. The use of the qualifier <i>seem</i> is not required. In the same way you have been very clear in stating that you do not believe that stage actors deserve inclusion here. I have disagreed. Ms. Alers has been in the casts of a number of Broadway shows. I have confirmed Rent and Capeman. That is good enough for me. There is no point in debating this further. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 05:53, 15 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>In some ways I would argue it is better. She was an understudy with the original cast of Rent, which means she played almost all the female roles at one time or another in front of a live audience. She then had a marquee role with the first touring company. She was also in the original cast of the Paul Simon show Capeman. Those are the only two I tried to confirm but there may be more based on the list on her website. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 08:00, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Of course stage-only actors can be suitible Wikipedia topics! But I'm not sure that this lady is well-known enough because I don't have enough of an interest in the genre to really judge. If she had a major part in the original production of <i><a href="../../../r/e/n/Rent_%28musical%29.html" title="Rent (musical)">Rent</a></i> rather than being an understudy, perhaps-- but then she did have what I assume was a major part ("Mimi") in the touring production.

<li><b>Delete</b> per Calton. Of course stage actors don't appear in the IMDB, they don't have tv and movie credits. That doesn't mean they are inherently non-notable, though.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just having a job (actress) does not make one encyclopedic.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. This AfD is just a display of aggressive ignorance; asserting that stage performances alone cannot provide notability is astonishingly foolish. Alers' Broadway credits are certainly substantive, if not stellar, as shown in the IBDB; a comparable entry in the IMDB would with next to no dispute satisfy the Wikipedia notability requirement. (A "swing" performer is not an understudy, as several of the comments here dismissively suggest, but one who is prepared for most if not all of the relevant non-lead roles in the program, and appears fairly regularly as a substitute performer.) Wikipedia has scores of entries for women who perform on stages with poles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_strippers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_strippers" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>, particularly women who have had attention-grabbing (if not outright deforming) cosmetic surgery and perform on stages with poles <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_big-bust_models_and_performers" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>. There is something creepy about the way so many editors believe that being an open participant in the commercial sex trade is inherently notable, while being an above-average working artist is not. (The average New York City actor never appears in original cast of a major Broadway production in any capacity, as Alers did in <i>The Capeman</i>.) <a href="../../../m/o/n/User%7EMonicasdude_2144.html" title="User:Monicasdude">Monicasdude</a> 16:34, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wknight94's peculiar standards notwithstanding, the answer to the lack representation of notable stage-only or mainly theater actors (not an oxymoron -- the TV/film industry isn't the end-all and be-all of acting notability) is NOT to lower the bar to pad out Wikipedia's coverage, but find and include the headliners who aren't represented, the likes of, off the top of my head, <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristin_Chenoweth_e82e.html" title="Kristin Chenoweth">Kristin Chenoweth</a>, <a href="../../../c/h/e/Cherry_Jones_1657.html" title="Cherry Jones">Cherry Jones</a>, <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sara_Ramirez_136d.html" title="Sara Ramirez">Sara Ramirez</a>, and <a href="../../../s/a/r/Sarah_Jones_ae19.html" title="Sarah Jones">Sarah Jones</a> (who all, checking the "Show preview" button, have articles).

<li>Good points, but can we please lose the "stage-only" bit from the discussion? The proper term is stage actor, theatre actor, or thespian.

<li>No, I don't see how we can. It's 2006 and whether a person has television/movie experience is a totally relevant criteria. Calton seems to have found in Sarah Jones the only other person with IBDB credits and no IMDB credits that has an article on Wikipedia. If that standard is so peculiar, then why isn't anyone here adding similar articles? If I can somehow drag this discussion back to the original article here, there appears to be dozens or hundreds of actors that are in IBDB and not in IMDB that would be more notable than Yassmin Alers but don't have articles here. How can that <i>not</i> be relevant? It's like making a list of all notable American cities and starting with <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palisade%2C_Nebraska_a4dc.html" title="Palisade, Nebraska">Palisade, Nebraska</a> --- and then giving up after that one. If I saw that, I'd guess the list wasn't too impressive to begin with.

<dd>You don't give up, do you? I said above there was no point in debating this anymore. I merely mentioned a point of semantics. "Stage-only" does not exist.

<li>I'm dubious about the accuracy of this article. It says that she has "appeared in many commercials nationwide, and can be found in many movies and television shows." I only see one TV credit and she has no IMDB entry. But she did do a national tour and does get a lot of google hits. However she doesn't appear to have the bona fides of a notable broadway actress just yet. So I'm stuck in neutral on this one.&#160;:) — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 16:51, 15 February 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I've never so many people complain about the coverage of an entire subject - but do nothing to actually increase the coverage of that subject! If there were a hundred other similar articles, I'd think it was a standard and leave it alone - but no.

<li><b>Keep</b>, though barely. The arguement we should exclude stage-only actors is utterly absurd. The nominator has confused bias with policy. We don't have articles on many communities in certain parts of the world, that doesn't mean its policy to exclude them. It means we lack Wikipedians with an interest to do so. Wikipedia should strive to cover more then just pop culture. One should never confuse "notable" with "stuff I care about" or "stuff everybody already knows". --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 14:23, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: "Utterly absurd" is awfully strong considering this many die-hard stage fans have been around Wikipedia for this long and <i>almost zero</i> such articles have been added. That sounds a lot more like "stuff <i>no one</i> cares about". We have teenage college debate competition runner-up's covered like a thick blanket but these "thespians" have been ignored here for years. For about the fourth time, I'll say put your money where your mouth is - spend less time attacking me and more time pumping out some articles on people whose notability is apparently obvious to everyone but me. And BTW, don't say "stage-only" for Godsake or someone here will blow a gasket! They <i>choose</i> to never get widespread media coverage or fame. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 16:47, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>Why should I spend "<i>...more time pumping out some articles on people whose notability is apparently obvious to everyone...</i>", when you wish to delete those very articles. The fact we've undercovered stage-only actors is all the more reason to have more articles on stage-only actors. Also, I'm going to call your bluff here. Please cite some examples of people who's sole claim to fame is being a "<i>college debate competition runner-up</i>", that have articles. I suspect every such article has been speedy deleted a long time ago. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 17:19, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

<li>I wouldn't delete those articles if there were more of them. I'm going by precedent here - and by the fact that <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>'s guidelines seem to come nowhere near including this person - so I don't understand why everyone else is saying it's so obvious that this career choice is notable. The college debating comment was in reference to <a href="../../../e/r/i/Erik_Eastaugh_f4bc.html" title="Erik Eastaugh">Erik Eastaugh</a> whose Afd also has a lot of people saying he should obviously be kept. (I voted delete there on a different precedent that more notable competitions - like Speeling Bees that I've even seen on TV - get nowhere near as much coverage here). He's linked from at least one article that seems to link to a bunch of other college-level debaters. Regardless, my point is when you start adding a new category of info, you start at the top ---- otherwise it looks like cheesy vanity to the outside world. —<a href="../../../w/k/n/User%7EWknight94_8d60.html" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="../../../w/k/n/User_talk%7EWknight94_ce18.html" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 17:48, 18 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
