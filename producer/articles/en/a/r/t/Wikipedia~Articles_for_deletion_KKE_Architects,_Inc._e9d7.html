<hr />
<p>The article concisely states the firm description and scope, with no self-promoting gratuity, and provides unbiased 3rd party references. The article provides a brief synopsis of “notable” existing and proposed buildings. The article also provides a non-promotional history timeline, which is informative and educational to an architectural firms progression. Please see my user page for additional info. Thanks! <a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 08:55, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>, references must not <i>only</i> be third-party, but must also be reliable and non-trivial. <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> is not a "pick any one" criterion. First couple of sources (Architecture Week) are trivial directory-style listings (likely paid ones), third one trivially mentions the company (one sentence!), and the rest don't mention this company at all! A non-trivial source means the company is the <i>focus</i> of a <i>full piece</i> (not blurb or directory entry) in a reliable, editorially-controlled or scholarly peer-reviewed publication. (Note: If the company really did help <i>significantly</i> in building Mall of America, I would imagine better sourcing can be found. No prejudice to recreation if better sources are found and cited.) <a href="../../../s/e/r/User%7ESeraphimblade_3956.html" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> <small><sup><a href="../../../s/e/r/User_talk%7ESeraphimblade_c110.html" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a> <a href="../../../e/d/i/Wikipedia%7EEditor_review_Seraphimblade_2_de03.html" title="Wikipedia:Editor review/Seraphimblade 2">Please review me!</a></sup></small> 19:57, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>I have added an additional reference to KKE’s involvement in the Mall of America and updated the KKE Architects, Inc. page. As for the architectureweek reference, I simply provided this to indicate what this firm specializes in (as there are many various aspects to this profession). Architectureweek is a free online weekly newsletter with a free directory that is derived from the wiki “Archiplanet.org” website. I could refer the article to the KKE website for the same information, but I thought that would appear too self-promoting. And to address your comment that some of the sources only cite one instance of mention to the compnay, it is not uncommon for these design professional's to be briefly credited. Perhaps this has something to do with the fact the architects routinely rank as one of the least unhappy and lowest paid professionals. One reference does not indicate KKE, but Howard F. Thompson, whose firm/work was acquired by KKE. Also, I noticed someone deleted the pages content…I believe this should not have been done. As stated in wikipedia’s deletion review process “While the review is in progress, you are welcome to edit the article, <i>but please do not blank it</i>…” <a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 22:41, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Question</b> Did this come here straight from a speedy? there is no relevant history before the deletion review., and no AfD. . <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:44, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a way, yes. <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> recomended I place it here for review. Here is the brief history on my attempt at this article: The article was first posted on 2-2-07, and this was my first ever wiki attempt. That article was speedily deleted by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a>. I revamped the article and reposted it on 2-8-07, but it was then speedily deleted by <a href="../../../r/h/a/User%7ERHaworth_2933.html" title="User:RHaworth">RHaworth</a> who indicated it was "reposted spam". The thing is, I believe he was quick on the gun and must have reviewed the first (2-2-07) artcile deleted by <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">Chairboy</a>, as he made mention of references only in the original 2-2-07 version. I tried to make him aware of this, but he insisted I move this to deletion review.<a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 04:30, 11 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>List on afd.</b> Assuming that I understand the sequence, it seems an example of over-hasty and rather careless process. There's no point in trying to defend decisions made on such a basis--with the record as confused as that, the course is to have a proper AfD debate in the ordinary way. The ordinary way works fairly well. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 05:07, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><b>very weak delete</b> 2 of the sources in the refernces section on considered reliable by wikipedia standards, however neither mentions the subject of the article more than once. <a href="../../../i/k/a/User%7EIkanreed_d2bc.html" title="User:Ikanreed">i kan reed</a> 19:58, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>I see your point of the lack of mention, but as I indicated above, acknowledgment of the design team is often very brief, if at all (for most projects). I will due my best to keep an eye out and include additional interview references and the such (if consensus/admin. decides to keep).<a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 21:48, 12 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Delete.</b> It's a complicated case because these folks designed the Mall of America, but the article's format and style does not sit well with me - i.e., it doesn't place this company's relevance in a broader context. <a href="../../../y/e/c/User%7EYechielMan_4ab2.html" title="User:YechielMan">YechielMan</a> 01:24, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>delete</b> per yechielman - <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> is the only linked article that might possibly give a link back, but it doesn't. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaronbrick_b1aa.html" title="User:Aaronbrick">Aaronbrick</a> 03:16, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>YachielMan: There are very few architectural firm articles available for reference that I could find as an example of format. As stated in my user profile, I choose to loosley model the KKE article from the semi-longstanding “<a href="../../../s/k/i/Skidmore%2C_Owings_and_Merrill_19ee.html" title="Skidmore, Owings and Merrill">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>" article. <a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 06:28, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>Aaronbrick: Yah, I tried yesterday to add a link within the <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> upper right facts box...but for some reason it does not show up (I'm pretty fresh to this). If you have the time, could you elaborate on what I may be doing wrong. Thanks <a href="../../../j/i/s/User%7EJisher_5768.html" title="User:Jisher">Jisher</a> 06:29, 13 February 2007 (UTC)</p>
