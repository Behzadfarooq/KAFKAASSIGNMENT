<p>This is a synthesis from primary sources, i.e. original research. Does it have a place here if rewritten to fix that? Maybe, maybe not; I'd call it fancruft and leave this to Memory Alpha, but that's an aside. This article is OR and needs to be referenced from reliable secondary sources or deleted. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 23:43, 5 December 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> - There have been a lot of Star Trek nominations that have seemed unfair. This is not one. The coverage adds nothing beyond what would be contained in individual episodes.

<dd>Well, star trek law is a very vast and smudgy area. This article is trying to focus on a branch of starfleet more than star trek law. Starfleet is obviously a notable fictional organization and this is its notable branch. The branch affected canon a great deal, lots of very notable events.

<dd>(edit conflict where I repeat WJBScribe's point)Well, it's not a "major branch of Starfleet," because Starfleet doesn't exist. It's a plot device in a work of fiction. What I'm trying to figure out is how important a plot device it is. Is it merely a designator for the characters who are introduced when the plot calls for a court-martial or is the organization itself involved in the plot? <a href="../../../j/c/h/User%7EJChap2007_3bf5.html" title="User:JChap2007">JChap2007</a> 01:11, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There is probably not an "anti-Star Trek cabal" of Wikipedia users who want these things gone, I will give you that. But, I feel strongly that there are personal feelings mixing in with some of the AfD nominators stretching back to initial edits on <a href="../../../f/l/e/Fleet_captain_%28Star_Trek%29_8c08.html" title="Fleet captain (Star Trek)">Fleet captain (Star Trek)</a> where material was removed, over and over again as "unsourced" even after sources were provided. The same user who was doing this then nominated Warrant Officer (Star Trek) for deletion and did so in a quick and quiet fashion, not bothering to contact or talk page those who had worked on the article. When the deletion was overturned, its parent article, Starfleet alternate ranks and insignia was also nominated for deletion and the nominator openly stated that they were upset that Warrant Officer was still around and would therefore nominate its parent article for deletion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2006_November_30&amp;diff=91132585&amp;oldid=91129856" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. When <i>that</i> deletion attempt failed, one of the users involved followed my edits to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a> and, after I made an honest and innocent attempt to imporve the article, I was <i>slammed</i> on the talk page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Starfleet_Security&amp;diff=92296643&amp;oldid=92293872" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Starfleet_Security&amp;diff=92296643&amp;oldid=92293872" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> in a highly uncivil tone, my edits called "crap" and "hogwash", accused of making up sources, and of committing a copyright violation. When all this is overturned on the Admin Norticeboard, less than 5 minutes later Starfleet Security is up for deletion. Then, after <a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECoolcat_e5e1.html" title="User:Coolcat">User:Coolcat</a> makes the best case he can, the AfD nominator of that article in turn nominates this one for deletion, almost as an effort to get Coolcat stirred up even more. Three years ago when I joined this site, something like this would <b>NEVER</b> have happened. People would have talked it out on talk pages instead of trying to get things deleted to upset other users. I guess times change but I simply don't think this is right.

<dd>I don't understand this tendency toward not naming names - I axed a chunk of the fleet captain stuff (repeatedly) because it was uncited. You've since provided a plausible citation (Okuda's assertion, I think some other stuff from print sources) and, voila, no more removal by me. The warrant officer material continues to be speculative nonsense/crap/hogwash, the only "citation" being to a fanboy website -- it should still be deleted. (Heck, the phrase "warrant officer" is never mentioned in all of live action Trek -- yes, yes, I know, you have these myriad resources back home. But, as Morwen points out, "I don't have it with me" doesn't alleviate the burden of proof.) Starfleet Security I voted to *keep* even though the article itself is still laden with OR and generalizations -- but, as I said on that AfD page, there's an underlying degree of usefulness to it. As for SF JAG, another keep -- and how about you take a look at its edit history, remind me who's done a fair amount of sprucing up.</dd>
<dd>I don't buy the "it's personal, not business" assertion, at least insofar as I'm a factor. Until this spate of AfDs, neither you nor Cool Cat nor anyone else on wikipedia has really even registered as a person to me -- it's not worthwhile to keep that stuff in my head -- and the only thing that's stuck in my head about you is the Navy thing. I don't check contributors' names; I check contributions. If I were to have a gripe against you (outside of mainspace contributions), it's your lumping me in with the folks endorsing the more recent deletions. I have no problem AfDing something as WP:OR; I probably would not, however, AfD something Trek-related for WP:N (as these latter ones appear to be) because I am, after all, a geek -- I keep it closeted in the real world, so that part of me really goes crazy on wikipedia. --<a href="../../../e/e/m/User%7EEEMeltonIV_6dc8.html" title="User:EEMeltonIV">EEMeltonIV</a> 20:42, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

<li>Deletionists: Husnock's convinced you're all out to get Star Trek pages. And the Klingon law page is in bad shape - I added a note that it needs references, and there are many more examples from the shows that could be added to flesh it out. I actually had second thoughts about posting it here, for fear that it'd get AfD'd immediately, but it's relevant to this discussion, so here it is. How about you show a sign of good faith, and <i>not</i> start AfDs on any of the articles I just mentioned? <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 05:42, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It's worth noting CoolCat has decided that since the article is merged, this entire deletion discussion is null and void. I'm very sure that when an admin strolls along and looks at this they will be <i>vastly</i> interested in your creative interpretation of deletion process, specifically the part where it says <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html#You_may_edit_the_article_during_the_discussion" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">to be bold but cautious in moving, renaming, and merging.</a>. So far, two articles (the SF JAG and Klingon Law) have been merged into one (Law in Star Trek) and then the deletion notice removed since it's a "new article under expansion". Some may find this bold and acceptable. Others might find it disingenuous. You claim it will turn into a "fine article".

<dd>I can't comment on what Coolcat did, because I was in no way involved with it. I did merge the articles becuase I am full speed ahead with the rewrite and revamp. And the merge makes entirely good sense. A stub article on Klingon Law has been merged into a much article on Star Trek law. I see nothing wrong with that.

You don't need a newspaper review saying "Luke blew up the Death Star" before you can accept it. OR would be "What was Luke thinking when he fired the torps?", "How fast was his X-Wing going?", or "How big is the Death Star, anyway?"</li>

<li>Husnock, CoolCat, Re: content - I haven't changed my thoughts on a "Law in Star Trek" article. I'm looking forward to seeing what you come up with - but if you find some sources regarding a race's legal system, you should put them in the article <i>for that race</i>. If you find so much information that a new article is justified by size, fine. And I do think Klingon Law has been the subject of so many episodes and movies that it could carry its own article. But you'd be hardpressed to find as much canon information about the other legal systems to justify their own individual articles. And any attempt to compare these legal systems in one article, no matter how well-sourced, would rapidly turn into OR. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 09:26, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In the serries starfleet (entire frenchise), klingon (mostly on TNG and Ent), cardassian (ds9), ferengi (ds9) had been explored. Many minor races' legal systems were also explored such as the Edo. I however deiced not to ever contribute to articles related to fiction. Reason behind this is this very afd and similar others. --<small><a href="../../../c/o/o/User%7ECool_Cat_eb3e.html" title="User:Cool Cat">Cat</a> <a href="../../../c/o/o/User_talk%7ECool_Cat_0d3e.html" title="User talk:Cool Cat">out</a></small> 09:44, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Don't say that! I'm still looking forward to seeing what you guys come up with! My main concern is where it gets added, that's all. Look - the main <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romulan.html" title="Romulan">Romulan</a> article is safe, okay? No-one can say they're an insignifcant race, they've been in the thick of things since the 60s. That means people can say it needs reworking or referencing, but they can't just wipe it out. So, if you find a properly sourced fact on Romulan law, put it there. It will be safe. Find another fact - put it there. Same for the other major races. Eventually, you might find enough to make a new article. But until then, the material you contribute will be safe - <i>it will not be deleted</i>. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 10:08, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Not really. The current article includes, wholesale, the same content, plus some additional content which is either unsourced or sourced in the same way, from original media. That's still the same problem, I'm afraid. If we are to keep this, it has to be cited from canonical sources, not as a distillation of plot synopses but from editorial descriptions of the concepts involved. Ohterwise it is simply not permissible, per <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>. My view is that this belongs on Memory Alpha, where being cited from original media will not be a problem at all. I'd not have a problem with a stub that said simply that the office of the JAG is the military discipline wing of Starfleet and then an external link to an article on MA, but this business of watchign the show and then writing about it directly is simply not on. This is nothing to do with how accurate a summary it is, from my meory of these episodes it's pretty accurate, but we don't <i>do</i> that stuff here. <b><a href="../../../j/z/g/User_talk%7EJzG_e089.html" title="User talk:JzG">Guy</a></b> <small>(<a href="../../../j/z/g/User%7EJzG_help_f724.html" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)</small> 13:34, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>The <i>Star Trek Encyclopedia</i>, or other episode guides, can be used as a reference for the appearance of JAG stuff in those episodes, so there's no strict need to cite the episodes. I agree citing episodes directly is problematic, but in this case, unlike <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starfleet_Security_d296.html" title="Starfleet Security">Starfleet Security</a>, the prose isn't written terribly in-universe, and it doesn't do any speculation or educated guesses about the JAG office, it just lists appearances of JAG officers. So I think what I'm trying to say is that I disagree that this particular case is a particularly novel synthesis, any more than say, listing all the episodes in which there are Klingons, or the Prime Directive, would be&#160;: it can easily be sourced. The part in the merged article about Klingon law, and assertions about the legal system are more problematic.

<li>I agree with above, time to end this and let folks work on the Law in Star Trek article. People should be supportive of this instead of trying to find yet further ways to declare this article unsuitable. Citing direct references to the law and then providing real world legal material that has appeared in Star Trek should be acceptable, IMO. The article can also be expanded to how legal pratices have been affected by material from the show and vice versa. The door is open for more than myself to work on this, also. Other editors can surely join in and make this article into something better. -<a href="../../../h/u/s/User%7EHusnock_2d3d.html" title="User:Husnock">Husnock</a> 14:22, 7 December 2006 (UTC)</li>
