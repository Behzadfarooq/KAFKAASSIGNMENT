<p>I could be wrong and I don't know much about the subject, but isn't this list a little useless? A list of lesbian/bisexual/etc. <b>characters</b> on television could be useful (and I believe we have such a list somewhere here), but a list of <b>actors</b> who played LBG, etc. characters seems incredibly pointless and very much a batch of loosely-connected information, which Wikipedia is not (i.e. one can imagine a similar "List of people who have played politicians, Irish Catholics, Jews, priests, nuns, etc....) . <b>Delete</b> per nom <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 23:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't think it is useless. In fact, I think is good. If I came across this article was just because I was interested on it. As a gay man, I like that this page exists for the fact that we are normally interesed in actor who we have seen on movies on a GLB role. Hope this isn't deleted.--Nauki 00:03, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But then you have Hamlet fans looking for List of people how have played Hamlet, and Einstein fans looking for List of people who have played Einstein, and so on and so forth. I can totally see where you are coming from, as I too tend to be fans of actors that previously had roles that I enjoyed, but I don't think this is the place to store that information. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 01:55, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>weak keep</b>. I'm normally not at all listicrufts, but I do see a diffrnce with this one. Firstly, there do not appear to be any categories for LGB actors/actresses, and as there are some heteros who have played homo roles, this list does seem to have a place.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> After a period of intense thought, I think that there's no reason not to keep this list. As for the nominator's other examples of lists he believes Wikipedia is not the place for (actors who have played politicians, Irish Catholics, etc.), I say again: why not? While this list might only be seldom used, that, in itself, is no reason to delete it. <a href="../../../n/i/g/User%7ENigelquinine_e86b.html" title="User:Nigelquinine"><font color="green"><u><i><b>NigelQuinine</b></i></u></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../n/i/g/User_talk%7ENigelquinine_44ea.html" title="User talk:Nigelquinine"><font color="blue"><b>Blather</b></font></a>• <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Nigelquinine_2ca3.html" title="Special:Contributions/Nigelquinine"><font color="blue"><b>Toil</b></font></a></sup> 02:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Are you saying that "List of actors who have played nuns" is encyclopedic? Really? You could have a million "list of actors who have played X". From policemen to nannies to mothers to celebrities. "Fictional policemen, nannies, nuns, etc." and "Real policemen, nannies, etc." are encyclopedic. Combining the two in this manner really has no value <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 04:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is known as a very GLB-friendly website, a resource for people of GLB. We must keep this fact in mind. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>Not really. Wikipedia is very encyclopedia-friendly, so to speak. There's encyclopedic content and un-encyclopedic content. While, of course, a list of GLB <b>characters</b> would be encyclopedic, and more or less so would a list of GLB <b>actors</b>, a list of actors who have played GLB has almost no value at all. In fact, a list of GLB characters would logically mention who the actor was who played the character, leaving this list with no purpose at all <a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJack_O%27Lantern_eb98.html" title="User:Jack O'Lantern">Mad Jack</a> 04:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree. My point is that the list is arbitrary -- some have been deemed "notable," others not notable, but there's no real distinction between the notable un-listed and the not-notable listed. So, yes, I think the arbitrariness of the list is reason enough to keep all of these, insofar as the justification for deleting them is a lack of notability.</li>

<li><b>Keep, list individually.</b> I wholly agree that many college a cappella groups probably don't merit an article, but this shotgun approach is non-functional.

<dd>The contradiction between the two preceeding keeps is the reason for the group nom. If they were listed individually, people would point to other similar articles not on the chopping block.

<li><b>Keep</b>. As mentioned above, this is too broad a nomination. I may be biased, but the Din and Tonics are fairly major, and have been for years.

<dd>Good Lord, what a shockingly pointless reply. As I clearly should have made obvious, releasing several dozen major albums for one of the largest record companies in the UK (EMI) and completely dominating the choral music scene in terms of output for thirty years or so is what we look for on WP. A good indicator of those things: the choral shelf of your local HMV. A poor choice for someone to put choral groups up en masse for deletion: someone whose never even seen the choral shelf at their local HMV.

<li><b>Keep</b> I can't comment on US College a cappella groups - but the King's Singers are something quite different. A major UK group, the original line-up featured prominently on UK national TV during the 1970s - including having several of their own national TV Shows. From a cultural point they popularised a style of music unfamiliar to many people, demonstrated the appeal of classically trained singers performing popular tunes, and arguably influenced the growth in "popular " classics, now a major part of the music industry. In addition, at least two of the original members are still high profile: Brian Kay is a well-known presenter and personality on BBC Radio 3 and Nigel Perrin a prominent classical choral conductor in the UK.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, unacceptably broad nomination. There may well be some of these groups that aren't sufficiently notable, but the presence of several obviously notable groups in the list, as highlighted by other comments above, suggests that the nominator has simply listed a capella groups en masse rather than considering each individual article in detail. --ⁿɡ͡b <a href="../../../n/g/b/User%7ENgb_4a87.html" title="User:Ngb">Nick Boalch</a><span style="padding: 0 0.1em;">\</span><sup style="font-size: 70%;"><a href="../../../n/g/b/User_talk%7ENgb_2abf.html" title="User talk:Ngb">talk</a></sup> 07:58, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. These groups have albums that have sold more copies than many of the equally small time bands or authors (in terms of books) that are present on Wikipedia. Most of them have history and tradition that is an important part of their campus community, yet merging them into the campus articles would be a disservice to both. And I echo comments above that this looks like a sloppy deletionist event rather than a thought out AfD nom. --<a href="../../../s/p/a/User%7ESparqMan_a449.html" title="User:SparqMan">SparqMan</a> 13:20, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

The group has placed in several rounds of ICCA and group members have won individual awards. - Several alumni later joined a band that is otherwise notable. Alumni Micah Shapiro and Mike Libis were both members of Throwback. Throwback toured extensively in Canada and New England and had a large regional following (I can't think of an absolute indicator of their following, but Throwback does have 12,577 friends on their myspace page). Throwback was also mentioned in a recent McGill News article about McGill alumni bands (which also mentions such notables as Arcade Fire and Leonard Cohen): <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/" class="external free" title="http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mcgill.ca/news/2006/summer/rock/three/</a>.

<li>This is absurd. You're basically saying you want to delete the groups that a) don't compete in competitions or b) aren't good enough to win them. If a group has an official webpage on the school server they are legitimate, not that legitimacy is a requirement for being on Wikipedia. Point out in the deletion policy what infractions the pages made and I'm sure the various authors will be more than willing to change them accordingly.

The closest this article comes to a claim to notability is: "<i>An unconfirmed report suggests that the group's "Finite Simple Group" video appeared on the <a href="../../../g/e/r/German_television.html" title="German television">German television</a> program <a href="../../../n/b/c/NBC_Giga_3c77.html" title="NBC Giga">NBC Giga</a>.</i>" Obviously not sufficient for <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>.

<dd>Argyriou is confusing me. Previously the deletion header asked for opinions in the discussion page! I have copied my comments here</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Eco-cement has had tremendous global publicity (see <a href="http://www.tececo.com/media.php" class="external free" title="http://www.tececo.com/media.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.tececo.com/media.php</a>) ranking it as one of the most important contributions to combat global warming this millenium. If Argyriou (is this some shortening or hyper word for argue?) wrote "I also don't have any reason to believe that cement with magnesia added is important enough to deserve its own article rather than a section of the articles I listed above; though even if that changed, the article shouldn't be named for one proprietary brand of the stuff" is displaying profound ignorance and is therefore not in a position to judge of what should or should not be included.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The name has been given historic and scientific legitimacy by the many articles written about it (type "Eco-Cement" into google to find hundreds not written by the inventor or associates of the inventor).</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Given the enormous level of publicity about eco-cements (over 50k hits a month on the web site and hundreds if not thousands of articles about it - most positive and one or two negative (paid for by the industry - unfortunately the cement industry is behaving a little like the tobacco industry. )</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia should at the very least say what it is so people can make up their own minds about whether it will in fact result in a giant carbon sink in the built environment. The page I have written gives enough information to enable them to do so. The entry is minimalsist and written totally for lay people. To reduce the level of criticism and claimed commerciality I will try and refer to independent articles about the article if I can get to edit it before it is deleted!</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>There are also chapters in at least two major book publications giving reference to the cement and I shall also refer to them in the article. The publishers, who are not small companies, would not have asked me to write about the cement unless they at least were aware of the importance of it.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>On the matter of other uses of the word Eco-Cement. TecEco have the common law right to the name by the shear volume of numbers. Nobody else is using the name which also happens to be unregisterable as a trade mark other than perhaps the irrelvant use for dog poo cement Argyriou rather flippantly referred to. Could I have their contact details so I can let them know that we believe we legitimately own the common law rights to the name.AubreyJohnWestonHarrison 00:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm no expert here, but a quick Google bash reveals many apparently reputable independent sources eg <i>The Guardian</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>. The article could do with a rewrite to put the issue in better context and mention related products, (eg see: <a href="http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/autumn05/ordinary_portland_cement.pdf#search=%22eco-cement%20%22new%20scientist%22%22" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/autumn05/ordinary_portland_cement.pdf#search=%22eco-cement%20%22new%20scientist%22%22" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li>That's the best link I've seen about it so far.

<li><b>Keep</b> I feel that those users that are against keeping this article are missing the point somewhat, whilst it needs to be re-written in order to cite sources, and represent a broader, more neutral point of view (and could be renamed with eco-cement as a redirect), the actual subject matter of the article is worth keeping on wikipedia. I suggest that Argyriou more carefully reads the criteria for notability of products and services as I believe that this product passes under criteron one, The technology has appeared in <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523515.100-green-foundations.html" class="external text" title="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17523515.100-green-foundations.html" rel="nofollow">New Scientist</a>, on ABC (Australia)'s <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/newinventors/txt/s1296184.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.abc.net.au/newinventors/txt/s1296184.htm" rel="nofollow">New Inventors</a> and <a href="http://www.exn.ca/dailyplanet/view.asp?date=4/21/2003" class="external free" title="http://www.exn.ca/dailyplanet/view.asp?date=4/21/2003" rel="nofollow">http://www.exn.ca/dailyplanet/view.asp?date=4/21/2003</a> The Discovery Channel Canada] (Mid page).

TecEco's Eco-Cement, developed by John Harrison, is written about in <i>Transmaterial: A Catalog of Materials That Redefine Our Physical Environment</i> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1568985630/202-0191516-6380600?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;v=glance" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1568985630/202-0191516-6380600?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> (published by Princeton University Press), and also <i>Sustainability at the Cutting Edge</i> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0750656786/202-0191516-6380600?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0750656786/202-0191516-6380600?v=glance&amp;n=266239&amp;s=books&amp;v=glance" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>.

<li><b>Tend towards Delete</b> This is just one of many forms of composite cement based on Portland cement and other constituents. Whilst it is possible that this cement may well lead to a revolution in cement technology, it is currently of far less importance than other composite cements that are used world-wide, for example Portland fly ash cements and Portland blastfurnace cements, that do not have their own articles - and for which there is considerably more peer reviewed scientific literature. Giving this eco-cement its own article gives it far more importance than it is worth, particularly as it is only one specific patented form in the much wider field of magnesium oxide cements.

<p>There appears to be a consensus forming that the article should be kept, but re-written and expanded to include various "environmentally-friendly" cement formulations besides TecEco's formulations. So what should the article be named? "Eco-cement" is claimed as a trademark by Mr. Harrison and <a href="http://www.tececo.com" class="external text" title="http://www.tececo.com" rel="nofollow">TecEco</a>, at least in Australia, and if the article is to cover similar products, some of which are not named "Eco-cement", it would appear that naming the article "Eco-cement" is not appropriate.</p>
<p>"Environmentally-friendly cement" is POV, and I don't think anyone is claiming fully "sustainable" (in the environmentalist sense) cement, so "sustainable cement" isn't very good, either. "Low-environmental-impact cement" seems accurate, NPOV, broad enough, and shouldn't run into trademark problems, but it also seems clumsy as a title. Any suggestions? <b><a href="../../../a/r/g/User%7EArgyriou_d8d1.html" title="User:Argyriou">Argyriou</a> 21:12, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Agree most formulations are clumsy. I'd personally be OK with 'eco-friendly cement' or 'ecologically friendly cement' or 'environmentally friendly cement', if the article contextualised the title, but I do take your point there's an element of POV there. Anything encompassing the lower CO2 emissions cf Portland cement would seem to be NPOV. Wrt your suggestion, I think 'low' should perhaps be 'lower' or 'reduced', as they're not objectively low, merely lower than the default material. <a href="../../../e/s/p/User%7EEspresso_Addict_7f98.html" title="User:Espresso Addict">Espresso Addict</a> 00:11, 26 August 2006 (UTC</li>

<li>As John states, (he did forget to sign his name) I think a list of environmentally friendly cements, linking from the main cement page may be a good idea. Merging all these things in to one article is not the best approach as the information presented on all of these technologies could be expanded upon significantly.

<p>Eco-Cement is eco-cement and yes it is a brand name TecEco has used since inception covering a blend of reactive magnesia and another hydraulic cement such as Portland cement and usually a pozzolan.</p>
<p>The point is that Wikipedia exists to provide information about what is important, brand name or not so please stop running this diversionary arguement about it being a brand name and therefore it should be deleted.</p>

<p>The capitals arguement is also irrelevant. TecEco own the brand name in upper and lower case through common law usage (hundreds if not thousands of articles including many important sources as cited) We don't really mind which Wiki contributors use as long as you stick to recording fact not making up fiction.</p>

<p>This would really be writing history. Who is it that thinks they have the right?</p>
<p>Several have incorrectly referred to other users of the name as being a reason to make it generic. This would be rewriting fact and not the purpose of an encyclopedia. Closer scrutiny is required. What is happening is that many are trying to rip off the publicity associated with the eco-cement technology, environmentally friendly reputation and product. The dog shit cement referred to by Argyriou is irrelevant and he seems unable to support it with references. My research indicates it is an yet another example of an unimportant rip-off or our name that post dates our common law right. The reference to Lin, K.L.; Chiang, K.Y.; Lin, C.Y. (June 2005). "Hydration characteristics of waste sludge ash that is reused in eco-cement clinkers". Cement and Concrete Research 35 (6): 1074–1081 also falls into the category of a minor post dated rip off of the name. Taiheiyo released ecocement (all one word) around 2002 (thus post dating our contribution to science and the effort to stop global warming). It is a more disguised post dated rip off of our name some years after we started using the name eco-cement. In this respect Bláthnaid 12:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC) did inadequate research. I repeat, the Japanese product is called ecocement (all one word) not eco-cement. Taiheiyo will probably get away with it legally and we have no plans to challenge them (they are bigger than us!!).</p>
<p>It is discouraging that so many Wikipedians seem to want to have a hand in rewriting fact or history, not in putting together a world class assemblage of actual fact! Wikipedia exists to record only so those who suggest the page be generalised need to be aware that eco-cement or Eco-Cement is a blend of reactive magnesia and another hydraulic cement such as Portland cement and usually a pozzolan. It is not something or anything else. It is important and should be referenced and the arguement about brand names is a red herring.</p>
<p>I agree however that Wikipedia would be diminished if it became an advertising bill board so edit it down if you like but do not change the name as doing so would be reinventing both history and sience.</p>

<p>One or two people have made the comment that the name eco-cement should not be there as it is a brand name.</p>
<p>The precursor to modern day cement was invented by Smeaton in 1759. It was Joseph Aspidin that gave his particular and superior formulation the name "Portland cement". The most used material on the planet next to water was originally a brand name. Who still thinks it should be deleted?</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> but only for now. There are articles on individual Big Brother seasons, of course, but my feeling is it's a bit premature. Make sure it's mentioned at the main BB article, and when the show actually goes forward (as in there's information beyond speculation to print) then by all means recreate it. An exception would be if for some reason the new season becomes somehow noteworthy before broadcast (such as the controversy that has erupted regarding the yet-to-be-broadcast new edition of US Survivor.) <a href="../../../2/3/s/User%7E23skidoo.html" title="User:23skidoo">23skidoo</a> 22:27, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> This article relates to a small hockey league in a small Canadian town, organized by a few dedicated volunteers. It was organized to allow underprivileged youth from the surrounding area to participate in hockey for free. It is important to the community and we thought it would be fun for the kids to be able to read about themselves online. It completely arrogant to suggest this isn't important; it has made a big difference in the lives of several kids. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Cameronbuttz (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cameronbuttz_dad1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cameronbuttz">contribs</a>).</small>(user's only edit)
<ul>
<li>If you want the kids to be able to read about themselves online, why not make a page on MySpace or even eteamz.com? This, however, is a general reference encyclopedia, and the criterion for including articles is not, unfortunately, whether they make someone happy or whether they make a difference to "several kids".

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> SGHA does not fail <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> as news of the league has been reported on quite frequently in several local newspapers as a venue where the premier roller hockey players in the region gather to compete. There has also been a long standing, and very significant SGHA webpage, which until recently was the source for all SGHA-related information. Many of the techniques and strategies formulated within the SGHA league hierarchy have been implemented in professional rollerhockey associations across Southern Ontario, most notably the Greater Toronto Inline Hockey League. The SGHA is widely known, with hubs of interest pocketed across the country, and in many cases across the continent. Locations as varied as Portland, Calgary, Toronto, and New York City have all had their own unique and significant experiences with the organization.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> The SGHA is a well known developmental/summer league in the Greater Toronto Area. Those who have chosen to delete it are extremely unfamiliar with it and thus are therefore threatened by it's reality. Many professional players play in this league during their off-season.

<li><b>Comment</b>: The AfD process is designed to allow for improvement of the article within the five day course of listing. I feel that enough good faith has been given to Zinco100 (and any of the other supporters of the article, for that matter), despite the personal attacks, generalizations, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> violation in nominating another article for deletion. I have seen no desire by the supporters to improve the article to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> as explained herein, despite repeated requests to do so, and thus there is no need to break process in this instance. --<font face="Book Antiqua"><a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKinu_5ebb.html" title="User:Kinu"><font color="blue"><strong>Kinu</strong></font></a> <sup><a href="../../../k/i/n/User_talk%7EKinu_5933.html" title="User talk:Kinu"><font color="red"><i>t</i></font></a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Kinu_ac66.html" title="Special:Contributions/Kinu"><font color="red"><i>c</i></font></a></sub></font> 13:48, 17 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Note</b> Draicone, I'm sorry to burst your bubble but there is no hierarchy of authority in regards to deleting pages based on Wikipedia experience. It doesn't matter if a user is newly registered or been on here since the beginning. We are all equal. I refuse to be bullied. (Zinco100 16:07, 17 August 2006 (UTC))</li>
<li><b>Response</b> Zinco100, I'm not saying that there is a hierarchy of authority for AfD. However, new users are not always familiar with policy, such as the four listed above by Whpq which clearly apply in this situation. In addition, I am not attempting to bully you. However, if you feel this way, then <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> no longer applies and the standard policies that Whpq listed above state that this article should be deleted, end of story. Failing notability generally is not an issue, but verifiability, vanity and original research don't give very much reason to keep the article. If you feel it deserves a place on the web, I suggest you put it on <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikia.html" title="Wikia">Wikia</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDraicone_e5d6.html" title="User:Draicone"><b>Draicone</b></a> <a href="../../../d/r/a/User_talk%7EDraicone_3170.html" title="User talk:Draicone"><sup><span style="color: #FF9933;">(talk)</span></sup></a> 07:47, 18 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> I guess it needs to be said...While I can respect the feelings that some of these anons have completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or suggesting the organization isn't important to the children. <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b> Let me help out a bit so the people new to wikipedia understand. The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims of the author(s). It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article fails to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, some sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, does not follow the guideline of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> An article on this org must cite multiple, reliable, secondary, independent of the organization, non-trivial, third-party sources such as books, magazines, and papers that have national and/or international coverage. The articles must be based, or completely focused on just this org. Just a mention in passing is not acceptable (as it is concidered a trivial source...even if it is in the New York Times...the source isn't trivial, but the coverage by the source was. So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b> is one of Wikipedia's three content-guiding policies. The other two are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> (as explained above). Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>The principles upon which these three policies are based are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus.</b> In essence, please explain why this article should be allowed to not follow WP:V when all other articles must.

<li>Wikipedia is not a game guide. <b>Edit:</b> I just want to add right up front for the closing admin to make sure there is no confusion that this article is merely a list of every ability the various pokemon have in the various pokemon games, what these abilities do, and which pokemon have them. Therefore the sole purpose of the article is to be an in-depth guide to a facet of a video game. Here is a quote from <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, <b>video game guides</b>, and recipes." (Emphasis added) To quote <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_Policy_a230.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion Policy">Wikipedia:Deletion Policy</a>: "[I]t's worth noting that (as with all Wikipedia consensus decisions), the purpose of a discussion is to bring out a "sense of the community" and the valid points for or against each view. So deletion is not a strict "count of votes", but rather a <b>judgement based upon experience and taking into account the policy-related points made by those contributing</b> (emphasis added). The policy arguement for deletion is that it is a violation of the WP:NOT point quoted above. The keep votes are based mostly on an desire by pokemon fans to keep an article they have worked on and find useful, but no arguement has been made relating to policy, nor has the proposition that the article violates WP:NOT been refuted. Just some food for thought. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:39, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Whoa, hold it!</b> Wouldn't it be more appropriate to discuss this on the article's talk page instead of instantly nominating it for deletion? I'm not for deleting the article, but I also see how it doesn't qualify for the Best Article award. Maybe it could use more expository text and have more of an overview of what a Pokémon ability is instead of being merely a huge list. Several people put a lot of work into this article (there's a lot of Pokémon to list and link); it'd be a shame to lose it so fast. --<a href="../../../b/r/a/User%7EBrandon_Dilbeck_91d8.html" title="User:Brandon Dilbeck">Brandon Dilbeck</a> 01:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It is none of my concern whether a lot of people have worked on this article or not. Please read <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, paying particular attention to the part about wikipedia not being a game guide. This article violates policy, and I see no way this article could be changed to not violate policy. AfD is the proper venue for this discussion. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 01:53, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I say <b>Keep</b> because this article is relatively new and could be fixed to have more generic information in it, rather than being a big list of data.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Though there are other wikis where concerned Pokemaniacs can harvest info, a small article is ok.<a href="../../../b/a/k/User%7EBakasuprman_bbab.html" title="User:Bakasuprman">Bakaman</a> <font color="blue"><sub><a href="../../../b/a/k/User_talk%7EBakasuprman_b63a.html" title="User talk:Bakasuprman">Bakatalk</a></sub></font> 01:58, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Actually, no it is not because it violates policy.

<li><b>Comment</b> Hold up! Where does it cite sources? Why should this article be allowed to ignore <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a>, and <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> when all other articles must follow them? While I can respect the feelings that some of the other editors have completely, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or suggesting that pokemon isn't important to children or such. <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b> Let me help out a bit so the people new to wikipedia understand. The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there have to be sources to back up the claims of the author(s) and all information provided in the article. It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's information</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article fails to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> (if not all of OR), does not follow the guideline of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> This article <b>must</b> cite <i>multiple, reliable, secondary, independent of the organization, non-trivial, third-party sources such as books, magazines, and papers that have national and/or international coverage.</i> The articles must be based, or completely focused on just pokemon (and in this case, the powers). Just a mention in passing is not acceptable (as it is concidered a trivial source...even if it is in the New York Times...the source isn't trivial, but the coverage by the source was). So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. <b><a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a></b> is one of Wikipedia's three content-guiding policies. The other two are <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">Wikipedia:Neutral point of view</a> (as explained above). Jointly, these policies determine the type and quality of material that is acceptable in the main namespace. They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore try to familiarize themselves with all three. <b>The principles upon which these three policies are based are non-negotiable and cannot be superseded by other policies or guidelines, or by editors' consensus.</b> In essence, please explain why this article should be allowed to not follow WP:V when all other articles must. While we know that pokemon is Verifiable, where are the New York Times, Washington Post, or CBS nightly news report on the pokemon abilities? I hope this helps understand my take on this discussion. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 07:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b> There are ungoing debates over the use of wikilinks as references. Whilst featuring the references themselves is generally better, if a direct wikilink has the reference this also tends to count.

<li><b>Weak keep</b>.

<li>How do you cite a video game? I'm just ignorant--I'd do it if I knew how.

<li>My research wasn't original; this information can be found in many places on the Internet and it's been published in many playing guides and even in the game itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> As one of the main contributors to this page(fixing links, adding secondary effects), I believe this article should stay. As mentioned before it is a central concept of the games, and as a central concept I believe there should be a page describing and listing all of the abilities. The article does need a bit cleaning up, but other than that there is no reason for deletion. <a href="../../../0/-/1/User%7E0-172.html" title="User:0-172">0-172</a> 16:39, 24 August (UTC)

<li>A page listing and describing all the abilities is a game guide in violation of policy. Cleaning it up will not save it. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 17:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I'm all for having an article that explains what Pokémon abilities are, which assumes no prior experience of Pokémon, and generally describes some of the various types of abilities. But a listing of each specific ability and which Pokémon creatures have that is utter gamecruft, and should be removed. <a href="../../../j/i/p/User%7EJIP_0758.html" title="User:JIP"><font color="#CC0000">J</font><font color="#00CC00">I</font><font color="#0000CC">P</font></a> | <a href="../../../j/i/p/User_talk%7EJIP_c5bf.html" title="User talk:JIP">Talk</a> 18:33, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>However surely the article you propose, stripped of descriptions of all but a handful of abilities and without additional information is of less intrinsic value than the current article? It would, however, be more immediately accessable - but this is easily fixable in the current article. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 19:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>comment</b>. I don't understand the jump between an article being <i>about a game</i> and being a <i>game guide</i>. To my mind, a game guide gives you hints and suggestions about strategies, etc. Documenting facts about a game need not constitute a guide. Also, for articles about fictional works, the work itself often serves as a perfectly good primary source. <span style="font-size: 10px">—&#160;<a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrighterorange_f618.html" title="User:Brighterorange"><span style="padding : 0px 1px 1px 1px; border : 1px solid #FFE7B0; background: #FFFFFF ; color: #FF9600">brighterorange</span></a> (<a href="../../../b/r/i/User_talk%7EBrighterorange_9de6.html" title="User talk:Brighterorange">talk</a>)</span> 04:40, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>I agree that this can be a difficult area to define. To me, it usually comes down to focus. Obviously, an article must give a general overview of how a game works in order to convey the subject properly. However, when an article begins to go into every facet of a game, or a part of a game, then it is starting to cross the line. By analogy, a plot summary is necessary to explaining a novel, but a chapter by chapter summary goes beyond explaining what the book is about and becomes a substitute for the novel itself. As for pokemon, describing the role abilities play in the game and giving one or two examples helps inform on the game. Something this comprehensive can only be useful to one attempting to formulate game strategy even if the article does not give specific strategies itself. In other words, only one playing the game requires this level of deatil. That, to me, is what makes it a game guide. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:51, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I disagree and would put the Catagories into a Deletion review, personally. There is no reason for catagories on 'growth' or 'lightning' just to catagorize the characters. The articles on the characters are enough. There is no need to catagorize them or even have a 'list' like this. Remove the list, leave the top paragraph but reference the hell out of it. Why do we need a list when it is easy enough for people to look directly at each characters' page and/or get a free game guide/FAQ online? The only people who would be interested in knowing this information are the people who play the games...hence it is a game guide. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 16:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>ummmm, that is exactly what an instruction manual does, explains how something works. This is a guide on how to play the game and on how various facets of the game work.

<li>An instruction manual explains <i>how to do</i> something, that's what "instruction" means. An encylopedia's duty is exactly to explain how various facets of the game work. <a href="../../../k/a/p/User%7EKappa_91fc.html" title="User:Kappa">Kappa</a> 03:51, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Have you ever read an instruction manual for a computer game? They usually include both information on how to play the game as well as information on what various things do so that the player knows how best to use them. Anyway, why don't I just quote <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>: "Instruction manuals - while Wikipedia has descriptions of people, places, and things, Wikipedia articles should not include instruction - advice (legal, medical, or otherwise), suggestions, or contain "how-to"s. This includes tutorials, walk-throughs, instruction manuals, video game guides, and recipes. Note that this does not apply to the Wikipedia: namespace, where "how-to"s relevant to editing Wikipedia itself are appropriate, such as Wikipedia:How to draw a diagram with Dia. If you're interested in a how-to style manual, you may want to look at Wikihow or our sister project Wikibooks." I have often been at odds with you on AfD, but this is the first time I have seen you blatantly disregard an official policy. <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 04:02, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>: this is Wikipedia, not GameFaqs. I doubt Wikibooks would accept this either, so transwikifying is not an option.

<li><b>Keep</b> Um...I'm the person that wrote this article, as well as much of <a href="../../../d/a/w/Empires%7E_Dawn_of_the_Modern_World_2703.html" title="Empires: Dawn of the Modern World">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a>, and I wasn't aware that I was breaking policy with this. I thought it added understanding to the game article if someone wants to look further into the game or how it's played. I know it looks like I suck at writing, but I haven't had time to edit this and Empires: Dawn of the Modern World simultaneously. I did most of this myself, but I could see about minimizing it or wikifying it if you guys don't like it. If you look at the main article I was able to summarize the gameplay with the knowledge in mind that if someone wanted to look up more into the gameplay they could so. <a href="../../../g/o/o/Wikipedia%7EGood_article_candidates_d0d2.html" title="Wikipedia:Good article candidates">Empires: Dawn of the Modern World</a> is up for GA nomination right now, and I'm just worried it will be failed because the gameplay article was suddenly wiped from the face of the Earth, which would make the Gameplay section look rather pathetic. I'm also rather sad that Indrian decided to go after this one article. I thought I was doing a good thing by making this only one article. I noticed that articles like Runescape have 16 articles that could be considered exactly the same thing as I'm writing, so would it be better for me to split this into a few more articles and you guys can decide which sections should be up for deletion? I'm really up for any solution other than deleting, and I'm hoping that can be done.--<a href="../../../c/l/y/User%7EClyde_Miller_83b6.html" title="User:Clyde Miller">Clyde Miller</a> 21:10, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The problem with a lot of video game articles like this one (as well as articles about TV series and books) is that they seem to cater to people who are familiar with the topic...<i>extremely</i> familiar with the topic. Maybe if articles like this one could be written more for people who have never played the game (or never played video games <i>at all</i>, *gasp*) they would fit in with the other articles a bit more easily. As it stands, I can't really make a decision about this article because it doesn't relate much of anything to real life<sup>TM</sup>. If the article is kept or userfied, a severe amount of <b>wikification</b> and <b>general cleanup in tone and spelling</b> is needed. But it may have a shot. <a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_fe3b.html" title="User:Ikiroid">The ikiroid</a> (<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_4fb8.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid">talk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User%7EIkiroid_Desk_5611.html" title="User:Ikiroid/Desk">desk</a>·<a href="../../../i/k/i/User_talk%7EIkiroid_Help_Me_Improve_8caf.html" title="User talk:Ikiroid/Help Me Improve">Advise me</a>) 01:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I cannot understand why someone would want to delete this long and informative article. Some people don't understand this game and think games of this sort have no importance.

<li>A game isn't important, noteworthy, relevant or has encyclopedic value just because someone claims it has in the middle of a pile of baseless accusations and personal attacks.

<li>In your vote, you stated that the people voting delete do not understand the game or its importance. However, the reason given for deletion is that the article violates policy by being a game guide and no one here has advocated that the article about the game itself be deleted. Therefore, your comment is a straw man because it attacks an issue that you made up rather than one in controversy, and it is an attack because you call people ignorant rather than attacking the policy arguement. Anything still unclear? <a href="../../../i/n/d/User%7EIndrian_d72c.html" title="User:Indrian">Indrian</a> 21:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>It may have been a straw man (that depends on whether you think there was some "real issue" that I was ducking in my post), but was no attack. What I wrote: "Some people don't understand this game and think games of this sort have no importance." What you say I wrote: <i>people voting delete</i> do not understand the game or its importance. Those are two different statements. If I wrote, "people voting delete" have no idea about the importnace of the game, that might be a personal attack. But I was making a more general point that the article deals with a subject about which some (most?) people know or care very little but yet that should not preclude it from being on wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi</li>

<li>His video can be seen on <i>multiple</i> independent sites.

<li><b>Comment</b> Cindy, I need to point out this to you: Popularity on YouTube means nothing for notablility here at Wikipedia. The video could have 3 views or 3 billion...it doesn't matter. YouTube does not count as a 'source'. The only sources that are accepted are the media articles (magazines, books, newspaper articles, and tv reports). I just wanted to make that clear. I have seen 9 (nine) videos from YouTube (which all appeared on the most watched of all time list) removed because they did not have any reliable sources (YouTube and blogs don't count). --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 04:41, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>, but clean up - he's notable, the fact the YouTube website says he's had 31 million views should surely be enough to keep him. However, the page does need cleaning up.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- And why is it that we seem to have go through this process for each and every person from Youtube? Can't we agree that after 4-6 keep votes on other Youtube folk that we can just agree to keep them until proven otherwise? I know we don't want articles about anybody and everybody. But we have people attacking the most famous Youtube people over and over. I think we should pick some criteria to use for this... be it number of video views, number of videos, google hits, or some combination of these and other things. But going through this whole process each and everytime is getting to be incredibly time consuming and dare I say <b>stupid</b>. I'm also getting more and more PO'ed at folks who ask for citations from various media sources, which they are then given. They then act like they were never told of them and say there are none over and over, as if "The big lie" is part of their AfD strategy. It may work in real-world politics folks, but I'm getting sick and tried it on Wiki. Dave 06:26, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Start of the article claims it's a business, however the rest of the article is an advertisement or history of an MMORPG guild.

<p><b>Keep</b> It was not my intent to portray it as a business but to throw a fun fact out. The article is a historical portrayal of the character Macorden and the role he has played in several games in the past and games upcoming. It can fall under WP:BIO and WP:FICT. I have had used the name Macorden in all games and if anyone wants to look up the history they should be allowed to. If Fatal1ty has a wiki, I should be allowed to host a history for Macorden. Further, the article leave out many aspects of the Eclipse guild and only mentions the parts I have been involved in. The article is worthy of a wikipage. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Macorden (<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacorden_eda5.html" title="User talk:Macorden">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Macorden_40f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Macorden">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<li>An article is only unverifiable if it cites no sources and <i>your best efforts to find some sources come up with nothing</i>.

<li><b>Comment</b>: "If I could verify it I would have". Sigh. Since DrunkenSmurf recognises that he's being a bit unpleasant, I will try not to knock him too hard for it. However, I do wish people in deletion debates would sometimes recognise that <a href="../../../b/i/a/WP%7EBIAS_a5af.html" title="WP:BIAS">WP:BIAS</a> exists.
<p>In particular, when an article states that person X is notable for having written book Y, the simple thing to do to establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> is to check that Y exists and is notable. In this case, the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hs=n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22%E2%80%98AWN-AL-MA%E2%80%98BUD%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hs=n&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=%22%E2%80%98AWN-AL-MA%E2%80%98BUD%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">[13]</a> search for an idiosyncratic spelling of the second book mentioned in the article returns 475 English ghits. I would at least quadruple that, given that the rendition of Arabic into Latin characters is non-standard across the Middle East and South Asia. I further wonder how many ghits exist for this same book - one of three referenced in the article - in Arabic, Persian, Urdu, and Hindi. Further, a cursory glance at some of the ghits would reveal to the uninformed, which DrunkenSmurf is in this case, that the article subjects' name can be spelled several different ways in English as well - "Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-'Adhim Abadi" for one among dozens of permutations.</p>
<p>The moral? Its a good idea for everyone to recognise the limits of their specific knowledge and comparative ability to research certain subjects before thundering into deletion debates; would make the rest of us a lot happier. <a href="../../../h/o/r/User%7EHornplease_3cdc.html" title="User:Hornplease">Hornplease</a> 06:46, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Thank you</b>: Perhaps then you can add a couple references to the article and help make this a complete verified biography of the individual.

<li><b>Merge and Delete</b> Looks to me that there is only about a line or so of important information that should be easy to merge.

<li>If so, we could never delete a redirect with history. The information remains in the database, because the article can be undeleted.

<li>If you read the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html" class="external text" title="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html" rel="nofollow">GFDL</a>, the closest tha article deletion would come to violating it is clause 4J, preserving the network location. However no clause exists in GFDL which covers the ceastation of distrobution, which is the nature of deletion.

<li>Certainly it is possible that I am overemphasizing the commercial aspect of the site; I am not intimately familiar with it as I'm guessing you are, and the t-shirts may be a mere afterthought.

<ul>
<li>It's extremely possible you are overemphasizing the commercial aspect of the site. They only sell two t-shirts. If selling a t-shirt is means of deletion on wikipedia why not the Something Awful entry as their website contains a full store selling tons of Something Awful items? They also have a forum which you must pay to become a memeber of. I don't understand why that entry is ok, but this one should be up for deletion because of two t-shirts and a button. I'm not hating on Something Awful but just pointing out that if the Sykospark entry should be deleted because you think it's about making money, why other entries that do the same but on a much grander scale aren't even mentioned. --Rev.Phill</li>

<p>No original research. Unverifiable and not well-defined. There is no apparently no widely accept meaning of "Gainax Ending" other than an ending that doesn't satisfy the viewers. This is objective and not worth a wikipedia entry. The concept doesn't exist outside a select few anime circles, and is not even well-known in the anime world itself. No verifiable use of this term outside wikipedia, or other "answer" sources which borrow from wikipedia has been shown. There is no published record of this term. Mgio 05:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Very strong keep</b>: the article is very incomplete, obviously, but Skeleton is an Olympic sport, and Florian Grassl was second in the 2004 world championships (he didn't compete at the Olympics due to an injury). This page<a href="http://www.skeletonsport.com/athletes/?ContactID=874" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.skeletonsport.com/athletes/?ContactID=874" rel="nofollow">[17]</a> gives his results, which are more than worthy of inclusion here. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 09:45, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> The length of an article should not be a reason for deletion.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Article length should not be a reason for deletion, but an article so spare that there is no indication of notability certainly invites deletion. A skeleton racer is not notable when given no more than that. I'd argue that nothing short of the world championship level establishes notability. Grassl qualifies as notable under that measure, though. That's why I withdraw this AfD. <a href="../../../e/r/e/User%7EErechtheus_2543.html" title="User:Erechtheus">Erechtheus</a> 18:09, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - He was 20th a year ago? That's notable? And I doubt many people are going to know what "DNS" is supposed to mean. Again the claim to notability is pretty slight even with this minor expansion. <a href="../../../w/j/h/User%7EWjhonson_d987.html" title="User:Wjhonson">Wjhonson</a> 18:15, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b>: Yes, the article should be heavily expanded, but no, what's now in the article is not what makes him notable, what I gave in my link (see the very strong keep vote above, I don't use that lightly) is: the man finished second in the world championships of an Olympic sport. If that is no reason for inclusion, then what is? The fact that he couldn't compete at the Olympics was important enough for Germans that it got articles at Eurosport<a href="http://www.eurosport.de/rennrodeln/sport_sto809498.shtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.eurosport.de/rennrodeln/sport_sto809498.shtml" rel="nofollow">[18]</a> e.a., his German title (yes, he is champion of Germany as well) got an article at ARD (the German BBC)<a href="http://sport.ard.de/sp/wintersport/news200401/10/skeleton.jhtml" class="external autonumber" title="http://sport.ard.de/sp/wintersport/news200401/10/skeleton.jhtml" rel="nofollow">[19]</a>. When in doubt, try to find sources. The absence of them does not necessarily prove lack of notability, but when you get enough (and serious) sources, like in this case, then notability is firmly established. I'm all for deleting non notable article subjects, but this is not one of them. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 19:04, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Um, what? I simply followed the proper procedure for nominating an article for deletion. First you put {{prod}} on it. If someone disagrees, you put {{afd}} on it so that a proper debate can occur. I was unaware that there is a {{move to wiktionary}} template. It's nothing personal and has absolutely nothing to do with civility or assuming good faith. If you think I was uncivil, please bring it up on my talk page and I'll be happy to discuss the matter. — <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianSmithson_ad3a.html" title="User:BrianSmithson">BrianSmithson</a> 22:54, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> This particular articles has existed since October 2005. It has been cleaned up, and has grown. I did a google search on the word “encyclopedia” and came up with the following:

<dd>A reference source containing information on a variety of topics.

<li>I object to what I see as the tagging of short articles because of "importance," not every article in wikipedia needs to be a treatise.

<ul>
<li>The time the article was able to stay under the radar of wikipedians is irrelevant when talking about merit and encyclopedic value. As it has been stated, it is only a dictionary entry. Not everything has merit or value to be mentioned in an encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 17:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

This kind of work is what wikipedia is all about.

People desperately wanted to reflect some of the views other cultures hold of the French military, because it seems that's what first comes to mind for many American and British Wikipedians when it comes to France's military. I propose a <b>merger</b> to another related article (like <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francophobia.html" title="Francophobia">Francophobia</a>), and the material can be converted into a section of that article. --<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerimosocordiae_f337.html" title="User:Perimosocordiae">Perimosocordiae</a> 22:01, 19 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Therefore it is obvious that a second article, which the original author claims that was copied from a textbook, isn't justified. Moreover, Wikipedia isn't a howto manual. There are other wiki projects which are better suited for this kind of information --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 17:17, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I don't think <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplex_algorithm.html" title="Simplex algorithm">simplex algorithm</a> explains the details of the algorithm well. It only gives an overview of the algorithm, and I think that somebody who hasn't seen it before will find it impossible to follow the explanation. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 01:49, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>So why not expand and improve the already existing article? And if the reader really wants a HowTo document, why not consult other wiki-projects like wikibooks? As I see it, two separate articles is overkill for such a simple thing, specially if one of them is a HowTo manual (which doesn't belong in wikipedia) copied from a book. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 11:30, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> per Charles Matthews. Algorithms are frequently difficult to understand; this seems appropriate. Could use a better title, though. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinas_c62b.html" title="User:Linas">linas</a> 23:44, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Maybe the article was greatly improved after the nomination? At any event, I don't see the problem. The simplex algorithm is <i>without doubt one of the most important algorithms in all of applied mathematics</i>, and has had a tremendous influence on the development of math/sci/engineering since it was introduced. It is <i>completely appropriate</i> to offer a clear step by step discussion. Please note that <i>every</i> undergraduate textbook on numerical methods which I have seen (and I have looked at dozens) contains a similar discussion. To name one of the most elementary such books: <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Kemeny_c3ac.html" title="John Kemeny">Kemeny</a> et al., <i>Finite Mathematical Structures</i>, Prentice-Hall, 1959 (a fine book which unfortunately seems to be hard to obtain these days). (I could give more authoritative citations testifying to the outstanding importance of this algorithm, even specifically to the algorithm itself, but I trust that one will suffice.)---<a href="../../../h/i/l/User%7EHillman_ce0e.html" title="User:Hillman">CH</a> 18:31, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> into <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplex_algorithm.html" title="Simplex algorithm">simplex algorithm</a>. I don't see the point of having an example of using the simplex algorithm anywhere other than the <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplex_algorithm.html" title="Simplex algorithm">simplex algorithm</a> article. -- <a href="../../../m/e/n/User%7EMeni_Rosenfeld_0f50.html" title="User:Meni Rosenfeld">Meni Rosenfeld</a> (<a href="../../../m/e/n/User_talk%7EMeni_Rosenfeld_b8a1.html" title="User talk:Meni Rosenfeld">talk</a>) 19:43, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>transwiki</b> per ColourBurst. This is an encyclopedia, not a textbook. Nevertheless, the existence of this implies that <a href="../../../s/i/m/Simplex_algorithm.html" title="Simplex algorithm">simplex algorithm</a> could probably use an example, with explicitly subscripted coordinates. <a href="../../../p/m/a/User%7EPmanderson_cb9f.html" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> 20:42, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I agree. Usually the textbooks on <a href="../../../o/p/e/Operations_research.html" title="Operations research">operations research</a> approach the simplex algorithm twice. First the book explains the hands-on approach to the algorithm (to what the AfD serves as a howto) and then the book presents the algebraic approach (what is written in the article). I believe that the article would indeed benefit from having both approaches listed, which merits a merge. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> | <a href="../../../m/e/c/User_talk%7EMecanismo_b2ea.html" title="User talk:Mecanismo">Talk</a> 23:30, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I just wanted to state for the record that this article was nominated for deletion while I was working on it and compiling information. As you can see in the history log the nomination was activated 18 min after the article was created (I guess it was spotted after like 10 min). That's little unfair. Giving me (or anyone else for that matter) no chance to even develop the article. But thanks to the initial action from Uncle G, but foremost, Yomangani for his amazing editing skills, 4 days later this article looks superb!

<li><b>Keep</b>. This "lower league, part-time" football club is the same one that reached the semi-finals of the Scottish F.A. Cup less than five seasons ago, right? The same one that are currently in only the <i>third</i> flight of Scottish national football?

<dd><b>Comment</b> No, as the article states, they reached the quarter-finals where they were beaten 6-0 by Rangers. The third flight of Scottish football is of an extremely low standard, probably the equivalent to district or junior leagues in England. The only reason he has a BBC Sport article is because he moved away from Celtic, given that he did not play for Celtic's first team, he does not warrent an article on Wiki, in my opinion. <a href="../../../f/o/r/User%7EForbsey_d5ce.html" title="User:Forbsey">Forbsey</a> 06:40, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Whoah, slow down</b> before we do a kneejerk 'it's a church -delete' ('ditto' etc.), let's do some thinking. Probably individual religious congregations are not <i>per se</i> notable (although since we keep even the smallest school, that's perhaps a little strange). However, the nominator here doesn't seem to have read the article: 'makes no claim to notability' - actually it does. 1) 'Megachurch' suggests <i>very</i> large - let's investigates that. (I've found one claim it's the 3rd largest AOG chuch in (Australia/the world) - but the source isn't good) . 2) Employs 50 staff - <i>if</i> that's verifiable then it <i>certainly would</i> be notable - given that most local churches employ 1-2, it would be larger than a small denomination. The nomination is frankly erronious.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 18:47, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Well, I could be wrong. However, the article currently states that the church is "large" and gives a "see also" reference to <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a> (as opposed to stating that this church <i>is</i> a megachurch), but doesn't indicate how large the congregation is. By contrast, the article on <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a> (an undisputed megachurch) says they have 17,000 to 20,000 people in attendance each week. However, having 50 people on staff would indeed be consistent with Garden City Christian Church being a very large church. I will reconsider the nomination if the article is improved during the AfD period. --<a href="../../../m/e/t/User%7EMetropolitan90_bac2.html" title="User:Metropolitan90">Metropolitan90</a> 19:48, 24 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are wrong. And since the article asserts (and did when you nominated it) that it has 50 staff and runs a college, you nomination seems to indicate you didn't read the article. If the assertions arn't verified then you should have marked if for verification, or tried to verify it yourself - no nominated it for 'no asserion of notability' when it has one. See my further evidence below - which I found with a gentle google. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 20:03, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The church I go to used to have a "College of Life" every spring: essentially, a series of evening Sunday-school classes taught by the pastor or by volunteers from the congregation.

<dd><i>I'm not sure why we need articles on churches because they do churchy things like missions, teaching, etc. Obviously this is a very large and active church, but the article doesn't actually say much about it, and that's a problem. Having a large library and a ministry to the deaf is just the normal course of business for churches. But I'm not overly fussed if we keep it, so I'm changing my vote to neutral.

<li>The comment is invalid anyway - we don't delete things because their claims have not been verif<b>ied</b> (although they have here) we delete things because, after much research, they are found unverifi<b>able.</b> At any rate, we've shown this place has an accredited college with 7 staff and an on-line catalogued library - that is extremely rare, if not unique amoungst churches. We've shown a good number of other staff, pastors, and 'department heads' (alhough the '50' claim may not be verifiable - and should probably be removed). I have to say, given that there is a string of keep votes for even the smallest little school, the tone of this debate, the extremely high thresholds being set, the disingenuous claim of 'no assertion of notability' (that missed the claims to a college and 50 staff), the demands that everything be verified now (without the voter trying themselves), leads me to suspect some element of bias is at play. I suspect that any other voluntary sector body claiming as many employees and activities wouldn't even have been debates. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 15:11, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I accused no single editor of anything. No doubt there are some voting for deletion that would vote for the deletion of any school or other organisation of a simmilar size - that's fine. What is not fine is applying standads here that are not applied elsewhere. The need for verification is not usually a deletion criterion - the inability to verify is. But, the existence of this as a megachurch with a lot of staff and a college was verified from the outset.--<a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> 15:32, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is what <i>you</i> say. I have seen no evidence that this is a megachurch, and I'm not even sure that the definition of a "megachurch" has been properly determined. However, if they do indeed have a fully accredited college, the college might deserve an article whether the church does or not. <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">wikipediatrix</a> 17:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I've no use for the term megachurch, since it is too vauge. But we have verified that this church 1) had 2,000 attendenting in the 1980's 2) employs <i>at least</i> ten named individuals in its pastoral staff, some of whom are 'department heads' (unless their website is lying - which is hardly likely) 3) is strong enough to establish a college offering accredited degrees - employing six teaching staff and librarian who maintains a on-line catalogued theological library. Yup, I'd like us to get better sources and clearer information, we should work on that to improve the article. We should either remove or mark as unreferenced the stuff we can't verify. But why consider deleting it? It isn't a hoax, and we can at least be sure that it is an extraordinary church.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I know the church in question - it is nearby here in Brisbane. I can attest to its status as a "megachurch" (going by the definition on the wiki page here) and the church numbers haven't declined since the 1980's, so it's still up there.

<li>Sir / Madam,
<p>This is an act of injustice!!!</p>
<p>All and sundry know that WIKIPEDIA is actually FULL of indirect advertisements DE FACTO. Why are tons of other pages tolerated while mine is being persecuted?</p>
<p>Please, I ask for your kindness and compassion. Please, let me set up my genuine business without sabotages. I have had already enough trash from my country's government. Please, give me a break.</p>

<ol>
<li>Every last word is original research - none of this information comes from reliable, third party sources - he's writing is because he's researched it himself. That makes the <i>entire article</i> unacceptable, per <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a></li>
<li>Every last word is unverifiable. The article does not cite a single, reliable source. That makes the <i>entire article</i> a violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, a policy which cannot be overridden by concensus.</li>
<li>The bottom half of the article is contact information for the purpose of promoting the company - all of that is in violation of <a href="../../../s/p/a/WP%7ESPAM_199a.html" title="WP:SPAM">WP:SPAM</a> - it's just a piece of spam he's trying to drum up some business with.</li>
<li>The article repeated uses phrases like "An octogon is better than a square when it comes to turning, because it doesn't have corners that will hit furniture." - this is a violation of non-negotiable policies like <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a></li>
<li>The company itself fails the guideline of <a href="../../../c/o/r/WP%7ECORP_7df3.html" title="WP:CORP">WP:CORP</a> for inclusion.</li>

<li>OK, may I say, it looks amazing, and i wish that it was notable enough to write about on wikipedia, but we need more than just a youtube video to satisfy <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Wikipedia verifiability</a>.

<p>Thanks JD cooper! Hey, what do you mean by "made-up invention"&#160;? I mean, if you make it up then it is an invention&#160;!!!!!! My goodness! Nowadays we talk so rapidly that we do not even realize that we would be uttering complicated simplicities, i mean, if you can set up something, then it is what it is - simple&#160;!!! The science-fiction in Hollywood Films is actually "real" in the sense that if you see a gargantuan monster, the monster as a living creature would be obviously ficticious but its model would be REAL&#160;!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hm, i see what you mean, but my point stands, a youtube video is not verifying evidence either of existence or notability. <a href="../../../j/d/c/User%7EJdcooper_7efd.html" title="User:Jdcooper">Jdcooper</a> 17:40, 24 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>A product doesn't necessarily have to be 50 years old to be notable - it only has to have an impact that has a good chance of lasting such a period of time.

<dd>You are right that it would be innappropriate to rely on google; note that in my nomination above, and the extended discussion on the subject's <a href="../../../e/d/g/Talk%7EEdgar_de_Evia_8e6c.html" title="Talk:Edgar de Evia">talk pages</a>, I never refer to google. However, I did check periodical databases that stretch back, for some periodicals, to the 19th century. I also checked for books by or about him. Nothing could be found. My best bet is that this guy was almost purely a commercial photographer, somebody who snapped pictures that appeared in catalogs and/or magazines but without his name on them (or with his name, but that he failed to make much of an impression). Lots of people have worked hard at their jobs without much public recognition; this does not mean that they didn't do their jobs well. However, it also does not mean that Wikipedia should provide them in death with the exposure they never received while alive.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>: It's a strangely written article at best. I learn that he was a photographer, was very rich, and had a succession of boyfriends. I don't see anything noteworthy about being rich or having boyfriends. Yet the lead to the article is (after markup-stripping): <i>Edgar de Evia (30 July 1910 – 10 February 2003) was an American photographer, artist and author. Partner and mentor first of Robert Denning and then of David McJonathan-Swarm from the mid 1960s until his death.</i> The second half of that seems trivial; maybe I've overlooked something but I see no sign in the article that he was an artist (other perhaps than by virtue of being a good photographer), and his writings (perhaps aside from occasional magazine articles about photography, etc.) are unpublished so I think not noteworthy. If the article should be retained at all, it needs radical pruning. Or is WP something like a social register? ¶ Commercial photography of the fifties has a certain vogue; e.g. the attention given to the last part of <a href="../../../n/i/c/Nickolas_Muray_54cc.html" title="Nickolas Muray">Nickolas Muray</a>'s career. A commercial photographer wouldn't need to have Muray's fame to merit inclusion, but I'd like to see a greater quantity of disinterested <i>evidence</i> for de Evia's <i>photography</i> (I don't have access to libraries where I can look up popular US magazines of the seventies and earlier). And the non-photographic (his boyfriends, cars, apartments, etc.) seems trivial at best. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:50, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>And another <b>comment</b>: both <i>Photography from 1839 to Today</i> (Taschen) and <i>The Oxford Companion to the Photograph</i> are large books that mention very many photographers and have indexes. This photographer appears in neither index (whether under "De Evia", "Deevia" or "Evia"). Of course these are both general books; is there something akin to a reference book to US photgraphy, to commercial photography, or even to something as specific as postwar US commercial photography? If it exists, I may be able to locate a copy. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 00:35, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Nor does he appear anywhere among the 133 photographers discussed in Helmut Gernsheim's seminal <i>Creative Photography: Aethetic Trends 1839-1960,</i> which book includes a number of photographers working in America in the years when de Evia was.

<dd>The former seems an extraordinarily stringent requirement. I'd noticed that he isn't numbered among the far more than 133 (five hundred, perhaps?) photographers in <i>The Photo Book</i> (Phaidon) or among the very many in <i>20th Century Photography</i> (Taschen) — but then again, neither are a great number of photographers who merit posthumous exhibitions, monographs, etc. Do you have any large books with <i>indexes</i>? If so, see whether this man pops up in them.

<dd>I did not intend to establish inclusion in Gernsheim's book as a test of photographic noteworthiness.

<p>Edgar de Evia was a well-known photographer in his day, and I have seen numerous citations about him in the New York Times and elsewhere in his day. Just because a person does not appear in or on Google does not make them somehow unknown. As a reporter for the New York Times who wrote the obituary about Robert Denning for the Times, in which de Evia is mentioned, I would be happy to contribute footnotes, et cetera, to establish de Evia's prominence in his field, which was largely commercial photography. Though his work may often have been workaday in its quality, he was a well-established and frequently credited photographer in his day. I suggest that though some Wikipedians might consider him "unremarkable," that does not negate that fact that he was a well-established and often frequently credited commercial photographer in his day. My suggestion is to leave the article, allow it to be streamlined and footnoted, et cetera. The stridency over this article's "importance" seems rather extreme, no? There are numerous article in Wiki about people, incidents, etc, that easily could be deemed "unremarkable."

<p><b>Strong Keep</b> This photographer was a significant influence in his day and started several contemporary photographers. He had many credits for editorial work, but this was all pre-internet and many of the tear sheets which show the credit to not include either magazine or date. Some do and I will try to add those. Given just a bit of time I believe that the significance can and will be shown. The importance of the automobiles and the houses, both in New York City and Connecticut, is that they were used in photographs and became a central part of his contribution during that period. His books albeit are unpublished at this time with the exception of one he wrote with Dr. Stearns titled <i>A New Synthesis</i> which I will add. The Rhinelander Mansion was not "gutted" it retains a great deal of its original architectural detail, but was adapted for a commercial use and restored or added to. It was truly one of the grand apartments in New York and was used in many editorial photographs and well as commercial work. Any editor of national magazines or New York art director of his period would know the name. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 15:34, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Reply to comment</b> At the time that I started the articles on Robert Denning and Edgar de Evia, they were the first as I have stated on my user page, I knew little about Wikipedia referencing. I have tried to learn protocol here and had started adding references to both articles. There are many holes on the internet and many "major old time" persons that have nothing on-line. This is one area where a good on-line encyclopaedia has the opportunity to be an invaluable asset. Part of my difficult with providing references on this article is that many of the tear sheets that I have, even when they show the credit do not have the issue and in some cases not even the magazine in which they appeared, as I said above. I have in a number of cases seen on Goggle a magazine for sale on eBay with a cover by Edgar de Evia and have purchased several which then give the necessary citation, but this all takes time and I do have a life beyond Wikipedia. With regard to your comment below, I don't know of any other personal friend of Edgar de Evia that has edited this article. <a href="../../../d/_/c/User%7ED_C_McJonathan_b121.html" title="User:D C McJonathan">Doc</a> ♬ <a href="../../../d/_/c/User_talk%7ED_C_McJonathan_3332.html" title="User talk:D C McJonathan">talk</a> 22:55, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Keep</b> I just had lunch with David McJonathan-Swarm and he told me about the article I had done on him being deleted. He had advised me against it, I am sorry if I did a bad thing for Wikopedia, but I thought he deserved an article. I had class materials and article copies from when he made the Guinness record back when I was his student. Much of it I admit I lifted from his user pages. I can not imagine anyone knowing anything about photographers of the 1950s and 1960s not knowing that Edgar de Evia should be included here. He had covers on many of the major magazines and was always doing huge ad campaigns, some such as Body by Fisher, with credit. I haven't done that much yet on Wikipedia and I'm sorry if I have broken rules, but the way David McJonathan-Swarm has been treated here the last week, I'm not sure that I wish to expose myself to this forum either.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. You don't have to apologize that much for creating the article on Mr. McJonathan-Swarm. It's ok to go on such mistakes when we're new users. But maybe, as an experienced user, Mr. McJonathan-Swarm should had avoided editing his own article. But this is over now.</dd>
<dd>But LouiseC, I'm interested in your opinion... do you think Mr. McJonathan-Swarm is the only person that knows about 1950s and 1960s using the Internet? It' has been stated that, being a pre-Google photographer, it is expected that we don't find much information about Mr. de Evia on the Internet. Is Mr. McJonathan-Swarm the only of many de Evia's fans that uses the Internet?</dd>
<dd>Was this person really notable when all users (3 that I can count) doing relevant changes to his article were <b>personal friends</b> of him? There's no need to feel bad for Wikiepdia not having an article about him. It doesn't mean he wasn't good on what he did. Take good care.

<dd>Abu, my nose is clean when it comes to your accusation. I was not a friend of Edgar de Evia. I never met the man except once, in an elevator, more than 10 years ago, because I was visiting a friend who lived in his building. And I have never met David McJonathan-Swarm, though I certainly contacted him when I wrote Robert Denning's obituary in the New York Times, and I have exchanged probably only 3 emails with him between 2003 and 2006. I have no personal connection to any of these people, at all. All I am concerned about is that someone whom I believe was prominent in his field but is woefully undersourced, as are so many individuals who were prominent in the design field, can have his/her article scheduled for deletion based on that criteria. So I'm doing what I can, as a design scholar, to help the article meet Wiki's criteria. <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 13:19, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> Certainly meets the criteria set forth at <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. The article is sourced and verifiable. Even a resource as poor as google turns up satisfactory verifiable information. As an aside, the nomination itself seems to be somewhat less than good-faith or civil as the nomination comes across more as a dispute with another wiki-editor than it does with the merits of the article. <a href="../../../a/g/e/User%7EAgent_86_1151.html" title="User:Agent 86">Agent 86</a> 07:23, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I agree with Agent86 ... his points are well taken ... Wiki allows lots of wiggle room in its policies re documentation, verification ... and if that's not allowable, then Wiki needs to make a more strigent statement with no wiggle room of any sort, for Google or elsewhere. One of the extraordinary values that Wiki has become (in fact, which it has allowed itself to become, via oversight policies) is that it is an ever-expanding resource, not without problems and issues. But given that as a scholar of historical design, etc, many of the people I research and write about for a variety of publications are unknown and will remain so until somebody gets a contract from a magazine to elaborate on their lives and importance in their field, or at least their influence and prominence in various arenas, Wiki is an amazing place to establish that kind of research. It is terribly odd that say, for instance, if I wanted to post an article about the French furniture designer Marc du Plantier, about whom I'm one of the few people in the English-speaking work to write about for a major publication, that my research if for naught, according to Wiki, if it hasn't been published; but then, once the article is published (in this case, in ELLE Decor), suddenly the research becomes reputable, even though the archival material I used to write the article is entirely in a private collection. This is a debate for another day ... <a href="../../../m/o/w/User%7EMowens35_1d6c.html" title="User:Mowens35">Mowens35</a> 13:14, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> First off, it's considered bad form to vote more than once especially when you're not signing your posts. That aside, we know it exists. Lots of other things exist which aren't on Wikipedia. Despite my good looks and charm, Wikipedia doesn't have an article dedicated to me. The sources aren't <b>notable</b>, which is the problem.</dd>
<dd>To put it into context, you've got a site here for PG Games. That proves nothing. Anybody with five dollars and a little patience can create a website. The link to forum posts on PG Games is accomplished via a search. Ditto the source for Game Maker Games... The only entry related to PG Games in ANY of the Top 25 lists on that site is a PG Games fangame. As has been stated before, you don't have to establish the existence of PG Games, but the notability. <a href="../../../l/a/n/User%7ELankybugger_0c4f.html" title="User:Lankybugger">Lankybugger</a> 15:08, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I disgree, it could be intended to make a list, not unlike entries such as the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_cel-shaded_video_games.html" title="List of cel-shaded video games">List of cel-shaded video games</a> Which has survived for years without deletion. And Wikipedia is the "free encyclopedia", a loose definition being: "A reference source containing information on a variety of topics. This information may be supplied in short paragraphs or in lengthy articles that include citations to other works on the same topic. Encyclopedias can be general - covering all topics, or specialized - focusing on a particular discipline such as art or philosophy." Therefore I believe one should be allowed to list Stained Glass Dealers as it is good for viewers to learn of how to get involved in such an art as Stained Glass. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../r/y/a/User%7ERyanHLewis_5c3a.html" title="User:RyanHLewis">RyanHLewis</a> (<a href="../../../r/y/a/User_talk%7ERyanHLewis_9450.html" title="User talk:RyanHLewis">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_RyanHLewis_0955.html" title="Special:Contributions/RyanHLewis">contribs</a>) 2006-08-24 15:30:24 (UTC)</small></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> RyanHLewis, you wrote 'a loose definition [of Wikipedia] being: "A reference source containing information on a variety of topics." The problem is, this is your opinion on what Wikipedia is or is not. We are not working with a 'loose definition', there is an official policy which we use in this situation. for the official policy on what Wikipedia is or is not, see <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> where you will find that "Wikipedia is not the yellow pages. See Yellowikis for a project with that goal." and that "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information". Also, I observe that you are the author of the article and the webmaster of the only company in this list, Hudson Glass. This is why I thought the list may also have been for the purpose of advertising your company. --<a href="../../../a/m/i/User%7EAmists_8945.html" title="User:Amists">Amists</a> 16:42, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The reference to <a href="../../../m/o/s/WP%7EMOSDAB_2469.html" title="WP:MOSDAB">WP:MOSDAB</a> is thoroughly misleading. If the manual page, which is at most a guideline to how to write generic dab pages, is worded so as to permit valuable lists by surname to be deleted, then the wording is wrong and needs to be changed. <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_people_by_name.html" title="List of people by name">List of people by name</a> is an inflexible structure that has done good work in the past, but is not adapted to the WP of today where the number of pages by personal name is in the hundreds of thousands. <i>No one is likely to enter "Allen" in the search box to find "Tim Allen"</i> is a comment with no merit at all (who is in a position to claim anything of the sort?) .

<li>Of course it was brought as an upgrade; that's the procedure. I thought no one might object to the prod; when someone did, I moved here to discuss it.

<li>False statements should be retracted with an apology, I think. And the rest is nonsense.

What is more, if you happen only to <i>know</i> that someone is a baseball player, and a surname, you can search on that basis.

<li>The assertion that nothing does nor <i>should</i> lk to it is irrelevant, if it is treated as a Dab page (to which, by def'n, nothing should lk). IMO it is, like most lists, clearly a nav'n page, and IMO the distinctions among the various forms of Nav page (well, other than Rdrs) are fuzzy enuf that the presumption should be "there's nothing wrong with a Nav page that nothing lks to" and the burden of proof to the contrary should lie with those seeing a problem.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. It has a valuable function (almost entirely of a Dab'n nature); this function is distinct from those that are better served by <a href="../../../a/l/l/List_of_people_by_name%7E_All_b972.html#People_named_Allen" title="List of people by name: All">List of people by name: All#People named Allen</a> (nav when dead certain of surname spelling but, re given name, under various degrees of (A) spelling uncertainty and/or (B) typing fatigue). (I believe that <a href="../../../a/l/l/Allen_%28surname%29.html" title="Allen (surname)">Allen (surname)</a> and Allen (given name) would be the titles that Allen (name) would be divided into, if it is one of the rare cases where the name-derivation topic is large enough and overlap is low enough. Thus i'm not sure the title shouldn't be Allen (person) instead; but that is not an AfD issue.)<br />

<li>I think this nomination raises a good question for any religious institution , what makes it notable?

<p>I have brought this forward so that the Community can take a view as to whether songs that have performed dismally in the Eurovision Song Contest merit their own article. There is already an article on <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision_Song_Contest_1998_6be6.html" title="Eurovision Song Contest 1998">Eurovision Song Contest 1998</a>, for example, where most of the information is contained. The rest of the encyclopaedic information can easilly be merged into the main article with an extension to the table. It is hard to see how such songs need their own article. Separate articles also have another problem - they splinter the information making it harder for the reader who has to keep switching articles. <b>Merge and redirect</b>. <a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueValour_4b06.html" title="User:BlueValour">BlueValour</a> 17:18, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

A song performed at the Eurovision Song Contest is notable by virtue of the fact that it won a national pre-selection to get there, was performed representing a country at an international competition viewed throughout one continent (Europe) and in a number of places worldwide. The article doesn't look too crash hot right at the moment, but in time a lot of the "splintering" will in fact be worked around and the effect will be similar to articles on people who've held offices and things. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> 22:44, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - first of all, nominating one song in a pretty haphazard manner seems rather strange to me, why not all of them at the same time? Is it any different from the other Eurovision Song articles? Secondly, while I had my reservations about the individual song articles, there were actually two previous identical cases (see links above) and the results were "keep". So I guess it is pretty pointless to reiterate that, as I believe the community consensus has already been reached (unless something new is being added to the discussion, which I believe is not the case).

<li><b>Keep</b> - How well the song performed in <a href="../../../e/u/r/Eurovision.html" title="Eurovision">Eurovision</a> is not relevant. The fact is, it was THE one and only song which went forward to represent an entire nation in one year: which makes it very notable. Some songs will only have a little bit of information at first; some will have a lot. But the ones with little information must be given a chance to grow. If this was were an anonymous national final song (of which there have been many thousands over the years), it would be different – but no, this was <i>the</i> song which represented France in 1998. <a href="../../../e/u/r/User%7EEurosong_5f20.html" title="User:Eurosong">EuroSong</a> <sup><a href="../../../e/u/r/User_talk%7EEurosong_19f5.html" title="User talk:Eurosong">talk</a></sup> 23:29, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Skeet has an article because it is used worldwide and has been used for many years. However, "Crumbelievable" is only used by fans of Stephen Colbert. Many Americans do not watch Colbert's show, and it's not broadcast in multiple countries. The major two differences betwen "skeet" and "crumbelievable" are:
<ol>
<li>"Crumbelievable" is very localized and only used by people who watch a certain television show while "Skeet" is used prominently in at least three different nations, by people of all social groups and hobbies;</li>
<li>"Crumbelievable" is a recent ("neo" = "new") term and may never be used again, whereas it is fairly certain that "skeet" will continue to be used. <a href="../../../s/r/o/User%7ESrose_465a.html" title="User:Srose"><b><font color="green">S<i>rose</i></font></b></a> <a href="../../../s/r/o/User_talk%7ESrose_7d50.html" title="User talk:Srose"><font color="hotpink">(<b>talk</b>)</font></a> 19:54, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - is the above a complete non sequitur, or do you actually believe that the existence of other bad articles justifies the existence of another one?

<li><b>Comment</b> - I believe the point of the argument is that there are wikipedia stubs for advertisment campaigns and slogans, and this fits under that category.

<p>nonsense page, libel LordBothwell 20:07, 24 August 2006 (UTC) <small>— LordBothwell (<a href="../../../l/o/r/User_talk%7ELordBothwell_4fec.html" title="User talk:LordBothwell">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_LordBothwell_7404.html" title="Special:Contributions/LordBothwell">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></p>

<li>You're very transparent, as the only article that you've edited in your entire user history is Brian Mandelbaum's page. Brian, please do not edit the article. Self-promotion is against Wiki rules. I will now remove the deletion clause. Twotacos 20:13, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and possibly edit. The page itself is not nonsense; it's a coherent article, with sources, about a contestant on <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Apprentice_e490.html" title="The Apprentice">The Apprentice</a> with other TV appearances. The nominator is probably referring to the section that cites two blogs for the proposition that Mandelbaum was rejected from a fraternity. That section should arguably be removed, but it doesn't mean the entire article should be deleted. Note: nom is User:LordBothwell's first Wikipedia edit. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 20:14, 24 August 2006 (UT</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Response</b> You are correct that User:Twotacos created the article on August 4, and that it originally had the gay/lesbian references in it. Those references are now gone, along with the fraternity section. That's how Wikipedia is supposed to work -- information that is incorrect should be edited or deleted. Unless Mr. Mandelbaum himself is not notable, or the information about him is not verifiable, though, the article itself should be kept. <a href="../../../n/a/w/User%7ENawlinWiki_2ff5.html" title="User:NawlinWiki">NawlinWiki</a> 20:22, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>-- Admittedly the Quinnipac stuff needs <b>real</b> references to reputable sources, or more corroboration, but otherwise the article is factual, with references.

<li><b>Keep</b> - The article describes a notable person (repeat appearances on a major network television station) as is indicated by a moderately sized following (both based on television appearances and through internet articles based on the television appearances). Information relevant to those topics should, at minimum, be kept in wikipedia. Regarding the controversial section, is it not enough that the material is categorized in the article as being controversial? Articles such as <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Simmons_2733.html" title="Richard Simmons">Richard Simmons</a>' have statements describing allegations of him being gay but no proper citations (and a simple google search for relevant articles results in links pointing back at that wikipedia entry) but it is clearly marked that they are allegations and not fact. Stating that the allegations are fact is wrong, but it should be documented that the allegations exist and have been made. Iluvitar 21:50, 24 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Accusations fly! If this is what the total efforts of wiki editors (and apparently the subject himself) can do to assert notablity, we should delete. The subject was not notable prior to appearing on the Apprentice, his appearances (repeat or otherwise) do not confer notability, unless perhaps if he/she is the winner, and even then it would depend on what he/she did afterwards. The subject does not seem to have done anything particularly notable SINCE the show and should be deleted per <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. His other TV appearance(s) referred to all happened prior to The Apprentice. Helping to "orchestrate a massive overhaul of the 70 year old company" is what executives as part of their job, and if that makes him notable, then I deserve a wiki entry too. <a href="../../../o/h/c/User%7EOhconfucius_bd0f.html" title="User:Ohconfucius">Ohconfucius</a> 04:09, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Reply</b>: Fair question. From your page: "The primary criterion for notability, that applies in all fields, is that an article's subject is notable if it has been the subject of non-trivial published works by multiple separate sources that are independent of that subject itself." I'm looking for them, but the article doesn't list any, and Google is of no help either (lots of hits for the school, which obviously exists, but nothing that fits your primary definition of a non-trivial published work. I have e.g. this NY times article<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DD1230F933A05757C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print" class="external autonumber" title="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE6DD1230F933A05757C0A963958260&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print" rel="nofollow">[45]</a>, but it mentions nothing special about the Middle School (it confirms existence, of course). The more regional Asbury Park Press<a href="http://orig.app.com/lifein/story/0,21786,1199354,00.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://orig.app.com/lifein/story/0,21786,1199354,00.html" rel="nofollow">[46]</a> thinks the schools are excellent (bravo!), but again makes no mention of what makes this school so distinct from other schools that it becomes notable. If someone can convince me by finding other sources that <i>do</i> establish notability, great: for now, it fails the norm. If you want this expressed in a policy: the claims which make the school different and thus notable (if you are not of the opinion, like some people are, that all schools are per se notable) are not verifiable in the sense of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, until some of the editors of the article or some of the people that vote keep canproivde those references. To me, it all looks like some fancy names to give the impression of some unique concept, but basically it is a school like there are thousands of others. <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 07:53, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for citing sources. I hope that we can continue to push the schools debate towards finding, reading, and citing sources, and away from the "stuck record" arguments and subjective evaluations of notability. Looking at the <i>NYT</i> source, it appears that there is enough information there to source an article on the whole <s><a href="../../../m/a/n/Manalapan-Englishtown_Regional_Schools_6831.html" title="Manalapan-Englishtown Regional Schools">Manalapan-Englishtown Regional Schools</a> school district</s> <a href="../../../m/a/n/Manalapan-Englishtown_Regional_School_District_fbbb.html" title="Manalapan-Englishtown Regional School District">Manalapan-Englishtown Regional School District</a>, even if there isn't the source material for more than a sentence on this 1 individual school. The same goes for the <i>Asbury Park Press</i> article, which discusses all of the schools as a group. So, given the sources that we have, which only discuss the school district as a whole, <i>and</i> the fact that the web site hyperlinked to by the article is in fact the school district's web site, would not a rename/merger into the school district be the most appropriate course of action, in order to have the encyclopaedia reflect the sources? <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:02, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

Looking online, although the phrase "pro-Palestinian lobby" is used by various places (and even some <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>), usually it's either shorthand to refer to people espousing particular views in an organisation, conference, etc (who and what views varies, and is generally only obvious from either the context or due to a qualifier), part of a description, or used to contrast with the supposed pro-Israeli lobby.

<li><b>Keep</b> The phrase has been verifiably used. It is no worse than the China lobby. The page has plenty of potential for development. Some people here seem to think that the very existence of the page is POV, but I disagree - lobbying is an inherent part of the political process and does not carry intrinsically negative connotations. Would you say that a page on people who lobby for the disabled "reeks of POV" or describe it as "POV screed?" Hope not. This is no different.

The phrase "pro-Palestinian lobby" has been used in places meeting <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> as shorthand for "the members of some organisation lobbying for some pro-Palestinian (or anti-Israel) action" (where the organisation and actions are implicit from the context) but that doesn't make it worthy of an article IMO. The question is, is it used in the sense described in the article? Remember, the article as it stood alleged that varous groups made up something called the "Pro-Palestinian Lobby", and were all busy spreading Palestinian propaganda. There have been some small improvements since, but I think you can see why I thought (and still think) it has serious POV (and verifiability) issues. -- <a href="../../../m/a/k/User%7EMakomk_1f87.html" title="User:Makomk">makomk</a> 22:03, 26 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep or turn into a category.</b> I think that this is a legitimate grouping. While there is no roof body, this does not change the fact there is a lobby. A lobby doesn't have to be a formal organization. For instance, the US Tobacco Lobby, while containing some organizations dedicated to lobbying, also may be supported by actual companies like Big Tobacco, who are, as such, also part of the lobby. Or for an example relating to Wikipedia, we have our Jewish lobby, our Arab lobby, we have our anti-globalisation lobby, marxist-lobby, and quite a few others. They are just groupings of users who band together and try and have a certain POV (dirty term) be the norm in certain articles. So depending on your definition of lobby - mine being one which I believe is well-definied - there is a pro-Palestinian lobby. <a href="../../../e/v/o/User%7EEvolver_of_Borg_d229.html" title="User:Evolver of Borg">Evolver of Borg</a> 09:43, 30 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

Moreover, as I see it, the Arab lobby is associated more with past events, whereas the Palestinian lobby has began to have some momentum only after 2000 and its future lies ahead. --<a href="../../../g/a/b/User%7EGabi_S._4020.html" title="User:Gabi S.">Gabi S.</a> 09:33, 2 September 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Except in very few cases, songwriters and producers don't get noticed as much as performers. The subject had 44 relevant Ghits out of 330 (which include mirrors). It seems that he may have produced a single (<i>Getcha Head in the Game</i>) from Disney’s “High School The Musical” by B5 which went to #1 on billboard, and he may have been Head of A&amp;R at ERA Productions. Most of the other Ghits all point to his high school (Occidental College), other aspiring artists' sites, several obligatory myspace links, blog entries and a few dead ends. However, there are no reviews and is precious little else on him.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I am wondering why this page is being deleted. If this page does not seem to have merit or importance then I strongly disagree. Just because this group has not been in any newspapers does not mean that it has no importance. This group is a vital part of the social networking website known as Facebook and it is imperative that this page remain available to those who are new to the group and would like to find out what this group is all about. Many times people who are new to the group on Facebook wonder what the history of the group is and this Wikipedia entry can inform them rather than having the regulars on the wall explain everything every single time. Also, this Wikipedia entry should be allowed to remain because of it's importance to those who belong to the group. Many members of TLFGE love using Wikipedia and this entry is sure to only increase their love even more. I certainly felt that way when an entry was created for my high school. I'm sure that the existence of the group's Wiki entry will encourage members of TLFGE to continue using Wikipedia and possibly introduce Wikipedia to people who have never used it before thereby securing even more Wikipedia users. Thanks.

<li><b>Comment:</b> I agree that TLFGE is a fad but doesn't the fact that it is a part of Facebook also make TLFGE verifiable? TLFGE is just a subset of Facebook but it is a very large subset. Out of 7.5 million members in Facebook, TLFGE has 780,000. I would say that is a large enough number to verify that this group has the right to a wiki entry. Also, the group is not just a fad in the US. There are many international Facebookers who are also in the group. I myself have made many international friends from the wall and I would never have met them if they group had not existed. Considering my personal experiences (which I know others have had similar experiences) completely relate to the goal of Facebook (social networking), this group certainly has merit and I would like to give credit to this group on wiki.

<li><b>Reply:</b> Being a fad is exactly why this doesn't belong in Wikipedia. The problem is that no one else but people already within the Facebook group would be writing it -- we have to take your word and your word alone. What if you were to stop monitoring this page and someone adds a lie? The rest of the editors on Wikipedia wouldn't be able to tell what was was true and what wasn't because there are simply no 3rd party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiy</a> anything written in the article at all. That's simply unacceptable in an encyclopedia. An article on <a href="../../../f/a/c/Facebook.html" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> can be verified because we can cite journalists who have investigated Facebook and much more likely to have fact-checked their statements before writing it from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>.

<li><b>Comment:</b> "Does lack of fame make a vanity article?<br />
An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is currently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required to justify a unique article being created in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see Template:IncGuide). Borderline cases are frequently nominated for deletion and discussed on WP:AFD. Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.<br />
Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject; indeed, it can also be vanity if written by a fan, or close relationship. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses can be "vanity" depending on the amount of recognition - e.g. a homemade movie or game, a self-published book, or a fanfic story is not generally considered encyclopedic. In general, the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.<br />
The key rule is to not write about yourself, nor about the things you've done or created. If they are encyclopedic, somebody else will notice them and write an article about them.<br />

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I was a pagan when I was a teenager, and now I'm an atheist. But that's not the point. When I studied Wicca at one of the largest occult stores in New York's East Village, a good number of the people I studied with did not believe in a deity, or flat-out denied anything mystical, instead emphasizing the importance/benefits/etc of <i>ritual</i>, for which reason they were attracted to Wicca/etc. <i>Community</i> and <i>female empowerment</i> were also prominent themes/motivations. Furthermore, <i>no dogma</i> is a founding principle of modern Paganism, and while it's been at least 10 years since I read it, I'm quite sure Margot Adler (<i>Drawing Down the Moon</i>) discussed modern witches/etc who lack any belief in the supernatural, and the acceptance of such individuals in the larger community (I really don't have the time to look that up right now). Anyway, I recognize all of this is anecdotal evidence, but I assure you that atheism and non-theism (?) are strong subcurrents within modern Paganism. <a href="../../../z/w/e/User%7EZweifel_24e8.html" title="User:Zweifel">Zweifel</a> 08:04, 26 August 2006 (UTC)note my name
<ul>
<li>Also, one of my best friends is much the atheist, but is also a member of her local Reconstructionist Jewish temple. While I am sure members of other Jewish sects would claim she is therefore not Jewish, she certainly identifies as one. The criticisms raised here relate to 1) notability, which I guess I haven't satisfied, despite my personal experience with the subject (albeit with something of an avante guard within the Pagan community); and, 2) semantic/doctrinal/etc issues, which are utter bollocks. Paganism is as Pagans do. Keep the article (though definitely put up the sign which says it doesn't cite sources). <a href="../../../z/w/e/User%7EZweifel_24e8.html" title="User:Zweifel">Zweifel</a> 08:23, 26 August 2006 (UTC) more anecdotal evidence</li>

<dd><i>Fairsing, thanks for the response. I want to make sure I understand your position, and to do so it'll be helpful to me if we leave out the term 'Enterprise 2.0' altogether.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - A concept that describes how technologies such as wikis can be used in novel ways within organizations -- and that garners over a million hits on google -- clearly should be in Wikipedia. Although the boundaries of this term are still being defined, the Sloan article provides a very useful start. Wikipedia is exactly the forum where this term, like Web 2.0, can and should be more clearly articulated. mtoffel <small><b>Note:</b> First edit from this user</small>
<ul>
<li><b>comment</b> I find myself amused that the aformentioned google test by presumably a Enterprise 2.0 supporter appears to forget good google practice. Adding speech marks changes the result somewhat. <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Enterprise+2.0%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Enterprise+2.0%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"Enterprise 2.0"</a> garners 720,000 results, whilst the alternative phrase <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22social+computing%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" class="external text" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22social+computing%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">"Social Computing"</a> gets 921,000. Sadly these results are by no means authoritative, as there is no simple means to filter out the use of this term within forums (which wikipedia should not use as a reference, hence making their inclusion in a google test a bad idea), as forums are part of this concept. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:23, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Going through these points in order:
<ol>
<li>A concept that describes how technologies such as wikis can be used...
<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is not a place to discuss the theoretical uses of wikis. It is a wiki-based encyclopedia, but focusing on being an encyclopedia, not a forum for wiki meta-discussions. For that you have many other wikis, including <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="m:Main_Page">Meta</a>.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>...that garners over a million hits on google...
<dl>
<dd>Yes, notability is a fair reason to keep an article on almost any phrase, person, or concept -- though perhaps a very short one.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>...Wikipedia is exactly the forum where this term, like Web 2.0, can and should be more clearly articulated.
<dl>
<dd>This suggests a simple misunderstanding of Wikipedia's goals. <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">It is not</a> a place to store the definition of terms (for that, see <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiktionary.html" title="Wiktionary">Wiktionary</a>). It is explicitly not a place to articulate new and unformed ideas, but rather a record of that which has been clearly formed about ideas. <a href="../../../s/j/_/User%7ESj_7824.html" title="User:Sj">+sj</a> <a href="../../../s/j/_/User_talk%7ESj_d037.html" title="User talk:Sj">+</a> 02:27, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>comment</b> Enterprise 2.0 is not the same as social computing.

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - While certainly a neologism, so too is Web 2.0 as is "Wikipedia" for that matter. I would hope the fervor created by the deletion over the last few weeks would be indicative of the potential importance of this term. This is an evolving concept (as is Web 2.0) so it would be unfair to imply that the litmus test is a tried and true, uniform, definition. We don't worry about having one unified definition for concepts like "Faith" or "God" or "Love", and this is far more tangible and will find its way to a more universally accepted definition as we prove this out. <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWood83_e275.html" title="User:Wood83">Wood83</a></li>
<li><b>Weak Delete</b> as a neologism, stated as emerging in spring of this year. The presense of references however makes this weak. <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/21/it_managers_guide_to_social_computing/" class="external text" title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/07/21/it_managers_guide_to_social_computing/" rel="nofollow">Social Computing</a> is arguably the better term for this. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELinaMishima_c376.html" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> 02:17, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - More than worthy of discussion, as one time's neologism is not necessarily the future. I believe it takes domain expertise to understand the importance of this term and how it is being used in academia and industry. There is going to be risk of sock puppeting in this conversation, because the domain experts are highly connected through blogging and other networks. This isn't necessarily bad, as even Wikipedia forks content from conversation within the tool, previously on mailing lists and now on IRC (nor is it sock puppeting as most of the calls for participating are to expand the article). The article itself has great potential for expansion, use of the term is clearly on the rise, and it will be problematic to co-mingle it with consumer articles like <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">web 2.0</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_software.html" title="Social software">social software</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_computing.html" title="Social computing">social computing</a>, <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_software.html" title="Enterprise software">enterprise software</a>, <a href="../../../a/r/c/Architecture_of_participation.html" title="Architecture of participation">architecture of participation</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> and more. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossmay_7dcd.html" title="User:Rossmay">Rossmay</a> 03:39, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> this article really is not helped by being buzz-statement heavy, and almost evangelical. A casual read of the article is painful. With proper clean-up so as to make the article accessable, many delete votes may become keeps. A good place to start would be a description of what Eterprise 2.0 actually means, rather than it'the history of the term. Also, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_computing.html" title="Social computing">Social computing</a> does seem very similar to me - however Enterprise 2.0 seems to be about the technologies rather than the business technique.

<li><b>Delete</b>. While I can respect the feelings that some editors have on this article, the fact of the matter is that this AfD is not about censorship or picking favorites or saying the term isn't used. It isn't about if the term has a huge following or not. <b>It is about if the Article can pass all of Wikipedia's rules.</b> Let me help out a bit so you understand. The Google searchs are really only used to back up a statement, not as a stand-alone basis for a vote though this is abused sometimes. The problem with the google searches are that they also include blogs, forums, and other links that are not accepted by wikipedia's policies as sources (and quite a few users forget to do quotation marks around the words to make sure it is a focused search for that exact term). The real problem with this article is that it doesn't follow the three pillars of wikipedia. An article must be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiable</a> through multiple, reliable, reputable, independent, third-party sources. It must not be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>, which means there are no sources to back up the claims of the author(s). It must also have a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point-of-view</a> and not show bias. As a guideline for the above rules, an article must <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">cite it's notability</a> with <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and be must be <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">encyclopaedic</a>. This article fails to meet <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, some sections of <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>, does not follow the guideline of <a href="../../../c/i/t/WP%7ECITE_9b8f.html" title="WP:CITE">WP:CITE</a> or <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. The biggest violation beyond not citing reliable sources, is <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">neologism</a>. <i>The first is that Wikipedia is not a dictionary, and so articles simply attempting to define a neologism are inappropriate</i> and <i>The second reason is that articles on neologisms frequently attempt to track the emergence and use of the term as observed in communities of interest or on the internet — without attributing these claims to reliable secondary sources. If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia. This is true even though there may be many examples of the term in use.</i>. Following this, <i>Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of <b>verifiability, not truth.</b> To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers <b>about the term — not books and papers that use the term</b>.</i>. So far no one has shown that there are reliable secondary sources that fit this criteria for this article. More over <i>Neologisms that are in wide use — but for which there are no treatments in secondary sources — are not yet ready for use and coverage in Wikipedia. They may be in time, but not yet. The term does not need to be in Wikipedia in order to be a "true" term, and when secondary sources become available it will be appropriate to create an article on the topic or use the term within other articles.</i> So when the time comes that this term does have citations that rely on books and papers that have articles/sections about the term, then the article can be recreate. As far as personal thoughts, <i>An editor's personal observations and research (e.g. finding blogs and books that use the term) are insufficient to support use of (or articles on) neologisms because this is analysis and synthesis of primary source material (which is explicitly prohibited by the original research policy). To paraphrase <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">Wikipedia:No original research</a>: If you have research to support the inclusion of a term in the corpus of knowledge that is Wikipedia, the best approach is to arrange to have your results published in a peer-reviewed journal or reputable news outlet and then document your work in an appropriately non-partisan manner.</i> I hope this helps understand my take on this discussion.--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 04:57, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. Brian, I appreciate the detailed view and, in terms of the letter of the Wiki law, I can't argue with many of your assertions. But the struggle I have broadly is that I could personally find you hundreds of wiki entries that are active and not subject to deletion which violate these very same "rules." Wiki is resplendent with neologisms of, frankly, far less import. There are even dozens of slang terms (including Booya! for goodness sake), which are allowed; yet Enterprise 2.0 which clearly has a following and an emerging interest can't pass muster? Wiki submission rules shouldn't be so complicated, is there somewhere I can read about the decision to create such rigid submission rules? <a href="../../../w/o/o/User%7EWood83_e275.html" title="User:Wood83">Wood83</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Reply</b> Wood83, while I understand your thoughts, the arguement 'Because of Article X, then Article Y..' does not work here. Yes there are hundreds of articles that do not follow wikipedia's rules and as you see by the AfD logs, by the end of the day, dozens are removed. The thing is, nothing states that if I 'vote' delete on this afd, that I have to go out and make an AfD for all the other articles like this that fail any of the rules. If you found some, then by all means, make and afd for them! They are most likely subjects for deletion, yet no one has taken the time to start an AfD on them. The problem is that some of those slang terms that you have found do pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>...Enterprise 2.0 does not as of now.

<li><b>Comment: Original Research, Sources, and Verifiability.</b> I am the author of the <i>Sloan Management Review</i> (SMR) article referenced in the current WP entry on Enterprise 2.0. I hope that this entry is not deleted, and I'd like to address the arguments mounted here for doing so.
<p>It is true that Enterprise 2.0 has become a marketing buzzword, but it did not start that way. My article was the first use of the term (aside, I believe, from a single Technorati tag), so the term originated in an acceptable secondary source (as discussed more below), not in a marketing brainstorming session. It subsequently become a buzzword because of its resonance and popularity in some quarters, but the same is true of 'Web 2.0' and 'disruptive technology,' both of which have long WP entries not currently flagged for deletion.</p>
<p>It is also true that Enterprise 2.0 is a neologism, as are Web 2.0, grid computing, and Web Services, all of which have WP entries. WP's guideline on this seems quite clear: "If the article is not verifiable (see Reliable sources for neologisms, below) then it constitutes analysis, synthesis and original research and consequently cannot be accepted by Wikipedia... Support for article contents, including the use and meaning of neologisms, must come from reliable sources. Wikipedia is a tertiary source that includes material on the basis of verifiability, not truth. To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term."</p>
<p>My SMR article (which is clearly referenced in the current entry) was entirely devoted to explaining what the term meant. SMR is a well-regarded and peer-reviewed journal, intended for both practitioners and academics. It seems to easily meet WP's criteria for appropriate sources, and for verifiability: "One of the keys to writing good encyclopedia articles is to understand that they must refer only to facts, assertions, theories, ideas, claims, opinions, and arguments that have already been published by reputable publishers." "Reputable publications include peer-reviewed journals..." "The goal of Wikipedia is to become a complete and reliable encyclopedia. Editors should cite reliable sources so that their edits may be verified by readers and other editors." It seems to me that the current entry does exactly this; anyone who wanted to could verify both the existence and content of the SMR article. I appreciate that this article is not freely available on the Web, but I don't see anywhere that verifiability must stem from free, universally available, or copyright-free sources. At any rate, an abstract of the article is available here: <a href="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2006/spring/06/" class="external free" title="http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2006/spring/06/" rel="nofollow">http://sloanreview.mit.edu/smr/issue/2006/spring/06/</a>. Other sources include the numerous blogs, my own included, listed in the current entry, as well as stories in Business Week (<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060605_424102.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060605_424102.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2006/tc20060605_424102.htm</a>) and other mainstream publications. I read in WP's policies that "Research that consists of collecting and organizing information from primary and secondary sources is, of course, strongly encouraged. This is not "original research"; it is "source-based research", and it is fundamental to writing an encyclopedia." Aren't we doing exactly this sort of source-based research with the current entry?</p>
<p>In short, after spending some time familiarizing myself with WP's policies and guidelines, I come away puzzled as to why many of the commenters here seem to believe that the inclusion of any entry on 'Enterprise 2.0', let alone the current one, violates policy on verifiability and/or original research. As argued above, it seems that the topic passes all of the relevant tests for inclusion in WP (other comments here have addressed concerns about notability). Most of the current entry's editors are, like myself, WP newbies and so have certainly made some mistakes in preparing and structuring the entry, but I don't see how these are grounds for deletion. Instead, I would hope that the WP community would use the entry's talk page as a forum to help us sharpen the entry over time.</p>
<p>Another set of comments here and on the entry's talk page ask about folding Enterprise 2.0 concepts into WP's existing 'Web 2.0' entry. I can think of two main reasons not to do this. The first is the same reason that information about Chihuahuas is not subsumed under the entry for 'dog.' In other words, even if Enterprise 2.0 were purely a subset of Web 2.0, it might well have sufficiently distinctive history, features, and/or other characteritics to merit a separate entry in an encyclopedia. But I and others believe, and have previously published on the topic, that Enterprise 2.0 is not simply a subset of Web 2.0 -- that use of these technologies plays out behind the corporate firewall quite differently that it does across the entire Internet (see, for example <a href="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/03/06/an_adoption_strategy_for_social_software_in_the_enterprise.php" class="external free" title="http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/03/06/an_adoption_strategy_for_social_software_in_the_enterprise.php" rel="nofollow">http://many.corante.com/archives/2006/03/06/an_adoption_strategy_for_social_software_in_the_enterprise.php</a> and <a href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/does_web_20_guarantee_enterprise_20/" class="external free" title="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/does_web_20_guarantee_enterprise_20/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/index.php/faculty_amcafee_v3/does_web_20_guarantee_enterprise_20/</a>)</p>
<p>I hope these comments are helpful. Thanks for giving me a forum to post them, and for having such a transparent AfD process.Amcafee 18:05, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>comment</b> Thank you for your reply Amcafee. While you make a good arguement, the fact of the matter still remains that everything must be verifiable. "Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, because Wikipedia does not publish original thought or original research. While you state it was in a peer-reviewed journal, the problem is only readers that have access to this journal can verify the information. It must be available to anyone (by heading to the library, searching online, or stopping by a book store). Unfortunately, even though your blog may spell out parts of the journal, blogs are not accepted as sources in general. While you may have written the journal article on Enterprise 2.0 (and since you did it is generally, but strongly, frowned on that you work on the wikipedia article) the term still does not have multiple, Independent (from the source...being yourself), reliable, non-trivial, third-party sources. That is the main arguement. Now if the New York Times, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Time Magazine, Newsweek, or some other major publication wrote an article exclusively on the term, or if a book had a chapter on nothing but this term, then the article would have reliable sources. As it is, we have a journal that the general public does not easily (if at all) have access to and no media mentions. On a related note: <a href="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/" class="external text" title="http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/" rel="nofollow">the last three enteries on your blog are fairly damning</a>. <i>The Get Out the Vote Drive</i> where you tell people <i>weigh in on its(enterprise 2.0) 'articles for deletion' entry.</i> and that <i>Every vote counts, so please take a minute to chime in (respectfully) on this . Let's get ourselves a not-in-danger-of-deletion-anymore entry that we can refine over time, in keeping with Enterprise 2.0 best practices!</i> While I respect your knowledge and status as an Associate Professor, I take a dim view of a person who coins a term also being the person that is the main editor and follower of that term's wikipedia article. A google news search brings up no articles about the term itself (beyond your blog and an article about this AfD). A dogpile search brings up a lot of talk on the first and second AfD's but no full-length, featured articles about the term itself. A quick ODIN search of North Dakota and Minnesota's libraries does not bring up any printed articles or books that have the term. (and be careful before commenting, this search also looked into the college libraries. NDSU, Minnesota State Universities (all of them), UND, VCSU, Mayville, NDSCS just to name a few) --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 20:33, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Let me lead off my response by citing again WP's guideline on neologisms: "To support the use of (or an article about) a particular term we must cite reliable secondary sources such as books and papers about the term — not books and papers that use the term." As I said in my original comment, my article is such as source. Its contents are verifiable to anyone who has access to a good business library, anyone who has Web access and is willing to spend $6.50 for a copy of the article, or anyone who has Web access and access to retrieval services such as ABI / Proquest, which carries a .pdf of the article. I appreciate that these sources present hurdles, but as WP's guideline on reliable sources says, "Fact checking and reference-running can be time consuming." Luckily in this case, the SMR article's contents are currently verifiable to anyone who has Web access and moderate Googling skills, since at least one site has a .pdf of the full article available for free public download (I did not upload it).
<p>I see nowhere in WP's policies that multiple sources are required, but they do exist in this case. The Business Week article excerpted by Rossmay below (and available to anyone with Web access) places the phrase "Enterprise 2.0" very close to a quote identifying the trend as "... the biggest change in the organization of the corporation in a century." This seems like the opposite of a dismissive or trivial tone. The reporter does appear to tweak those of us who use the "Enterprise 2.0" neologism, but new concepts often demand new labels. This article, the title of which is "Web 2.0 Has Corporate America Spinning" is not about Web 2.0 as it's commonly and broadly defined. Instead, it's about nothing but the use of Web 2.0 technologies behind the firewall; it is, in other words, a full-length mainstream magazine article about Enterprise 2.0. It is also completely independent of me; I was not contacted by the reporter or referenced in the article.</p>
<p>So I remain highly puzzled as to how this concept could be seen to fail WP's verifiability policy, which states: ""Verifiable" in this context means that any reader must be able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source,"</p>
<p>To respond to some of the other points raised by Brian fairsing.</p>
<p>Of course I have an interest in the outcome of this AfD process, and of course I have passion and bias. I have the same interest in publicizing this concept that all academics do in advancing their theories, and I think that it would be great if a Wikipedia entry on it existed. This is why I'm spending time to understand WP's policies, and to demonstrate that they're all being followed.</p>
<p>As part of this demonstration I'm engaging in the distasteful activity of self-citation. I don't like it, but I can't see how else to proceed. And I cite my blog because, as WP's guideline on reliable sources states, even though blogs are largely not acceptable as sources "Exceptions to this may be when a well-known, professional researcher writing within his field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material. In some cases, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as their work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications, and they are writing under their own names, and not a pseudonym." My blog meets all these criteria.</p>
<p>Brian writes that he takes "a dim view of a person who coins a term also being the person that is the main editor and follower of that term's wikipedia article." A glance at the Enterprise 2.0 entry's history page would show that I have not in fact edited it at all. I have no way to see if I'm the article's "main follower," but I suspect I'm not.</p>
<p>It was a mistake for me to refer to this AfD discussion as a 'vote' in my blog. I should have known better, and I apologize.Amcafee 23:13, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Having something pass through a process of fact checking, peer review, and publication is one factor in our <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a> policy. Another factor is that a concept must have then become a part of the corpus of human knowledge. The existence of wholly separate non-trivial published works on the subject, from sources independent of the subject's creator(s), is a strong indicator of that. In slightly more academic terms: The original research hurdle is only jumped when <i>other people's</i> papers start coming out. You compare Enterprise 2.0 with Web 2.0, but the two are very different in one important respect: Whilst Google Scholar turns up several papers, from several authors, on the subject of Web 2.0, the <i>only</i> thing that it turns up about Enterprise 2.0 is your paper. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 01:27, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - Printed books and matter on library shelves always lag the landscape on the ground. Wikipedia changes all of that. It keeps pace with time (and the rate of change). Enterprise 2.0 - it's in journals, newspapers, blogs, magazines, posters, signs - but not on Wikipedia! Irony of ironies.--171.69.101.214 20:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> for Professor McAfee. Thank you for your input into the discussion and for attempting to understand the criteria for inclusion in Wikipedia. To help out here, citing your own blog does not help establish <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">Verifiability</a>. And as to the Business Week article, the article itself is not about the term "Enterprise 2.0", but about "Web 2.0". The "Enterprise 2.0" term receives two trivial mentions in that article, one of which is derisive of the term: "Despite all the activity so far, it's still early days for this phenomenon some techies (who can't help themselves) call Enterprise 2.0." This quote indicates that even Business Week doubts the validity of the term. So, overall, what do we have here?
<p>An academic at a respected institution attemps to coin a new term in an article published in a respected journal (SMR). Fine, but all this means is that there is a new neologism on the block.</p>
<p>The same academic starts promoting the term on his blog. Fine again, but does not establish verifiability of the term.</p>
<p>Other blogs pick up the term. Nothing wrong with this, but these are very weak sources for verifiability according to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>There is anecdotal use of the term by people who work for various software companies. Ok, but again does not pass <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.</p>
<p>No other academics (that I have seen cited here, at least) have started to use the term in their own research.</p>
<p>No mainstream business publications have published a non-trivial article regarding the term (that I have seen cited here). The BusinessWeek mention is trivial, and vaguely derisive at that.</p>
<p>The academic begins to campaign to get readers of his blog to come to Wikipedia and "vote" to keep the article in this AFD ("every vote counts"). But voting is explicitly *not* the purpose of an AFD discussion.</p>
<p>Several new WP editors consequently show up to "vote" in this discussion, several anonymously, several of whom have never edited Wikipedia before. Almost none of these postings make a coherent argument using Wikipedia criteria (notability, verifiability, etc.): some because they are new and don't understand these, and others don't even try, they just "vote".</p>
<p>Also, because you potentially stand to gain personally if this term wins currency in the business community (respect among your peers, consulting engagements, etc.), you are inherently biased on the topic. So, although I respect your position and your passion for this subject, your comments here, and those of your blog readers can't overcome the fact that this term fails <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I wish you well personally and if your term does become legitimately verifiable as per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> in the future (or additional citations are posted here), I will gladly support the inclusion of this term in the encyclopedia.

<li>See my comment above on the BW article. The article is not about "Enterprise 2.0" but about "Web 2.0".

<li>The entire BW article is on Enterprise 2.0. It is important to understand (and I think people would if we spent the same energy on the article as this discussion) that this trend began with adapting Web 2.0 design principles and technology to an enterprise context. But remember that social software preceeded it and there are new discoveries in an organizational context.

<li><b>COMMENT</b> Rossmay...you didn't read the BW article at all. The ONLY two times Enterprise 2.0 is mentioned is the ones pointed out. The title of the article is <i>Web 2.0 Has Corporate America Spinning</i>. NOT <i>Enterprise 2.0 Has Corporate America Spinning</i>.</li>
<li>Well, you have proven you have read the article, and have imagination. But sincerely, I appreciate you taking up the other side of the argument, someone has to. In this case, however, the MIT Sloan Management Review, BusinessWeek and Don Tapscott/Wikinomics stand to verify. Personally, but let's not make it personal, I have read all three. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossmay_7dcd.html" title="User:Rossmay">Rossmay</a> 05:58, 26 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Rossmay, I need to point out that the Sloan Management Review article was written by the author of this term (Hence it is the primary source). Secondary sources are what are being sought here. Multiple, independent (of the original author/person that coined the term), Reliable, non-trivial, third-party sources are what matters. The business week article is about Web 2.0...not enterprise 2.0 and renders the article as a 'trival source' as stated many times already...that's wikipedia policy. The article has to be about (in title and body) the term in question (enterprise 2.0). It must be a full-lengthed featured article...not a sentence or two of an article hence the business week article fails to provide <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The Don Tapscott/Wikinomics....article? Blog? I am not sure, you didn't source/link it so I can't say, but even so, is the article 100% about the term? So, no....at this point the article is failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>--<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 06:14, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bschott...Again, what I think we are dealing with is a grasp of the subject matter. And getting a commun understanding of what is a <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_source_593b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable source">reliable source</a>. Mainstream media needs to relate new, but important, concepts through framing. The BW article leads by framing the subject with Web 2.0. Why? Because they had written about it before and it helps contextualize for readers. Unlike a daily newspaper that leads with the who, what, when, why and sometimes how, the genre of a weekly needs to build a story. But the topic of the BW article is the same as this Article. All that said, I wonder why we are debating the title (of the Article, not the BW source, let's say). Some topics are defined by headlines (e.g. <a href="../../../d/-/d/D-day.html" title="D-day">D-day</a>), some are not so trivial. The original deletion was based on Neologism, which in my mind has been refuted. Does the reference to Enterprise 2.0 in the BW article not equate to a citation if you give the publication credibility? I'm happy to debate verfifyability, because, well, it is a good chance to test it. But isn't the argument about the topic of the article, not the title? At this point, I will have to ask other contributors to give their opinion of the subject of the BW article. The Tapscott quote and the logical tie to the book he is working on may require the opinions of other logicians. But I will say that if he thinks it is the biggest business trend today, he would probably be writing about it in a book that the website says is about the same tools and enterprise context. Back to common understanding. Fair reading outside of Wikipedia is required to get us there, but what is not here is obviously holding us back. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossmay_7dcd.html" title="User:Rossmay">Rossmay</a> 07:47, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Brian brings up a good point, which is that the concept of the use of Web 2.0 technologies behind the firewall goes by a couple different names, of which 'Enterprise 2.0' is the dominant one. Dion Hinchcliffe, for example, calls it 'Enterprise Web 2.0' We should acknowledge this in the entry (assuming, of course, that the entry persists). The entry is about the concept, and the concept is captured by other terms in addition to 'Enterprise 2.0.'Amcafee 21:06, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> NO Rossmay. You are very well aware that wikipedia can not be self-referencing. Those blogs are about the AfD, and as such are voided as sources. The reference Wikipedia, which makes them invaild. Google News has their own criteria, and Wikipedia has theirs. I don't want to get personal, but it feels like you are grasping at straws here. And you mentioned a book that was due out but hasn't been published as a source? No, that isn't allowed either, though after the book is published AND has notability, then it could be sourced. Since quotations or sentances in an article is trivial coverage. Period. Blogs mentioning the AfD or Wikipedia are self-referencing and voided as sources. Period. Journals that the general public can not easily access are not valid sources. Period. That is wikipedia policy. --<a href="../../../b/s/c/User%7EBschott_97e6.html" title="User:Bschott"><font color="purple">Brian</font></a> <sup>(<a href="../../../b/s/c/User_talk%7EBschott_b59f.html" title="User talk:Bschott"><font color="orange">How am I doing?</font></a>)</sup> 18:10, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Actually Rossmay, I think Brian is saying he *doesn't* see the blogs as reliable sources. I don't take as hard a line on blogs as Brian appears to, but in general Blogs are very weak sources with regards to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. His comment on the Hinchcliffe article being highly self-referential to Wikipedia is valid. Also, the other blog post you include (Farber) is about Web 2.0, not Enterprise 2.0 (Enterprise 2.0 gets only a trivial mention), and so it is a trivial mention in a weak source. This type of reference isn't going to get the article over the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> hurdle. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 01:41, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> It seems to me that the schoolyard bullies are having just a bit too much fun with those of us who believe Enterprise 2.0 (the organizational and management impact of social media within large organizations) or Enterprise Web 2.0 (the new forms of collaborative software that enable the "emergence" (talk about neologisms) of new and still unknown organizational and management patterns and behaviors)is important and that the best idea may be to make a strategic retreat, get those peer reviewed articles and sources (and almost certainly a couple of new books) together, and come back in six months to a year with an overwhelming argument. Pointing out the obvious, which is that many, perhaps most, Wikipedia articles are neologisms and that that there are an awful lot of Wikipedia pages devoted to crappy little open source software apps that no longer exist, is not going to do it. 162.83.219.72 04:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)Jerry Bowles 162.83.219.72 04:08, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment: Getting past the Neologism.</b> It seems a lot of the debate here centers around the silly neologism 'Enterprise 2.0.' So let me presume to speak for the advocates of this WP entry (fellow advocates, if I misrepresent your position at all, please correct): this is not intended to be an entry about a neologism, but instead about a development -- the appearance of something new and noteworthy. 'Global warming' and 'citizen journalism,' for example, are other developments, both of which have excellent WP entries. Both of these terms are also neologisms, but their WP entries spend no time on the terms' etymologies. Instead, the entries treat the neologisms much as they are treated in the everyday world -- as shorthand for the development. And because encyclopedia entries need titles, the entry's title in each case <i>is</i> the neologism.</li>
</ul>
<p>The development we want to build a WP entry about is the use of a novel set of communication and collaboration technologies within organizations, i.e. within the Intranet as opposed to across the Internet.</p>

<p>In addition, Wikipedia's parent foundation found the development notable enough to include it as <a href="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:KL1" class="external text" title="http://wikimania2006.wikimedia.org/wiki/Proceedings:KL1" rel="nofollow">part of the 2006 Wikimania conference.</a></p>
<p>Most of these references do not use the neologism 'Enterprise 2.0,' but they are all about the development for which the term is a shorthand -- the development we'd like to build a WP entry about. I can find no WP policy or guideline stating that every reference for an entry must contain the same words as the entry's title, and it's not hard to find entries where this is not the case. The following, for example, are references included in WP's entry on citizen journalism that do not use the neologism 'citizen journalism.' <a href="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1060217106.php" class="external free" title="http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1060217106.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ojr.org/ojr/workplace/1060217106.php</a> <a href="http://www.cpn.org/topics/communication/civicjourn.html" class="external free" title="http://www.cpn.org/topics/communication/civicjourn.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpn.org/topics/communication/civicjourn.html</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/010705.html" class="external free" title="http://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/010705.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/010705.html</a> <a href="http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php" class="external free" title="http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hypergene.net/wemedia/weblog.php</a></p>
<p>We want to build at WP entry about this development for the same reasons that the reporters, editors, academics, and researchers referenced above devoted their energy to their publications: we think the development is important and noteworthy enough to merit our attention and effort, and we'd like to inform a larger audience about it (For whatever it's worth, a number of entrepreneurs, executives, analysts, financiers, and bloggers apparently concur.). We also think it's distinctive enough to not be subsumed into a broader entry, just as WP's 'citizen journalism' entry is not subsumed into 'journalism,' and 'global warming' is not subsumed into 'climate change.'</p>
<p>This entry needs a title. We've been using 'Enterprise 2.0' to date because that neologism has become the most frequently-used shorthand for the development. People may or may not like the neologism (I'm coming to wish I'd chosen a different one), but what does everyone think of the development? Are its advocates right or wrong in thinking it's an appropriate subject for a WP entry?Amcafee 19:21, 27 August 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>If the issue is that there are developments and trends in the Web 2.0 space regarding the ideas you are referring to, but that the term "Enterprise 2.0" itself just hasn't caught on widely enough yet to pass <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, then it sounds like the content you are describing could very well fit in Wikipedia as a sub-heading of an existing article (perhaps the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_computing.html" title="Social computing">Social computing</a> articles might be good homes for this content?). <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 22:00, 27 August 2006 (UTC)

Is it your position that the use-of-brand-new-collaboration-and-communication-technologies-within-organizations development we're interested in fails to meet one or more criteria for inclusion as a <i>stand-alone</i> entry within WP?

<li>Thanks for asking. I don't really have a position on whether "the use-of-brand-new-collaboration-and-communication-technologies-within-organizations development" is worthy of its own article or not. My guess is that it might be, and certainly the topic is interesting and ripe for study / discussion. My issue is that putting an article on this topic with the title "Enterprise 2.0" isn't appropriate at this time because the term itself doesn't pass Wikipedia's standards of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>. That's what this whole AFD discussion is about -- not whether the concept is valid or not, but whether there should be an article in WP with the title "Enterprise 2.0". My own personal guess is that the concept could benefit from an article, although I'm not sure whether that's the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> article, the <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_computing.html" title="Social computing">Social computing</a> article, some other existing article or a brand new</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Amcafee is right. For better or worse, Enterprise 2.0 has become the buzzword, or neologism, if you insist, to describe the convergence or collision of a new breed of widely available and deployed participative, social networking technologies (those things we call Web 2.0) with traditional hierarchical organizational dynamics. No one yet knows exactly what this will produce in the long run or even if it's a good or bad thing. It is, however, an incredibly BIG thing and one with enormous implications in the world of business which is one of key building blocks of civilizaton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you won't find a lot of published references in dead tree media about Enterprise 2.0 yet. It still takes a year or so to get a book published and scholarly articles take months to be vetted and published. (I would point out that the words "Web 2.0" "Ajax" and "podcasting" did not even appear in the 2005 Gartner Hype Cycle report, published only a little over a year ago. Obviously, they are all over the 2006 report.)</p>
<p>Enterprise 2.0 is not an isolated concept that came out of nowhere. There is a long and rich intellectual trail of work done on participation and collaboration within large organizations before the advent of these new technologies and these are part of the evolving Enterprise 2.0 story. For example, consider all the groundwork done on "communities of practice," which is also shorthand for research across many disciplines and has its own full and rich Wikipedia entry.</p>
<p>I refer you to such seminal works in CoP area as:</p>
<p>Wenger E, Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity, Cambridge University Press, 1998. Wenger, E, McDermott, R &amp; Snyder, W.M., Cultivating Communities of Practice, HBS press 2002. Saint-Onge, H &amp; Wallace, D, Leveraging Communities of Practice, Butterworth Heinemann, 2003.</p>
<p>In the field of social networking, which is also part of the E2 story, see this example which available online:</p>
<p>Hanneman, Robert A. and Mark Riddle. 2005. Introduction to social network methods. Riverside, CA: University of California, Riverside published in digital form at <a href="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/" class="external free" title="http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/</a></p>
<p>Enterprise 2.0, as shorthand for the collision of participative technologies with hierarchical organizational dynamics, also encompasses scientific notions like complexity and emgergence. See, for example, Paul B. Hartzog of the IGERT Fellow Center for the Study of Complex Systems who writes:</p>
<p>"Technologies that allow us to work together in new ways make possible an era of “do it yourself” cooperation. That means people being able to help each other without relying on hierarchies do things for them. These anarchical networks are best understood within the framework of complex adaptive systems.</p>
<p>"So, this means we have to study new phenomena like open source, wiki, and social software, but it also means that we have to look back to the roots of civilization: tribes, gift economies, communities, and political theory."</p>
<p>Enterprise 2.0 is an important concept that is going to go away simply because it does or does not meet the Wikipedia gatekeepers' criteria for inclusion at this time. It represents the most important and potentially disruptive business challenge since the advent of modern management.162.83.218.25 22:58, 27 August 2006 (UTC)Jerry Bowles</p>
<ul>
<li>Uhh, ok, but I think you misunderstand the purpose of this entire discussion. A Wikipedia AFD discussion isn't about whether the concept is going to re-write the history of humankind or be the next greatest thing for business since sliced bread or whatever. The only question at hand here is whether there should be an article on Wikipedia with the title "Enterprise 2.0". There are guidelines for establishing whether or not such an article should exist, one of the most of important of which is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This question here is most crucially related to the *term* "Enterprise 2.0", not the various <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> innovations, concepts and techologies. As a tertiary source of information, Wikipedia will always be a bit "behind the times" when new neologisms appear. Wikipedia's purpose is not to be the proving ground for new terminology, represent the "cutting edge" of research, or any other purpose. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, period. (See here: <a href="../../../p/o/l/WP%7EPolicy_4cef.html#Key_policies" title="WP:Policy">WP:Policy#Key policies</a>, point number one). Personally, I think the concept of the various technologies involved in these concepts are exciting and interesting, but that doesn't mean that the "Enterprise 2.0" term meets <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> at this time. That's why I suggested to Professor McAfee above that perhaps for now the <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a> and/or <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_computing.html" title="Social computing">Social computing</a> articles are better places for this content. If the "Enterprise 2.0" term catches on in the next six months or year or so, such that there are solid third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> regarding the term and its application to these technologies, then the term will pass the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> criteria and an article under this heading will be appropriate. But for now, there aren't third-party reliable sources, and the verifiability hurdle can't be reached, and as such the article should be deleted from WP. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 02:08, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

My comment above obviously made you feel the need to strike out at me (in anger, frustration, or some such), and for that I apologize. I hope that your experience here on this AFD discussion is not wholly negative, and in fact motivates you to learn more about Wikipedia and become a regular contributor so that you can more effectively make your case on AFD's and in other areas as well.

<li><b>Include under Web 2.0 for now</b> As a somewhat interested party, in that a post on my blog (<a href="http://www.scalefree.info/2006/03/list_of_tools_f.html" class="external free" title="http://www.scalefree.info/2006/03/list_of_tools_f.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scalefree.info/2006/03/list_of_tools_f.html</a>) is referenced in the current article, my thoughts are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Enterprise 2.0 is a useful term that acts a shorthand description for a number of technolgies and behaviours that are referenced to externally as Web 2.0. There are sufficient differences in how people operate inside a company and outside to make the distinction a useful one, and I think once more articles, book chapters and papers are published, specifically talking about Enterprise 2.0, then it will merit an entry. For now though, why not include it in the Web 2.0 (or social computing) article&#160;? Could it not have an explicit 'Enterprise 2.0' heading within that article which could then be moved out once the term becomes more broadly known and accepted&#160;? Anu.gupta 10:41, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> While I believe there are robust arguments for keeping the article, if the outcome of this conversation is moving it to a section of Web 2.0, this should only be done if we can define a criteria for moving it back to Enterprise 2.0. For example, when there is one more academic or mainstream media source (but also acknowledging in advance that a well researched source may very well refer to this article). Including this article within Web 2.0 seems to be desired by some, if for no other reason there is a title-to-title match, but the roots of Enterprise 2.0 are less Web 2.0 than Social Software. I would also suggest fragmenting this collaboration across such topics as <a href="../../../w/e/b/Web_2.0.html" title="Web 2.0">Web 2.0</a>, <a href="../../../s/o/c/Social_Software_19ae.html" title="Social Software">Social Software</a>, Social Computing and <a href="../../../e/n/t/Enterprise_Software_8742.html" title="Enterprise Software">Enterprise Software</a> would be a mistake, and to the detriment of the quantity and quality of contributions. Structurally, all four of these articles would be better off linking in reference to Enterprise 2.0. <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossmay_7dcd.html" title="User:Rossmay">Rossmay</a> 14:48, 28 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Include under Web 2.0 for now - Agree</b> Inspite of many mentions, "Enterprise 2.0" seems to be in an echo chamber of a few blogs and one academic paper. I agree with many people on this discussion that there is a new and emergent use of social technologies within the enterprise, but I see no consensus that Enterprise 2.0 is the term of choice used by everyone. Even if this article is moved into Web 2.0, I expect that there will be an even livelier debate with proponents of other terms. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingsleyj_cf7c.html" title="User:Kingsleyj">Kingsley2.com</a> 06:55, 29 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> - As a parallel, we might want to consider the treatment of the term 'knowledge management' in WP. This is arguably a broadly defined term, even among management academics studying organization. Nevertheless, there seems to be a robust and well structured page for the term. It seems to me that 'Enterprise 2.0' should be treated similarly. rhuckman
<ul>
<li>(Note above comment is from yet another editor who has never before edited WP prior to this AFD). The difference between the terms is the plethora of third-party <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> available on the term "Knowledge Management". Even though it is broadly defined, the use of the term is well-documented by third-party sources and thus is <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. "Enterprise 2.0" is not. <a href="../../../f/a/i/User%7EFairsing_4fac.html" title="User:Fairsing">Fairsing</a> 23:30, 29 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the one who placed this article. Win or lose here, this whole review process is really impressive. I'd really like to make this work as an acceptable article, so your input would be valued. I'm finishing up a graduate degree so I understand the significance of referencing and actually what you said is very true apparently, much of the content on the internet about us has actually originated from us! Aerials Express may appear as an NN but it quietly provides the basis for many cartographic and Geographic Information Systems in both the private and government sectors. Foundations aren't always highly visible or necessarily sexy. For instance, we provided the USGS with extensive aerial imagery for New York incase the recent Atlantic hurricane (now headed towards Iceland) actually hits the Eastern Seaboard. High profile no, significant sure. Aerials Express is important in terms cultural and technological innovation. Whether its ViewGL for Google Earth or providing the aerial imagery for Yahoo maps, people are integrating (our)aerial photography into their subconsious and daily practices. Just a few years ago, these same systems only provided vector data maps but now with advances in data storage and bandwidth, viewing aerial photo is now an option. Aerials Express not only provides a foundation but it also represents a cultural shift of how we view the world. With this in mind, I'd appreciate some feedback on how I could keep Aerials Express an article while respecting the principles of Wikipedia. Thank you.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> and <b>Strong Cleanup</b> mostly because it's at the very least well referenced (at least one reference even has "Durban Strategy" in the title). However, the text needs to conform to NPOV and simply report on the research it's based on, not state that the strategy absolutely exists. Wikipedia doesn't state that anything is true, it asserts that X source has proposed the opinion that Y is true -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarkeer_0d07.html" title="User:Markeer">Markeer</a> 01:44, 25 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> and I did some cleanup. The Durban conference already has <a href="../../../d/u/r/Durban_declaration.html" title="Durban declaration">it's own article</a>. It needs more work however, but since this also links with <a href="../../../z/i/o/Zionism_and_racism.html" title="Zionism and racism">Zionism and racism</a> and there is quite a few sources out there, I believe it is worthy to stay around. <a href="../../../m/c/e/User%7EMceder_5657.html" title="User:Mceder">Mceder</a> 12:28, 25 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Oh what controversy we have stepped into. If it is true that there is a "Durban Strategy" it long predates the Durban conference; remember the "Zionism is racism" resolution? <a href="../../../a/l/l/User%7EAllon_Fambrizzi_8070.html" title="User:Allon Fambrizzi">Allon Fambrizzi</a>Allon Fambrizzi
<ul>
<li>I think that we can steer clear of becoming embroiled in the controversy. Wikipedia isn't an arbiter of whether it is true, and the question here, as per the nomination, is whether this article is capable of addressing the controversy from a NPOV. My opinion is that it is really the title that is problematic. Although we can certainly discuss the idea of a Durban Strategy that some commentators have propounded, we should do it within the context of a larger article that discusses the 2001 WCAR conference as a whole, and the reactions of all sides to the events therein. Merging and renaming solves this, though. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 00:24, 26 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
