<p>Above, JFW wrote that "even Slifkin probably shoudn't have a page." Why not? This controversy is shaking the Orthodox world, and may even reinforce both a sociological split and have huge theological repercussions for the entire idea of rabbinic authority in Orthodoxy.

<dd>Dovi, there is something called vanity and non-notable, this exists in this situation to try to argue against it by saying that it is because of his stance on chabad is avoiding the issue and an attempt to change the subject.

<p>The book is not just "controversial." It is at the center of a world-wide controversy. A Cherem of the type that happened here is not unusual at all, by the way. What is different is that <b>this</b> cherem was followed by an internet rebellion, one that included the active participation of rabbis and scholars from around the world! This has <b>never happened before</b>, it is of extreme historical interest, and yes, Eliezer, it is of extraordinary importance.</p>
<p>Of course, Jayjg, I agree that the case should be decided on its own merits. But the fact that that has <b>not</b> happened on this page is a cause for concern. Wikipedia has the stats on every mediocre athlete in the country, and they are not deleted as "vanity" pages.</p>
<p>Eliezer, I would like to point out to you that I am <b>not</b> a big fan of Gil Student, and in fact his extreme views on Chabad are part of what I oppose. But there is no denying that he has played an important role in extremely important events recently. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 08:29, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This page is listed for deletion as a vanity page. However, it meets none of the requirements for a vanity page:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous. There is presently no consensus about what degree of recognition is required for a page to be included in Wikipedia (although consensus exists regarding particular kinds of article, for instance see WP:MUSIC). Lack of fame is not the same as vanity.</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, an article is not "vanity" simply because it was written by its subject. Articles about existing books, movies, games, and businesses are not "vanity" so long as the content is kept to salient material and not overtly promotional.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article as it stands is salient and not promotional. Even if Gil Student wrote the page (which he apparently did not) it would not be a candidate for deletion.</p>
<p>In fact - and this is cute! - even if Gil S. himself thinks he is not noteworthy enough for a page (as Jayjg wrote above), that is not reason for deletion&#160;:-)!</p>
<p>Since there are no "vanity page" grounds for removal in terms of policy, I move that we dismiss this whole motion. It is not even worthy of a vote. <a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 08:53, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Dovi, this isn't how wikipedia works, you get a chance to vote which you have, and so does everyone else.

<p>It could be that some people really weren't fully aware of the events going on that Student was involved in, or of why they are so important. I dare say that no one would consider deleting information about actors in a controversy of similar importance regarding another religious or policial issue. The article as it currently stands is quite clearly not "vanity" and is quite notable. If fact, more articles should be added on the topic, including <a href="../../../n/o/s/Nosson_Slifkin_f8ca.html" title="Nosson Slifkin">Nosson Slifkin</a> and cleaning of <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_creationism.html" title="Jewish creationism">Jewish creationism</a> (though this controversy goes well beyond general <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_creationism.html" title="Jewish creationism">Jewish creationism</a> in its importance).

<dd>First of all, their readership is huge now, precisely because of what the article described. They are having a publishing boom. Second of all, I respectfully disagree with the notion that publishing banned books in general is not of notable interest. Actually, it is of great interest to many (witness the "Banned books" section at the "Online Books Page"). Even JFW was hesitant ("may not"), because this really goes against all intuition. Thirdly, this banning controversy, especially because of the immediate and publically defended reissue, goes well beyond a general <i>cherem</i> of the Rav Shach or Rav Elyashiv type.<a href="../../../d/o/v/User%7EDovi_943a.html" title="User:Dovi">Dovi</a> 11:08, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Yes, and therefore I see nothing wrong with a page for <a href="../../../s/o/b/SoBe_5597.html" title="SoBe">SoBe</a> <i>in toto</i> (although it could use some de-hyping). However, we <i>don't</i> need a carefully wikified transcription of the ingredients list and nutritional information for each individual product they make, nor - for instance - do we need to be told that a serving is 8 ounces, and that there are 2.5 servings in each 20-ounce can. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonflySixtyseven_c6ee.html" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">DS</a> 15:59, 25 Apr 2004 (UTC)</li>

<li>Modify. I agree with Everyking above. An article that better contextualizes the relative place of the popular SoBe beverage in today's society, and that is less concerned with the arcane list of ingredients might be more helpful to the typical Wikipedian. <a href="../../../s/c/o/User%7EScottperry_5cbd.html" title="User:Scottperry">Scott P.</a> 17:55, Apr 25, 2004 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Say someone could write another paragraph or two on the drink, and then added in the ingredient list and nutrition info after that. Would that be acceptable?

If recipes are not allowed, which have <i>some</i> practical use as they allow you to produce the dish being described, then lists of ingredients from labels of commercial products are far worse.

<li>Keep. Useful info, perhaps marginal, but good for the 'pedia. I would agree with Everyking and suggest that more be written besides simply the ingredients and nutrition facts.

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see why just being a CEO of something relatively important makes you automatically notable enough for an encyclopedia.

<li>A good point. This could well end up as a pointless stub. Why people submit stubs when it would take little effort to make a reasonable article is beyond me.

<li>Delete: We shouldn't have articles on schools of 500, either. The question is whether the person is well known enough and referred to enough to need a <i>biography.</i> The corporation she works for may be very important without making her, as a person, a proper subject of a biographical article. She could be very unique, as well, but it is a combination of remarkable qualities and fame that makes her a proper subject. She's borderline for the reasons Aaronhill mentions, but I lean toward folding a short version into the bank.

<li><b>Keep</b>. While I don't have a Wikipedia account, I am PokeDigiManiac, one of the contributors to the article, and I wanted to correct a few misapprehensions that the previous voters might have had. Directed to Joy Stovall, the site is not down currently; however, only registered members can access it, in order to protect from s and other malicious acts. Additionally, the reason that <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/cardboardia/" class="external text" title="http://www.livejournal.com/community/cardboardia/" rel="nofollow">this journal</a> seems to reflect it being down most often is because, as mentioned in the article itself, it generally only sees use when the site is down. This can be noted by looking at the dates of posts in said journal - they all cluster around certain dates or short periods of time where the site was experiencing difficulty. In terms of notability, I agree that it is a very difficult thing to establish. However, I will state that the message board currently has 580 members. Beyond that, I leave it to you to judge. Additionally, in response to the charges of self-aggrandizement, said urbandictionary article (The link was incorrectly posted; however, I have now found the article that I believe Fernando Rizo was referencing <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cardboardia" class="external text" title="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cardboardia" rel="nofollow">here</a>) was created by two personally motivated members, and should not be taken as a representation of Cardboardia as a whole. This article under question on Wikipedia is an attempt to gather as much information as possible and form it into a clear and detailed explanation of just what inspires over five hundred people to form a community that has lasted over two years (a rarity on the Internet). In any case, thank you for your fair considerations. 68.7.209.76 4 July 2005 06:25 (UTC) — <i>(68.7.209.76's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.7.209.76_cad2.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.7.209.76">11th</a> edit.)</i></li>
<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> Seeing that this whole nomination for a deletion was because someone found The Live Journal Site, I wish to set something straight. The LiveJournal account for Cardboardia is a system used by the administrators to alert the Cardboardian Members of any problems with Cardboardia. For example, if Cardboardia suddenly went down without any notice, Members would post their worrys and the Administrators would be able to alert the members of the problem. Now, I also notice that people seem to think this is 'not notable enough' to be on wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>: I wish to know what your ideas of 'not notable ennough' are. Not notable to you?

<li><b>Keep</b> (Note, after reading the guidelines under votes for deletion I wish to point out that I am the Guesty Type Personification that authored half the article from my school's IP address of 203.87.121.161. This statement is not designed to call myself an authority on the subject or of the site, it is merely to avoid being called a sockpuppet) This site's guidelines for what constitutes a vanity article state 'An article should not be dismissed as "vanity" simply because the subject is not famous.' therefore google hits and alexa rankings seem irrelevant in this case. The aforementioned Urban Dictionary post seems to be a purely promotional entry by two overenthusiastic members out of approximately 600 and should not be taken as an example of all of us. The article itself is more informative than advertising. As Urban Dictionary has to guidelines as to self promotion that are readily enforced or advertised, posters feel free to enter whatever they feel and as such I would propose that the urban dictionary entry is irrelevant to this case. Considering the fact that the guidelines of Wikipedia state that a lack of fame is not indicative of a vanity article I would consider this article within the guidelines as the article states information but apart from some in-jokes meant purely sarcastically or as easter eggs for those members who would read this it is not saying whether the site is good or bad, merely describing the facts of its existance and history.--Guesty Type Personification 4 July 2005 18:04 (+9.5GMT) — <i>(Moff's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Moff_f8c0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Moff">8th</a> edit.)</i></li>

<li><b>Comment</b> There is no 'Wikipedia is not a webdictionary' section so I assume that you mean Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Under that guideline, Wikipedia negates entries that are dictionary definitions, Lists of such definitions or usage, slang or idiom guides. This entry fits none of those criteria. The point about various other sites with more than 600 members not having entries is superfluous. Unless you can site examples where a site in our situation has tried to get an article on Wikipedia and been <i>rejected</i>, the point does not count.--Moff

<li><b>Keep</b> Okay, this is Hika, Supreme Ruler of the Universe and Admin of Cardboardia. While, obviously, I kind of am biased, I vote to Keep the Cardboardia article. For one thing, Cardboardia isn't just some stupid little message board. Okay, yeah, we have a measley 600 members, and we're not "notable" because we don't turn up enough hits on Google, or whatever. But among it's members, Cardboardia has evolved into it's own little culture - and while that culture might not even be on the radar for most, for its members, Cardboardia's a freakin' way of life. Where else can a topic that merely states the time of day turn into a thread about boobs, and most recently, pajamas? We have Wars (Podima Wars I, II, III, IV, V, that one war VZG had against the sun, the Darkeru war that got covered up...), invasions, marriages, children (so many children!), and HOLIDAYS. Holy hell, we have "national" holidays. Not only that, but through SEVERAL bouts of extreme drama, including a majorly bad , a fight between myself and Keru, several of the older members up and leaving, and personal dramas of its members, Cardboardia has held through for almost three years (the original Pub having been started in August 2002). And while all of this certaintly doesn't make Cardboardia bigger or more notable, it does make it extremely UNIQUE. All of us Cardboardians are a family (through the several marriages and, y'know, figuratively speaking). There's a little thread that holds all of us together, and it will for the rest of our lives. Cardboardia's a big thing for most of us, and even though I know I won't be around Cardboardia forever, chances are I'm not going to forget it. It's almost like one of those shows/books/movies where kids find a portal to some totally awesome dimension - a world all their own. To us, it's like that. And really, you can't call this whole thing "shameless self promotion" - most Cardboardians, and ESPECIALLY ME, tend to be suspicious of "newbies." In fact, if no one ever came to the board again except those that existed already, I'd be perfectly happy. Who wants new blood when you got a great group of people already? No, we aren't looking to pimp Cardboardia... at least, not to get us tons of new members. We just want an article on Wikipedia. Is that so much to ask? — <i>(Unsigned comment by Hika; user's <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Hika_001c.html" title="Special:Contributions/Hika">1st</a> edit.)</i>

<li><b>Comment</b> The 'ruthless edit' has completely foregone the point of the article. It was about the culture and history of the people, not the layout of the board. We don't need to read an article on board layout, we wrote it to put our culture there, the stuff that has been left after said edit completely misses the point and makes the article look like a vanity page moreso than what our original article was. I agree the fictional history might not belong on Wikipedia but the rest of history, the rest of culture should not have been deleted.

<li>I agree that it wasn't my most nuanced bit of editing. But count the votes here, Cardboardians - this page is about to be deleted unless it changes drastically.

<li><b>Keep</b> It's an interesting article on a very unique topic. Furthermore, I know of several TOWNS that are less notable than this website.

<li><b>Comment</b> I was going to stay out of this one, but I can't pass <b>that</b> up. A town is a physical object and will persist even if everyone who lived there gots up and walked away. It has a continued presence seperate from it's population. Thus a <i>town</i> of five hundred in much more notable than a <i>messageboard</i> of five hundred. and I would vote to delete a town of that size that was in no other way notable without a second thought. Because, "what harm can it do" misses some important points:
<ul>
<li>Noise will chase out signal. Every <s>junk</s> trivial article takes up space on search results pages, editor's time, and even an almost (but not quite) insignificant space on a disk. This is an <i>encyplopedia</i>, and should function as such.</li>

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> It is of my strongest belief that you should keep this page because it is not a vanity page. A vanity page would be something like, "LOOKATME! I'MWONDERFUL! JOINORDIE, plzkthxbai!" And you say that we use "meatpuppetry" to try and save our article. We don't need "meatpuppetry". What kind of Cardboardians would we be if we did not try and defend ourselves? We Cardboardians are trying to share our culture and history with the rest of the world, and we cannot even begin to if the article is deleted. Many of the people who have said "delete" do not even know what Cardboardia is truly like. And many, I'm sure, have said "delete" because of what 'evidence' that previous people have given. It sickens me to see the world in such a state that those who try to share their messageboard's unique atmosphere with other people cannot. I implore you to keep the article.

<li>It's only notable attribute appears to be its age, although the article is interesting enough. The issue of contributions to Professional astronomy is irrelevant, though, as it's contributing to public education. Still the telescope is pretty puny. I'm going to pass. — <a href="../../../r/j/h/User%7ERJHall_ff1f.html" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> 4 July 2005 19:55 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Well in my opinion the telescope isn't anywhere near as relevant as its historical significance. The observatory is noteworthy because:
<ul>
<li>it was established by an astronomer who was very well-known in Wellington and New Zealand at the time,</li>
<li>it was used a lot by William Pickering (who went on to run JPL through its pioneering unmanned space missions) while growing up, and he's stated in the past that the facility really strengthened his interest in space and astronomy,</li>
<li>it's still operating and relevant in Wellington today, and there are things to write about it. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 4 July 2005 20:10 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - Maybe the problem is that the Astronomical observatories category is unclear about whether it's supposed to be for research observatories or not. Gifford's not worth noting for any recent serious academic contribution to astronomical research, so perhaps it shouldn't be listed there, or the category should be reorganised. It's a significant structure for a heap of other reasons, though, and deleting the page entirely is just wrong. <a href="../../../i/z/o/User%7EIzogi_2699.html" title="User:Izogi">Izogi</a> 7 July 2005 01:19 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>This article (Jolly Fun Pack) is currently under attack by many prominent members of Wikipedia.</b></p>
Although the Jolly Fun Pack's roots are obscure, (Who knows of Charlotte, VT, where the first Jolly Fun Pack was created?) this article is not vandalism! For some reason, prominent members temporarily block me from editing pages for my contribution, as they probably will for making this text blurb here. Well this one is for all those who keep nagging me and calling me a "vandal": I'm trying to contribute, not vandalize! My intentions are the same as yours! To convey correct, conscise information to the general public! Why do you persecute me for that? You can block me from editing pages for putting this text blurb here but it will only be a lasting mark on your conscience! You will have shut up an innocent member of Wikipedia! Somebody tell me! Why is this vandalism? Why do I get punished for my contributions? If that's the way this whole "free encyclopedia" is, then it should be erased immediately because it's not free. My voice has been deleted from this encyclopedia many times! Where's the freedom in that? Exactly. There is none! There's not enough justice and peace in the world today, and we don't need people creating more problems in Wikipedia by banning someone when he tries to contribute! Block me if you must, see what I care! You are only injuring your own clean conscience! You can silence me through blocking but this message will have already been received by thousands, maybe even millions of people across the world. If I get blocked, they will turn away form you administrators because they know my plea! Someone tell me what I need to do to make this not portrayed as "vandalism"! Let justice prevail in Wikipedia! That will be all.</div>

<p>all of which I'm proposing for <b>deletion</b>. I only put the {{subst:vfd}} tag on the first one, because doing it 27 more times was too painful (and seemed rather pointless).</p>
<p>This is a huge list of terms imported from a thesaurus found on an NIH web site. They appear to be keywords culled from research grant applications. The problems are several. The vast majority don't link to anywhere. Many of the concepts have corresponding articles, but not under those exact names. It appears that the source is updated <i>weekly</i>, which means this list is out of date almost immediately. This is a mindless import of data, with no added encyclopedic value. See <a href="../../../l/i/s/Talk%7EList_of_biomedical_terms_002e.html" title="Talk:List of biomedical terms">Talk:List of biomedical terms</a> for more info.</p>
<p>This was on VfD recently in a <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_List_of_biomedical_topics%2C_A_to_E_a9c5.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of biomedical topics, A to E">slightly different form</a>, and was voted to keep, but it appears to have been largely by default with little or no discussion and almost no voter input. I think it's worth another round, if only to build a strong consensus one way or the other.</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> all. I originally split these into the separate pages (original sizes were huge) but realised that they were worthless as I proceeded through the job.

Unless someone is willing to manually fix the links to the appropriate pages these lists will never be a useful indexing aid.

It says (in big friendly letters), <b>The main goal of this project is to ensure that Wikipedia has a corresponding article for every article in every other general purpose encyclopedia available</b>. That may be a laudable goal, but wholesale importation of this list isn't going to advance it. This isn't a list of somebody else's encyclopedia articles, it's a list of keywords from a database of research grants. It's not even clear that they came from a controlled vocabulary, such as <a href="../../../m/e/s/MeSH_c072.html" title="MeSH">MeSH</a>. What if somebody created List of every professional athelete who ever played in any sport? What about List of every license plate number ever issued in the US?

<dl>
<dd>You know what - you're right, and I should have done more research first. We should certainly be looking out for a medical encyclopedia, and looking to match its coverage, but this list isn't it. It's more than just keywords, if you look at <a href="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/Thesaurus/index.htm" class="external text" title="http://crisp.cit.nih.gov/Thesaurus/index.htm" rel="nofollow">CRISP</a>, but it is only a thesaurus, a controlled vocabulary. There are a huge number of terms in there that we <i>should</i> have articles for, but probably at least an equal number that we shouldn't, and there's no way (without specific knowledge of the topics, which I don't have) to tell which is which. Changing my vote to <b>delete</b>, unless anyone more knowledgeable wants to take it on. <a href="../../../o/p/e/User%7EOpenToppedBus_1b69.html" title="User:OpenToppedBus">OpenToppedBus</a> - <a href="../../../o/p/e/User_talk%7EOpenToppedBus_4569.html" title="User talk:OpenToppedBus">My Talk</a> July 5, 2005 15:29 (UTC)</dd>

<li>You can't do that! 'Garlic' and 'green tea' have well know medicinal properties. The 'greeks' have healthy food and 'grief' can be stressful leading to real medical issues.

<li>I mentioned this above but here it is again. They should definitely not be requested articles. Why invite people to create articles that will eventually become merged or redirected? Why don't we focus on the important gaps? There are already many requested article lists in wikipedia with some very important topics that need to be started. The difference is that those articles have been requested for a reason. This is just a random list.

<li><b>Keep</b> <s><b>Comment</b> I am very much in favour of the chess championship which is a semi-official wikipedia tournament. I think that is fine, and should definitely be encouraged. I didn't have a problem with the sandbox-games before, but it seems to be getting slightly out of hand. There are nine games going on right now. I am divided, on one hand it is like "what's the harm", but also if you use the wiki solely for playing these games, why not do it on wikicities? If you want to play a friendly game with another editor, fine, set it up in your user-space, but having a centralized place to play from, well..., as I said I'm divided. Ohh, and also, can we merge the three other VfDs into this one calling it Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sandbox games or something, it would be much more practical. <a href="../../../g/k/h/User%7EGkhan_3d68.html" title="User:Gkhan">gkhan</a> July 4, 2005 17:26 (UTC)</s>You know what, I change my mind.

I can see that it's fun and, of course, I don't object to a few people playing a game in their userspace or in the sandbox, but we shouldn't get to a point were the games interfere with the encyclopedia building (e.g. by making the site slower, complicating RC patrol because of higher volume of changes). If we are going to keep these games, these VfDs will become a precedent and it will become more difficult to limit the amount of "fun" pages that do not help the encyclopedia-building-aspect of Wikipedia.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. Some of the logic offered in connection with votes here and at the other game-related VFD's makes me wonder: If the purpose of Wikipedia is <i>only</i> to create an encyclopedia (which is the starting point for many votes) then could the following pages fall into the "not relevant to creating an encyclopedia, pulls too many resources, creates extra RC patrol work, and therefore must be deleted" category? <i>The entire <a href="../../../d/e/p/Wikipedia%7EDepartment_of_Fun_d4d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Department of Fun">Wikipedia:Department of Fun</a></i> for obvious reasons. <i><a href="../../../r/e/f/Wikipedia%7EReference_Desk_edf4.html" title="Wikipedia:Reference Desk">Wikipedia:Reference Desk</a></i> because they can look it up in the encyclopedia, or "go to another (reference desk) site". <i>All user pages</i> becasue it doesn't matter about the users, it's about the encyclopedia, and if they want to talk about themselves, they can do it at a private hosting site. <i>All user sandboxes</i> because they can draft it in the article space or go to an outside editing site. <i>Featured pictures/picture of the day</i> because pictures should be about articles and not about pictures on their own, and anyone who wants to look at random pictures "can go to another site." <i>The entire "Wikipedia:" namespace</i> because we're here to write articles, not to read policies. <i>Wikimania 2005</i> (deleted and cancelled) because if everyone stays home they can spend that time writing articles rather than socializing. <i>RfA</i> because we have enough admins, and voting for candidates takes time away from article writing, plus there has to be another Wikipedia-administrator electing site out there. <i>RfAr</i> because the time spent disciplining users should be spent writing articles, and if they want to discipline users, they can go to another Wikipedia-user disciplining site. <i>RfC</i> because if we spend all our time writing articles, then we won't have time to waste commenting. <i>Recent Changes</i> because RC-patrol time could better be spent writing articles. <b><i>How to donate money</i> because by the time we've deleted everything above, we won't need donations anymore, because the project will be dead.</b> -- <a href="../../../e/s/s/User%7EEssjay_c5fd.html" title="User:Essjay">Essjay</a> · <a href="../../../e/s/s/User_talk%7EEssjay_a39e.html" title="User talk:Essjay">Talk</a> July 6, 2005 05:09 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- The sandbox isn't an appropriate place for games of this type. All content in the sandbox should be routinely cleared and deleted, including subfolders, regardless of the content.

<li><b>Delete</b> or at least <b>move</b>: there is no way anything in the sandbox is supposed to last through a cleaning cycle, and this includes any sub-pages. If the <a href="../../../d/e/p/Wikipedia%7EDepartment_of_Fun_d4d4.html" title="Wikipedia:Department of Fun">Department of Fun</a> are so keen to keep it, they should justify moving it under their project and promise to police it to ensure it stays within sane limits.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Although I love the idea of wikipedians playing chess together, I think that it makes more sense to do this at Wikicities or somewhere similar. I feel faintly hypocritical about this, having had such fun with European Toilet Roll Holder but I do see a significant difference between the relatively short-lived building of a nihilartikel and the running of a continuing suite of games. My fundamental problem with this is its location. Would the participants feel aggrieved were this cleared as part of routine sanbox cleaning? I imagine so, and thus conclude that it is not appropriate for the sandbox. I would also have less of an issue with it were it possible to watch just recent changes to the main article space. —<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheoClarke_a891.html" title="User:TheoClarke">Theo</a> <a href="../../../t/h/e/User_talk%7ETheoClarke_5767.html" title="User talk:TheoClarke">(Talk)</a> 7 July 2005 07:56 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. The games section does absolutely no harm to the site. Statements that, "they make the site run slower and use bandwith" are full of it. Yes, every page takes some bandwith, but Wikipedia has about one new page every minute or two. So if you are going to claim that the pages make the site slower etc., then you need to realize that in making that statement you are also basically saying "Oh, let's remove the option to start new pages because they slow the site down and take up bandwith." Open your eyes, the site is growing, but does anyone ever make a large complaint about the site slowing down. Seven pages have been created since I began typing this, but I find no difference in the site speed, even on dial-up. So stop fooling yourselves. The games do not harm the project in any way. They are there for the benefit of the users who choose to use them. If you don't want to use them then don't, that's fine with me, but don't ruin other people's good times just because you don't see how it benefits you. Maybe it benefits them and allows a break from the pain it sometimes is to contribute and edit Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinman11_b86f.html" title="User:Martinman11">Hoekenheef</a> 7 July 2005 09:25 (UTC)</li>

<p>The Wikipedia community has expanded ever since its conception over three years ago, and we currently have hundreds of active members, each offering his/her contributions, building up the diversity and greatness in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>. With the growing usage of the site, though, tensions will inevitably amount. Tempers will flare, and edit wars will begin. Users with no other place to turn will vent their frustration on other <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a>.</p>
<p>While the above may be an "<a href="../../../a/r/m/Armageddon.html" title="Armageddon">Armageddon</a>" prediction, the truth is that <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> need places to relax and unwind. WikiChess, currently located in the sandbox, is one of the multiple sites for WikiFun. Incidentally, <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikifun_2ab9.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikifun">Wikifun</a> is an extremely popular game that has now drawn a plethora of attention, and multiple users are playing it as we speak. WikiChess serves a similar purpose to the many other Wikipedia pages which serve to entertain or challenge. <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">BJAODN</a> has kept hundreds of Wikipedians laughing for months; <a href="../../../w/f/_/WP%7EWF_0117.html" title="WP:WF">the WikiFun tournament</a> has frustrated- and amused- users for a long time, and X-treme deletion has lasted through its own x-treme VfD. What distinguishes WikiChess from the other entertainment and amusement pages?</p>
<p>Indeed, WikiChess is no different from WikiFun or the other entertainment pages. It serves to keep Wikipedians involved, and is a great place at the end of a long day of RC patrolling to meet with fellow Wikipedian chess enthusiasts. In fact, chess has been scientifically proven to stimulate the mind- allowing better editing and writing! Seriously, though, WikiChess has done no harm- there have been no recorded incidents or complaints that it impedes with normal Wikipedian editing and Wikipedia operations.</p>
<p>As to WikiChess being in the sandbox, it can- and should- be moved to a Wikipedia: page of its own soon. It has attained an honored status similar to that of WikiFun, and is deserving of its own nameplace, just like the many other Wikipedia: pages which serve to keep us amused.</p>
<p>To respond to the concern that WikiChess will draw more users who will only play chess: the more users, the better! We currently have a dire situation where most people who create an account do not stay long-term. Are we to chase away potential editors, writers, and <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikipedians_0c31.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Wikipedians</a> when they stumble onto our pages? Besides, there will be no influx of people who join Wikipedia solely for the chess- as argued in your letter above, there are much better gaming sites that offer free chess. People only interested in chess will ultimately end up in those sites.</p>
<p>Erik also makes an argument that once the games have developed, it will clutter up the RC patrolling. Will one move per game per day really make a huge difference? Do people not respond to the challenging questions at <a href="../../../w/f/_/WP%7EWF_0117.html" title="WP:WF">WikiFun</a>, and do people not add more nonsense to <a href="../../../b/j/a/WP%7EBJAODN_1a71.html" title="WP:BJAODN">BJAODN</a>? The extremely small number of edits to be performed would hardly make an impact, and personally, when I am RC patrolling, do not mind these edits. Besides, it certainly does not require much effort to look at the edited page and determine that it is a chess game.</p>
<p>In addition, the above letter also argues that the page clutters the Wikipedia: namespace and also will serve as a reflection of Wikipedia. One additional page will not clutter the namespace, and one page (out of over 600,000 articles alone) will not change the reflection of Wikipedia. Wikipedia is, was, and will be a free-content encyclopedia, albeit with policies, user pages, and other community-building pages.</p>
<p>Finally, I do share the concerns with Erik that there will be an abundance of new game pages. However, the matter at hand is the fate of WikiChess, and the other pages should not affect this vote. A new policy limiting the start of new pages, as proposed by Erik, should be a completely different debate irrelevant to this one.</p>
<p>Thus, I urge everyone to rook- oops, I mean keep- and save this noble WikiGame. Thank for taking the time out of your busy Wiki-Schedule to read this, and happy editing!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<li>The games section does absolutely no harm to the site. Statements that, "they make the site run slower and use bandwith" are full of it. Yes, every page takes some bandwith, but Wikipedia has about one new page every minute or two. So if you are going to claim that the pages make the site slower etc., then you need to realize that in making that statement you are also basically saying "Oh, let's remove the option to start new pages because they slow the site down and take up bandwith." Open your eyes, the site is growing, but does anyone ever make a large complaint about the site slowing down. Seven pages have been created since I began typing this, but I find no difference in the site speed, even on dial-up. So stop fooling yourselves. The games do not harm the project in any way. They are there for the benefit of the users who choose to use them. If you don't want to use them then don't, that's fine with me, but don't ruin other people's good times just because you don't see how it benefits you. Maybe it benefits them and allows a break from the pain it sometimes is to contribute and edit Wikipedia. -<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinman11_b86f.html" title="User:Martinman11">Hoekenheef</a> 7 July 2005 09:27 (UTC)

It is a nice way to relax after dealing with vandals, and stupid debates over a sentence in the entire article. That said, this is just a way to relax and its a SANDBOX. Perhaps we shouldn't have any SANDBOX then.&#160;:) There is the trivia game and other things as well. If anything this helps bring interest to wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/a/l/User%7EFalphin_2def.html" title="User:Falphin">Falphin</a> 8 July 2005 16:47 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. No vote on keep/delete, but it lends itself to confusion with the article on the circus act <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_cannonball.html" title="Human cannonball">Human cannonball</a>. If the album article is kept, it should be renamed <a href="../../../h/u/m/Human_Cannonball_%28album%29_0fb8.html" title="Human Cannonball (album)">Human Cannonball (album)</a>.

<li>I'm glad I'm not the only one who's wasted a lot of time on comic books, although this character came along after I'd stopped reading them.

<li><b>Comment</b>: If this were merged into <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Fish_bae8.html" title="School of Fish">School of Fish</a>, then it would also call for merging in their other album (<a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Fish_%28album%29_616e.html" title="School of Fish (album)">School of Fish (album)</a>) into the <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Fish_bae8.html" title="School of Fish">School of Fish</a> article. If one was to merge <i>that</i> one into <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Fish_bae8.html" title="School of Fish">School of Fish</a> as well, then that would make a really confusing article with two infoboxes. The albums should be kept seperate from the main article.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Problems with formatting are not a reason to <s>seperate</s> separate an article. Fourty or so extra lines can easily fit in the 'base' School Of Fish. Unless there is something particulary noteworthy about these album <i>other than their existance</i> they do not merit their own articles. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_Brenneman_d498.html" title="User:Aaron Brenneman">OkI'llUseTheSameNameJustThisOnce</a> 9 July 2005 04:21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Maybe so, but I've definitely seen album articles with less information. I didn't author the article, and it doesn't really matter to me if it is deleted or merged into <a href="../../../s/c/h/School_of_Fish_bae8.html" title="School of Fish">School of Fish</a>, but I wouldn't mind it being moved as I said above. If someone can figure out how to deal with the infoboxes already present (or maybe even just delete them), then go ahead and merge the articles. <a href="../../../j/a/x/User%7EJaxl_09f9.html" title="User:Jaxl">Jaxl</a> 9 July 2005 04:32 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy</b> It isn't really appropriate to publish details of Union elections on the web, especially as this is explicitly banned by the Union's rules. This page really shouldn't have been created, and the information isn't supposed to be in the public domain.

<li>No, the Union churns out 3 elections and three presidents every year, and none of them have their own articles. This information can;t be described as relevant to anything, and moreover, it shouldn't be allowed on this site in the first place.

<p>This article is an admitted neologism, as well as an apparent attempt to incorporate Nazi attrocities against Poles, the Prussian (later, German), Austro-Hungarian and Russian (later, Soviet) occupation of Poland, ethnocentric denigration of Poles, and perhaps a few other gripes, together into a single article.

<li><b>Keep</b> or <b>Rename</b>. The factual information in the article is sourced (see references, external links - how can you call 12 written and 8 online references NOR??), so the phenomenon exists and is of encyclopedic value. True, the title is a neologism, but it was not invented on Wiki - while it is rarely used (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Anti-Polonism" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=mozclient&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Anti-Polonism" rel="nofollow">517 hits on Google</a>), half of them (first page) are non-Wiki. Name change might be useful, but as you can see on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Polonism_c94c.html" title="Talk:Anti-Polonism">Talk:Anti-Polonism</a>, the name change was often discussed, but no consensus was reached. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 4 July 2005 22:00 (UTC)

<li>Regarding the references, it appears many of them are not about the concept as described in the article, but rather are historical works describing various events which <b>this article</b> is classifying as "anti-Polonism".

<li>Some, perhaps. All, surely not.

<li><b>Rename</b>. I see no good reason to have a rarely used neologism as the title of this article. In <a href="../../../a/n/t/Talk%7EAnti-Polonism_c94c.html" title="Talk:Anti-Polonism">Talk:Anti-Polonism</a> various other naming possibilities were discussed. What would be wrong with a more intelligible title like <b>Prejudice against Poles</b> or something to that effect? I personally do not like the term <i>Anti-Polonism</i>, since in Poland it has often been pushed by at least some right wing Polish nationalists, for their own reasons too complex to discuss here (in a nutshell, to set up an equivalency with the phenomenon of <a href="../../../a/n/t/Antisemitism.html" title="Antisemitism">Antisemitism</a>). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 4 July 2005 22:13 (UTC)

<li>Anti-Polonism is an obvious neologism; even the article itself admits it. I don't think you can make the same claim for the other examples you have given. Anti-Semitism gets millions of Google hits, anti-Americanism hundreds of thousands, anti-Catholicism tens of thousands, even anti-Arabism gets over three thousands hits. As for anti-French and anti-German, they're not neologisms at all, but descriptors. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 4 July 2005 22:24 (UTC)

<li>It doesn't work that way. Even if you can find non-right-wing sources that use the term, it might still be associated with the right-wing. (I have no idea whether it is, in this case.) Furthermore, such associations change over time, it might be a perfectly neutral word one year only to become very partisan the next. --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMoritz_f530.html" title="User:Moritz">Moritz</a> 4 July 2005 23:04 (UTC)</li>
<li>I never implied that the term anti-polonism was only used by right-wing nationalists. Nevertheless, in Poland some right-wing nationalists (and sometimes antisemites) do use it frequently in their writings. To pick a random example, see <a href="http://www.niedziela.pl/xml.php?wyd=nd&amp;nr=38&amp;doc=nd200349.xml" class="external text" title="http://www.niedziela.pl/xml.php?wyd=nd&amp;nr=38&amp;doc=nd200349.xml" rel="nofollow">this link</a>.</li>
<li>And Anti-Semitism is used by Jewish right-wing nationalists, and? And the term Nazi is used by German Neo-Nazis, and? BTW the term anti-polonism is used by (among others) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland - Nobody cares about Anti-Arabism, Anti-Americanism or Anti-Slavism articles etc - is this voting the next demonstration of Anti-Polish sentiment amongst Wiki-Users? ...&#160;:)--<a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">Witkacy</a> 4 July 2005 23:34 (UTC)</li>

Secondly, most of the examples given in the article are wars! Rightly or wrongly, that is not the normal definition of "anti-whatever" prejudice. As an American, I would never suggest that the War of 1812 or World War I were examples of "anti-American" prejudice, even though both wars featured opponents who intended to kill Americans. That's just not how you normally define it. This article would have a much stronger case IMO if it concentrated on prejudice against Polish emigrants who travelled elsewhere. But it doesn't seem to have that, dealing almost entirely with wartime attacks against Poland. The Nazi activities of course went well beyond the normal boundaries of warfare, and so I do suggest merging them for that reason. <a href="../../../d/c/a/User%7EDcarrano_a5d2.html" title="User:Dcarrano">Dcarrano</a> July 5, 2005 00:09 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I wouldn’t call the wars anti-American prejudice either, since they were wars, not planned extermination of people (civil men, women and children) of particular ethnic groups. The Nazi kind of occupation was not normal (as you noticed) nor it was similar to the same in other countries. Also, it’s not about the Nazis only. The article refers mostly to war times, because there were mostly wars in Poland. Still, there is a difference between occupation and persecution, though both may happen simultaneously. If you can develop the issue of prejudice against Polish emigrants, please, do. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 5 July 2005 01:24 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. There are many mentions of "pl:antypolonizm" in newspapers, there are even <a href="http://www.gandalf.com.pl/b/antysemityzm-antypolonizm-wielkie/" class="external text" title="http://www.gandalf.com.pl/b/antysemityzm-antypolonizm-wielkie/" rel="nofollow">books</a>. The reason for little usage of this word in English is that only few of them are translated and antipolonism itself is not widely discussed in media: but Wikipedia already contains articles about more exotic words and subjects and nobody complains.

<li>Yes. We need a central article - although whether it is AP or some better name, that I am not sure about. But I like the section versions Przepla suggested. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 6 July 2005 14:11 (UTC)</li>
<li>Sounds good, though we have to be very careful about the central article and any navboxes. I shudder at seeing <b>Polish jokes</b> and <b>Nazi atrocities</b> discussed side by side and placed in the same category, even by implication. This would vastly overrate the importance of the first and at the same time trivialize the second. Similarly, to me assigning <a href="../../../y/o/u/You_forgot_Poland_e1ef.html" title="You forgot Poland">You forgot Poland</a> and <a href="../../../k/a/t/Katyn_Massacre_a3ab.html" title="Katyn Massacre">Katyn Massacre</a> to same Category:Anti-Polonism is ridiculous and sad.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 6 July 2005 14:59 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. I find many of the comments defending this article disturbing in that they fail to address the concerns of the nominator, or justify keeping the article for reasons which have nothing to do with policy. A primary complaint is that the term is an <b>admitted</b> rarely-used neologism; responses along the lines of "Jews get to have anti-Semitism, so we should get to have anti-Polonism" do not address this issue, and, in fact, reek of "victimhood" competition, which has nothing to do with whether or not this article should remain, or should have this name. Second, the comments fail to address the issue that the article appears to consist entirely of <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>; rather than quoting expert sources discussing the issue of "anti-Polonism", the authors instead have merely listed the things they believe are "anti-Polonism". Third, the article authors seem to have decided that any war against Poland is an example of "anti-Polonism", which is a fairly absurd idea, as is easy to see if one were to extend this concept to all wars between countries. Finally, as <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">User:Balcer</a> points out, the article conflates the relatively trivial (anti-Polish jokes) with the horrific (mass-murder), thus (by implication) trivializing the latter. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 6 July 2005 17:23 (UTC)

<li>All what you say amounts to the necessity to <b>rename and cleanup</b> the aticle. The topic itself is valid. While "anti-polonism" may be a neologism, the word "Anti-Polish" is not. So the article may perfectly well be moved into the History of anti-Polish attitude or something. And there is nothing inherently wrong in conflating jokes with mass murder: both are poured from the same good old barrel of <a href="../../../x/e/n/Xenophobia.html" title="Xenophobia">xenophobia</a>. <a href="../../../m/i/k/User%7EMikkalai_a7bb.html" title="User:Mikkalai">mikka</a> <a href="../../../m/i/k/User_talk%7EMikkalai_61f6.html" title="User talk:Mikkalai">(t)</a> 6 July 2005 22:21 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> &amp; <b>rename</b>.

<li>Does this thing actually exist? (I.e. Should this article be deleted?)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The answer to the first question is contained in the article itself. Thus, at the very least this article should be renamed.</dd>
<dd>The answer to the second question is more complex, and could perhaps be restated as:
<ul>
<li>Does this thing actually exist <i>as stated</i> in this article? (I.e. Would someone without other knowledge of the topic get NPOV information here?)</li>

<dd>In this discussion there are nationalist tendancies being shown that are clouding the issue.

It's true that <i>anti-Polonism</i> is not really in use in the English-speaking world (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-polonism%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22anti-polonism%22" rel="nofollow">514 Google hits</a>), but the Polish word <i>antypolonizm</i> has <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=antypolonizm" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=antypolonizm" rel="nofollow">7,860</a> results. This is a considerable number, especially when you take into account that the Polish-language part of the internet is relatively small. The word was coined and is mainly used by right-wing media and politicians, most often in the context of "Jewish anti-Polonism" (<i>antypolonizm Żydów</i>), where it is supposed to function as a counter-concept to "Polish anti-Semitism". However, these right-wing circles exert a profound influence on the Polish mainstream, and the anti-Polonism <a href="../../../m/e/m/Meme.html" title="Meme">meme</a> has demonstrated a remarkable tendency to shift to any area of conflict between Poles and other nations, such as Polish-German and Polish-Russian conflict - of which this article is a prime example. In my opinion, the article should carefully explain this phenomenon and point out the rationale behind it - it should <i>not</i> do what it does now, i.e. present a muddled mishmash of any repressions that Poles were subjected to at various times in history. And it should certainly not try to "prove" anything about "anti-Polonism"; that would be <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a> at best and yet another case of repugnant patriotic soapboxing at worst. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 9 July 2005 14:27 (UTC)</li>

<li>My vote, as the nominator of record for this VfD, is an assumed <b>Delete</b>. What I no longer find surprising, but incredibly distressing, is the number of "Keep" votes and their related rationales, which (1) do not address a single point I raised in my nomination, and (2) have nothing whatsoever to do with any legitimate criteria for keeping articles. What is even more distressing is that a number of editors have been running around in what they apparently assume is the backwoods, on talk pages here, disparaging me. If the Polish Wikipedians /Black Book still existed, I have no doubt but that I would feature prominently in that nasty treasure trove of happily deleted trollishness. <a href="../../../w/i/t/User%7EWitkacy_80e6.html" title="User:Witkacy">User:Witkacy</a> has been especially nasty, deciding to take out his frustrations with me by stalking my contribs and blindly reverting me. Meanwhile, the article remains as I described it, a jumbled mess of every gripe Poles have with the history of the world, compiled by POV-pushers whose concept of <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a>, <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECivility_3fb1.html" title="WP:Civility">WP:Civility</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> are apparently sorely lacking. To date, the most sensible "Keep" has been by <a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> who, it seems, has himself been an erstwhile persona non grata among apparently Polish wikipedians. What is presently in the article needs to go, not because of the made up word "anti-polonism" (for the record, I think one of the coolest things about languages is their ability to express new ideas by various rules of word-formation), but because the word, and the article attached to it, are little more than an unencyclopedic catalog of complaints. The information <i>in</i> the article may be encyclopedic, and should be put into other articles, as I said from the outset, but it categorically does <i>not</i> belong all in one place as it is, with the apparent specific intent of demonstrating the veracity of a concept that is non-notable if it even exists. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font size="-1" color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 15:46, July 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Witkacy and Tomer, please, take your discussion to your talk pages. I’ll try to answer some of questions asked here. No, a war between two countries means a disagreement or opposing interests, not anti-xxxism. However, if civil citizens of an occupied country are treated with unnecessary cruelty, or suffer planned ethnic cleansing it is a sign of great hostile and irrational prejudice. This article didn’t mean to double all the historic events, which are already described elsewhere only to single out those ones, which meant expulsion of Polish people. Please, note, that in the article <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> in a section referring to Poland, there is a very wide description of <a href="../../../c/h/m/Chmielnicki_Uprising_1b4c.html" title="Chmielnicki Uprising">Chmielnicki Uprising</a>, which wasn’t even aimed in Jews, though in effect of it great number of Jews died. Soldiers, who died in equal fight will not be mentioned here. On the suggestions that we might have as well articles about anti-xxxisms referring to any other country. Yes, I think we might and we should. There is a lot of irrational prejudices and hostile attitudes of one people to another based only on biased convictions. If Poles think about Germans that they like order too much or Germans about Poles that they love mess, it’s not really harmful. However, if my friends are brutally treated by Austrian police just for driving too fast a car on Polish registration plates, and then heartily apologised upon showing their American passports, something is wrong. If my brother is refused to enter a bar in New Zealand only because he looks American, and apologised upon saying that he’s a Canadian with Polish origins, something is wrong either. If I see an American documentary film, where a young German boy is asked, how does it feel to have DNA of murderers, I would call it a huge prejudice. The same prejudices caused many disasters in the past and that no one plans a new war in the moment, doesn’t mean that it should be neglected. Small number of Google hits means nothing but that the problem is rarely mentioned in English language publications. I agree that there should be more information about the present situation, and the article will be developed in the future. I hope it answers your doubts. You are of course welcome to contribute in this article. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 17:54, 10 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

This is mostly true (though this doesn't prove anything about "irrational"), but such situations are also, sadly, extremely common.

<li><b>Keep</b> This was the Nazi pretext for war on Poland. Hitler and his thugs had used historical examples of Polish failures and aggression by foreign powers, to justify Polish inferiority and start the <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blitzkrieg.html" title="Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>. Poles were equally victims of the Holocaust as the Jews. Germany was in the process of wiping out the entire Polish nation, to replace it with Germans. Western Slavs suffered twice, from Germany and the Soviet Union under Stalin.

<dd><i>"This was the Nazi pretext for war on Poland."</i> With all due respect, TheUnforgiven, that is sheer nonsense. No serious historian will dispute that the reason behind WW II was a vague desire to expand the German <i>lebensraum</i> eastward, coupled with a strong anti-Semitic urge and the sense of an anti-communist mission, plus a vague sense of Germanic superiority over Slavic nations - there was nothing particularly anti-<i>Polish</i> about Nazism. Let us not forget that Hitler, presumably representing Austrian Catholicism and not Prussian Protestantism, was initially seen as a welcome change in Poland; that Hitler was said to have admired Piłsudski's May Coup; that a phony peace lasted and even some degree of comradeship was staged between Sanacja Poland and Nazi Germany between 1934 and 1938. Even in the last days before the outbreak of WW II, Hitler was trying to force Poland into the position of a junior partner in his crusade against Bolshevism. There can be no doubt that the Nazis had little respect for the Poles and treated them with extreme inhumanity. But reducing the cause for WW II to some kind of "anti-Polonism" is at least as ridiculous as reducing the motivation of modern Palestinian suicide bombers to "anti-Semitism". --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 21:59, 11 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>During WWII, the Nazis killed around the same amount of Poles as Jews. However, the Jews were much more severely targeted and almost all Polish Jews were slaughtered, while a much, much lower percentage of Poles were. Anyway, the Germans and Russians clearly hated the Poles deeply, but that is still a regional phenomenon. Why isn't there an article on anti-Tutsiism (though Witkacy may now quickly add a stub)? <a href="../../../t/u/t/Tutsi.html" title="Tutsi">Tutsis</a> in <a href="../../../r/a/w/Rawanda.html" title="Rawanda">Rawanda</a> were slaughtered mercilessly. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 22:14, 10 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Piotr, I agree with everything you just wrote, except the last sentence; you don't need to convince me of the existence of regional anti-Polonism. (I only mentioned the bit about WWII in response to the previous post, but I agree that it's irrelevant to this VfD in general). The reason that I think that it's important to determine whether anti-Polonism is global or regional is that such regional phenomena are a-dime-a-dozen and not notable enough to be mentioned as distinct phonomena. I agree that regional anti-Polonism has been extremely severe and tragic. However, I think that it is only noteworthy in the context of regional conflicts and relations, and should be discussed only in the relevant historical articles. It isn't an isolated and independent phenomenon as is, for example, <a href="../../../a/f/r/Afrophobia.html" title="Afrophobia">hostility towards people of African descent</a>. <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 03:17, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Ahh.

<dd>Hmmm. I see your point. But then I will ask for you to describe to me where can we draw the line between general xenophobia and more specific anti-&lt;insert ethinic group name here&gt; feeling.

<dd>As to your second question: Yes, I believe so. Semantics aside, the Nazis severely and particularly hated the Poles. As to your first question... it's a very good question, and I believe it can be answered as follows: Usually, when people around the world tell a Canadian joke, for example, I would assume that they have no specific desire to deride Canadians. They're just playing on existant stereotypes, and they would just as soon tell a Latino joke or a Chinese joke. In other words, most mild instances of anti-X are only manifestations of a general desire to joke about stereotypes. When one finds that a specific group is widely targeted for any negative treatment or derision, in a manner that noticablely surpasses the negative treatment or derision of other groups, that indicates a unique phenomenon. Can you show me examples of this for Poles or Poland? <a href="../../../h/k/t/User%7EHKT_ea55.html" title="User:HKT">HKT</a> 23:13, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>First, if the answer to my second question above is yes, isn't this enough reason for article to exist - even if the only undisputable section would deal with IIWW period? Second. For the wider scope of anti-Polonizm. 1) I think that the 19th century <a href="../../../g/e/r/Germanization.html" title="Germanization">germanization</a> and <a href="../../../r/u/s/Russification.html" title="Russification">russification</a> of Polish population, under partitions, are examples of actions target specifically against Polish culture. 2) There is some evidence of anti-Polish feelings during the interwar period, and the following two quotes I will give here did convince me sometime ago that there is something more here then just xenophobia - perhaps they will do the same for you. <a href="../../../d/a/v/David_Lloyd_George_0b0a.html" title="David Lloyd George">David Lloyd George</a>: <i>An historic failure, which has won her freedom not by her own exertions, but by the blood of others</i> <a href="http://topaz.org.uk/published_articles/inter_war_economic_success.htm" class="external text" title="http://topaz.org.uk/published_articles/inter_war_economic_success.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a>, at Versails he <i>(wouldn't give the Poles Silesia like he wouldn't) "entrust a watch to a monkey.</i>, in 1939 Poland <i>"met with the fate it deserved"</i> <a href="http://www.warsawvoice.pl/index.phtml?pg=druk&amp;a=4250" class="external text" title="http://www.warsawvoice.pl/index.phtml?pg=druk&amp;a=4250" rel="nofollow">source</a>. <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_Maynard_Keynes_664d.html" title="John Maynard Keynes">John Maynard Keynes</a>: <i>Poland is an economic impossibility with no industry but Jew-baiting</i> <a href="http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/keynes_ecp07.htm" class="external text" title="http://evans-experientialism.freewebspace.com/keynes_ecp07.htm" rel="nofollow">source</a>. Also, both are quoted on the first two pages of Davies God's Playground Chapter XIX together with some other interesting quotes. The bottom line is that those important people, with world-wide influence, seemed to have some grudge with Poland. At least in case of DLG it did transform into significant influence - like blocking aid to Poland during the <a href="../../../p/o/l/Polish-Soviet_War_6e8b.html" title="Polish-Soviet War">Polish-Soviet War</a> (see this article for details). I could give you some more examples, but if you are not convinced by this nor by any articles from Category:Anti-Polonism, then I am not sure what else I can write to prove that this regretable phenomena does infact exist. --<a href="../../../p/i/o/User%7EPiotrus_27db.html" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a> <sup><a href="../../../p/i/o/User_talk%7EPiotrus_217f.html" title="User talk:Piotrus">Talk</a></sup> 00:58, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>So, in 95% percent of cases, when anti-polonism is mentioned on the web, anti-semitism has to be mentioned also. This goes a long way to convince me that the word anti-polonism does not have an independent existence, but it is some kind of a construction in reaction to the concept of anti-semitism. The article should clearly reflect that fact, if it is to be kept.

Poznan: Wydawnictwo Poznanskiego Towarzystwa Przyjaciól Nauk, 1995. Vol. 51 of the history and social sciences series. 183 pages. Illustrations, tables and indices of persons, localities, and topics. ISSN 0079-4651. <a href="../../../b/o/o/Special%7EBooksources_ed7b.html" class="internal">ISBN 83-7063-148-7</a>. Paper. In Polish with English and German summaries.</p>
<p>The stated aim of this scholarly study is to trace back the negative stereotypes of Poles entrenched in German historiography and popular culture ever since Prussia and Russia engineered the partitions of Poland in the eighteenth century. The treatise begins with a survey of authors and readers of the Prussian statistical publications in the period under review. We learn that the credibility of Beamtentumsliteratur (studies written by petty officials in Prussia) was often marred by corruption and dishonesty of said officials, as well as by their lack of proficiency in Polish. The data they collected were also marred by incompetence, ignorance and a classically hostile attitude toward the Other--in this case, toward the Poles. The writers' generalizing helped to distort the picture: whenever they did not like something, they were likely to say "as is always the case in Poland;" but when they encountered a city they liked (Poznan), they commented that "the city was built according to German standards." German officials routinely compared Polish peasant farmers to the wild inhabitants of "Kamchatka and the West Indies," or to "Roman slaves and American Indians." Such scholars and travelers as Johann Georg Forster compared Poles to "cattle in human form" (in SŠmtliche Schriften). A certain Lichtenberg (said to be Forster's friend) wrote that Poland was inhabited by "landowning despots, dirty Jews and plica" [Weichselzopf, or koltun]. The expression "German cockroaches" must have entered the English language owing to the similarly brutal descriptions of German immigrants to America by those who came earlier from the British Isles.</p>
<p>Among the specific complaints of these official record keepers were the prevalence of Catholicism among Poles (it was considered scandalous), low level of education, consumerism and vanity of the Polish landowners, poverty and servitude of the Polish peasantry, and the greed of Polish Jews who were seen as Poland's "third estate" and whose numerosity in Poland (by comparison to Prussia) irritated the German officials. üukasiewicz's conclusions are that the Prussian officials created a taxonomy within which persons of Polish nationality were perceived as inferior and in need of Prussian tutelage."</p>

While Herder was reflecting on the Slavs, Fichte was teaching in Poland and writing negative, racist comments about the Poles. Polish women were slovenly and with a stronger sex drive than Germans (p. 335); Poland was full of wild animals, wild people, and Jews. A racist diatribe published in 1793 (Joachim Christoph Friedrich Schulz's Journey of a Livonian from Riga to Warsaw) was republished in 1941 after the Nazis had conquered Poland, reflecting a trend among German scholars from the eighteenth into the twentieth century to perceive, in the difference between Germany and Poland, a boundary between civilization and barbarism, high German Kultur and "primitive Slavdom" (p. 336).</p>
<p>Although concerned primarily with the emergence of racial classifications of Eastern Europeans, Wolff's chapter includes an interesting discussion of the writings of Georg Forster, a German born in Poland who traveled in Russia and with Captain Cook's second voyage to the South Pacific, for whom racial differences were significant only between white Europeans and Negroes (Poles, although oppressed, were still Europeans). In other writings, the black/white distinction was grafted onto the barbaric/civilized distinction in Europe itself, appearing in such extreme statements as Ledyard's claim that there were "no white Savages." Eastern Europeans, as barbarian, were therefore not white. (In a letter to Thomas Jefferson, Ledyard interpreted the Tartars--a broad category that included, on occasion, Jews, Poles, and Russians--to be American Indians [p. 348].) www.oslo2000.uio.no/program/papers/s18/s18-blackbourn.pdf These European parallels with the Americas expressed contempt towards "uncultivated" peopleswithin Europe itself. In the German case, this meant Poles, and the motif runs through the 18th-century history of Prussian reclamation. The line of the Prussian "improvements" ran eastwards. Itbegan immediately to the east of Berlin in the Electoral March, then crossed the Oder to the Wartheand Netze marshes before turning south-east towards Silesia and north-east, to newly acquired partsof Pomerania and above all to West Prusia, the booty from the first Polish partition. On the easternmargins of protean Prussia, reclamation and settlement "secured" the border -for how could youprotect or even define a frontier that was under water half the year?Officials carried contempt for the indigenous Poles with them. The draining of the Oderbruch wasintended to plant good German colonists where "superstitious" Wendish fishermen had lived, amental connection that was even stronger when it came to the new eastern territories. Frederick'sown views on "the slovenly Polish trash" of West Prussia were expressed in unflattering NewWorld parallels. They were like "Iroquois". Or: "I have seen this Prussia; I believe Canada is bettercultivated". This was "a barbarous people sunk in ignorance and stupidity" (note the metaphoricalundertones of the French verb "croupir" -sunk in, wallowing in, stagnating) I hope this books as well as roots of antipolonism that they show will be put in the text, which I do hope will stay on wikipedia.User:194.30.182.7</p>

<dd>A lot of chauvinist and nationalist literature has been published in Poland, both during the stalinist People's Republic, and after the fall of communism. This is not news at all. But does reliable <i>English</i> scholars describe this "anti-Polonism"? I believe if we are going to have "anti-Polonism", we should also write an article about anti-Germanism, illustrating with half a dozen of pictures of Poles and Soviet-Russians killing German children.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. What User:194.30.182.7 is describing is not so much about any specific German contempt of Poland, but rather the general idea of a cultural gradient from East to West. Speaking of which, the Polish image of Ukraine as "wilderness" was in fact strikingly similar to the German image of Poland - read Sienkiewicz's <i>Ogniem i Mieczem</i> some time. Should we collect such material, throw in horror stories about crimes committed by Ukrainian partisans against Polish civilians, plus stuff about SS Galicia and maybe some of Putin's remarks concerning the Ukrainian revolution, and then neatly label all this Anti-Ukrainianism? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 21:59, 11 July 2005 (UTC)

However, I have heard and seen it umpteen times in Poland or Polish media, who are trying hard to convince their audience that the rest of the world is constantly talking about "Polish death camps". That way - and in many other ways - they are spreading and consolidating the stereotype that the world outside (and not only outside) Poland is anti-Polish to the core. As self-centeredness goes, the Poles are right up there with the Americans, Jews, Germans, and French (in no particular order, and not a complete list). Unfortunately, as you say, people rarely realise that they are driven by stereotypes, Poles being no exception, but are usually just <i>brilliant</i> at identifying the stereotypes other people are driven by...

I am reluctant to paste and translate quotes from the book here, since this would needlessly propagate its rather pathological views. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 16:27, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Actually it is one book. I really fail to see, when and why the voting on Anti-Polonism changed into discussion on Anti-Semitism? In which place the article, which is the subject of this voting, is offending to any non-Poles? --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 16:08, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Szopen made a long list of meanings, so I made some additions for completeness. Plus, as you know very well, the problem is not just with this one book, but with a widespread set of beliefs held by at least 10% of the population of Poland (as reflected by their voting preferences). <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 16:27, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>10% of population? Hmm... Let's see: election to the Polish parliament in 2001 - frequency 46%, election to the European parliament - 21%. In the same time it is widely supposed in Poland that our president is of Jewish origin and yet he was voted a president of Poland, twice. Frequency in 1995 - 68% and in 2000 - 61% and he won in the first round. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 20:57, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let's not quibble over numbers, which of course cannot be precise. I had in mind the fact that a party like the <a href="../../../l/e/a/League_of_Polish_Families_66bc.html" title="League of Polish Families">League of Polish Families</a> regularly receives between 10% and 15% support in public opinion polls. Now, of course, let me say here that I am not accusing all the supporters of that party of being anti-semites or xenophobes or whatever. Having said that, it does appear to me that some politicians from that party do employ the idea of anti-Polonism in their rhethoric, so it must find at least some resonance among party supporters. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 21:38, 12 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Sylvia, I am not sure if your comment really proves your point - or the opposite. The question is why do so many people care at all, and sometimes obsessively, whether or not "Kwaśniewski vel Stolzman" (try Google for this one!) is "of Jewish origin"? Perhaps because they want to prove that, at best, he can be president <i>although</i> he is Jewish - thus proving the Polish electorate's generous tolerance. And at worst because they want to prove he is one of "them" (<i>oni</i>) not "us", that he is an agent of some foreign powers-that-be and working against the Polish national interest. Thus, your example demonstrates the very reciprocity of the two concepts, anti-Semitism and anti-Polonism. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 22:08, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>As I understand Balcer says that people with an anti-Semitic bias are a serious problem in Poland. I guess that they were those people, who let everyone know that Kwaśniewski is Stolzman according to them. What I meant was that voting people didn’t care for what the other prejudiced people were saying only voted for the man they wanted to be a president. So the prejudiced people make only a big fuss but without any serious support. Then, I think they are not as big problem as Balcer claims. That was my point. I didn’t vote for Kwaśniewski and I don’t think it makes me an anti-Semite. I would rather say that one people longed to some advantages of communism while other didn’t and voted according to that, so the prejudiced people had nothing to do with decisions of voters. I still think that the article at hand is not about that at all and is very important for many other reasons mentioned in the discussion above. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 22:59, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Sylwia, I saw where you are coming from in the first place. <i>My</i> point was that the same facts you mention can just as well be seen from a different angle. And you are certainly entitled to your opinion that the prejudiced anti-Semitic people are not as big a problem as Balcer claims. And we are entitled to our opinion that the anti-Polish people are not as big a problem as the article claims. Are we even, then? --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 23:16, 12 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>The particular anti-Semitic people are not as big problem, because they are hardly taken seriously in their own country. I don’t say their prejudices are not problematic.

<dd>"<i>The particular anti-Semitic people are not as big problem, because they are hardly taken seriously in their own country.</i>" Fair enough (although one might indeed beg to differ), but then how do you know that anti-Polish people are being taken more seriously in their own countries than anti-Semites are in Poland? Knowing the situation both in and outside Poland, let me assure you that anti-Polish hostility is much less tangible in the west than anti-Semitic hostility is in Poland.</dd>
<dd><i>"The article describes many people killed, because of anti-Polish prejudice, I wouldn’t call it a small problem"</i> (read "as small as anti-Semitism"). Please see my response to TheUnforgiven above: The insinuation that the outbreak of WWII and the ensuing cruelty against Poles (Jews, Russians, ...) has its cause in "anti-Polish prejudice" is not supported by international (or Polish, for that matter) scholarship. It is original research at best and Polono-centric soapboxing at worst. Also, what are you actually comparing here - the <i>present</i> verbal anti-Semitism in a country virtually without Jews with the anti-Polish atrocities of <i>WWII</i>? Let us compare the past with the past and the present with the present, shall we? No matter how you look at it, the death toll of German and Russian anti-Polish atrocities will always be much higher than the death toll of Polish anti-Jewish atrocities. But to belittle the relevance of anti-Semitism in modern democratic Poland by comparing it to atrocities in occupied Poland is anything but fair discussion. --<a href="../../../t/h/o/User%7EThorsten1_e185.html" title="User:Thorsten1">Thorsten1</a> 10:31, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Thorsten, I’m afraid that again you know where I come from, but try to show my words <i>from a different angle</i>. I wrote just three sentences, but you avoided the one, which would contradict your interpretation of the remaining two. I said: <i>I don’t say their prejudices are not problematic</i> (read: every anti-Semitic sentiment is a problem). How am I trying to belittle the importance of anti-Semitism? Did I say that anti-Semitism doesn’t exist? Did I say that there shouldn’t be an article about anti-Semitism? Did I say that anti-Semitism in Poland shouldn’t be described in Wikipedia? Please, let me conclude my opinions to avoid any future misunderstandings:</dd>
<dd>1. Every prejudice against a nation, religion etc. is a problem and deserves its own article.</dd>
<dd>2. The fact of existence of extreme opinions of some people from one nation about another people, do not diminish the importance of prejudice against the nation itself.</dd>
<dd>3. Every prejudice should be condemned. (read: if you wish to add examples of prejudiced opinions of any Polish politicians or mass media, you are free to do so; you have to your disposition articles like: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> with two Polish sections, <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kielce_Pogrom_b20f.html" title="Kielce Pogrom">Kielce Pogrom</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_in_Jedwabne_cb66.html" title="Massacre in Jedwabne">Massacre in Jedwabne</a> and many others, lately you also voted to keep <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_a736.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Poland">Anti-Semitism in Poland</a> so you can add it there as well).</dd>
<dd>4. I never tried to make a death toll competition to show that one prejudice is more important than another. I think the numbers are of secondary notion, as people should be always put in the first place. No matter how many people died, they suffered the same, and suffered unjustly. Not for what they did, but for what their origins were. I don’t think we have the right to draw a line showing where it is a serious problem and where it is not.</dd>
<dd>I really think I already said all I had to say about this issue. I hope then, we can stop this discussion now, as there is really nothing new I can add to it. I understand that we both agree that anti-Semitism exists and is a serious problem. I also understand that we disagree in our opinions on existence of anti-Polonism and its importance. We don’t have to agree, really. --<a href="../../../s/y/l/User%7ESylwiaS_ce3b.html" title="User:SylwiaS">SylwiaS</a> 15:18, 13 July 2005 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><i>"I wrote just three sentences, but you avoided the one, which would contradict your interpretation of the remaining two."</i> First off, when it comes to being selective about which points to respond to I do not think I can best you... However, the sentence you are referring to does <i>not</i> at all contradict what I said, considering the circumstantial evidence. I have, of course, no way of knowing what you really meant to say. To me, however, the statement in question comes across as a rather phony concession. <i>"How am I trying to belittle the importance of anti-Semitism? Did I say that anti-Semitism doesn’t exist?</i>" Hell no, you even said it was <i>"problematic</i>", even though it was not <i>"not as big [a] problem"</i>. This raises the question - "not as big as <i>what</i>"? Well, not as big a problem as the <i>"many people killed because of anti-Polish prejudice, I wouldn’t call [this] a small problem"</i>. You are evidently comparing modern Polish anti-Semitism, which does not kill, to historic anti-Polish sentiments, which did kill. This is logically incorrect.</dd>
<dd>As for your other statements: <i>"Every prejudice against a nation, religion etc. is a problem "</i> - yes - <i>"and deserves its own article"</i> - no. This one does, though. <i>"The fact of existence of extreme opinions of some people from one nation about another people, do not diminish the importance of prejudice against the nation itself."</i> True enough. But then I never implied otherwise and it's not really the issue here, either. What I said was the <i>concept</i> of anti-Polonism was designed in response to accusations of Polish anti-Semitism and does not really have an independent existence outside Polish-Jewish relations. Even the fiercest proponents of the concept rarely use it in any other way than to counter the accusation of one-way prejudice and hostility in Polish-Jewish relations. <i>"Every prejudice should be condemned."</i> Yes, but please not here. Wikipedia is <i>not</i> a soapbox from which to "condemn" anything, as condemnable as it may be. We are working on an encyclopedia, not a collection of indictments. <i>"If you wish to add examples of prejudiced opinions of any Polish politicians or mass media, you are free to do so; you have to your disposition articles like: <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland_5757.html" title="History of the Jews in Poland">History of the Jews in Poland</a>, <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_e26e.html" title="Anti-Semitism">Anti-Semitism</a> with two Polish sections, <a href="../../../k/i/e/Kielce_Pogrom_b20f.html" title="Kielce Pogrom">Kielce Pogrom</a>, <a href="../../../m/a/s/Massacre_in_Jedwabne_cb66.html" title="Massacre in Jedwabne">Massacre in Jedwabne</a> and many others, lately you also voted to keep <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_a736.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Poland">Anti-Semitism in Poland</a> so you can add it there as well.</i>" What is that supposed to mean? Something like "this is <i>our</i> playground, the Polonophobes have their own playgrounds"? Also, may I remind you that I voted keep on this article? What I criticise is the body of the article, not the title. May I further remind you that I initially voted delete on <a href="../../../a/n/t/Anti-Semitism_in_Poland_a736.html" title="Anti-Semitism in Poland">Anti-Semitism in Poland</a> because of the article's clear anti-Polish POV message, and did not change my vote until Prokonsul Piotr - whom you will hardly suspect of being anti-Polish - rewrote the article from scratch? So please stop trying to frame me as a Polonophobe. <i>"I never tried to make a death toll competition to show that one prejudice is more important than another."</i> No, but you nonsensically juxtaposed the supposedly harmless anti-Semitism in modern Poland and the harmful anti-Polonism in WWII and earlier conflicts, which obviously had a higher death toll than the former. <i>"I think the numbers are of secondary notion, as people should be always put in the first place. No matter how many people died, they suffered the same, and suffered unjustly. Not for what they did, but for what their origins were.</i>" These are all noble declamations that no one would contradict. <i>"I don’t think we have the right to draw a line showing where it is a serious problem and where it is not."</i> No, but we do have the right and the duty to draw a line between a decent article based on established knowledge and attempts to establish "new" knowledge and usages in Wikipedia. <i>"We don’t have to agree, really."</i> That is the one thing in your post I wholeheartedly agree with.

<dd>Let me just clarify that I am not out to promote the image of Poland as a country with a big antisemitism problem, as Sylwia's remarks seem to be implying. I only pointed out that in Poland there are nationalist groups and parties promoting ideas unacceptable by the liberal mainstream, xenophobia and anti-semitism in this case, and that these parties can count on the support of about 10% of the electorate. This is a phenomemon quite similar in kind to what occurs in France (<a href="../../../j/e/a/Jean-Marie_Le_Pen_39bd.html" title="Jean-Marie Le Pen">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>), Germany (<a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Democratic_Party_of_Germany_%28NPD%29_ae1f.html" title="National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD)">National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD)</a>), Italy (<a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_League_%28Italy%29_aec9.html" title="Northern League (Italy)">Northern League (Italy)</a>, and many other Western democracies in good standing. At the same time, the presence of such phenomena needs to be acknowledged and, in my opinion only of course, opposed. In particular, we should not advance the ideas of such parties by creating articles such as this one, in its current form. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalcer_81b4.html" title="User:Balcer">Balcer</a> 22:39, 13 July 2005 (UTC)

<p>Thorstan that is absurd, since I fail to see any connection between Antipolish sentiment and statements made by Frederick the Great, Forster or prussian officials.Likewise antipolonism of Russians has nothing connecting it with antisemitism as it based on Russian state aspirations and accusing Poles of betraying panslavic ideals etc. Hence the accusation that antisemitism and antipolonism are connected doesn't survive a simple test.Of course that doesn't mean that antipolish statements by Jewish representatives don't fall into category of antipolonism and vice versa.But still antipolonism is neither the creation of antisemitism/as Russian and Prussian examples show/ nor is the tool of mythical ultranationalists of Poland.Molobo</p>
<dl>
<dd>Molobo, I apologise, I was wrong. My idea that anti-Semitism and anti-Polonism were somehow connected was crazy, as it did not survive your test. And, of course, the existence of ultranationalists in Poland is just a myth....&#160;;) Seriously, when I said that the concept of anti-Polonism is a reaction to allegations of Polish anti-Semitism, I did obviously not want to imply that nobody had ever said anything bad about Poles before. If you can produce any plausible evidence that the concept of anti-Polonism (not the fact that people made statements hostile toward Poles) was in fact widely used in the 19th century, and <i>not</i> in connection with Jews, I might have to change my mind.

<dd>"If you can produce any plausible evidence that the concept of anti-Polonism (not the fact that people made statements hostile toward Poles) was in fact widely used in the 19th century, and <i>not</i> in connection with Jews". It has been already shown that Poles were treated as inferior and barbaric people since XVIII century and legislation followed-for example polish nobility had to put higher taxes in Prussia, polish monasteries were persecuted("lairs of idleness" according to Frederick, polish language forbidden.)And of course antipolish policies and ideology of Russian officials(shown btw in the first source in the article) weren't connected to antisemitsm at all as they were based on Russian imperial ambitions and panslavism.Molobo</dd>

<dd>Yes, Molobo, it has been duly shown that Poles were considered and treated as inferior by non-Poles at various times in history. But since nobody seriously doubted this, you didn't actually have to "show" this, either. What I did ask you to "show" was that the <i>concept</i> of anti-Polonism has really been used to collectively describe and interpret the various injustices done to Poles, and to assert a genetic connection between, say, the tax policy in 19th century Prussia, accusations of Polish anti-Semitism in the Jedwabne debate, and "Polish jokes" in 21st century America. You are constantly talking about historical <i>events</i>, whereas I am talking about <i>concepts</i>. You being a student of "International Relations and Journalism and Social Communication", as you say on your <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolobo_4aaf.html" title="User:Molobo">user page</a>, should be aware of the difference - otherwise you might run into some serious trouble during your studies.

<dd>Hammering my point home (hopefully), the issue is <i>not</i> whether or not non-Poles have acted hostilely towards Poles. The issue <i>is</i> whether or not the concept "anti-Polish" has seriously and verifiably been employed as heuristic tool for understanding any behaviour hostile towards Poles, and not primarily as a counter-weight to allegations of Polish anti-Semitism. To the best of my knowledge, it has not; you have so far failed to put forward any evidence that I am wrong. Unless you can come up with anything convincing, I will stick to my vote - keep the title, but rewrite the body of the article to highlight the origin of the concept in Polish-Jewish relations, and to keep much more critical distance to the concept.</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> A.the Orientalism article says the term is used to refer mainly to eighteenth and nineteenth century works, not a book that was published in the 20th century. B.

<li>The book was published by Virgin books in 1982 in the UK, Delilah Communications in 1983 in the US, Library of Congress number 82-74032. The book's cover is a cartoon depiction of a female leg. To get this book, by the way, I had to see 3 library employees, all female. The book appears to be more commercially oriented rather than academically oriented. The book contains small stub-length sections with titles such as "Most ___", "First ____", "Largest ___", "Rarest ___", etc. with photographs and cartoon drawings sprinkled throughout. The raping chair article on page 106 is titled "First raping chair introduced." While some sections give references to works or particular people, the raping chair section lacked any. In the introduction section of this book the author explains:</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Yes, devils appear in works of fiction, but they're as Japanese mythology as superman - that is, not at all. Swap "Japan", "akuma", and google count with any other country, translated word, etc, and your statement is most likely true. For example: (teufel is a) <i>"Widely known name in German culture. Word appears often in novels, television, film, etc. both as a translation of the word "devil" from English (and similarly from other Western languages) and in original German fiction. Please note that the existence of teufel is not what needs verification; the existence of the concept of teufel is what does, and yes, it is both notable and verifiable, with more than 800,000 hits on Google. Important aspect of German culture."</i> That's like saying that we need about a dozen foreign language dictdef stubs for every English word. This reasoning is problematic because it doesn't address the real issue, which is the current article. The anonymous IP's contribution is bogus. Even on the slim chance that it was actually describing a character in a real work of fiction, without referring to the specific work of fiction it is placed out of context and equally worthless and meaningless. Furthermore akuma, as described in dictionaries, do not refer to entities specific to Japanese mythology. —<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 7 July 2005 03:50 (UTC)

<dd>You probably think you know who <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Edison_ebd8.html" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a> was. But there is one aspect of Edison that might surprise you: Thomas Alva Edison, <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shinto.html" title="Shinto">Shinto</a> god. Yes, the American inventor's likeness appears on ema at a prominent, important, and ancient <a href="../../../j/i/n/Jinja_%28Shinto%29_1ab2.html" title="Jinja (Shinto)">shrine</a>, and when visitors to the shrine write their wish on one of these ema, they bow in prayer to Edison. My point is that Japanese culture alters the concepts that Japan takes from the West, in ways that are worthy of attention. The anonymous user has done Wikipedia a service by separating a longstanding cultural phenomenon (Christianity reached Japan at least as early as <a href="../../../1/5/4/1549.html" title="1549">1549</a>) from the popular anime/game/manga fluff. Give this article time to grow, and let's see how the Japanese notion of akuma differs from the Western devil. <a href="../../../f/g/2/User%7EFg2_c241.html" title="User:Fg2">Fg2</a> July 7, 2005 06:41 (UTC)

<dd>You may have a point if we were voting on "Thomas Edison (mythology)". However you don't seem to deny the fact that what the anon IP contributed here is original research, which is arguably worse than game article fluff. The Japanese term "akuma" is already covered at the <a href="../../../a/k/u/Akuma.html" title="Akuma">akuma</a> article. Is there enough content to justify yet another akuma article? —<a href="../../../t/o/k/User%7ETokek_9e29.html" title="User:Tokek">Tokek</a> 7 July 2005 14:33 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Generally speaking a concert album is just a collection of their older work, as performed at a concert. They're much cheaper to make and thus no real evidence that the band is able to command the kind of investment that most major (or large indie) label labels will put into an album.

<li><b>Maybe Delete</b> Not sure if one web page counts as a proper source. If these are legit and are really that famous, how about some additional evidence of importance? Particularly if it's notable for being the influence for Moe, we need evidence of this. Wikipedians saying that it sounds like the influence for Moe without sources amounts to original research. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> 6 July 2005 02:14 (UTC)

<li>Alright, somehow you convinced <i>me</i> to do some research on it. Luckily, it was very easy. Check <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Tube+Bar%22+prank" class="external text" title="http://www.google.ca/search?q=%22Tube+Bar%22+prank" rel="nofollow">Google</a> and you'll get no end of hits. I've added a few to the <a href="../../../t/u/b/Tube_Bar_prank_calls_23e7.html" title="Tube Bar prank calls">Tube Bar prank calls</a> page including some Wikipedia links. (By the way, it turns out <a href="http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/tubebar/recording.html" class="external text" title="http://www.missioncreep.com/mw/tubebar/recording.html" rel="nofollow">page 2</a> of the external link that was already referenced did mention that it was the inspiration for Moe.)

<p>This is an advertising article for a non-notable website. Much of the article text comes from the website's FAQ, suggestive of advertising. The website itself appears to have a limited active fan-base. Its fan discussion board has only 142 members. Google retrieves 1,600 results but gives the "omitted similar" message after 55 results. Most hits seem to be blogish references. Note that the redirect for this page is listed below. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 5 July 2005 00:06 (UTC) +</p>
