<p>This article is about a tunnel connecting two university buildings, and is likely to be fiction — a recent edit to the article suggests it is an elaborate hoax. I had wondered about the authenticity of the tunnel previously, since the only references to it seemed to be for the student supporters group. To be honest, even if the tunnel does exist I don't really think a tunnel connecting two university buildings is sufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article, and its existence certainly seems to be in some doubt. <sub>└</sub> <sup><b><a href="../../../u/k/p/User%7EUkPaolo_5ba7.html" title="User:UkPaolo">UkPaolo</a></b></sup>/<sub><i><a href="../../../u/k/p/User_talk%7EUkPaolo_332d.html" title="User talk:UkPaolo">talk</a></i></sub><sup>┐</sup> 22:23, 13 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Well obviously the tunnel doesnt exist...thats the whole point! To cut the story short the rumour about the tunnel was started by the Chaplain and it became very popular so now there is a Boldrewood Tunnel soc. however to be recognised as one of the university's clubs it needs to have "genuinely serious aims and objectives". Therefore it has been decided that our aim is to make life better on our campuses. This will be achieved by doing ‘nice things’ called Temporal Unifying No-specific Nactions of Evil-less Love (or T.U.N.N.E.L.S.) Performing a TUNNEL is going to be known as DIGging (or Direct Instigation of Goodness). Looking for somewhere to DIG a TUNNEL is going to be known as SURVEYING (or specific urban reaction… etc etc etc...</p>

<p>This Club is the greatest society any univrsity has ever spawned. It is growing at a very very fast rate, and is and international society, with members across the globe. The tunnel itself is a very usful untaped resourse for the university, 17 students a year are currently run over on burgess road, and quite frankly the university needs international pressure to reopen said tunnel. As for obviously not existing, well that's rubbish, we have evidence and so on, see the main article for our web address. The Idea of DIGging a TUNNEL is simply and extension of our aims, that help the Students union affiliation process go a little more smoothly.</p>

This is the most totally awesome club ever - I am a member and don't even go to Southampton uni! That just goes to show how far the society gas united peoples of all calling and from all areas of the globe, not just those students of Southampton, but is strongly developing inter-uni links across the country, and as such is a more valuable resource than possibly comprehendable.</p>

<p>There is a viable reason for the society. 17 ppl are run over PER YEAR. Opening the tunnel might help the situation. And I as a student at southampton would find the tunnel very useful.</p>

<p>The boldrewood tunnel is not so much a myth as a legend. Inspired by the new university chaplain, this club is now the fastest growing at the university of Southampton - and equally popular amongst current students as past students not even living there anymore - such as myself!</p>

<p>Boldrewood Tunnel, a myth though it is, is really a somewhat quirky and successful social experiment that has spawned a society. The mere fact that a society exists demonstrates that people are prepared to associate with utter nonsense. What does this say about trends in society? In the light of potential deletion of this article, it would probably remove a case study that demonstrates new trends, in a similar light to Flash Mobs and other such phenomenon. Urban myths, as this clearly is, need to be recognised. I would not recommend deleting this article, but renaming it 'Boldrewood Tunnel Society'.</p>
<p>DON'T DELETE&#160;!!!! - Rob H 15th March 2006</p>
<p>Corrected spellings, but that's not the point - this wiki should exist to inform people of the tunnel (which has not been disproved).</p>

<p>DON'T DELETE!!!!!--Seb Maybe the entry for boldrewood tunnel should be slightly changed. The aim of the boldrewood tunnel society is no longer the reopening of the tunnel, we have developed into an international society with members from countries as distant as Germany and France. Thus we are actively puttting foward good relations between different cultures and different nations. The TUNNEL is just the symbol that brings us together, it is a mere idea we can all identify with and which we can relate to- i.e. the idea to do good in the world. Please take this into consideration.</p>

<p>Our society is so unique, special and in it's formative years atm. The reaction we have received on campus cannot be undermined, with new recruits every week, who previously slammed our soc. There is more to the society than just the 'tunnel' itself. We aim to act as do-gooders, helping our common man..or student! Please don't take my tunnel soc away...:-)</p>
<p>This club is unique and is currently the fastest growing on campus. Dont delete! It is not an elaborate hoax, but something that people may want and need to find out about- it deserves an entry! DONT DELETE!</p>
<p>This club is unique and is currently the fastest growing on campus. I think we all need someone DIGGING for us one day or the other, so please, for your own sake, DON'T DELETE!</p>

<p>To those at the top of ths page who want to delete this article, i wish to pose a question, or perhaps two. It would be nice to recive an answer. Firstly perhaps the article should be renamed rather than deleted as you propose, to "Boldrewood Tunnel Society" as the society most certainly does exist and noone can honestly deny that, even those fools who pretend the tunnel is a fake. Secondly i would like to contend the point made "I don't really think a tunnel connecting two university buildings is sufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article". The whole purpose of an encyclopædia is to document EVERYTHING, thats what the name means, saying something is unworthy an entry is daft, an could lead to all sorts of pages being cited as insufficiently "notable to merit an encyclopedia [sic] article" Elijah78.84 21:47, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Despite your first sentence, you failed to pose any question, merely to make two points. In response, I would say that a university society, or a tunnel connecting two university buildings <b>is not</b> sufficiently notable to merit inclusion in an encyclopedia. The purpose of Wikipedia is not to "document everything" — see <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_fd5a.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a> and <a href="../../../w/h/a/Wikipedia%7EWhat_Wikipedia_is_not_86da.html" title="Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not">Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not</a>. You seem to ridicule the notion that saying something unworthy of inclusion is daft and that this could lead to "all sorts of pages being cited as insufficiently notable to merit an encyclopedia article" yet that is precisely what does happen. I suggest you read through <a href="../../../a/f/d/WP%7EAFD_90f0.html" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> where you will find plenty of nominations for deletions of articles deemed insufficently notable to merit inclusion.</dd>
<dd>As a side issue, I notice you feel the need to append <a href="../../../s/i/c/Sic.html" title="Sic">sic</a> to the spelling of encyclopedia without an <a href="../../../a/_/_/A.html" title="A">a</a> or <a href="../../../%C3%A6/_/_/%C3%86.html" title="Æ">æ</a>. This is a perfectly well accepted spelling (see <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">Encyclopedia</a>) although admittedly more American than British in origins.</dd>
<dd>To the anonymous contributors to this page please read the warning notice above and realise that this is not a simple voting process. No-one is objecting to the article purely because of a lack of references, or suggesting that your club is gaining popularity. It is just not sufficiently notable to merit inclusion here (otherwise <i>every</i> club in <i>every</i> university around the world would want an article).</dd>
