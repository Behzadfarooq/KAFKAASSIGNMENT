<p>Hi, it seems to me a lot of the Wikipedia "experts" don't accept reality. My puzzles are real and sold in many countries. And I had a lot of counterfeith too. I am an inventor and you can check more than 130 patent applications on databases on Internet. I have a lot of officially registered USA copyrights, starting from 1986. My puzzles were exhibited on the World Expo of 1992 in Sevilla and 1996 in Portugal in the Pavillions of Belgium. You need to have a very good product to be invited there by the Belgian authorities. But in fact: What is the problem? Mu6 23:49, 21 November 2006 (UTC)<br /></p>

<li>With apologies to the above contributors, and with some reluctance, I say <b>Keep</b>. Whilst the business with the holons and the cold fusion looks like crankiness, which I'd like to delete on the grounds that it's personal research and thus not appropriate to Wikipedia, I do think that this guy is notable as the inventor of the little foam-rubber cube puzzles. I've found a couple in Christmas crackers over the years, and they're neat little geometric puzzles - nothing like as interesting or important as <a href="../../../r/u/b/Rubik%27s_Cube_6ec5.html" title="Rubik's Cube">Rubik's Cube</a>, but worth noting nonetheless.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b>. Many of the Dutch googles are about DGS, a compression technique he advertised 2001-2002. There was a lot of argument about that one, some said the claims were outrageous, and there was an authorship dispute. Neither of these is represented here, we only get a short sentence about his involvement in 3ivx. Something to hide?

<p>Connecticut does have a coast, but it does not define a "Region." In fact it was made up as an agglomeration of smaller Connecticut "Regions," which reflect some planner or tourism official's idea of what needed to exist - neither Coastal Connecticut nor its "constituent parts" would likely be recognized by state residents. <a href="../../../j/d/2/User%7EJd2718_bc8a.html" title="User:Jd2718">Jd2718</a> 08:10, 12 November 2006 (UTC) I am also nominating the following related page because it is also an artificial region, invented by agglomerating smaller, artificial regions.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> He's a presenter (DJ) on a radio station that covers all of Ireland, and he was nominated for an national radio award last year <a href="http://www.ppiradioawards.com/2005/entries_rec_2005.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.ppiradioawards.com/2005/entries_rec_2005.htm" rel="nofollow">[9]</a>.

<li>'The article does contain a lot of duplicated material that can easily be found on the comic's page itself.

<li><b>Keep</b> There are tons of webcomic entries on wikipedia that nobody's ever heard of. The only reason this particular article is up for deletion is because it actually has gotten attention. Ghastly's Ghastly comic is popular and noteworthy compared to a lot of comic articles. Amongst all of them, it makes the cut just because there are so many less noteworthy here than it.209.86.72.159 09:14, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>The comic is notable to me, but according to <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> it seems that anything that spreads by word of mouth or personal recommendation fails the notability criteria (guides?). If notability is transitive, I came across Ghastly's comic through Sexy Losers through Stile Project. <b>Reluctant delete</b>, since we're going by the rules. --<a href="../../../g/a/r/User%7EGargoyleMT_d768.html" title="User:GargoyleMT">GargoyleMT</a> 13:19, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT#PAPER</a> would suggest that there's no real point in getting rid of it, since it's not advertising or spamming, and it's a fairly well-written, informative, concise piece. There's no value given to wiki by getting rid of it, besides making the lists of wiki articles a bit smaller and neater, I suppose. I am liking the idea of a central Tentacle Epics article, however, since all of them together would be enough to pass the notability criteria, I would think. Can we reach an agreement that instead of deletion, it should be merged with the other works of Ghastly into a Tentacled Epics article? 209.86.74.146 15:34, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

I didn't know that the image was based on a comic until now but, to quote another user on another deletion discussion, "I find it a vital service for Wikipedia to bring me information on life's obscure topics". <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 02:11, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><s><b>Weak Delete</b> per WP:WEB, as above (but only weak per Esn's comment - if there's more to say about this, I could be convinced to change)</s> . Please note that there was apparently an entreaty on another website to readers of this comic to come over and "vote," which may explain the new users here (please see Link's link above for more details). Also a person claiming to be the author of the comic seems to have participated in the discussion over there, which brings up concerns about WP:AUTO (assuming he is who he says he is, of course). So that should be kept in mind - those new user comments certainly "count" (to the extent anyone's counting), but may not be as unbiased as your average comment. However, I'd also like to add that if you've just come to wikipedia for the first time to vote, we're glad you're here and encourage you to stay and explore and see how you can contribute. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheOtherBob_0f8f.html" title="User:TheOtherBob">TheOtherBob</a> 02:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is a Chinese street dictionary article. It describes what Ah Lian is, and then it lists external links. No notability. It's just a dictionary definition. <a href="../../../d/i/e/User%7EDiez2_aaaf.html" title="User:Diez2">Diez2</a> 03:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> A premise of this afd has an error. "Ah Lian" is commonly used in english language text.

<li><b>Weak delete</b> I stumbled across this one earlier when looking through the articles tagged as <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a>. The term is notable within a fairly large area but that really doesn't change the fact that it is just a slang term. Wikipedia contains many such slang terms so that in itself is not reason enough. However the article is not sourced good enough and if you remove the obvious original research really there isn't enough left to warrant an article on its own. Delete and make a new article summing up these terms without spreading it across several articles. Also keep in mind that Wikipedia is not a dictionary. Just because a word is notable does not mean it belongs in the English Wikipedia. But as I stated it is only a weak delete mainly based on the considerable number of Google hits for this. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinDK_6629.html" title="User:MartinDK">MartinDK</a> 08:08, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

Although he seems to have won internal teaching awards from his university, I really don't think that kind of thing can make a prof notable. The guy sounds like a great teacher, but that's not a reason to have an article on him in an encyclopedia -- even one that isn't paper. Has published a couple of books, but (1) nothing much is said about it in the article, and (2) that doesn't make his publication record especially much one way or the other. <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMangojuice_635d.html" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mangojuice_939a.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice"><font color="orange"><b>juice</b></font></a><sup><a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMangojuice_e07d.html" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a></sup> 04:08, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I just want to point out that most of the Google Scholar hits are citations, many of them in books. His single most cited work has 68 citations (1st hit), and that's a paper written 16 years ago.

As for the article itself, major cleanup is required, but the article seems likely to be genuine hagiography, not "utter nonsense" or a hoax.

<li><b>Keep</b> While I'll admit that I'm basing my opinion on what Yom has to believe (after all, his family comes from Ethiopia &amp; he should know whether St. Abba Samuel existed), this article illustrates a problem that we will encounter more &amp; more on Wikipedia: that there are some subjects whose veracity cannot be established with a Google search or taking a few minutes to consult an encyclopedia or other reference work.

This seems unlikely to be a hoax, since the school's website is verifiable on archive.org back to 2002 -- so I am inclined to believe this is true, but perhaps hard to verify -- for example, perhaps it's a local or regional term.<br />
I concur with other editors that we can't keep this unsourced, but I do just wonder whether it's worth not being hasty here. I have notified the user who created the article (this should really have been done before, as s/he appears to be a newcomer); hopefully s/he will be able to provide sources.

<dd>Apologies, I overlooked notifying the creator. As my editing history will show, notifying the creator after I afd-nom is something I routinely do, even with new users. This article was afd'd during my first session with new page patrol, and this put off my tempo/routine rather. Thanks to Haeleth for notifying the user, though I don't see my oversight or my nom statement as a violation of <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> at all. <a href="../../../b/w/i/User%7EBwithh_bfa1.html" title="User:Bwithh">Bwithh</a> 23:18, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<p>Looks like some park organization. My question I want to ask, is it notable enough in the sense of an <b>encyclopedia</b>. And if so, we need to cleanup the external link frenzy... and the article.

<p>The Neighborhood Parks Council is environmental organization representative of over 100 parks groups in San Francisco. There are many other environmental organizations listed in Wikipedia, so I don't see how this one is any different. I am new to Wikipedia, so any feedback is welcome.

</ul>
<p>The Neighborhood Parks Council is ten years old, and just celebrated its ten year anniversary. The organization is actually a coalition of several hundred park and green open space groups in San Francisco. Isabel Wade, founder of the organization, has been one of the most important green leaders in San Francisco, and is one of the founders of the Friends of the Urban Forest and also the National Aids Memorial Grove located in Golden Gate park. The organization is located at 451 Hayes Street in San Francisco. The phone number is 415.621.3260. With regard to content of the Wikipedia entry, efforts were made to use original language and not to replicate information available elsewhere on the web. Numerous links are now included in the article to other parks and relevant topics that are central to the work of this organization. Yes, the folks who created these entries are Wikipedia newbies and would very much appreciate feedback with regard to style, content, and linkage.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - The organization's existence is verifiable and it looks notable enough to me.

<dd>The article badly needs references to <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> external sources (i.e. not just the organization's own website) which can <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verify</a> the information in it.

<li><b>Reply</b> Thank you for these suggestions. Yes, I am a principle of NPC; my name is Wolfram Alderson, and I am Deputy Director of the Neighborhood Parks Council. One challenge with regard to external citations is that NPC is one of the leading sources of information with regard to neighborhood parks. There are many newspaper articles I can cite, and NPC is listed on the San Francisco Recreation and Parks official government website. I must admit that I am not too knowledgeable about how to create citations in wikipedia, but this is a welcome challenge.--<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> 19:35, 16 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> I have added some of the requested references to external sources.

<li><b>Comment</b> Firstly, I'd just like to say I'm impressed at the response to this AfD: Wikipedia conventions are always convoluted for those unfamiliar with the system, and <a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> is showing an admirable willingness to address concerns. Secondly, while I don't personally have an opinion on whether this organisation meets the criteria to have an article of its own (though I would say that notability could be established easily enough by the addition of some press citations), if the final consensus is that it does not then I would suggest that at the very least a summary be merged into <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parks_in_San_Francisco%2C_California_7535.html" title="Parks in San Francisco, California">Parks in San Francisco, California</a>, since this organisation does seem to be of some note in that context. (To avoid unbalancing the latter article, it would need expanding with summaries of the other organisations involved with SF parks; actually, it would rather benefit from that anyway...) — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a> <small><a href="../../../h/a/e/User_talk%7EHaeleth_7220.html" title="User talk:Haeleth">Talk</a></small> 23:25, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> Thanks for the nod from the latter contributor that acknowledges that we are trying to create a wikipedia entry of value that meets the standards of the wiki community. The comment from <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> that states <b>basically an ad</b> and the the comment from <a href="../../../j/a/m/User%7EJamesMLane_34be.html" title="User:JamesMLane">JamesMLane</a> that the organization <b>isn't of general importance</b> seem harsh to me. Please explain how our entry about an organization that has dedicated itself to greening the City of San Francisco for the last 10 years is less relevant (or more of an ad) than the entries in Wikipedia for the the <b>7-11</b> retail chain, <b>Charmin</b> toilet paper, or the <b>World Toilet Organization</b>? The Neighborhood Parks Council is considered a model for urban efforts to unite neighborhoods around their urban assets. We work tirelessly to bring resources and support to run-down urban parks in underserved neighborhoods. I am truly impressed at the level of democracy involved in the wikipedia community, and I am a willing and eager student with regard to bringing the NPC entry up to standards. Please note that I have added press citations, and can easily add more, but still feel gunshy from the comments that suggested there were too many external links.--<a href="../../../w/o/l/User%7EWolframald_d594.html" title="User:Wolframald">Wolframald</a> 01:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Perhaps "general importance" was the wrong term. I meant only that the organization isn't important enough, in the context of parks worldwide, to be linked to from the <a href="../../../p/a/r/Park.html" title="Park">Park</a> article. That article is about parks in general and shouldn't link to every organization anywhere that has anything to do with parks.

<li><b>Reply</b>With regard to reply by <a href="../../../r/i/c/User%7ERichMac_732c.html" title="User:RichMac">RichMac</a>, there are nearly 150 member groups under the Neighborhood Parks Council and 14,000 folks actively on our mailing list, many of whom, I'm sure, would like to contribute to the Neighborhood Parks Council wikipedia entry, but are unlikely to do so while the article is scheduled for deletion. Highlighting me as the "sole contributor," seems diminishing and hardly rewards an earnest effort being made to rise up to the standards of the community. There is a learning curve here, and the sheer element of time involved, so if you seek a diversity of points of view that will strengthen the NPC Wikipedia entry, then simply approve it, so we can move forward with improving upon the article. BTW, my "agenda" is (a) to be passionate about a topic (related to preserving, sustaining, and developing green open space) and (b) creating a wikipedia entry that is worthy and meets the standards of the wikipedia community. There are thousands of entries in Wikipedia that portray much more of conspicuous agendas than this entry being submitted by park/green open space advocates in San Francisco (see Wikipedia entries: <a href="../../../y/o/u/Young_Republicans_96d7.html" title="Young Republicans">Young Republicans</a>, <a href="../../../p/r/o/Pro-life.html" title="Pro-life">Pro-life</a>, the <a href="../../../r/e/v/Revolutionary_Communist_Party_6035.html" title="Revolutionary Communist Party">Revolutionary Communist Party</a>,or the <a href="../../../a/s/p/Asphalt.html" title="Asphalt">asphalt</a> entry that provides links to the National Asphalt Pavement Association. <a href="http://www.asphaltinstitute.org" class="external text" title="http://www.asphaltinstitute.org" rel="nofollow">The Asphalt Institute</a>).--216.102.91.242 14:40, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Of course I believe you bought the Schmidt chocs, though perhaps the Tokyo outlet is a franchisee or perhaps its been closed down?

<dd>I KNOW they're closed down because they weren't there LAST Valentine's Day, damnit -- though every other confectioner in Belgium and France seemed to have a store in the neighborhood, I swear. My point is, they WERE, at least briefly, international. And as for franchising, that's pretty much the only way into the Japanese market, as I understand it. The Japanese branches of the <a href="http://www.doughnutplant.com" class="external text" title="http://www.doughnutplant.com" rel="nofollow">Doughnut Plant</a> -- yes, the New York City doughnut maker -- and <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nathan%27s_Famous_63a1.html" title="Nathan's Famous">Nathan's Famous</a>, for example, are clearly not run by native English speakers, given the prose I see at their locations: the menu at Nathan's describes the chopped onions with the phrase "you can enjoy hard" -- as opposed to the soft grilled onions, is what they presumably mean.</dd>

<p>This article does not demonstrate that the subject yet meets our generally accepted <a href="../../../c/r/i/Wikipedia%7ECriteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies_b92b.html" title="Wikipedia:Criteria for inclusion of biographies">criteria for inclusion of biographies</a>. He is a published professor but all professors publish. There is no evidence that he passes the "average professor test".<br />

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I added that he is Assistant Professor. This is a weaker criterion for inclusion than full professor at a major university. He publishes actively (as the quest for tenure encourages). I do not see awards and honors listed, but it is interesting to see someone outside the physical sciences and mathematics analyzing the philosophical implications of the paradoxes in modern physics. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:26, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, but without third-party sources, we cannot properly verify the importance of his work. In fact, much of this article looks like <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a>. For example, there is no source for the statement, "<i>Lastly, Peter Lewis has shown formal inconsistencies in the conspiracy interpretation of quantum mechanics. While such interpretations are universally rejected, such a formal debilitating blow had yet to be stuck against them."</i> We have some fairly serious <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> issues here because of the lack of notability. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 16:57, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Conditional</b> delete: for living persons of uncertain notability, I lean towards deletion in respect of the subject's personal privacy. Then again, I seem to recall an extremely controversial Peter Lewis in academia; if he is one and the same, he is very notable, but as I see no mention of any controversy in this article, he is unlikely to be the person whom I'm thinking of. <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.140.173.15.html" title="User:69.140.173.15">69.140.173.15</a> 17:35, 25 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: But as I said above, we don't have any reliable sources that confirm even the theories are notable, much less the article subject. --&#160;<span style="font-family:Palatino Linotype"><a href="../../../s/a/t/User_talk%7ESatori_Son_3c62.html" title="User talk:Satori Son"><b>Satori Son</b></a></span> 22:14, 27 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Extremely strong keep</b> His interpretation of quantum mechanics is a notable one, &amp; not in the current mainstream, but taken seriously. At least 7 out of his 11 primary works are in the leading journals in the subject. The only thing lacking is that the editors of the article in question didnt put it strongly enough &amp; give enough sources. There have been many comments in academic and other journals. They should be sent a message to that effect. The last thing I'd worry about is personal privacy. <a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a> 04:31, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Question</b>: Will those arguing to keep this page commit to improving it or will this sit for another year unimproved? If someone will start working on it, I'll withdraw the nomination. (One editor has made some minor changes but the fundamental questions of sourcing and demonstration of notability <i>within</i> the article remain untouched.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <small><a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a></small> 04:45, 28 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - Google seems to back up the idea that it was nominated for a Hugo Award. Where these fall in the world of creative writing I'm not sure (and neither am I sure whether a nominee is as notable as, say, one for an Oscar), but it could well scrape over the line. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 06:13, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: If it was nominiated for a Hugo then it's notable.

<li><b>Comment</b> This story appeared in a magazine in 1974, and was selected for a "Year's Best SF" anthology too. I have no view on whether it should stay, because the criteria for keeping a work of fiction are not clear to me. However, in the absence of criteria I would say only rarely does a story justift an actual article, rather than mention in context; nothing in that way makes it notable. By the way, Hugos are as close to an Oscar as you can get in the written science fiction world, and only 5-6 items per category make the nomination list. <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotinasnaid_e8da.html" title="User:Notinasnaid">Notinasnaid</a> 10:44, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Going against the general consensus here, just becuase that's the kind of radical I am, but I also think this list would be extremely convenient to anyone who wants a quick reference of who's in what movie. Sure, it is "redundant" in that each character page says which movies they are in, but it seems much easier to come here if you're wanting to look this all up at once. I don't know the first thing about Harry Potter, and it makes sense to me (well, until you scroll down half-a-screen and can no longer see which movies the actors correspond with). And whoever created it, it looks like they put lot of hard work into putting this together.

<li><b>Keep</b>, not clear what this is redundant with. Is there another list?

<li><b>Keep</b> No problems with verifiability or reliable sources, and I could see how it could be useful to see at-a-glance who played who in what movie, especially since some of the roles have switched actors. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 15:33, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Redundancy is not an actual reason to delete, and this page does seem to serve a useful list in terms of looking at the information at a glance. Since this series is a book to movie, this may be useful to some folks who want to look at the appearance of a character in a movie versus the books.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I'm curious to know how a user in his first three edits nominated an article for deletion and was aware of the term "cruft." I don't think I learned the meaning of that word for at least two months into my Wikijourney. While I admit that I'm biased towards this article since I edit the page frequently (and gave it a complete make-over from when it was <i>really</i> a mess), I must say neutrally that this list serves a purpose just as any other. For those who suggest to merge into the film article or look at character entries, you aren't seeing the purpose of a list: to gather the information in one place, rather than having to diverge and get it at each individual article. Additionally, it is helpful to track the changes over time of a character (like Andrew Lenahan said), which is more difficult to do in a character article. I agree that the page should be renamed and that it could be cleaned-up to reflect differences from the book, but that does not merit discussion here. --<b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">Fbv</a></b><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">65</a><i><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_Esperanza_2f4a.html" title="User:Fbv65edel/Esperanza"><font color="green">e</font></a><a href="../../../f/b/v/User%7EFbv65edel_8a7f.html" title="User:Fbv65edel">del</a></i> / <a href="../../../f/b/v/User_talk%7EFbv65edel_60e2.html" title="User talk:Fbv65edel">☑t</a> / <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fbv65edel_f6f7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fbv65edel">☛c</a> || 23:07, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

Since movies 1-4 have been confirmed as completely on the IMDb, I cited that for the first four columns, and proceeded to copy and paste each individual ref from the <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_%28film%29_b646.html" title="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)</a> article, so that everybody appearing in the fifth column is cited after their name in the table.

<li><b>Keep</b> I just ran a LEXIS search, and it turned up 28 news sources using "Hutber's law," most of which use refer to the specific law. For example:
<ul>
<li>"Not a Credit to the Banks," Daily Mail, 12 April 1992, p. 6: referring to a problem with an upgrade to ATMs "What a fine example of the operation of Hutber's law - that improvements invariably make things worse."</li>
<li>"Leading Article: Figuring it Out," The Guardian, 15 April 1994, p. 21: "'another case of Hutber's law, that 'progress brings deterioration'".</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Appendix: Here are a few more citations to consider:
<ul>
<li>The Scotsman, 13 Sept. 1994: "One of the immutable laws of business, according to the late Patrick Hutber, one of the best regarded financial journalists, was that improvement meant deterioration."</li>
<li>Tim Satchell, "Patience is the hardest virtue: Tim Satchell explains why it took two years to secure the money he was owed," Daily Telegrah, 20 January 2001, p. 06: "[The] Woolf [reforms to the legal system] went the way of Hutber's Law, that great truism revealed by the City commentator Patrick Hutber who said, 'improvement means deterioration'"</li>
<li>"Pay any price to beat poverty," New Statesman, 26 November 2001, "Hutber's law, coined by a now deceased journalist, states: 'Improvement means deterioration.'"</li>

<li>Have you looked at the rapper's article?

<ul>
<li>A Wikipedia article is not a good reference. I do not agree with the bootstrap process, that he has an article, so all his albums are notable enough for articles, and then the albums have articles, so all the songs on them are notable enough for articles. The article for the artist also lacks references to show notability, other than links to numerous articles about his albums which are just lists of songs, and links to a couple of blogs. That article and his other album articles should be looked at for Afd as well in the future. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 20:30, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don't think anyone's actually saying that the <i>songs</i> are notable. Just that the artist and - therefore - the album is notable. There'd have to be better sources on the artist (certainly the liner notes of one of his albums which I have feature quotes from a series of performers explaining how influential he was, so it'd be a matter of tracking those down in a physical presence), and if it comes to it I'm willing to brave underground hip-hop fandom and hunt them out. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigHaz_ff65.html" title="User:BigHaz">BigHaz</a> - <a href="../../../b/i/g/User_talk%7EBigHaz_db77.html" title="User talk:BigHaz">Schreit mich an</a> 22:46, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, redirect and briefly mention in the <a href="../../../e/s/h/Esham.html" title="Esham">Esham</a> article. While the (somewhat controversial) consensus on WP:Music is that albums generally get their own article, this stretches that point. This article is just a track listing of a compilation album. Unless there is some evidence that the compilation itself is somehow independently significant, I suggest that WP would not be diminished if the Esham article merely mentioned that he released a compilation/greatest hits album in 1996. Not every repackaging of previous material needs an article. -<a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">ave</a>)</i> 04:22, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I've reviewed the content which Aecis restored, but I still don't see any claim to notability <i>for the band</i> "Crash My Model Car". The band which begat this one - Poor Old Ben - might have been notable, and might belong at their own page, but this one hasn't gone on tour or released an album yet. (This does sort of bring up a bit of a philosophical question of when a band is still "the same band" - if all of the members are replaced, but the name stays, is it still the same band? If the name changes? etc, etc.) <a href="../../../z/e/t/User%7EZetawoof_384b.html" title="User:Zetawoof">Zetawoof</a><sup>(<a href="../../../z/e/t/User_talk%7EZetawoof_febf.html" title="User talk:Zetawoof">ζ</a>)</sup> 21:28, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Well, the article looks more interesting now, but none of the information is backed up by any secondary sources, and, very tellingly, neither of the names "Crash My Model Car" <i>nor</i> "Poor Old Ben" turn up anything on Allmusic! "Poor Old Ben" has a listing on last.fm, but no listeners at this moment, and their top track peaked at 13 listeners in the last six months. I found a reference that Poor Old Ben played at a festival in Glasgow, but...lots of obscure bands get booked into festivals. I'm fond of trying to salvage band articles, but in this case, I see one album under a different name (and no sign the album was on a major or "important indie" label), and one <i>planned</i> album on an important indie. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> wants <i>two</i> released albums on a major or important indie. Even with the restored information, they still seem to fall far short of meeting our notability guidelines. <a href="../../../x/t/i/User%7EXtifr_63b5.html" title="User:Xtifr">Xtifr</a> <sub><a href="../../../x/t/i/User_talk%7EXtifr_6312.html" title="User talk:Xtifr">tälk</a></sub> 21:50, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> Wikipedia is not a Gen Tree means that we should not make trees of non-notable people, having non-notable relatives. That is an extension of WP:NOT indiscriminate info. However, this does not included royalties, since almost all people in royalty houses are notable. This would not include single notable people with lots of NN relatives, but as said, being notable and having lots of notable people does merit a gen tree on WikiPedia. Just look att <a href="../../../f/a/m/Category%7EFamily_trees_5107.html" title="Category:Family trees">Category:Family trees</a> and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_family_trees.html" title="List of family trees">List of family trees</a>. Now, with this said, the family of Umar is about as notable as you get in Sunni Islam. He is a <a href="../../../r/a/s/Rashidun.html" title="Rashidun">Rashidun</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>, all his same-timed relatives are also <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a> and his daughter is a <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mother_of_the_Believers_d3a2.html" title="Mother of the Believers">Mother of the Believers</a>. His son is also an important <a href="../../../s/a/h/Sahaba.html" title="Sahaba">Sahaba</a>, and his grandsons are <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salaf.html" title="Salaf">Salaf</a>. Also, his genealogy back is relevant, Muslim biographies often include this to show distance relationship with Muhammad. Sunni Muslim are proud to carry the name even today. He had also several wives. This information is notable and accurate, having Gen Trees in WikiPedia is established in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_family_trees.html" title="List of family trees">List of family trees</a>, and there is no one disputing the notability of Umar's family. --<a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">Striver</a> 11:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> article lacks any context. Who is this Umar guy, what makes him important, and why does it matter what his family tree was? From the links, it <i>appears</i> to be about this <a href="../../../u/m/a/Umar.html" title="Umar">Umar</a>, <s>in which case it would be notable just like <a href="../../../b/r/i/British_monarchs%27_family_tree.html" title="British monarchs' family tree">British monarchs' family tree</a></s>. On closer inspection, it seems that his successor was elected, rather than succeeding him through relation like the Windsors, so I don't see the relevance of this article, unless Islam places some special significance on family trees/genealogy? <a href="../../../d/e/m/User%7EDemiurge_afbf.html" title="User:Demiurge">Demiurge</a> 11:42, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li>Yes, he was elected, but its not like "Bush vs Kerry" elected, Umar was connected to Muhammad via marriage, and so was the two "finalists" in the election after him. family played an important role back then.

I <i>do</i> doubt that this is merit for inclusion in wikipedia. For instance, in the department where I study, this could be said about most professors. However, how many of them appear in wikipedia? one (<a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_Unruh_71ff.html" title="Bill Unruh">Bill Unruh</a>). Having numerous publications, including those in peer reviewed journals is something nearly everyone in academia can claim, and therefore, unless you believe we must list everyone in academia, is insufficient grounds for keeping. I would also call attention to the fact that <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">User:Mark Dingemanse</a> who made the above comment is, except for anons and a now-inactive user, the only editor of <a href="../../../r/o/g/Roger_Blench_e178.html" title="Roger Blench">Roger Blench</a> and has been accused of <i>being</i> Roger Blench on the article's talk page. Not that I believe that, but I think it accurately reflects whether or not above user can be counted on for being objective in this case. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarm_d458.html" title="User:Marm"><font color="green">Marm</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarm_0191.html" title="User talk:Marm">t</a>)</sup> 23:14, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>That is quite a remarkable argumentation in an AfD. First, if you want to suggest that I want to keep the article because I'm sympathetic to Blench in person or something, I think you should look at <i>what</i> edits I have made to the article (and read the talk page more closely). Second, do you really want to imply that the vote of 'regular' editors (hardly a fitting appelation in my case, but okay) of an article should have less weight in an AfD? I think you should assume good faith, and assume that such editors may actually know <i>better</i> why the subject of the article would be notable (or not) than a passerby who nominates it for AfD.</dd>
<dd>I do agree however that not every academic should be included in Wikipedia. My vote simply reflects my opinion that Blench is notable enough for this article to be kept now that it has been created (even though I wouldn't have created it myself). — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 15:58, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I'm confused: you don't think this article should have been created, yet you think it should be kept? That makes little sense to me.</dd>
<dd>I agree with your point in regards to frequent editors. I just felt you being the <i>only</i> named editor perhaps reflected your seeing something notable where no one else did. For an extreme example, see Kenneth Wajda (linked here so that it may perhaps catch an admin's eye and be erased more expediently!).<a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMarm_d458.html" title="User:Marm"><font color="green">Marm</font></a><sup>(<a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMarm_0191.html" title="User talk:Marm">t</a>)</sup> 08:44, 21 November 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it shouldn't have been created, I was just saying that I wouldn't have created it myself (in my editing I usually focus on languages, not on linguists); I said that just to make clear that I really don't have a stake in this (I'm not trying to save my valuable edits or something like that). And trust me, I'm more of a deletionist than an inclusionist, in my own field as much as in other fields. — <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Dingemanse_1cc9.html" title="User:Mark Dingemanse">mark</a> <a href="../../../m/a/r/User_talk%7EMark_Dingemanse_c686.html" title="User talk:Mark Dingemanse">✎</a> 09:01, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Cautious Keep</b> - I don't hold a particularly strong view, but I created the article originally (only a tiny stub - others have since added more information), so thought I'd throw in my thoughts. "Doxbridge" got around 300 google hits when I created it, almost all referring to the sports tournament. It now, suprisingly, gets about 4,800 hits, although a lot of these will be linked back to the article I created. However, its use has definantly increased and most of the hits again refer to the Doxbridge tournament. As someone at Cambridge (who has never been to Durham University) who hates the idea of Durham being compared to Oxbridge (it's NOT, I live in a village outside of Durham and hate it when people do this), I think the article actually clarifies that this is just a sports tournament. Indeed, one of the main reasons for creating the article was that by firmly attatching the view that "Doxbridge" = "sports tournament" (which is the truth) we could prevent the term "Doxbridge" being used to infer a greater affiliation if it were left to float around and attatch its own meanings. Note that "Doxbridge" links to the article. It's a win-win situation in my opinion. <a href="../../../l/o/g/User%7ELogica_1d41.html" title="User:Logica">Logica</a> 01:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Reverting myself after looking through this a bit more. 1. I agree with the majority sentiment that the idea doesn't sound workable, as Nuttah68 points out, the risk that main article and summary diverge is too big. 2. Both the idea and the deletion should be discussed in a different forum. I don't see why this, if workable, should be restricted to labor-related articles, and, if it is not considered workable, why labor-related articles should be an exception. So while I note that while the idea did not find supporters here I do not consider AfD the right spot to discuss this. Consider <a href="../../../r/f/c/WP%7ERFC_94fc.html" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFC</a> or <a href="../../../v/p/_/WP%7EVP_dc2f.html" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a> instead. <b>No action</b>. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 05:58, 29 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This is a list of CSI Episodes in the order that they were broadcast by one South Korean network. It adds no encyclopedic information, and is about one step up from a TV broadcast schedule. These are not *Korean* episodes of CSI (that would be something), they are just regular American CSI episodes broadcast by <a href="../../../m/u/n/Munhwa_Broadcasting_Corporation_492e.html" title="Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation">MBC</a>. Furthermore, MBC is not even the only South Korean network to broadcast CSI, which makes this list even less relevant.

<p><b>Undelete</b> Akybonko This is still a work in progress and I'm still learning the ropes of using Wikipedia's code. Give me more time to work on this. Also, a comic hosted on deviantArt is no less important than one that has its own site.</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>Comment</b>: The problem is not the code, the problem is the notability of the comic. A webcomic on its own wite gets usually deleted as well. What we need is major independent awards, publication on paper by a major publisher (not a vanity press or somesuch), reviews in independent, peer-reviewed magazines or journals, or other clear indications (per <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>) that the comic is important, notable, of encyclopedic value. This does not indicate if the comic is good or bad, popular or not, but just shows the verifiable impact it has made outside of its site, fan forums, blogs, ... <a href="../../../f/r/a/User%7EFram_5082.html" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> 21:46, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Non-notable Flash cartoon. Lots of Google hits due to common terms, but nearly all are blogs or Newgrounds-type links. No major citations in first 100 results or so.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Why? If they are deleted for not being notable enough for inclusion, why would the company behind them somehow become notable?

<li><b>Weak delete</b> Yes, there should be a standard established such as number of views to judge stuff which only appeared on the internet and was never written about in books, magazines or newspapers.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> - I don't know if it's popular enough to be an internet meme (though there definitely seem to be a lot of spinoffs on Youtube).

On another note... <b>comment</b>: I find MikeWazowski's suggestion that there is a Robert Benfer conspiracy afoot to be a rather serious one, and I challenge him to provide some proof of it or else strike out his words (the suggestion seems to be that the constant recreation of articles related to Robert Benfer is a sign of a concerted effort by a small group of people to get him on wikipedia, rather than an unrelated effort by many people owing to his large fanbase, which, according to <a href="../../../d/p/_/WP%7EDP_58bd.html" title="WP:DP">WP:DP</a>, may be a sign of the need for an article). <a href="../../../e/s/n/User%7EEsn_d244.html" title="User:Esn">Esn</a> 19:05, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Unconcerned either way</b>, however I note that evidence for notability is very easy to find. Just searching the www.witchvox.com site (the leading pagan/wiccan current affairs/networking site) if find three articles about the pejorative use of this term: <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&amp;c=words&amp;id=8424" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usma&amp;c=words&amp;id=8424" rel="nofollow">[47]</a>, <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=words&amp;id=8598" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=words&amp;id=8598" rel="nofollow">[48]</a>, <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=words&amp;id=8963" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.witchvox.com/va/dt_va.html?a=usny&amp;c=words&amp;id=8963" rel="nofollow">[49]</a>. There are many more passing references to it on that site, and I'm sure there will be articles on the subject in printed pagan books and journals as well. Some of these articles also describe attempts to reclaim the term as a positive identifier, information which could make for an interesting article, and one that goes beyond mere dictionary definition. This is a very widespread term, instantly recognisable by neopagans in any English-speaking country. Merely resenting the term is not necessarily a reason for deleting the article. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a><big><a href="../../../f/u/z/User_talk%7EFuzzypeg_e470.html" title="User talk:Fuzzypeg"><font color="#3399FF">☻</font></a></big> 01:51, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - Google search on ("Dark Star" WCCO) brings up plenty of hits, with news articles from actual papers among them. Article needs to be re-written, but there's enough out there to meet notability guidelines, IMHO. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRealFennShysa_6315.html" title="User:TheRealFennShysa">TheRealFennShysa</a> 19:42, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>. I did a Google search too, but couldn't find anything that looked like a substantial press mention. A merge might work, too, and I might change my mind to "keep" if bonafide <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> references can be produced, but even then I'd want to see a substantial rewrite to get rid of the self-promotional and "silly" language, like, "In his own opinion and agreed to by many regular listeners, Dark Star stole every moment he's been on the radio."

<li><b>Delete</b> per Elonka. I guess all the air-headed twaddle on how great this guy is does collectively represent an assertion of notability, unfortunately.

<dd><b>Comment</b> for those suggesting merge I just pared down the article to anything that could be considered note worthy. Basically its just his name and air time, which sounds like an ad.

<p>Article pertains to a film which is due for release (and this is imdb's best guess) in 2009. I have deleted the external links section of the article as it was totally irrelevant. The only source given is a couple of paragraphs on a page about many projects. The source doesn't support some of the assertions made about the content of the film. This seems to breach <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. At this stage I would question the project's notability and suggest the article is deleted until there is some verifiable information and it is at least out of development stage and in production <a href="../../../m/a/l/User%7EMallanox_1ced.html" title="User:Mallanox">Mallanox</a> 18:53, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - this is an irrelevant reference - there are plenty of references that are based on a belief in the existence of this angel; the question is whether Wikipedia is the right forum to judge whether these exist (and as I say below I am not qualified to decide but am willing to bow to the views of editors who are qualified to pronounce on the existence of specific angels). <a href="../../../t/e/r/User%7ETerriersFan_e633.html" title="User:TerriersFan">TerriersFan</a> 22:23, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Ambriel has plenty of references. If we are to eliminate anything not provable. e.g. <a href="../../../g/o/d/God.html" title="God">God</a> etc that's fine but if not then this one has 'multiple non-trivial mentions'.

<li><b>Comment</b> You have given more information than this stub (or that I teased out of google). Helpful. But since the article says little, I'd still suggest a delete or redirect until someone can provide a NPOV article with references.

<li>Sorry, you're wildly mis-interpreting what these policies mean... the policy on verification says quite clearly <i>"The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth."</i> What we're looking for is a reliable source that says "Here is the main view of what this thing is." That's the "undue weight" part of the bias guideline (a.k.a neutral point of view.) If there are not substantial, serious, independant sources for this we can't be sure that we're not giving too much credibility to what one fringe source says. The fortune city version is just something someone whacked on the internet, it doesn't have any provenance. - 152.91.9.144 01:24, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not sure of whether those charts mentioned count as "national music charts" for the purposes of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, or if winning the Belgian Junior Eurovision pre-selection counts as "winning a major music competition", but I'm inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> Only 256 Google hits is rather non-notable, but top selling record in a country IS notable. More deserving of an article than 99% of the garage bands and amateur musicians putting articles about themselves and their albums on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 00:55, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (full disclosure: I created the article). I waited until I was sure he could have an article. Winning the Belgian preselection for the <a href="../../../j/u/n/Junior_Eurovision_Song_Contest_8c8d.html" title="Junior Eurovision Song Contest">Junior Eurovision Song Contest</a> which was on national television in Belgium was what put him on my radar for an article, but reaching number 1 in the Flemish Top 10 and coming in reasonably high in multiple other Belgian music charts is what makes him pass <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and made me decide to write the article. Google hits alone is not a good indicator of encyclopedic value. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:35, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>A more detailed look into <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>: With those chart ratings (#1) I have no doubt the gold certified record is forthcoming in weeks.(#2, crystal-ballery for now) He was also the subject of multiple news publications (#5) in for example national newspapers. He placed in a major music competition (#9). The Junior Eurovision Song Contest is televized to millions of people in multiple countries. And his chart positions cannot be possible with him getting air time on national radio (#11). By my count that's four points on which he passes WP:MUSIC. Website publications are scarce, but I used every one I could find to source the article. - <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="../../../m/a/c/User_talk%7EMacGyverMagic_9394.html" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 13:43, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What's with the attitude about somebody improving an article. Deletionism is great. It takes just seconds to whip up an AfD that says "non-notable" and it takes just a fraction of a second to type up "delete". Then you just sit on your behind and hope no one notices that the AfD is unjustified. Then when someone actually does some productive work and adds to the article, you can slip in a snotty comment that enough has not been done to meet your standards. If only you could paid for this. Do articles or notability have an expiration date, and if so, do you have a source for this or is this another rule you just made up? <a href="../../../a/l/a/User%7EAlansohn_f91e.html" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> 22:52, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Not many schools meet my criteria for keeping, but this one does. It participated in an 8 year study to develop "progressive education" in which the curriculum is made relevant to the problems of society. What is more surprising is that this took place from 1933 through 1941.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Why can't we have the dignity to wait, say 24 hours or even a few days or weeks, before we start the train wreck towards AfD, and allow an opportunity for a properly constructed article to be developed. That said, the school has played a major role in influencing education standards in its regional area, through participation in a groundbreaking experiment for alternative admission standards for admission to 200 selective colleges in the 1930's, which would qualify it under the "substantial and unique program, structure, or technique" criterion 4 of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a>. The school was founded in 1919, which qualifies under <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOL_1b63.html" title="WP:SCHOOL">WP:SCHOOL</a> criterion 2's 50-year standard. And the multiple mentions in major articles in <i><a href="../../../t/h/e/The_New_York_Times_8b14.html" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> over the span of several decades would meet the "multiple non-trivial coverage" qualifications of criteria 1. As such, I believe that it is clear that the article meets and far exceeds the standards for retention of <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCHOOLS_e731.html" title="WP:SCHOOLS">WP:SCHOOLS</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a superb, nicely referenced article on a school that qualifies for inclusion per various comments above and based on the numerous essays, defunct proposals and other competing pseudo guidelines on schools at wikipedia. I don't know what motivated an AfD nomination only a few hours after the article was submitted and without any attempt at dialogue. I do know that google hits and the school's size are irrelevant and the nominator's undocumented assertion regarding "notability" has been proven false. Would suggest a withdrawal of the nomination, or a revised argument with at least a token attempt at explaining why it is "non-notable". --<a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 23:10, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Washington Online Learning Institue ("WOLI") is indeed accredited by the prestigious Middle States Association. This information may not appear on Middle States' website because the website has not yet been updated, and for no other reason. You may confirm the fact of accreditation by contacting Middle States Association. You may speak with the head of the organization, Hank Cram, who will confirm that WOLI is accredited by MSA. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Koplen (<a href="../../../k/o/p/User_talk%7EKoplen_32ea.html" title="User talk:Koplen">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Koplen_93be.html" title="Special:Contributions/Koplen">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>Calling somebody up is not a source, and just because there's no phone number. Any formal announcement by Middle States on their website or via a press release, or any supporting article in a publication, would go a long way to satisfying the <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> requirements needed to justify this article. If the claim is true, and its supported, I think you've established notability as the first online school to receive such accreditation. P.S.

<p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Henry (Hank) G. Cram, Ed.D.</p>
<p>Dr. Cram was appointed Executive Director of the Middle States Commission on Secondary Schools (MSCSS) in July of 2005 following a long affiliation with MSA as a member of the Strategic Planning Advisory Committee, chair of both domestic and overseas evaluation teams, and representative for the Association at various conferences.</p>
<p>Dr. Cram has been involved in education for over 35 years. Prior to his appointment as Executive Director, Dr. Cram served as the Director of Staff Development for the New Jersey Association of School Administrators (NJASA). He has held a variety of teaching and administrative positions in New York and New Jersey including Superintendent of Schools for the Rancocas Valley Regional School District from 1988 to 2003. In addition, he has been a part-time lecturer at the Rutgers Graduate School of Education and an Instructor in the New Jersey Provisional Teacher Program at Rowan University.</p>
<p>Dr. Cram holds degrees from William Paterson University, Montclair State University, Fordham University and a doctorate in Educational Administration from Rutgers University. He has served as a consultant to school districts on a variety of topics and is the author of numerous works, including two books on change in public education and brain-based instructional practices.</p>
<p>Dr. Cram can be reached at hcram@css-msa.org or 215-662-5603 x5044 / Direct Dial: 267-284-5044 <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.193.47.226 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.193.47.226_336e.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.193.47.226">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li>Dr. Cram seems to be an excellent candidate for a Wikipedia article. I do not doubt Dr. Cram's identity, role or integrity. But we need to see a source from Middle States or an independent entity that confirms that accreditation has been granted.

<p>Yes I agree selling Chitosan should be added, also the tax case is true and if someone wants to add it that is great, I served a 2 1/2 year sentence in Duluth MN Federal Prson and Florence CO, my inmate # is also available on BOP.GOV, I did only serve 16 months and all taxes have been cleared. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../6/9/2E/User%7E69.179.43.203.html" title="User:69.179.43.203">69.179.43.203</a> (<a href="../../../6/9/2E/User_talk%7E69.179.43.203.html" title="User talk:69.179.43.203">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_69.179.43.203_f9a8.html" title="Special:Contributions/69.179.43.203">contribs</a>).</small></p>

He might be experienced and talented, but I still have the impression that he is more or less a 'local' phenomenon. If sources can be found to prove that he has gained nationwide coverage more than just a few times, I'd reconsider. The <a href="../../../m/o/n/Montreal_Mirror_04c2.html" title="Montreal Mirror">Montreal Mirror</a> has approx 285.000 readers (their own estimate), but for a nation with a population of more than 30 million this is rather low in my eyes.

<p><b>Delete</b> I'm not sure where to start with this one. It seems to be a list defined by very spotty and vague critera. The start of the article "Few of the following would qualify as <a href="../../../n/e/o/Neologism.html" title="Neologism">neologisms</a> from a strict lexicological perspective" - so why have neologism in the title? More than that, I see no way that it can claimed that anything but two or three of those are actually notable or used in the real world without engaging in original research. I'd also argue that it fails under WP:NOT as the vague wooly criteria means that it's pretty indiscrimate in what could be included <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharlesknight_2ce5.html" title="User:Charlesknight">Charlesknight</a> 20:57, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Revise</b> On the one hand, I think it's true that lots of the article is pointless - listing Frink's phrases or Burns' mis-words does no good to anyone. On the other hand, there are a few entries that should definitely be inclued in any tome on The Simpsons, such as Cromulent and D'Oh, which have a life beyond the show (and I think are real neologism?) So I would propose that the page stands but is radically revised to include only words which meet a chosen criteria, and I think "words or phrases which are used more than once" would be suitable, and would leave only the sorts of things that people are likely to want to look up --<a href="../../../m/o/r/User%7EMortice_2b16.html" title="User:Mortice">Mortice</a> 22:38, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> I'd say the criteria is pretty clear, it's a unique word or phrase used on the Simpsons television. Given the extensive cultural pervasiveness of this show, it certainly helps to have a list of words unique to it. I don't know if neologism is the right term for it, but that would be a cause to rename, not delete. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 22:40, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Every single one? Nope, but then we don't need to keep every single one to keep this whole article. See above, for some that I would say would qualify as an article in itself, or within the episode. So, the information would be kept somewhere. So, is there anything wrong with having it here as well? No, because redundancy is part of good presentation. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:59, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong keep but shorten</b> There are certainly a lot of highly notable neologisms created on the show, and I absolutely love the idea of this list existing. With that said, I completely agree that it's far too long and contains too many words/phrases that will never be heard again. Yet I think it would be terrible if WP lost this article altogether. -- <a href="../../../k/i/c/User%7EKicking222_efec.html" title="User:Kicking222">Kicking222</a> 22:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> but prune, as everyone else says -- but I think we could have the "major" words (i.e. the famous ones that have a life of their own outside the show, like "Yoink", "Cromulent" and "Car Hole") in one section, each with its own sub-heading, and the generic rest in a three-column table with each row containing the word, a <i>brief</i> definition, and the episode it was used in. Probably also change the title, since in many cases the show didn't <i>create</i> the word... <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave-ros_0552.html" title="User:Dave-ros">Dave-ros</a> 09:54, 23 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>In addition to what I said before, maybe instead of keeping the lesser words in a table, have some spiel in the intro about the huge number of compound, nonsense and quasi-words the show comes up with (and list a <b>few</b> of them), and have the main article for the notable words. <a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDave-ros_0552.html" title="User:Dave-ros">Dave-ros</a> 11:15, 26 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and Prune</b> There are many more entries that are less important that would never get deleated. Moreover, Though it may be useless to some, may be important to someone else. For example, someone who is doing a report on the impact of Television on modern languages may use much of the information here to prove there point. There dose need to be a more established criteria though. As for sources, I would recomend that (1) The episode the word neologism was given (though in some cases it would be almost all of them) and (2) Any external source that the word was used in every-day speach.</li>

<li>Kafenio was the first e-zine about Europe</li>
<li>About half the travel e-zines are patterned after it</li>
<li>It had the highest readership of all travel zines that ever were on the net</li>
<li>Was recommended by Writers Digest as one of the best zines to contribute to 3 years in a row mostly due to readership and notability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if those are not notable facts I wonder what is.
<p>Because most of the documentation available is only on the net I decided to write an e-mail to the former publisher for information, which as far as I learned is a standard way of research. If needed I can produce these e-mails.</p>
<p>The question I have is if this is really about Kafenio, or, if Kafenio is removed, SteveHopson is right about the lack of notability of Roberta Beach Jacobson below.</p>

To its credit, it had an ISSN and editors paid writers (on acceptance), a rarity in those years. This entry should remain.

<li>The Article is not yet finished, additionally I am working on a list of about 30 books she either edited or collaborated on, some of them featured in Articles with her name in Wiklipedia. It will take a little longer to get all ISBN numbers together. <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERough_6479.html" title="User:Rough">rough</a> 21:58, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> (for now). Generally, giving an article less than four hours (especially when it is obviously being worked on) before nominating it for deletion is bad form. <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 07:18, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Note to Caknuck: Please check the logs before concluding 'bad form.' The article was actually created on Nov 12 and Speedily Deleted on that day. My decision to nominate for deletion was to give the article the benefit of a longer discussion period. The article was also not 'obviously being worked on' as the only changes since inception were minor in nature. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 23:11, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This appeared to be a bad faith nom b/c it was you who speedied the first instance of the article, and then AfD'ed it right after it was recreated. (The logs don't reflect <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERough_6479.html" title="User:Rough">Rough</a>'s request.) I was concerned that your quick trigger on the AfD, along with your nomination of another one of Rough's articles (Kafenio) was verging on "beating up the new editor". <i>If I got the wrong impression, then I apologize.</i> <a href="../../../c/a/k/User%7ECaknuck_4acf.html" title="User:Caknuck">Caknuck</a> 05:40, 21 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I nominated the article for deletion because I did not think the subject is notable. Because the article is a recreation of a previously deleted one, it was eligible for Speedy Delete, but I submitted for AfD to give it the benefit a full discussion. I resent your accusation and the facts that your comments make this a personal discussion, rather than a discussion of the merits of the article. Yes, Caknuck, you got it wrong and owe me an apology. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteveHopson_68d6.html" title="User:SteveHopson">SteveHopson</a> 05:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note to SteveHobson: The version of Nov 12 was speedily deleted, and I asked for deletion because I could not produce more than a stub, which-as I learned is uncool around here (Then again, I think it was the Nov 13, on the 12 I was travelling)The new version was exactly 4 hours old when the deletion note flashed. <a href="../../../r/o/u/User%7ERough_6479.html" title="User:Rough">Rough</a> 00:05, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><s><b>Abstain as nominator, for now</b></s> This article appears to have been created to give a place to put contested material that the community is not allowing at the <a href="../../../r/o/m/Romano_Prodi_32bc.html" title="Romano Prodi">Romano Prodi</a> article. I think the question needs to be raised here: Is a Member of the European Parliament automatically notable? (The EP has a pretty low profile, doesn't really do much, so I'm yet to be convinced on that point.) If not, is Batten notable on his own, either for these allegations that haven't gotten much traction, or for some other reason? --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:29, 19 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Actually I was wrong about the creation of the article; it was created back in '04 and the Prodi stuff wasn't added until April of this year. I think the questions still deserve discussion. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 21:35, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Well, <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> says "Political figures holding or who have held international, national or statewide/provincewide office, and members and former members of a national, state or provincial legislature." I have no real opinion about the European Parliment's status, but it is a international legislative body, so I think Members pass. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 23:41, 19 November 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. Current European-level parliamentarians cannot evade being notable and their entries encyclopedic. I am going to remove the AfD: there is clear consensus (both by convention and as evidenced here) and it is unlikely to change without an overall policy change. – <a href="../../../k/a/i/User%7EKaihsu_59f0.html" title="User:Kaihsu">Kaihsu</a> 15:31, 22 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> you can't remove the notice without closing the AfD. I wouldn't object to an early close with a result of <i>keep</i>, but formally speaking the AfD has not been closed, so I restored the notice. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 22:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Another comment</b> it seems that a lot of people misunderstand the AfD notice at the top of the article; Kaishu mentioned "removing the AfD", but in fact all he did was remove the notice telling people <i>about</i> the AfD and where to find it. --<a href="../../../t/r/o/User%7ETrovatore_c393.html" title="User:Trovatore">Trovatore</a> 22:33, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>(While this is the second nom for an article under this title, it's the first nom for an article on this exact subject; the former article was only tangentially related to this one, apparently.) Maybe it's just me, but I don't see how a slip of the tongue by <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_%28journalist%29_fc2e.html" title="Bill O'Reilly (journalist)">Bill O'Reilly</a> during one interview segment two and a half years ago is somehow worthy of a Wikipedia article, unless you were just using it as an attack article, that is. <b>Delete</b> as total <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> failure that exists only to disparage its subject. <a href="../../../a/a/r/User%7EAaron_8aa3.html" title="User:Aaron">Aaron</a> 21:48, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. People who are curious about the subject and whether or not it exists could very well look to Wikipedia. The article could be improved in terms of reducing POV, but it is informative. I'd be OK with merging it with <a href="../../../b/i/l/Bill_O%27Reilly_controversies_bce5.html" title="Bill O'Reilly controversies">Bill O'Reilly controversies</a> as well, but it's certainly not the least notable independent article on the site. There is a degree of Internet popularity for the phrase, including parody sites. Also, the idea that it is merely a "slip of the tongue" gives O'Reilly too much credit, as he invented the publication and the things it supposedly said to support his point of view. It's not as if he slipped and said "Paris" instead of "French" but his point remained valid: his point was wrong and he cited a periodical that does not exist to bolster it. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECroctotheface_7023.html" title="User:Croctotheface">Croctotheface</a> 00:09, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Charles above labels a contributor as "vandal" with too flimsy grounds. Actually, this article (written by the so-called "vandal" in Charles' designations) is a rather neutral piece of work, as to giving several essential alternatives. The only thing I really deplore in this article is the problematical opposition to "self-taken" titulary of Vladimirovichi branch (for NPOV reasons, we allow all pretenders to be mentioned with their title of pretension here, and that should be allowed to Vladimirovichi too). However, all that information (excluding the POV details) should be added to the already existing article <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_throne_85bc.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian throne">Line of succession to the Russian throne</a> (where all the relevant information is not yet covered, contrary to Charles' above-expressed opinion); however preferably through discussion at the talk page. <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_Throne_f8b6.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian Throne">Line of succession to the Russian Throne</a> should be a redirect only, as there "Throne" does not need to be written with capital letter. A problem is that Charles, above, blindly reverts edits of the editor he sees as "vandal". I support deletion only because <a href="../../../f/o/r/Fork.html" title="Fork">forks</a> should be deleted. When now having an occasion to comment, I beseech Charles to use talk pages to discuss about differences, not edit summaries; I beseech Charles not to revert on sight despite of his heated feelings (and presumably blindly); and I ask Charles to refrain from name callings and other sorts of personal attacks. This AfD proposal (see the text Charles wrote above) includes clear personal attacks. Also, I request <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWikipediatrix_b60b.html" title="User:Wikipediatrix">User:Wikipediatrix</a> to check the language (s)he used above. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 23:38, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Hardly a rant Charles. But, why do so many people have a problem with you? Tim Foxworth 16:47, 22 November 2006 (UTC) Don't worry about it Shilkanni- Charles has a problem with everyone who doesn't agree with him. He does know it all after all! Tim Foxworth 17:37, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>Oh, I am not at all worrying about that. There is no such worry that Charles "knows it all" upon this matter. On the contrary. (He of course has strong opinions...) The worry is rather that he does not know enough to even recognize what is correct and what is not in this complex substance matter. After all, Charles himself wrote ten days ago: "I was wondering how much you know about the <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_Throne_f8b6.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian Throne">Line of succession to the Russian Throne</a>... The article was basically a botch job of messy titles and names and loaded sentence structure. I've done a quick little fix up on it, but I do not know enough about the theoretical line of succession to verify its accuracy. If you know, would you be able to add anyone who is missing and correct the names if they are wrong? I tried to truncate the give names to what the individuals actually use but I am unfamiliar for the most part. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 00:21, 10 November 2006 (UTC)" (copied from John Kenney's talk page, a person who knows at least something more than Charles) <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 22:27, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>What I would really like to know is why Charles was allowed to do a "quick little fix up" without discussion, yet I was not. Only Charles is allowed to make edits without consulting anyone? Tim Foxworth 16:34, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>You obviously feel that you are exempt from the "advice" that you dish out to others. I do not proclaim to know everything, but I feel I know enough about a situation to find the obvious errors even when I cannot expand upon the accuracies. I also know enough that it is wrong to apply surnames to people who do not use such names and that it is vandalism when a user reverts back to those incorrect names. I also know that is incorrect to give a lower title and style to a pretender when they use no other title and style and that it is incorrect to treat such claimants assymetrically. My primary worry is that we have a relatively experienced user (you) with some valid things to say but who has no qualms about displaying an obvious grudge and we have another who has done nothing thus far but vandalise articles even as he <i>may</i> be contributing. <a href="../../../c/f/v/User%7ECfvh_2f59.html" title="User:Cfvh">Charles</a> 22:50, 20 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All of your conjecture is POV Charles. As far as pretenders using titles they are not entitled to- I see nothing wrong with using both, as long as it explained why and sources can be found for both usages- which I did. Nice try though. Tim Foxworth 16:28, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I understand what you are saying, but it seems only a chosen few are allowed to edit without consulting other first. When the uninformed (Charles) do so they are allowed. Why not let those who actually know a bit about the subject matter do so as well? Just my POV. And it is not a blatant POV fork- at least my work was sourced- which the current editors have cited as their own, and I doubt they have read any of the source material. Charles admitted as much "I've done a quick little fix up on it, but I do not know enough about the theoretical line of succession to verify its accuracy."

<dd>Nobody has authorized Charles to edit over others. The situation is just that some people are more obstinate or more destructive or not willing/capable to analyze the actual issues on talkpages. Charles gets reverted relatively often, sooner or later, so it's not that he really has "privileges". When you look at the pertinent talk page, you see who are editors who are knowledgeable of the issue and capable of making sophisticated contributions. If someone who makes edits to the article, is absent from its talkpage, that gives rise to suspicions that such editor actually is not able to present any reasoning to those edits. Other people sometimes check (using diffs) worths of earlier edits - they tend to make corrective edits if needed. Ultimately, of non-talked edits mostly just self-evident things remain in the article, as those without supporting reasoning tend to be edited away sooner or later. <a href="../../../s/h/i/User%7EShilkanni_84af.html" title="User:Shilkanni">Shilkanni</a> 20:12, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> An article already exists which covers the exact same topic under a substantially similar name. This topic is inherently and notoriously contentious -- virtually no one is opinion-free, so consensus-building will require compromise, commitment to NPOV, and collaborative effort to make sense for the reading public out of a dauntingly complex issue. Tim Foxworth has acknowledged that some errors were made with edit tools and other editors, so it's now time to move forward with cooperative editing of <a href="../../../l/i/n/Line_of_succession_to_the_Russian_throne_85bc.html" title="Line of succession to the Russian throne">Line of succession to the Russian throne</a>. <a href="../../../l/e/t/User%7ELethiere_4ff5.html" title="User:Lethiere">Lethiere</a> 23:42, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Do you think that is possible? When I first started editing that article there were two persons listed- Maria and Georg. Check the history.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> I'm not sure its a hoax in the sense that someone is playing a trick on Wikipedia (still might not be true though). I found it mentioned <a href="http://www.thenazareneway.com/apocrypha.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.thenazareneway.com/apocrypha.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> (not sure how that plays out as a source for an article though). All the rest for a google search are wiki-mirros. And I did a prelim search of more reputable-looking sites on "apocrypha" and could find no mention of this book. However, that doesn't mean its a hoax -- I know I have a book around here somewhere about Paul, but I doubt I'll find it. If someone with a real knowledge of the subject can provide a book cite, I'll stay with keep. If not, I think it's in violation of <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> I posted a message on the talk page of one of the page's editors about this Afd, who according to user page studies theology. <a href="../../../d/i/n/User%7EDina_fad9.html" title="User:Dina">Dina</a> 23:27, 19 November 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, but amend. As noted in Talk:Book of spells of serpents, there are signs that this lost book once existed and was ascribed to St. Paul. This much is all that is asserted by the first paragraph up to and including "no known text has survived". To that point, the page is not a hoax, and should be kept.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>What remains in doubt is the subsequent text, the "citations needed" statements about that book's <b>contents</b>; if sources for these cannot be found, I think it would be better to delete them than the whole article.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>I don't know whether these statements are true, but they don't seem implausible. If St. Paul actually wrote a book with that title (and the assertion that he did is an old assertion), the Ophite heresy (which is accurately described there) would have been its probable topic ("Ophite" coming from the Greek word for serpent), and Paul would have written against it.</dd>

Come to think of it, the whole Nag Hammadi trove was "lost" until it was found. So were the locations of Troy and Knossos. Far from making these "non-notable" topics, it made them fascinating mysteries, that scholars dreamed of finding, and that made the discoverers famous. <small>– <a href="../../../s/a/j/User%7ESAJordan_b760.html" title="User:SAJordan"><i>SAJordan</i></a> <sup><a href="../../../s/a/j/User_talk%7ESAJordan_266c.html" title="User talk:SAJordan">talk</a></sup><sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SAJordan_0c1d.html" title="Special:Contributions/SAJordan">contribs</a></sub> <i>12:10, 21 Nov 2006 (UTC).</i></small></dd>

<dd><i>Note: I refactored the heading formatting to be <b>bold</b> because I seem to recall that it causes problems with AfDs to have headings within discussions</i>.</dd>
<dd>I see your point about apocryphal books. However, there are two things we have to look at here:
<ol>
<li>Time at which the (encyclopedia) article is written.</li>
<li>Reliability of sources.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dd>The thing is, a copy of this book has yet to be found. For all we know, it won't. Similarly, writing about existence of the Nag Hammadi scrolls <i>before they were found</i> would have been a bit weird, don't you think?</dd>
<dd>So, we then have to move on to reliable sources for the existence of the book at some stage. There are none. I see links to some neo-Nazarene site, but that, in my opinion, does not equate with a scholarly work.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally, I have my (private, very slight and quiet) doubts about the authenticity of this 'Gospel of Judas'. I find the timing to be awfully odd, coïnciding with that dreadful Da Vinci Code and the surrounding mass idiocy. The woman who 'found' it (in a safety deposit box or somesuch) also seems to be of the opinion that she was somehow 'destined' (by Judas!) to do so. It has not been offered up to the scholarly community at large to study, but has rather been ratified only by a small team (who were cherry-picked for the purpose).</dd>
<dd>Moreover, even to link this 'book of serpents' to Paul is problematic. For example, the <a href="../../../e/m/e/Emerald_Tablet_4cee.html" title="Emerald Tablet">Emerald Tablet</a> of Hermes Trismegistus was proven by the Renaissance philologist <a href="../../../i/s/a/Isaac_Casaubon_8896.html" title="Isaac Casaubon">Isaac Casaubon</a> to be a forgery perpetrated in the second or third century (as opposed to being of a more Mosaic epoch). Given that the article says that the mention of this 'serpent book' is on a 6th century list of heretical works, there is <i>no</i> proof that it was not just some cleric getting carried away in his fervour to condemn. Saying that it is mentioned in other works is worth nothing without specifying which works these actually are.</dd>
<dd>The 19th century Muslism piece is a tad more convincing, but because it is probably based on faulty documentation before it (like the 6th century list — I doubt the book got 'lost' in the 19th century) renders it equally unreliable.</dd>
<dd>So I am not saying that this should be deleted because it is a lost book. My point is that there is no reliable, verifiable way of differentiating it from a hoax (which it may or may not be — it may just be a symbol of man's ability to delude himself), and as such, it is not worthy of an encyclopedia article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Crying_Orc_c4ea.html" title="User:The Crying Orc">The Crying Orc</a> 12:33, 21 November 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><i>"Given that the article says that the mention of this 'serpent book' is on a 6th century list of heretical works"....</i> Whoa. Pause. Stop. Rewind. That's not what the article says. "[I]t appears in a 6th century list of works that were considered <b>non-canonical</b>", yes, but other texts have been non-canonical without being heretical. In fact, right under <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#Lost_works" title="New Testament apocrypha">New_Testament_apocrypha#Lost_works</a>, where this particular book is listed among others "mentioned in many ancient sources, but for which no known text has survived", the next section is <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#A_note_about_orthodoxy" title="New Testament apocrypha">A note about orthodoxy</a>: "While many of the books listed here were considered heretical (especially those belonging to the gnostic tradition--as this sect was considered heretical by most Christians of the early centuries), others were not considered particularly heretical in content, but in fact were well accepted as significant spiritual works." And then <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_Testament_apocrypha_b74e.html#Evaluation" title="New Testament apocrypha">Evaluation</a> points out: "among historians of early Christianity the books are considered invaluable". I think that makes the topic notable enough for inclusion. Drop the unsourced claims, sure. Leave the stub (up to "no known text has survived"), because that much was known already. Then if the claimants ever do come back with sources, they can simply revert the deletion of their text and add citations.</dd>

<li><s><b>Keep</b></s> <b>Delete</b> I think there is a room for expansion. This is going towards Categories vs Lists discussion. Categories help in finding the articles. We can never do away with having lists. Lists don't just list articles, they expand and explain them.

<dd>This <i>is</i> just a list of articles. You may have in mind a list like <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_commercial_airlines_in_India_3315.html" title="List of commercial airlines in India">List of commercial airlines in India</a>, which certainly has merit and I wouldn't dream of supporting its deletion. Of course, if we expand this list we would then have two lists doing pretty much the same thing, which we don't need. This list has nowhere to go: keep it small and it's useless; expand it and it's redundant. Bin it. <a href="../../../m/r/_/User%7EMr_Stephen_33a8.html" title="User:Mr Stephen">Mr Stephen</a> 11:41, 20 November 2006 (UTC)
