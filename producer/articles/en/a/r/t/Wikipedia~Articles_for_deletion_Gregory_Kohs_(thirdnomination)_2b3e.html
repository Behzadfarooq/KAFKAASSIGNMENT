<li><b>Keep</b> and a hearty <a href="../../../t/r/o/WP%7ETROUT_3ce4.html" title="WP:TROUT">troutslap</a> to all of you who think that IAR has any place in this discussion at this point. Let's look at it this way. First, check the sources. We have one oft-reprinted AP article that stemmed from the Microsoft issue where Kohs is a primary subject. We have the German article linked above which is non-trivial as well, so he meets the <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> standard, as well as any <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> questions that may crop up. Some claim that the article is spam, which is patently false - I know of no evidence that Kohs is currently editing the article, being banned, and if he is, we can certainly edit to fix that. BLP isn't an issue here, either, I'm not sure why that's being brought up. In full, there's absolutely no policy reason to delete this - he's "notable" by our standards, he's verifiable by our standards, and the only argument that seems to be permeating throughout this protracted debate is that since he did something that some Wikipedians didn't like, he should be held to a different standard. That's simply absurd, and should be treated as such. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 19:36, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>Two things: One, WP:AUTOBIO does not require deletion, and instead points to the various "notability" standards. Two, even if WP:AUTOBIO did require deletion, this article no longer appears to have any information that was added by Kohs, and did not at the time of the second AfD. In fact, much of the information added by Kohs and removed would make a better article anyway, but that's not a discussion for here. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:14, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> "Bear Fell Out of Tree in Santa Cruz" style news reporting makes this a primary-source based article.

<li>Speaking as someone who majored in history (and that should mean very little in this discussion), I often point to <a href="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" class="external text" title="http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml" rel="nofollow">this discussion</a> on primary and secondary sources. Essentially, it's my belief that these are not primary sources regarding Kohs as much as a secondary synthesis of information already available. Besides that, I think we'd be going down a very hard road if we started considering articles like this as primary. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:20, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The other hard road is the one we go down if we accept RMS Queen Mary 2 docks in San Francisco, California and RMS Queen Mary 2 undocks from San Francisco, California style articles based on the fact that these events were subject of multiple news reports. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 21:39, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that road is much easier to deal with, is it not? "When in doubt, don't delete" has been a guiding light since I got here, and your latter example protects content better than this scenario. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 21:45, 7 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No I don't think that road is easier to deal with. It's littered with COI problems, erodes collaborative work since we're stretching ourselves thin, and undermines the not-for-profit basis of Wikipedia since we're essentially turning into a free self-published Who-is-Who. On your library link, I would say the sources fit quite squarely in the primary camp, although I agree the primary-secondary distinction is itself a false dichotomy. ~ <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETrialsanderrors_11bc.html" title="User:Trialsanderrors">trialsanderrors</a> 22:12, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> It's not often I agree with Badlydranjeff but he's absolutely correct in arguing that many of the appeals to various policies are flawed. Sure, there would probably not be a page about Gregory Kohs on Wikipedia if he hadn't gained attention for his actions on Wikipedia. This is a completely routine phenomenon: articles tend to be created because some editor cares but that does not make it an automatic <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> problem. This is like saying that the article on Jimbo is a self-reference. (Yes I <i>do</i> understand the relative unimportance of Gregory Kohs) The only debate worth having here is "do the sources provided constitute multiple, non-trivial published works?" If the answer is yes, we should keep this regardless of the fact that <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">we don't particularly like the article or its subject</a>. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 21:08, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Once again, an article has to go prove itself repeatedly, and we have more bites at the apple until the desired result is obtained. There are multiple non-trivial published sources. That the guy became notable for abusing Wikipedia is, if anything, an argument that we should bend over backwards <b>not</b> to delete, lest we be seen as biased (or more so than we already are). -- <a href="../../../j/m/a/User%7EJmaynard_f6d3.html" title="User:Jmaynard">Jay Maynard</a> 21:23, 7 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> a couple of passing mentions, some sourced from the Village pump(!), self-referential, and not much evidence that anybody but us cares about Mr. Kohs.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I'm completely stunned by the deletion rationales here, almost completely across the board.

<li><b>Counter comment</b> in all fairness, not all rationales are illegitimate. For instance, I disagree with Sam but it's reasonable to argue that the AP article isn't what one would consider something whose primary subject is Gregory Kohs. But still, I feel that people first make the instinctive judgment that they don't want this article on Wikipedia and then find an interpretation of policy that matches their instinct whereas the argument should work the other way around. <a href="../../../p/a/s/User%7EPascal.Tesson_2c80.html" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> 23:18, 7 February 2007 (UTC)

Let's take a close look at <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a>: In a nutshell, "To ease reusability, never allow the text of an article to assume that the reader is viewing it at Wikipedia, and try to avoid even assuming that the reader is viewing the article at a website. There may also be stylistic issues with using phrases such as this article unnecessarily." This article does not assume that the reader is viewing it at Wikipedia or on a website, or make any statements about "this article." Therefore, <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> <i>simply does not apply to this article.</i> The reason I voted "weak" is that I wonder if we should <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">deny recognition</a>. --<a href="../../../n/_/s/User%7EN_Shar_b1e6.html" title="User:N Shar">N Shar</a> 00:28, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b> or <b>merge</b> into Controversies related to Wikipedia if there are enough to split it from <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a>. <s>This guy's name isn't even in the story cited as a reference; it appears only in the caption of a photo. The article itself mentions another guy.</s> (The article also says "The imbroglio will soon pass", which sounds like "trivial" and "not notable" to me.) All the other stories I've seen or heard on this topic don't mention Kohs' name at all, although I haven't checked out the one from Die Welt. The <i>incident</i> is notable, but I have to stretch to consider this person even at the edge of notability under WP:BIO. A better analogy for trialsanderrors' complaint would be if people were arguing to keep a biography of the Queen Mary 2's captain because there were news stories showing RMS Queen Mary 2 docks in San Francisco, California. (While I was researching this, the ref link was changed and now points to a story that does contain Kohs' name.) I still have the opinion that the person hasn't achieved enough notability to pass the hundred year test or even the one year test. Scraping the edges of one part of WP:BIO doesn't make something a mandatory keep. The second AfD was closed as delete (albeit borderline) and people should not keep hollering for multiple chances to get their desired result if they want "keep" any more than if they want "delete". If you want it kept, improve a poor article with sources and substantial content, instead of putting more "no no no I insist" text into the AfD than is in the article. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 00:40, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. The piece in <i>Die Welt</i> is substantial (so not having checked it before offering an opinion is rather strange, to say the least). The AP piece is rather less interesting, but between the two of them, plus the <i>SdZ</i> article, I think there's enough to build on. Since <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> are met, and <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> doesn't apply, consider the other alphabet soup offered in support of deletion arguments: <a href="../../../d/e/n/WP%7EDENY_da3a.html" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a> and <a href="../../../a/u/t/WP%7EAUTO_e1c1.html" title="WP:AUTO">WP:AUTO</a> are irrelevant; <a href="../../../a/s/r/WP%7EASR_31e6.html" title="WP:ASR">WP:ASR</a> likewise (why are <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Leslie_Brandt_2d95.html" title="Daniel Leslie Brandt">Daniel Leslie Brandt</a> and <a href="../../../h/i/s/History_of_Wikipedia_74f2.html" title="History of Wikipedia">History of Wikipedia</a> in mainspace if ASR is prescriptive?; clearly it's not); it is hard to see how <a href="../../../a/d/s/WP%7EADS_2ee6.html" title="WP:ADS">WP:ADS</a> could be applicable to the article in its current state. Additionally, a number of delete opinions are based on erroneous assertions (only two articles; articles do not mention Kohs; not much evidence that anyone but us cares). The long-term solution should be a merge somewhere, preferably in wikispace when all the other navel-gazing wankery is removed there too, but that's not a pressing matter. Unlike Hipocrite, I can think of nothing <b>less</b> helpful to the encyclopedia than deleting an article on a minor celebrity on the basis of a collective and conscious <a href="../../../i/d/o/WP%7EIDONTLIKEIT_1ffb.html" title="WP:IDONTLIKEIT">WP:IDONTLIKEIT</a>. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 02:02, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Die Welt</i> article was described in the Deletion Review debate (after the second AfD as just a reprint of the AP piece. Angus, are you saying that every editor is required to perform a <i>translation</i> of a reprint of known material just to comment validly on sources for the English-language Wikipedia? Are you saying that a translation of an existing article is separate and helps meet the "multiple independent sources" requirement? And why&#160;!vote "keep" if you think the correct action is "merge" which I also supported? Maybe one or two people are arguing IDONTLIKEIT (or finding a policy justification to back a predetermined position) but the rest of us are interpreting the facts and the policies differently than you. Please apply <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. Also note that over a half-dozen respected editors have commented that they "rarely agree with badlydrawnjeff" (in terms of his interpretation of notability policies, esp. WP:BIO) in the last couple of months of AfD and MfD and DRV. (That's not intended as a personal attack, just evidence that his positions are not community consensus even if he states them eight or nine times in one debate.) <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 14:31, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>The <i>Die Welt</i> article was not mentioned at all in Deletion Review. It covers some of the same ground as the AP article but is clearly an original piece, with stuff that isn't in the AP article (and vice versa). <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 15:15, 8 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>What Uncle G said. If editors haven't read the relevant material, why would they feel the need to comment? Offering an opinion at any particular AfD is not mandatory. Deletion policy seems to presume that editors will have informed themselves before opining. It is nice of Calton to acknowledge my rhetorical finish, but <a href="../../../p/o/i/Poisoning_the_well.html" title="Poisoning the well">poisoning the well</a> beats hyperbole any day. <a href="../../../a/n/g/User%7EAngusmclellan_1c5f.html" title="User:Angusmclellan">Angus McLellan</a> <a href="../../../a/n/g/User_talk%7EAngusmclellan_6ace.html" title="User talk:Angusmclellan">(Talk)</a> 15:46, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<p>All three are reprints/copies of the Washington Post/AP piece linked at the AfD. --badlydrawnjeff talk 15:27, 7 February 2007 (UTC) ", and thought the <i>Die Welt</i> article was one of those. I also read several newspaper articles which used only the first few grafs of the AP feed, content about Microsoft and Wikipedia that had no mention of Mr. Kohs. I first learned of the topic through hearing an NPR radio report, where Microsoft and Wikipedia were the focal points I heard and where if Kohs' name was mentioned I didn't notice it; it certainly wasn't featured. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 17:05, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Endorse deletion</b>. Still non-notable, still self-referential, still the not-primary subject of multiple trivial works, no matter how much air Badlydrawnjeff tries to pump into the minor news articles or how much (as he did at <a href="../../../d/r/v/WP%7EDRV_474d.html" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>) he pretends not to understand "self-referential". As sources for anything even resembling an actual encyclopedia biography, pretty worthless.

(To an extent as a reply to badlydrawnjeff's concern at the DRV): I think that <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELF_e41e.html" title="WP:SELF">WP:SELF</a> applies, although in a supposedly contrived way: the events are reported through several outside sources because the case has raised some dust and contoversy here, and we're <i>big and important enough</i> for that to catch attention of journalists. But all the references are not about Kohs as an individual, but about Wikipedia—Kohs might as well be a John Doe. Other than that event, I see no claim of notability; we routinely merge e.g. articles about otherwise unremarkable victims, scandal-causers, criminals, and similar into articles about the events they participated in (and which are the sole cause of their notability); I don't see why this case should be different. At best, his name and the event should deserve a couple of sentences in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia.html" title="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article or one of its subarticles. <a href="../../../d/u/j/User%7EDuja_17a6.html" title="User:Duja">Duja</a><span style="font-size:70%;"><a href="../../../d/u/j/User_talk%7EDuja_3032.html" title="User talk:Duja">►</a></span> 09:03, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>They're mostly about Kohs in the context of his associations with Wikipedia. That does not make the article about Wikipedia, but about Kohs, thus invalidating any contrived concerns regarding WP:SELF. Meanwhile, his claim to notability <i>is</i> the attention his business got, and I'm not sure he's exactly unremarkable given the circumstances. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 12:58, 8 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, but that's circular.
