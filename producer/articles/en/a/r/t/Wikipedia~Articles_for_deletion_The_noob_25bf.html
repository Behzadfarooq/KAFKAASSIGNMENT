<ul>
<li>I disagree with the speedy deletion nomination.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agree that the article is worthy of discussion for inclustion/exclusion, but by adding the "speedy" deletion, you eliminate a significant amount of the time for other authors on the subject to weigh in and work on the article enough to meet the requirements for inclusion to wikipedia. IMHO</p>
<p>I also belive that deleting this article contradicts the effort to "...an attempt to build a comprehensive and detailed guide to webcomics on Wikipedia. " Timmccloud 13:39, 22 November 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>"I am Gianna Masetti, the author of the webcomic. As the copyright holder of The Noob, I give Wikipedia editors permission to use text or image material from the comic for the purpose of updating its Wikipedia entry. My only request to the authors and editors of the entry is that it should be strictly informational and it should respect the guidelines of the website."</li>

<ul>
<li>I am working on references to prove notability of the article. However I do have a real job, and research like this takes time. I request a suspension of the speedy deletion for at least 2 weeks, while I work with the author and other sources to refine the article.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Why did this get deleted?? We were working on the content, providing valueable infomrmation to make it meet the noteworthyness of wikipedia!! I thought wikipedia gave discussions on articles, not just carte blanch deletions??

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Your own policy states "Articles listed here are debated for up to five days, after which the deletion process proceeds based on Wikipedia community consensus" It's been a total of 5 hours - that's not FIVE DAYS.

<li>Sorry, Tim, that was my fault. I didn't spot the article was at AFD, and speedy tagging it was not a great idea.

<li>Thank you Proto. The speedy tagging was not my idea, it was MER-C and BradBeattie who added that tag. I tried to remove it, but they put it back, so I figured I had to leave it. The author is working on trying to comply with the copyright restrictions on images so I hope to upload the image a thrid time with an appropriate permission.

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'd like to clarify that at no point did I flag this article for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Clairfication</b>. Yes, now that the history is restored, I can see that the speedy was entirely MER-C, yours was just the basic tag for AFD.

<p>Part of my problem with getting the external references... in the authors own words...

<li>This is a notable article, because it presents some facets of the current MMORPG culture in a humourous way, and funny to people who are not into these games too. With the recent attention in the popular media to MMORPG games I think that it would be worthwile to keep an article on this comic on Wikipedia.

<li><b>Comment</b>, This is from Gianna Masetti, the author of the comic in question. I didn't write the article on Wikipedia (it's the work of readers) and didn't mind either way if it was deleted or not because I am happy to abide to Wikipedia's self-policing by its users - if the entry about my work breaks any rules, then it shouldn't be here. However it seems to me that this objectivity doesn't really exist - after reading that "Comixpedia reviews and WCCAs are trivial", I checked several articles that were created or edited by Dragonfiend (who made that statement) - and their only references (and therefore claims to presence on Wikipedia, according to the notability rules) are sites like Comixpedia and WCCA. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding on my part, but I don't see how these sites can be trivial in my case and non-trivial in the case of the entries written by Dragonfiend - forgive me if I feel insulted.
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Hi Gianna, I certainly don't mean to insult you. Which articles were you looking at before you made your comment that several articles I've created and/or edited have their only references as sites like Comixpedia and those Web Cartoonist Awards? Check the references of the webcomics related articles I've created, including <a href="../../../a/m/y/Amy_Kim_Ganter_e571.html" title="Amy Kim Ganter">Amy Kim Ganter</a>, <a href="../../../d/i/c/Dicebox.html" title="Dicebox">Dicebox</a>, <a href="../../../d/r/e/Drew_Weing_d1db.html" title="Drew Weing">Drew Weing</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/n/Gene_Yang_da30.html" title="Gene Yang">Gene Yang</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/a/Lea_Hernandez_4b9f.html" title="Lea Hernandez">Lea Hernandez</a>, <a href="../../../m/e/t/Metaphrog.html" title="Metaphrog">Metaphrog</a>, <a href="../../../n/o/w/Nowhere_Girl_6b3f.html" title="Nowhere Girl">Nowhere Girl</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/i/Raina_Telgemeier_2673.html" title="Raina Telgemeier">Raina Telgemeier</a>, <a href="../../../s/v/e/Svetlana_Chmakova_a22c.html" title="Svetlana Chmakova">Svetlana Chmakova</a>, <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Hart_%28comics%29_e61b.html" title="Tom Hart (comics)">Tom Hart (comics)</a>, and <a href="../../../w/h/e/When_I_Am_King_8ff1.html" title="When I Am King">When I Am King</a>. I don't think I've ever created a stub article that didn't have a reference section with multiple non-trivial sources. The webcomics-related articles I've editd generally do as well, like <a href="../../../f/e/t/Fetus-X_564e.html" title="Fetus-X">Fetus-X</a>, <a href="../../../g/e/t/Get_Your_War_On_0b55.html" title="Get Your War On">Get Your War On</a>, <a href="../../../g/i/r/Girlamatic.html" title="Girlamatic">Girlamatic</a>, <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Zabel_c784.html" title="Joe Zabel">Joe Zabel</a>, <a href="../../../l/e/i/Leisure_Town_13df.html" title="Leisure Town">Leisure Town</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/r/Narbonic.html" title="Narbonic">Narbonic</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/n/Penny_Arcade_%28webcomic%29_73fc.html" title="Penny Arcade (webcomic)">Penny Arcade (webcomic)</a>, <a href="../../../s/l/u/Sluggy_Freelance_b9c8.html" title="Sluggy Freelance">Sluggy Freelance</a>, etc. I take it you were looking at some webcomics articles I've made minor edits to that are currently poorly sourced and need to be either deleted or improved? Which ones were you looking at? <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 17:17, 27 November 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: If you list also pages where you did minor edits I stand corrected. It was an entry that you had edited which had Webcomic Examiner reviews and WCCA as references. An entry that you created (you will know which one but I won't name it because I don't want to start witch hunts resulting in the deletion of more webcomic articles), has as notability references just one paragraph on The Village Voice lamenting an omission of it from some previous article and a review on the Daily Oklahoman. Now, the D.O. may be a daily newspaper, but how are Comixpedia, a news website specifically dedicated to webcomics, or the WCCA, more trivial or less reputable than D.O. where webcomics are concerned?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Large, developed, sourced and accurate. There are some issues with tone of voice, but those can be overcome. If notability is the concern, do I need to refer to the dreaded <a href="../../../k/i/t/WP%7EKIT_4e1f.html" title="WP:KIT">PokÃ©mon test</a>? Seriously, less notable articles than this have been kept before.
