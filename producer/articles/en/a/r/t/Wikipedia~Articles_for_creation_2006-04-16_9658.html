<p><a href="../../../c/y/c/Cyclone.html" title="Cyclone">Cyclone</a> is a <b>Thrash Metal</b> band from <b>Belgium</b>, peculiarly aggressive compared with other bands of the time. Often considered as a cult European band, their two only albums (<i>Brutal Destruction</i> in 1986, Roadrunner, and <i>Inferior to None</i> in 1990, Justice) got outstanding reviews at the time. Guitars were fairly in-your-face, reflecting the influence of old-school thrash metal, only much more brutal. The drumming is very fast, generally faster than usual Thrash Metal, and vocals overall clean with screams ending each verse, in a James Hetfield on <i>Kill'Em All</i> (Metallica)- style and many high-pitched Heavy Metal clean screams as well, quite similar to Slayer's Tom Araya's scream in the beginning of the song Angel Of Death (<i>Reign In Blood</i>, 1986).</p>
<p>Songs like "Take Thy Breath" on the first album were so brutal with so many screams and such a fast drumming that they could be considered as very influential to the emerging Death Metal scene, although the real influence of Death Metal is Possessed's <i>Seven Churches</i> album.</p>

<p>Short Duration Transaction Networks, or SDTNs, are networks characterized by high call rates, short call duration, and high peak loads.</p>
<p>High call rates result from the fact that most short duration transaction environments involve very large numbers of client devices (i.e. POS terminals, cash dispensers, etc.) connecting to a relatively small number of central application servers or host computers. Each client device must establish a network connection for each transaction. In an analog dial up environment, this means multiple connections per minute for each dial line available. In a digital link, this can mean hundreds or even thousands of connections per minute. These call rates can create havoc with data communications equipment using centralized call processing. They can also hang most host protocol stacks.</p>
<p>Short duration transactions are also characterized by very short call durations … typically two or three seconds for the actual transaction. The network access equipment used in SDTNs must be able to handle the resulting call setup and termination loads reliably.</p>
<p>Finally, SDTNs typically have very high peak to average load ratios. For example, an SDTN supporting retail POS terminals may experience an average load of 20 transactions per second over most of the year, but a peak load in excess of 200 transactions per second may be sustained over many hours on the busiest day in December. For this reason, SDTNs must be: (a) designed for peak, not average loads, and (b) must have some way of throttling transactions so as to prevent an outright crash during heavy load times.</p>
<p>Much of our world operates on SDTNs. These break down into two categories: (a) "best effort to deliver" such as current web page requests, and (b) "mission critical" such as retail POS, the PSTN's common channel interoffice signaling system, and medical alert systems. The first category may be carried over normal router based networks. The second has more stringent requirements generally involving guaranteed delivery, high availability, low latency, and high security.</p>

<p>Wing Boon Boon is a kickass Asian friend living in Australia. Many think Wing Boon Boom's name is Eddie. But it isn't. It is Wing Boon Boon.</p>
<p>Wing Boon Boon has a motonous voice and has difficulty showing an iota of emotion. For this reason many consider Wing Boon Boon to be a robot. But he's not a robot, he's human, just a much better human than you or me combined, and perhaps even that guy over there also combined.</p>
<p>Many people hold Wing Boon Boon in high regard. So much so that people sometimes "swear on the Wings of Boon Boon" that a certain statement is true. Furthermore people strive to "fly as high as the Wings of Boon Boon". No-one can actually fly that high, except for Wing Boon Boon himself. You could try and fly that high, but you would just fall on your face, and it would hurt - a lot.</p>

<p>b-1916</p>
<p>The compositional and intellectual wisdom of Milton Babbitt has influenced a wide range of contemporary musicians. A broad array of distinguished musical achievements in the dodecaphonic system and important writings on the subject have generated increased understanding and integration of serialist language into the eclectic musical styles of the late 20th century. Babbitt is also renowned for his great talent and instinct for jazz and his astonishing command of American popular music. His All Set, for jazz ensemble, reveals an extraordinary compositional flexibility, uniquely American and vintage Babbitt.</p>
<p><br />
Babbitt was born on 10 May 1916 in Philadelphia and studied composition privately with Roger Sessions. He earned degrees from New York and Princeton Universities and has been awarded honorary degrees from Middlebury College, Swarthmore College, New York University, the New England Conservatory, University of Glasgow, and Northwestern University. He taught at Princeton and The Juilliard School.</p>
<p><br />
An extensive catalogue of works for multiple combinations of instruments and voice along with his pioneering achievements in synthesized sound have made Babbitt one of the most celebrated of 20th-century composers. He is a founder and member of the Committee of Direction for the Electronic Music Center of Columbia-Princeton Universities and a member of the Editorial Board of Perspectives of New Music. The recipient of numerous honors, commissions, and awards, including a MacArthur Fellowship and a Pulitzer Prize Citation for his "life's work as a distinguished and seminal American composer," Babbitt is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>

<p>Burnt Offering crept into the bowels of the underground in 1987 with the release of their "Death Decay" demo. Nationally syndicated Rock Station Z-Rock chose the track "Black Blasphemy" from the demo as the coveted "Wailer of the Month" (July, '87) and gave it consistent prime-time air play.</p>
<p><br />
In the fall of 1989, independent Chicago label Walkthrufyre Records (now defunct) released Burnt Offerings self titled debut LP. to a legion of impatient, underground, thrash mongers. With Burnt Offering's collage of speed, thrash, crunch, violence, and death, tracks such as "Leatherface," "Power of Death," and "SlaughterhouseGrizzle" left fans in an irreversible disarray!</p>
<p><br />
By 1990, Chicago concert promoters Jam Productions, invited Burnt Offering to share the stage with international heavyweights: Death, Dark Angel, Kreator, Coroner,Sacred Reich, and Candlemass. Burnt Offering also had the privilege of opening forSepultura in their very first concert on American soil in Chicago.</p>
<p><br />
Sadly, and quite prematurely, Burnt Offering called it quits in late 1990 due to mismanagement and hollow promises of their failing record company. Vowing to redeem themselves, all five original members held a conference in July of 1997 and decided that the timing was perfect for a resurgence of Burnt Offering!</p>
<p><br />
Rehearsals began, and on October 25, 1997, Burnt Offering hosted their revival performance at Chicago's Riviera Theatre, followed by a special Halloween concert supporting Mexico's Transmetal on Chicago's southwest side. In January of 1998, Burnt Offering re- released their debut album on C.D. for the first time, and included the entire "Death Decay" demo. This release was retitled and called "Death Decay Complete." The C.D. was released on the band's own record label called Modern Day Recordings.</p>
<p><br />
The release of "Death Decay Complete" was followed by a nine city tour of Mexico, in which the band smuggled 500 promotional compact discs into the country in order to saturate the undying Mexican Deathffhrash Metal underworld!</p>
<p><br />
In the early spring of 1998, the C.EO. of Missouri based S.O.D. (Sounds ofDeath) Magazine and longtime Burnt Offering fan David Horn had caught wind of Burnt Offering's return. Horn called lead guitarist Jim Martinelli and expressed interest in releasing Burnt Offering's long awaited second loP. "Walk of the Dead" through his magazine and distribution outlets. Burnt Offering agreed and entered the studio in late summer of 1998 and pounded out their brand new masterpiece which was completed in October. Walk of the dead is now available on Modern day recordings</p>

<p>(2056)</p>
<p>The Classics is a video series by <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walt_Disney_Home_Entertainment_1be1.html" title="Walt Disney Home Entertainment">Walt Disney Home Entertainment</a>, which started in <a href="../../../1/9/8/1984.html" title="1984">1984</a> and ended in <a href="../../../1/9/9/1994.html" title="1994">1994</a>. It's first two releases were released in October 1984 on <a href="../../../v/h/s/VHS_078b.html" title="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/t/Beta.html" title="Beta">Beta</a>, <a href="../../../c/e/d/CED_Videodisc_0214.html" title="CED Videodisc">CED Videodisc</a>, and <a href="../../../l/a/s/Laserdisc.html" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a>, they were <a href="../../../d/u/m/Dumbo.html" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a> and <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Hood_%281973_film%29_8736.html" title="Robin Hood (1973 film)">Robin Hood</a>.</p>
<p>In July <a href="../../../1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a>, the line scored a hit with the home video premiere of <a href="../../../p/i/n/Pinocchio.html" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>, initially selling for $79.95. In early <a href="../../../1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sword_in_the_Stone_%281963_film%29_570e.html" title="The Sword in the Stone (1963 film)">The Sword in the Stone</a>, was released as a part of the line.</p>
<p>In 1987, following the video releases of <a href="../../../a/l/i/Alice_in_Wonderland_%281951_film%29_089a.html" title="Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)">Alice in Wonderland</a>, Sleeping Beauty, and <a href="../../../l/a/d/Lady_and_the_Tramp_afb2.html" title="Lady and the Tramp">Lady and the Tramp</a>, the line became a hit.</p>
<p>The line is known as the "<i>Black Diamond</i>" series because of the shape of the logo that promoted these videos. The line made an animated version of the logo that played before the movie, it was cheesy CGI effects that rotated around onscreen (THE CLASSICS and Walt Disney Home Video) and settle on a zooming diamond.</p>
<p>In 1988, the logo was replaced with a newer one resembling the Sorcerer Mickey Walt Disney Home Video logo that was introduced in 1987. The line managed to release 22 Disney animated features on video (films made between 1940 and 1992). The line had one last release,<a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Fox_and_the_Hound_2b3f.html" title="The Fox and the Hound">The Fox and the Hound</a> and spring 1994.</p>
<p>In the United Kingdom, the line released more titles on video, including titles that went on The Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection (the line that took over after the Classics was called off), and in Japan, it did the same.</p>

<p>“For me, a successful painting is one that stands on its own visual merits. It requires no verbal explanation or justification. The image reflects an understanding of composition, shape, relationships, and color that is inherently obvious. The skill of the artist’s brush is evident in every stroke. And, the passion that went into creating the work is captured on the canvas and emanates to the viewer. This is what I am drawn to as an art enthusiast and what I strive for as a painter.”</p>

<p>Martin Driscoll began drawing as a youth in New York City. In the early 1960’s, after serving in the Air Force, he returned to New York and enrolled in the Art Students League. He studied under Frank Reilly, a renowned teacher who developed a systematic use of the color palette that continues to serve as a foundation for fine art instruction. Reilly’s classes became a cornerstone in the development of Driscoll’s signature style. Today, it's Martin's love of Ireland and her wonderful people and culture that is his current insperation.</p>
<p>In the mid-1990’s, Driscoll began&#160;: teaching painting, giving art demonstrations, and selling his original work. He was quickly commissioned to paint a United States Federal Court Judge, international sports figures, and most recently received a prestigious portrait commission from The Winston Churchill Society.</p>
<p>In early 2000, he opened the Driscoll Art Studio, a working studio and gallery aboard the Queen Mary. In his studio/gallery, Driscoll’s pastoral scenes of rural Irish life have received particular attention and accolades from collectors and fellow artists alike. Ireland became the subject and serious focus of his paintings.</p>

<p>In 2006, Driscoll partnered with Sunflower Fine Art Galleries to publish his work. His first collection of limited edition giclee prints have sold across the globe.</p>
<p>Driscoll’s work is now being shown in a rapidly growing number of galleries from coast-to-coast. Martin exhibited most recenenlty at ArtExpo 2006, and nearly sold out of all work shown. He is currently busy at work in his new studio. His work is published by Sunflower fine Art.</p>

<p>Monster's Game (www.monstersgame.co.uk) is an amazing real-time strategy web based game. Like OGame, it revolves around using time as a way to gain money, achieve levels, and skills.</p>
<p>LEVELING UP: Leveling revolves around fighting other beasts of the opposite race. This means that if you are a werewolf you fight vampires, and so on. Everyone you fight in Monster's Game is a real person, as there are no NPCs. To gain experience you fight people that are your level or higher, and try to win. You obtain more experience by winning. Another way of gaining experience is by doing manhunts. You can do an hour of manhunts each day. The best way to utilize the manhunt command is by doing them in 10 minute intervals, and doing more minutes than 10 doesn't bring a distinguishable bonus. Manhunts also bring you flesh or blood, depending on your race, and money. Flesh and blood is used for high rank stats only.</p>
<p>CLANS: Clans so far serve as a purpose to meet people who play the game, and have clan wars with an opposite clan. While there is no automatic service for clan wars they basically are just two clans continually fighting eachother, and that's all there is to it. One clan that accepts new players is: the [[[AAA]]] [AAA] - Anti-Angel Alliance[<a href="http://www.mgcluster.net/mguk_world1/index.php?ac=showclan&amp;showclanid=13804" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.mgcluster.net/mguk_world1/index.php?ac=showclan&amp;showclanid=13804" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>].</p>
<p>SENTINELS AND ITEMS: Sentinels are basically beasts that players can control and upgrade, the same way they do with their own character. They add their stats straight to the character's, so they are a great help when you are fighting an enemy with around the same stats. Other items are armor and weapons, which also help greatly. Weapons help to do more damage, while armor helps create less damage happen to you.</p>
<p>Many more people are joining each day, and it is updating and becoming better by the minute.</p>
