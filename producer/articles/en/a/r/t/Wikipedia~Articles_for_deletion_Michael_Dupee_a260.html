<p>This was marked for speedy deletion, but it is well-written and has plenty of assertion of notability. I think the real question is, are there <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">reliable sources</a> for this guy? There might be, there might not be.

<li><b>Include</b> Michael Dupee is one of the best jeopardy players of all time. Plus, lots of people know him from playing his online games at MindFun.com. He is not a person of merely local interest. His online radio trivia call-in talk show is also becoming popular among people who like trivia. Next week, he is going to start hosting Jeopardy Tournament of Champion winners as guests on the radio show. This is sure to be a popular segment.70.171.58.219 18:41, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Include</b> This article is within the scope of WikiProject Biography. For more information, visit the project page.

<li><b>Include</b> I was sitting on the fence about this article, but now I'm inclined to keep it since it lists sources now, and is well-written (no surgery is necessary to bring it up to standards). There are sixteen articles about <i>Jeopardy!</i> contestants on Wikipedia, by the way, which is a very tiny percentage of the number of people who have appeared on a popular show that has been running for decades. It's not like Wikipedia is dealing with an avalanche of Jeopardy-cruft, unlike say, <a href="../../../p/o/k/Pokemon.html" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a>-related articles. I don't think removing this article is helpful, and I hope the new editor who wrote it stays around to contribute further to Wikipedia. - <a href="../../../i/t/s/User%7EItsfullofstars_bea3.html" title="User:Itsfullofstars">Itsfullofstars</a> 19:25, 3 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Include</b> Although Dupee currently has no records on the show, that is mostly because of the multiple changes in the show's format since he competed. He is a highly notable Jeopardy champion because he wrote the book which most contestants use to prepare to go on the show. Thus, all competitors know of Michael Dupee, and he is certainly notable enough to be one of the 16 Jeopardy contestants who are biographied in Wikipedia.75.200.104.42 21:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Clarification</b> In contrast to <a href="../../../t/o/m/Tom_Walsh_%28game_show_contestant%29_7e1d.html" title="Tom Walsh (game show contestant)">Tom Walsh</a>, Dupee never held any winnings records on the show, which should be requisite for notability barring notability outside of the show (as are the cases for Ohio State Treasurer <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Cordray_c6ee.html" title="Richard Cordray">Richard Cordray</a> or children's author <a href="../../../l/i/n/Linda_Sue_Park_ca4b.html" title="Linda Sue Park">Linda Sue Park</a>). If Dupee's forthcoming radio show is deemed to establish his notability outside of his involvement in the show, this should be considered. But his authorship of <i>How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win!</i> doesn't qualify him. It wasn't a huge seller, it's out of print, and it's mostly known only within the <i>Jeopardy!</i> community. Nor does his stewardship of several (wonderful) web sites/games make him notable. ToC champ and Google employee Ryan Holznagel also has a great web site (Who2.com), but none of these is enough to establish him as notable. <a href="../../../r/o/b/User%7ERobert_K_S_85c9.html" title="User:Robert K S">Robert K S</a> 11:28, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b> Dupee's authorship of <i>How to Get on Jeopardy! and Win!</i> does qualify him as notable. That book is <i><b>the</b></i> book that most Jeopardy! competitors have used to prepare for the show for the last several years. If everybody in a specific field is using a particular text to learn how to do something, then it is notable. His book is the "Joy of Cooking" of Jeopardy!-preparation. Every copy ever printed sold and it was going into reprints when the publisher went bankrupt for completely unrelated reasons. The used copies on Amazon have historically been difficult to obtain and highly priced. Lately, the used copies are more attainable, but that probably is because there is now so much Jeopardy! info on the internet (thanks to certain persons like yourself, Robert K S, the extraordinary writer of the online J! Archive), which is in stark contrast to when Dupee's book was published. Plus, Dupee's 2nd book was a best-seller, being sold at all stores, including Wal-Mart, book stores, the Scholastic Book Fairs, and through Publishers Clearing House. It even had a sequel. Plus, TOC champ Ryan Holznagel is highly notable. He, in fact, is the next person that I was thinking of writing a Wikipedia page on. His web site Who2.com is really a cool site. It is a comprehensive trivia encyclopedia of biographical information.Zana4 04:32, 6 March 2007 (UTC)
