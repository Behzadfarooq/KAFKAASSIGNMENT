<h2><span class="mw-headline">Transitive set</span></h2>
<p>Also a warm welcome from me. In <a href="../../../t/r/a/Transitive_set.html" title="Transitive set">transitive set</a>, you write that <i>A</i> is transitive if "whenever <i>x</i>∈<i>A</i>, and <i>y</i>∈<i>x</i>, then <i>y</i>∈<i>x</i>." There seems to be some mistake here; perhaps the last "<i>y</i>∈<i>x</i>" should be "<i>y</i>∈<i>A</i>"? Apart from that, it is a nice start, though it could probably be expanded (I don't know enough set theory to do it myself). By the way, you can write [[class (set theory|]] instead of [[class (set theory)|class]]. In addition to the pile of materials suggested by Longhair, you might be interested in <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Mathematics_7ee9.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics">Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics</a>, which is specifically about mathematics.

<ol>
<li>"I advised the something similar a week ago and [RJII] flatly refused to do anything other than edit the article as [he] saw fit and revert anything anyone else adds (to their credit, I suppose, they have followed through with what they said they would do)
<dl>
<dd>This is an outright lie. I never said such a thing. He's simply trying to turn public opinion against me to get his way through dishonesty. It's especially ludicrous because I've incorporated his edits into the text. The talk of prohibition is his. He wrote it in the intro and I moved it into the body and merged it with the appropriate paragraph. Anyone can see that I work with the edits of others. The most recent editor was "TheLand." I worked with his edits and there are there in the article.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>"I don't see much point in making any further edits to this page, since RJII has expressed his intention to revert them and ignore them (and he has followed through with that stated intention)"
<dl>
<dd>Ditto with the above explanation.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Also, he's been trying to spread the idea that I don't engage in discussion. That's obviously false.</li>
<li>And, he was stating that I was reverting the article without consensus, when in actuality he and Rd232 were deleting the whole body of the article without absolutely no prior discussion. I was simply reverting it back to its previously consensual state. Fortunately, after much pressure he finally admitted he was wrong to revert it: "<i>In retrospect, it would have been better to have copied the disputed material here, to the Talk page, and then go over it section by section before returning what's left to the article. That would have been the more proper thing to do, as directed by Wikipedia policy, and I have already admitted (a few days ago) that I erred in simply reverting back to your (Rd232's) version, just as much as RJII erred in simply reverting it back to his version.</i>" But, as you can see he's got to accuse me of wrongdoing in that. Reverting back an entire article that has been deleted is the proper thing to do. And, notice he says RJII reverted back to "his version." It wasn't my version; Radgeek authored most of that article. He was claiming on the talk page that the article amounted to an "essay" that I had written to further my POV. The guy has been on a DISHONEST mission to make me look like the bad guy. He's a complete sleazebag. Then when I announce what's going on, I'm attacking as being "uncivil." It's ludicrous. The incivility is the dishonesty. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 19:17, 20 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ol>
<p>Well:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can't find what you may have said that, so I cannot confirm it. BBlackmore would have to point to a page and version where you said that.</li>
<li>Now, there I concur. You have expressed an intention to revert any change of the definition. (For what it's worth, the one you have now on the locked page is not the best of the group you've chosen.) I now think that an NPOV article would need to have a version of your current definition, the definition that the monopoly is stabilized by use of force or subsidies, and the definition (from common usage) that a <b>coercive monopoly</b> is one that the speaker want to break up.
<ol>
<li>That's not true. If you claim that, then you should be able to bring up a quote. It looks like his propaganda has worked on you. If I was intent on simply reverting why on earth would I be engaging in such extensive discussion? I justify everything I do thoroughly and am very open to being proved wrong.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>You engage in argument. You do not seem to acknowledge apparently valid objections to your edits.
<ol>
<li>Yes I do engage in argument. I acknowledge objections, and I rebut them. That's how argument works. When one side realizes they are wrong, it's settled. I even realized I was wrong and changed my definition. The definition I'm arguing against, and that you Rd232 and Bblackmoor are arguing for now, is the definition I supported at the beginning of this conflict. I don't know if you realize that.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Point taken. (Mostly.) The talk page <b>does</b> need to be summarized with many of the discussions archived. Unfortunately, they are all pretty current, and we won't be able to agree on summaries. I do not agree that Rd232's and BBlackmoor's (and my) changing the article to the (arguably) <b>correct</b> definition was <i>deleting the whole body</i>, as -- if our definition were correct (which, by the way, I no longer accept without reservation), nothing in your copy of the article would belong there.</li>
</ol>
<p>By the way, the latest slander of me, is he just took a quote I said out of context and made it look like I was responding to something else he said. The guy is completely devoid of ethics. I cut and pasted what I actually said to reveal his deception. Then he went on to say he's been trying to get me to engage in discussion. I've been engaging in a huge amount of discussion. You know this personally because I've been engaged in discussion with you.<a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">RJII</a> 03:39, 21 October 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi Arthur Rubin, I was wondering whether you were interested in joining and developing a new WikiProject. While the more-established <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikiProject_Judaism_0444.html" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Judaism">WikiProject Judaism</a> focuses on relgious aspects of Judaism, this project intends to look at <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_literature.html" title="Jewish literature">Jewish literature</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_music.html" title="Jewish music">music</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_theater.html" title="Jewish theater">theater</a>, <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_languages.html" title="Jewish languages">language</a> and <a href="../../../j/e/w/Jewish_history.html" title="Jewish history">history</a>, among other aspects of culture. If you are interested in helping to edit and review these articles, please <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Jewish_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Jewish_culture&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" rel="nofollow">join</a>! <a href="../../../j/n/o/User%7EJnothman_5c31.html" title="User:Jnothman">jnothman</a> <a href="../../../j/n/o/User_talk%7EJnothman_b83a.html" title="User talk:Jnothman"><sup>talk</sup></a> 06:07, 14 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
