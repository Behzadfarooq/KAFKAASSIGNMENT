<p><b>Delete</b> - I am not finding any reliable sources which back up the assertions of notability. Lots of picture galleries and blogs but not much else. It seems odd that she would be named the #3 Latina in music when she's currently working on her first album.

<li><b>Delete</b> "Latino Entertainment TV" is a made up source. If you google it, the only items that come up are the three that Ms. Reece has put on the internet talking about herself. Nothing on her page can be substantiated. How can she name herself the site's #1 latina? Has myspace announced that? She claims on her myspace page that her song has 2.8 million plays. If you go to her music page, you can see that is far from the truth. She has had less than 50,000 plays. The 2.8 million number somes from a file that she has embedded in all of her bulletins on myspace. Anytime anyone opens up the posting (including herself), the number increases. --- Jessie620 11:47, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Just because you can't find it on Google doesn't mean it's made up. Daily Variety included "Latl-Latino Entertainment Television" in their "opt-in" listing of production companies on <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11.html" title="September 11">11 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a>. The website given there, <a href="http://www.latinoentertainmenttelevision.com" class="external free" title="http://www.latinoentertainmenttelevision.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.latinoentertainmenttelevision.com</a>, appears to be offline now, though. It appears the claim for "#1 Latina" is made based on the number of MySpace friends; I made a few searches for Latinas with more than 100000 friends, and it appears to be correct, with Christina Aguilera coming in second. -- <a href="../../../j/h/u/User%7EJHunterJ_08ee.html" title="User:JHunterJ">JHunterJ</a> 13:41, 26 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Even if that is true (isn't it a bit odd the website is offline now), Somaya has put "articles" up on her website claiming to be from other journalists. None of these publications could be found and none of the writers are notable enough to be taken seriously. It could have been her neighbor writing it. The bottom line is Somaya notoriously self-promotes. It's what she does. Unfortunately, she uses made up sources to back up her false claims. In all honesty, outside of myspace, the general population does not know who she is. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Jessie620 (<a href="../../../j/e/s/User_talk%7EJessie620_ba37.html" title="User talk:Jessie620">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jessie620_ef72.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jessie620">contribs</a>) 15:28, 26 March 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>IMDB has already been pointed out to you.

It all happens to be true, but that's beside the point. I've uploaded trivia, goofs, credits information, "also known as" and other sorts of information to IMDB and none of it has ever been changed, not even typos. Absent proof that IMDB engages in the sort of editorial oversight of material uploaded as "publicity" required by <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> I can't accept it as a reliable source. Especially in light of the campaign of self-promotion that the subject of the article engages in. And even if one were to accept unquestioningly that IMDB is reliable, it does not support, and indeed no sources yet offered support, either the claims made in the article or the notion that this person passes <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 00:29, 27 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>From <a href="../../../s/e/l/WP%7ESELFPUB_ddcf.html" title="WP:SELFPUB">WP:SELFPUB</a>: "The reputation of the self-publisher is a guide to whether the material rises to the level of notability at all." The subject has a reputation for inflating her alleged notability by doing things like inserting links in posts to boost her stats and that can certainly be considered. Under WP:SELFPUB the default on self-published sources like MySpace is that they are <i>not</i> acceptable as sources especially in the absence of other independent sourcing. It must be said yet again that there are no such independent sources that establish that the subject passes either <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> or <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 15:32, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Do you have a reliable source for asserting this reputation exists?

<li>Then you shouldn't have any problem finding the substantial independent sources that <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a> demands. Where are they? And why is it that credits for the deleted Jason McMahon noted below with credits like "Baseball player" and "Janitor" wasn't notable but somehow credits like "Harlot (uncredited)" and "Music video girl" are so stellar that they establish notability. And please spare me talk of her modeling work on IMDB, because anyone, including her, can upload it and IMDB doesn't vet it. This person does not pass BIO, does not pass NOTE and you have yet to offer one word that supports the notion that she does. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 19:07, 28 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Nor do I get why you cling to the notion that credits like "Harlot (uncredited)" do anything to establish notability. Do you know what "uncredited" usually means? <b>Extra</b>.
