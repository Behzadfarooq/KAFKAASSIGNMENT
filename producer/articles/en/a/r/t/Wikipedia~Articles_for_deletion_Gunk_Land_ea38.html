<p>Probable hoax. Purportedly it was a children's show that aired exactly <i>one</i> episode, in Wisconsin, in 1984; however, as is usual for hoaxes, mysterious circumstances seem to have conspired to put obstacles in the path of anyone trying to verify that the show actually existed: the lead actor "died under mysterious circumstances in 1989", the director/producer "remains anonymous to this day", and rumoredly "tried to destroy all of the props and footage after his show was cancelled." The external links claim to list the "Gunk Land Official Site" and "Gunk Land at the Internet Movie Database", but in fact "Gunk Land" has no listing at the IMDB. Neither does its supposed lead actor, Glen Thompson. The "official site" is actually a fan site, but out of its multiple subpages, only "About", "Characters" and "Video Clips" are anything but mere "Coming Soon" stubs. The video clips don't function, so they provide no evidence for the show's existence and the "Characters" pages list all character images as "coming soon". Then there's the show itself: this was supposedly a <i>children's</i> show, complete with educational content -- but the lead character, the little girl "Jane", is played by an adult male actor? There's "a giant phallic looking pink furry puppet named One Eye", who "has been known to spit a viscous fluid when pet under the chin"? "Poh Pie cuts off his arms to stop his urges from touching the TV set"? Who believes that <i>anyone</i> would have put this on the air as a kid's program in 1984, at the height of the <a href="../../../r/o/n/Ronald_Reagan_9da1.html" title="Ronald Reagan">Reagan</a> era? This is a very full-featured hoax, and truth be told, I find these retroactive creations of shows that never existed rather intriguing, but they're not appropriate material for Wikipedia. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 20:32, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Hello, I am the person who submitted the article Gunk Land, and while I am excited to think that people think I concocted this absurd story, I have to admit my own imagination is far too lackluster. I would like to petition to keep the info up as it is real. I distinctly recall seeing it sometime back in the mid 80s. Although I am not clear of the channel, and it could very well have been one of the local cable access shows. You have to keep in mind that while the story is potentially subversive - look at the much more successful Pee Wee's Playhouse. I distinctly recall much sexual innuendo between the puppets and the live characters such as Miss Yvonne. Also look at the subversive aspects of "You Can't Do That on Television" which aired during the Bush era. To say a show is a hoax because of its potent content is silly and short sighted. I can see your point about the "anonymous" director. I chalked that up to either shame or embarassment and the need for the artist to seperate him/herself from the failed project (aka Alan Smithee). Anyhow, I do hope you consider my petition to keep the article intact, and hope all of you have some Happy Holidays! Thank you for your consideration!&#160;:) -- Aidan_NY 23:40, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Unfortunately, without <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">sources</a> you aren't making much of a case for the article. -- <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMisterHand_55c4.html" title="User:MisterHand">MisterHand</a> 23:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>That's true MisterHand, I am not able to make as much a case for the article. It seems to be much harder to prove something exists especially when I am merely going by my memory here. The fan site is the only offering of confirmation that the show exists coupled with my memory I have of the media experience. I clearly remember this show, as well as the more popular Sid &amp; Marty Kroft live action lineup of the late 70s. I also can't help but see humor and irony in the concept of an anonymous jury debating the validity of my memories and experiences.&#160;:P Anyhow, I have contacted the fansite creator but haven't heard back. I was hoping to contribute my memories of the show. I guess I'll keep looking. I'll see what I can find on IMDB. That seems to be another reputable source that exudates fact - thanks for the lead Francis Tyers!-- Aidan_NY 23:48, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

The <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropa.html" title="Dropa">dropa</a> article is not "Flyboys" [sic], as you call it; a look at its edit history doesn't show him editing it at all. Even if he had, however, we have already explained to you the rather significant difference between Wikipedia recording the details of an externally notable hoax and Wikipedia being abused to attempt the perpetration of a hoax. What do we see in the first four lines of <a href="../../../d/r/o/Dropa.html" title="Dropa">Dropa</a>? "Skeptics note, however, a number of problems with the case (and a lack of corroborative evidence), which offers significant doubt as to the reality of the more sensationalistic Dropa claims. Mainstream critics argue that the entire affair is a hoax." Your "Gunk Land" article, on the article, tries to pass itself off as the real thing. Don't bother replying if the only replying you can do depends on ignoring the crucial distinction between <i>recording</i> a notable hoax and trying to play a new hoax. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 22:51, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>I was just posting a good natured hoax article on wikipedia. (redundant info to follow: A hoax is often perpetrated as a practical joke, to cause embarrassment, for personal aggrandizement or to provoke social change through awareness) my point is that i was amazed that a layman like me with no obvious practical experience in editing, research, journalism could put up information. It was a practicle joke.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Reviewing most of Wikipedia's general guidelines, I realize I am still inept in proper coding - but it seems to me that Quarl seems to be quite over-excited in his psuedo witch hunt (Reviewing all of his heated and persistant and inane edits to mistakes that are common with a newbie really causes me to take a step back. I am not versed in how to add "comments" to these pages and will cut and paste the previous entry and fill in my reply.) - I understand most of everyone's comments in how Gunkland is not appropriate for Wikipedia. I felt it was because of the fairly recent criticism concerning this site, and my growing interest in the nature of hoaxes. Gunkland wasn't created specifically for Wikipedia - but I was planning on using Wikipedia to help make it a fact - as it is known that the internet audience is increasingly relying on the internet for fact. Gunkland is my thesis project on the blending of media experiences (blurring horror, sexploitation and children's programming) and posing an argument about whether or not asexual characters can exude either homosexuality (like spongebob or teletubbies. The Elk Hotel is a film that exists and is currently being finished - I did this all in good humor, and was not trying to cause people anxiety attacks as I seem to have caused Quarl as represented in his crude criticism - (referring to his comment about getting rid of the "crap" on the gunge page - although the word crap is totally appropriate for Gunkland in the sense that taboo bodily fluids are figuratively exploited in the world I am creating. I realize that creating a hoax needs much more work before it is generally released into the world. This was a great test for me though! lostheadfactory 08:39, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
