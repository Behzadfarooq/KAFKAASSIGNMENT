<p>The Stetsons were considered as possibly the best group to come out of Watford in the last 25 years. They formed in late 2003 and comprimised of Joe Steson on vocals, Louie Romeo Johnson on drums, Joe Chilton on guitar and Ross Tito on bass. The group enjoyed a fruitful 3 years of gigs and many underground smash bootlegs. The band split in early 2006 and other bands were soon formed from their smouldering embers. These projects include Langley Rd, described by a local fanzine as a "Freakshow of punk rock with indie attitudes", the band include former members Ross Tito and Louie Romeo Johnson. Joe Chilton went on to form Old boy, an experimental Jazz band. Joe Stetson went on to form We Smoke Fags who are currently whipping towels at adversity.</p>

<p>Mol was first played in the 19th century in the town of Mol in Belgium, after which its name is named. There is a regional championship every year in the third week of October (unless it is a leap year, in which case it takes place on the second week, traditionally).</p>
<p>It is a game for two people, and is played with the right-index finger (known in the trade as the molar). The typical rally lasts for 10 seconds, in which both players try to touch the top side of the other person's molar - from the knuckle to the nail). Gwen Gladstone says in THE BELGIUM GAME, the only comprehensive outline of the rules and history of Mol in English, that it is closely related to fencing, but is considerably faster because the players have a very small range to move the molars about in (the arena) - and because at "professional" level, players can move the molars at speeds often exceeding 103 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Although the game has been played since the late 19th century, when it was believed to have been invented by a cobbler walking in the Lake District, the Annual Championships have only been played since 1972. The very first champion was Jean Musil; and other notable past champions of what Gladstone describes as "this noble sport" include: Jonathan Baby (1994, 96, 97), and Jabadad Shuru (1998). The first female player to win was Nichola Rabbit (1999), also the first British player to win, of the frew that there remain. She lives in North Norwood with her husband and 4 children.</p>

<p><b>Curl Ball</b> was created in the late 1970s in a village just outside Porec in Croatia. The game remained fairly low key for the first few years, untill the first Curl Ball camphionships was hosted in the coastal village of Funtana, where the local team drew 3-2 with a team fromm the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Among the sport's legends over the years, one name has dominated: Carl Beatle, who boasts six championship wins to his name. Carl's long career allowed him to develop the game to what we know it is today. He coined several now mainstream moves, such as the Baptist and the Bluffing Bind Man. Unfortunately his career was cut short by a freak accident, but he will be remembered by his peers as possibly the best Curl Ball player to grace the water's edge.</p>

<p>The EcoWalk is a fun and informative guided walk through Vancouver’s world class Stanley Park, a 1,000 acre (402 hectare) nature preserve. The friendly guides give interesting information on the unique trees, plants, birds and animals as well as on the rich aboriginal First Nations culture and legends of the park. The walking pace is medium, taking 3 hours to complete and covering 8 kilometers, (5 miles) of relatively flat paved and graveled trails over selected seawall and forest paths. This walk is suitable for the whole family, including active seniors. Both visitors and residents of Vancouver who take the Stanley Park EcoWalk just love it; it sparks or renews their interest in the aboriginal First Nations culture and Canada’s unique West Coast ecology.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Want to travel 8,000 years in 3 hours? Stroll from towers to totems, from symphonies to cedars, all this in an urban setting unsurpassed for its snow-dusted mountains and rich aboriginal history?</p>
<p>If you do, then a guided Ecowalk tour in Vancouver’s Stanley Park is the trip of, well, more than a lifetime. It’s 8,000 years of lifetimes.</p>
<p>An Ecowalk Tour is a unique experience in a unique setting. Stanley Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, is a 1,000 acre nature preserve on a forested peninsula in the middle of Vancouver’s metropolitan centre, nurtured by sparkling blue water and nestled along the flak of B.C.’s lofty coastal range. The Park, preserved from bare logging by Vancouver’s first mayor David Oppenheimer and named in honour of “Dr. Livingston, I presume?” Stanley is rich in both its natural abundance and its wealth of First Nations history and culture.</p>
<p>The Ecowalk Tour, developed and guided by Robert Rickey after consultations with First Nations advisors, sets a medium walking pace and takes three hours, covering five miles (eight kilometres). The trail is relatively flat, with paved and gravel walks, along the breathtaking seawall, identifying the 20 or so tree species in the forest cover. You will visit both present-day and aboriginal sites, passing Douglas fir where eagles roost.</p>
<p>As late as 1850, the Park was home to the Khwaykwhay – “Cedar Place” -- village, and nine middens (sites of First Nations’ temporary hunting/fishing camps). Deer fed in the interior. Killer whales were still seen in the harbour where you can still spot otters and harbour seals in the waters. Even into the 20th century the Park and its rich resources were tapped by First Nations villagers, whose sites line the entire breadth of Vancouver’s coastal beaches.</p>
<p>At the centre of First Nations’ traditions was the Red Cedar, used for shelter, clothing, food, medicines and, as you will see on the tour, carving the story poles – once called totems – that recorded their families crests and lineages. Several reproductions stand in the Park and will be an important stop on the tour. The guide will explain the origins of the poles and the vital part that they play in First Nations’ family and mythological stories. Nearby is a carving shed where today’s aboriginal artists continue to record their wisdom, mythology and history through the art of the poles.</p>
<p>Along the sea wall you will be able to stand at the edge of the waters of Burrard Inlet, across from the majestic North Shore coastal mountain range and the beaches that line the shore. Look for those otters and harbour seals, as well as the many shore birds that make the tidal basins their home hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Then plunge deep into the Park itself. You will be shown twenty of species of trees, each of which had importance for aboriginal life, and later fed vast lumber mills that once dotted the shoreline.</p>
<p>At Lost Lagoon in the heart of Stanley Park you will find a peaceful sanctuary bordered by willows and reeds, where Blue Herons, Mallard Ducks, swans and geese share the pool with frogs and turtles sunning themselves on the rocks.</p>
<p>“Visiting Vancouver without experiencing a Stanley Park EcoWalk,” remarked one visitor after the tour, “would be like visiting Paris without going up the Eiffel Tower.”</p>
<p>Vancouver has many attractions for the visitor. But nowhere else will you be able to experience its natural beauty and its cultural history all in one three-hour walk. Visitors of all ages will find this a truly unique experience.</p>
<p>Please visit the website www.ecowalkbc.com for all the details on this Vancouver attraction.</p>

<p>Rosamund Stanhope (1919-2005) is a British poet and teacher known for her exuberant use of esoteric and unusual words.</p>
<p>Born in 1919, the daughter of a German leather merchant who changed his name from Sternburg to Stanhope, Rosamund Stanhope grew up on the South Coast of England. She studied Drama and English, but worked as a radio mechanic during WW2.</p>
<p>She was not a prolific writer, trying both prose and verse, but she regularly had individual poems published in the arts press of the day, and published her first book in March 1962 at the Scorpion Press. Shortly after this she broke her spine in an accident, and thereafter suffered continuous ill health for many years.</p>
<p>She maintained her teaching position, however, and began publishing again in the 1990s, when her work was much admired. She released two collections of her poems through the Peterloo Press at this time, before dying in December 2005, aged 86.</p>

The young Italian artist <b>Alex Turco</b>, develops with time new and alternative artistic excursions looking for an inedited style and an innovative vision of art.</p>
<p>He combines in a unique way the use of photography, computer and manual applications of materials such as paint, resins, glitters, and many more. He is so able to create completely new works, which look at a different value from a traditional artwork and propose themselves as alternative, different, and especially missing furnishing items.</p>
<p>The brand <b>AlexTurco new.pics.art</b> takes therefore life, which develops elements that satisfy the need of the creation or the enrichment of private and non-private environments.</p>
<p>Quality is posed as a strong production element: AlexTurco new.pics.art is proud of qualities such as <b>Italian design and Swiss manufacturing</b>.</p>

<p>The Forbidden Game trilogy is a book by L.J. Smith (Lisa Jane) about a girl named Jenny who has been watched for years by a shadow man named Julian, who fell in love with her at the age of five when she accidentaly opened a closet that was holding all of the Shadow Men in. In the first book, The Hunter, Julian has finally decided to claim Jenny as his own, but to do this, a game must be played first. Jenny buys the game for a party thinking that it's just a game, but it ends up that once everything is set up, the game becomes real. Jenny and her friends each have to defeat their own nightmares, but if they lose than their souls belong to Julian.Dee, Audrey, Mike, Zach, Jenny, and Tom make it through their nightmares, but Summer failed to get through her's. To get everyone else out, Jenny promises herself to Julian before locking him back into the closet. Everyone but Summer gets out, but the ring Julian gave her is still there. The group wants to burn the box which holds the game in it, but two guys break in and steal the box, which holds both the game and Jenny's ring, and quickly leave.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I would like to bring to your attention some local news,</p>
<p>Hairdresser Tracey Budd who sold TC's Gents Hair Design on Boldmere Road, to fund a new idea she had, has just won West Midlands Best Innovation award 2006 for a new invention that she has devised for hairstylists and students to protect their fingers from their scissors. It has took over 2 years to get the product perfected and Intellectual Property rights secured but Tracey is finally there and will be exhibiting at Excel in Docklands London for the first time, 14th to 16th October with over 42000 hairstylists visiting the exhibition Tracey feels it will be a perfect place to launch the Buddieguard. Tracey has been in the hairdressing trade for over 26 years and knows only too well that once you cut your fingers, apart from the pain and the messy plasters, there's every chance that it happens again in quick succession, because the skin is raised, this protective flexible sheath covers the two fingers that are at risk and the webbing in between. It will help students to gain confidence in their cutting ability knowing that their fingers have some protection from their very sharp scissors. Salon owners will also gain because staff will be more productive by not be having time out to clean and dress wounds at best, or at worst have time off work due to infections, Ray Seymour (President of National Hairdressing Federation) Is very interested in buddieguard, as it is a health and safety product. Tracey said "It's been a long difficult road, but it would have been an impossible one, if I had not had the people around me that have made it worthwhile and possible"</p>
<p><br />
If you would like to contact me regarding this story My name is Steve Budd 0780 800 2655</p>

Thank you.

<p>Rob Holmes is Founder &amp; CEO of IPCybercrime.com. Originally coined the phrase "IP Cybercrime".</p>
<p>Raised in New Jersey in a family of private investigators, Rob worked his first trademark infringement case at the age of twelve. In the early nineties, after college, Rob left home to forge a life for himself in Los Angeles. While aspiring as a stand-up comedian, he found employment at a premiere intellectual property investigative firm. In 1995, Rob found himself assigned to investigate a new breed of faceless perpetrators: Cybercriminals. Here, he conducted some of the world’s first IP-related Internet investigations, and played an integral part in many cases that led to the inception of Ebay's VeRO program, the passing of the DMCA and the Anti-Cybersquatting Act.</p>
<p>Rob Holmes pioneered the study of the “virtual crime scene”, comprised of three primary types of evidence: physical, digital, and psychological. While most investigators were busy “thinking outside-the-box”, Rob knew all along that there is no box.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Rob Holmes has been operating the world’s first and leading Internet IP enforcement program, which he founded. His clients are a Who’s Who list of Fortune 500 companies; many of which have been with him since the beginning.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Rob has been sought as an advisor to a wide range of officials and businesspeople. Rob has been featured on television, books, and newspapers; and has been well-received as a speaker on the topic of IP Cybercrime.</p>

<p>The Forbidden Game trilogy is a book by L.J. Smith (Lisa Jane) about a girl named Jenny who has been watched for years by a shadow man named Julian, who fell in love with her at the age of five when she accidentally opened a closet that was holding all of the Shadow Men in.</p>
<p>In the first book, The Hunter, Julian has finally decided to claim Jenny as his own, but to do this; a game must be played first. Jenny buys the game for a party thinking that it's just a game, but it ends up that once everything is set up, the game becomes real. Jenny and her friends each have to defeat their own nightmares, but if they lose than their souls belong to Julian. Dee, Audrey, Mike, Zach, Jenny, and Tom, Jenny's boyfriend, make it through their nightmares, but Summer failed to get through her's. To get everyone else out, Jenny promises herself to Julian before locking him back into the closet. Everyone but Summer gets out, but the ring Julian gave her is still there. The group wants to burn the box, which holds the game in it, but two guys break in and steal the box, which holds both the game and Jenny's ring, and quickly leave.</p>
<p>In the second book of the trilogy, The Chase, the group of friends has to explain about the disappearance of Summer, while trying to find the box that contains the game. Julian was still trapped in the closet, but there was a chance that the two boys that stole the game might let Julian out. All of the friends begin to have nightmares, and unnatural weird occurrences at school are happening in the daytime. Finally, when Jenny is at the senior prom, Julian appears. Julian gives Jenny a chance to break free, but the stakes were the same as the last game. This time the game is "Goats and Tigers", where Julian is the tiger, and the friends are the goats trying to hide from him; for the goats to win, they have to find the Tiger's base. One by one Jenny's friends start disappearing, and Jenny is the only one left. She manages to find the base by tricking Julian. She finds her friends, but to get out they have to pass through a wall of flames. Everyone makes it but Tom and Zach, and to get them back again, along with Summer, Mike, Dee, Audrey, and Jenny have to find a way into the Shadow World.</p>
<p>In the last of the three, The Kill, the remaining four run away to Monessen, the place where Jenny's grandfather had lived before being taken away by the Shadow Men. They believed that there was a portal to the Shadow World there, and there was. When the four enter the Shadow World, they find themselves in a closed amusement park. After looking and experiencing some of the attractions, which are made to be like nightmares, Julian appears, and he tells them that if they find three Spanish doubloons in the amusement park, everyone will get to go free. The four friends search through the amusement park and find Summer, who is still alive. They also find three other souls being kept by the Shadow Men, the two boys who stole the game, and Jenny's grandfather who had been taken when Jenny opened the closet door. They set the three free without knowing the consequences, and they find the three doubloon coins to save Zach and Tom. Right as they all are leaving, the Shadow Men appear and say that the group has taken the souls, which were theirs. The older Shadow Men want to take Jenny's soul, but Julian says that he will take her place. The seven leave with some despair on Jenny's part, and get back home. When questioned what would happen if the Shadow Men brought Julian back to life, Jenny wished him well.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Characters:</p>
<p>Julian: The youngest of the Shadow Men, an ancient race that lived in darkness. He fell in love with Jenny when she opened the closet, which the Shadow Men had been captured in by her grandfather, and watched Jenny for countless years making sure that nothing bad ever happened to her.</p>
<p>Jenny: The "Light to his darkness". She has a natural goodness around her and fought her way through challenges to save both herself and her friends. Julian offered her is love which she refused until the end because of her love for her boyfriend, Tom.</p>
<p>Tom: The boyfriend. He is best described as an athletic Jock. He has been dating Jenny since the second grade and will do practically anything to keep her safe.</p>
<p>Zach: Zach is Jenny's cousin who is into photography. He has problems with his father because Zach represents all that is new and modern while his father stays with tradition.</p>
<p>Mike: He is described as the lovable one in the bunch and is going out with Audrey. His father is a Science fiction novelist, which makes Mike know about a lot of things that are happening.</p>
<p>Audrey: Audrey is the newest one in the group because her father being an ambassador moved them around different countries for many years. She knows many things about other places and myths, but she still has a conflicting nature with Dee.</p>
<p>Dee: Dee holds the confidence and strength in the group and is described as an Egyptian princess. Dee tries to stick with traditions and athletics while trying to avoid new high technology things because those are the only things that she thinks can defeat her.</p>
<p>Summer: She is the caring loving one in the group, but not much is told about her because of her disappearance in the first book, but throughout she has almost an entire town trying to find out what really happened to her.</p>

<p>GENTS, also "G PHI G" or "GENTS 1964" is a high schoool fraternal organization. In 1964, the original chapter of the GENTS was founded at Booker T. Washington High School in Houston, Texas by Mr. Langston Knowles. GENTS derives its culture from the african-american fraternal organizations and to this day is predominately african-american. GENTS chapters compete in step shows against each other and black fraternities. GENTS is now present at over 29 different Houston area high schools. Gents are notable for being the only fraternal organization present in Houston-area schools. Gents have a sister organization called YLD or "Young Ladies of Distinction". Gents members wear maroon and grey letterman's jackets.</p>

<p>The Epsilon PI Chapter of Beta Theta Pi is a fraternal organization affiliated with the Beta Theta Pi International Fraternity and based out of the University of California Santa Barbara - . It Colonized in the Winter of 1989, in the 150th anniversary year of Beta Theta Pi's founding, the Epsilon Pi chapter was founded during the hey-day of modern fraternities in a time when the emphasis was often on things other than the life-long friendships and relationships that could be developed during a man's undergraduate years.</p>
<p>From the beginning, the Epsilon Pi chapter has always fought against the "frat guy" stereotype and placed the development of its members as one of its highest priorities. From the first meeting of the Epsilon Pi chapter to the present, Beta at UCSB has always been about its members and developing a brotherhood other fraternal organizations could recognize and envy.</p>
<p>In 1991, the General Fraternity of Beta Theta Pi granted the Epsilon Pi chapter its charter, moving the fledgling colony to full chapter status granting it all the rights and privileges of a chapter of Beta Theta Pi. Shortly thereafter, the Epsilon Pi chapter secured housing for its members at 839 Embarcadero del Norte where members lived until 1999.</p>
<p>Beta Theta Pi has a strong history of philanthropic involvement and the Epsilon Pi c hapter is no different. Starting in 1997, the Epsilon Pi chapter partnered with the American Cancer Society to host Beta Softball, a Greek-wide philanthropy softball tournament that raised over $4000 in its inaugural year. Since then, the Epsilon Pi chapter has helped raise over $20,000 for charitable organizations.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1999, the Epsilon Pi chapter moved to a new house at 750 Embarcadero del Mar where active members currently reside. The house features 16 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms, a beach volleyball court, and a sundeck which overlooks one of the busiest streets in all of Isla Vista.</p>
<p>Since then, the Epsilon Pi chapter has been welcoming new members, friends and family to the house as well as UCSB faculty and staff. The chapter has hosted several benefit events such as the annual Thanksgiving Dinner and the Jingle Ball, a toy-drive that takes place shortly before finals in Fall Quarter.</p>

<p>Hidden away in the northernmost tip of the Arabian Sea lies one of the worlds last few undiscovered angling destinations.</p>
<p>In the South, Pakistan's vast coastline is even today; largely unexplored and sport anglers have only scratched the surface of this pristine sea. Saltwater game fishing in Pakistan has developed in its own unique way over the last 20 years in terms of tackle, techniques and boats. A century old Pakistani boatbuilding and seafaring tradition, with the new generation of conservation minded anglers, technology and tackle has combined to make angling in Pakistan a truly unforgettable experience.</p>
<p>The variety of saltwater gamefish is astounding and may favourably be compared to Australia or New Zealand. In fact Pakistan has just beaten Australia's record of Talang Queenfish (16.5kg) to become the world record holding country for this species. The snubnose pompano world record has also been broken in Pakistan. Two world records in as many years! The unique feature of our offshore fisheries are the sheer number of species of potential world record size that can be regularly caught. Cobia and narrowbarred mackeral are two species of note which are on the verge of being broken in Pakistan. Cobia of near world record size are caught each year in Pakistan and the record has unofficially been broken a few times. The same applies for narrow barred mackeral (or tanguige as it is known in Australia), with the Pakistan record falling mere pounds below the current world record. A glance at the list of species available to the saltwater angler makes one relaize why comparisons may be made to the great Australian and New Zealand fisheries. All three marlin species plus swordfish, yellowfin, bigeye, dogtooth, longtail and a host of the smaller tuna species abound. Mako, hammerheads, tiger, bull, lemon, and white sharks also feature prominently. Offshore waters are also full of the mandatory dorado. In addition to this the near shore waters hold cobia, tanguige, groupers, amberjack, snappers, rainbow runners, barracuda, and four species of trevally (including GTS) to complete all the requirements of a world class fishery. All this in the tiny secton of our extensive coastline where sportfishing activities are currently being conducted.</p>
<p>As one travels north from the coastline the terrain changes to extensive mangroves and saltwater estuaries. Barramundi, giant threadfin salmon, red and black drum, mangrove snappers, flathead and a host of other inshore species abound here and reports of massive barramundi and threadfin salmon are commonplace. The saltwater environment then gives way to Pakistan’s fantastic floodplains, and finally into freshwater lakes and rivers. The extend of flora and fauna in this region is now becomes apparent as this region is one of the worlds seven major migration routes for waterfowl. Thus, heavily fertilized, world famous lakes and dams such as Keenjhar lake, Haleji lake, Ranwal dam, Hab dam, Tarbela dam and a host of others provide exciting freshwater game fish. Topping the quarry list are the mighty mahseer, elusive snakeheads, numerous large catfish species and of course many carp species. These provide the course angler and freshwater plug caster with all the action he can possibly ask for.</p>
<p>The floodplains are finally interrupted in the extreme north of Pakistan where the mighty stretches of the Karakoram and Hindukush mountains boast thousands of streams and lakes. Here lies some of the world’s most exciting wild trout and Mahseer action. Given the remoteness of the best of the hot spots freshwater fishing in Pakistan is an adventure that involves not only world class fishing, it guarantee’s to “take your breath away”. It’s a time portal, which grants every angler the opportunity to once again revisit his real reason he started fishing.</p>
<p>However these unique and relatively un-exploited destinations do not exist without their setbacks. Without any active regulatory body, sport fishing in Pakistan is rapidly becoming a meat collection race, with no bag limits, undefined seasons and no concept of catch and release. Fishing continues without a thought for sustenance, no thought for the future.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the essence of sport fishing and ensure development, not degradation, it is pivotal that we, the anglers, develop and practice ethical parameters within which we conduct our sport.</p>

<p>By ocean dumping one understands the disposal of waste on the water. In many cases this concerns liquid waste, e.g. thinned sulphuric acid, or residues from the cleaning of ships and tanks. Most of it is regulated by organizations, for example the MARPOL. In Germany and the rest of the European Union ocean dumping isn’t allowed any more.</p>

<p>The Royal Copenhagen Porcelain factory (in Danish: "Den kongelige Porcelænsfabrik") was founded in 1775 under the protection of Queen Juliane Marie and has since been recognised by its factory mark, the three waved lines above each other, which symbolises Denmark’s three straits: Øresund, Store Bælt and Lille Bælt above the other.</p>
<p>The factory was founded by a chemist, Frantz Heinrich Müller, who was given a 50-year monopoly. When, in 1779, the king assumed financial responsibility, the factory was styled the Royal Porcelain Factory. (Source: Encyclopædia Britannica).</p>
<p>In 1868 The Royal Copenhagen Porcelain factory came into private hands and in 1882 the faience factory Aluminia purchased the factory. Shortly after Aluminia's acquisition of the factory, the production was moved to a modern factory building at Alumina’s site in Frederiksberg, on the outskirts of Copenhagen. Royal Copenhagen still has a factory shop there, but the actual production have moved outside the city today.</p>
<p>Among the most famous patterns are (<i>original manufacturer in parenthesis</i>):</p>
<p>- <a href="../../../f/l/o/Flora_Danica_936c.html" title="Flora Danica">Flora Danica</a>, Blue Fluted (in Danish: Musselmalet), Blue Flower, Henriette, Saxon Flower, Fan, Gemina, and Gemma (Royal Copenhagen) - Empire, Offenbach, Butterfly, and Seagull (Bing &amp; Grøndahl) - Tranquebar (Aluminia)</p>
<p>Royal Copenhagen acquired <a href="../../../g/e/o/Georg_Jensen_53e9.html" title="Georg Jensen">Georg Jensen</a> Silversmithy in 1972, and incorporated with Holmegaards Glassworks in 1985 and finally Bing &amp; Grøndahl in 1987. Royal Copenhagen is today a part of Royal Scandinavia together with Georg Jensen and is owned by the Danish private equity fund, <a href="http://www.axcel.dk/" class="external text" title="http://www.axcel.dk/" rel="nofollow">Axcel</a>. Following Axcel's acquisition of Royal Scandinavia, Holmegaard Glasworks has been sold in a <a href="../../../m/b/o/MBO_0eac.html" title="MBO">MBO</a> and a controlling interest in the Swedish glass works Orrefors Kosta Boda has been sold to New Wave Group.</p>

<p>Document clustering is closely related to concept of <a href="../../../d/a/t/Data_clustering.html" title="Data clustering">data clustering</a>. Document clustering is a more specific technique for unsupervised document organization, automatic topic extraction and fast information retrieval or filtering. For example, a web search engine often returns thousands of pages in response to a broad query, making it difficult for users to browse or to identify relevant information. Clustering methods can be used to automatically group the retrieved documents into a list of meaningful categories, as is achieved by Enterprise Search engines such as <a href="../../../n/o/r/Northern_Light_0663.html" title="Northern Light">Northern Light</a> and <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivisimo.html" title="Vivisimo">Vivisimo</a>.<br />
Example:<br />
[<a href="http://FirstGov.gov" class="external text" title="http://FirstGov.gov" rel="nofollow">FirstGov.gov</a>], the official Web portal for the U.S. government uses document clustering to automatically organize its search results into categories. For example if a user submits “immigration” next to their list of results they will see categories for “Immigration Reform”, “Citizenship and Immigration Services”, “Employment”, “Department of Homeland Security”, and more.<br /></p>

<p>"Illinois Jane and the Pyramid of Peril" is an adventure-comedy play by playwright <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colorado_Tolston_621c.html" title="Colorado Tolston">Colorado Tolston</a>, published by Pioneer Drama Service. The play features fictional adventure heroine Dr. Illinois Jane, cartographer extraordinaire, as she and her nerdy sidekick, Sid Knickerbock, search for the Elixir of Life that is hidden in the lost pyramid of <a href="../../../h/a/t/Hatshepsut.html" title="Hatshepsut">Hatshepsut</a>. In the process they must face the "odor-endowed villain" Pierre LeMalodeur who also seeks the Elixir, backed up by his two henchmen: Claude and Marcel, mime of evil. Other characters include Illinois' overbearing father, Dr. Thaddeus Jane, as well as Captain Nobeard, mighty pirate, and his first mate Tin Toe Terry, reasonably mighty pirate. While in many ways the play is a spoof of the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indiana_Jones_9930.html" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> saga, it does contain its own unique elements and stands alone as its own story. A variety of clever, low-budget special effects add to the charm and humor (the highlight is the classic "fight on a moving vechicle").</p>
<p>"Illinois Jane" was premiered by The Hodge-Podge Theatre Company of Saint Paul, Minnesota and has been performed across the United States since its publication in 2005 by Pioneer Drama Service. It also made an appearance at the 2006 <a href="../../../m/i/n/Minnesota_Fringe_Festival_43ec.html" title="Minnesota Fringe Festival">Minnesota Fringe Festival</a>, produced by The Pauper's Theater. A video trailer for this production can be found online on Google Video.</p>

FirstGov.gov, the official U.S. gateway to all government information, is the catalyst for a growing electronic government. It is an easy-to-search, free-access website designed to give citizens a centralized place to find information from U.S. local, state and federal government agency websites.<br />
<br />
FirstGov.gov is an interagency initiative administered by the <a href="../../../u/2E/s/U.S._General_Services_Administration_5143.html" title="U.S. General Services Administration">U.S. General Services Administration</a>. It got its start when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research was funded by the Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to government. That gift helped accelerate the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal.<br />
<br />
In June 2000, the President announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization established by Brewer, and instructed that FirstGov.gov be launched in 90 days. FirstGov.gov went online on September 22, 2000. The GSA and 22 federal agencies funded the initiative in 2001 and 2002. Since 2002, FirstGov.gov has received an annual appropriation in President Bush's fiscal year budget.<br />
<br />
FirstGov.gov’s powerful search, supported by <a href="../../../v/i/v/Vivisimo.html" title="Vivisimo">Vivisimo</a> and <a href="../../../m/i/c/Microsoft.html" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>’s MSN, offers an ever-growing collection of topical and customer-focused links connecting citizens to millions of web pages–from the federal government, local and tribal governments and to foreign nations around the world.<br />
<br />
FirstGov.gov is also pleased to provide a Spanish-language web portal, FirstGov en Español. It's the U.S. government's gateway to thousands of government resources–all in Spanish and developed by, and for, Spanish speakers.</p>

<p><a href="../../../i/n/f/Information_retrieval.html" title="Information retrieval">Information retrieval</a> methods and online search have been available since the late 1960s. It is with the popularization of <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> that search and retrieval as a discipline has grown in importance and popularity. The interest in enterprise search spiked upward largely in part to the increase use of web search. Enterprise Search is the attempt to make certain types of content available to authorized employees, partners, customers or contractors associated with an organization. The end-users of these organizations needed a solution that would allow them to search their digital data residing on their personal computers, corporate web sites, subscription services, <a href="../../../c/o/n/Content_management_systems.html" title="Content management systems">content management systems</a> and departmental servers.<br /></p>
<p>A simple definition of enterprise search states that it is a system that allows an administrator to identify specific content to be indexed, searched and displayed to authorized users. The core features can then be described as:<br /></p>
<p>1) The technology to take a document, <a href="../../../i/n/d/Index.html" title="Index">index</a> the words in that document and configure that index such that a user can search it.<br /></p>
<p>2) Administrative controls to allow a license to index certain documents and not others, and adjust the system so that the speed of indexing, query processing, relevancy ranking and myriad other attributes can be altered.<br /></p>
<p>3) Logs to record user behavior; for example, the number of queries, the number of hits a document receives, the most frequently used search terms and dozens if not hundreds of other measures.<br /></p>
<p>Outside of these core features the variation in functionality among leading enterprise search vendors is extensive including <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxonomy.html" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> tools, document clustering, data source connectors, guided navigation, entity extraction, semantic technologies and thousands of other extensions and features.<br /></p>

<p>Creating a search index is a required step that takes place when a <a href="../../../s/e/a/Search_engine.html" title="Search engine">search engine</a> is being used to crawl either the <a href="../../../w/o/r/World_Wide_Web_2386.html" title="World Wide Web">World Wide Web</a> or inside a corporate, proprietary network or a personal computer. Indexing includes the processes associated with identifying the key words in a document. Once the key words are identified, pointers are created to them.<br /></p>
<p>The indexing step can also perform a value-added process in order to create synonyms for words or concepts in a document, identify the specific topics discussed in a document and map the document into an enterprise <a href="../../../t/a/x/Taxonomy.html" title="Taxonomy">taxonomy</a> or classification schema. For example, a document may discuss a new technology without referencing a new product initiative, yet still be highly relevant for anyone interested in that initiative.</p>
<p>Indexing functions can include linguistic and semantic services that attempt to read and understand a document. These systems can create a synopsis of the document, identify and extract specific facts in a document, and examine the words and concepts in a document in order to modify the behavior of the indexing system itself. In general, indexing systems that rely on mathematics such as <a href="../../../b/a/y/Bayesian.html" title="Bayesian">Bayesian</a> logic can index content more quickly than systems that use linguistic and semantic processes. Systems that combine statistical and linguistic systems generally require more computational resources together than a system that uses a statistical approach to indexing.</p>

<p>" TELEAVIA, design also matters », this visionary motto appeared in 1963, way before Apple’s design revolution started. Thomson Company got the famous designer Roger Tallon to revolutionize the shape of TV sets. He later said to explain the trademark’s success and longevity: “It was the first time the shape, the function and the material absolutely intertwined”. Today, TELEAVIA is still an icon with TV models at the MOMA in NY and in other design museums around the world.</p>

<p>TIKTINER is a famous Designer from the French Riviera whose collections were distributed in France of course, but also in Europe, England and even New York.</p>
<p>For many decades TIKTINER embodied the « joie de vivre » garment from Cannes, St Tropez and Nice: casual and yet so chic. Enough chic to be on cover of magazines such as LIFE and ELLE. Two complete collections were created every year: blouses, swimsuits, coats and dresses, some of which were exclusively sold in Harrods London and Bergdorf Goodman New York.</p>
<p>In 2008 we will be celebrating the 100th anniversary of TIKTINER!</p>

<p>Young Gunz first came out in1999 in Bermuda, they started Djing public dances and different events. CEO Drew aka Skip brought the sound out along with chris aka Shady, Chris D aka chicken, Justin aka Snake and a couple of other guys in the click.</p>
<p>As years went by so did Young Gunz, they slowly got bigger and and slowly started to accumulate dubplates (professional artist bigging up a their sound) from locals, when they got their first forgien dubplate which was Sean Paul, it been one good thing after another since that and they have never stopped.</p>
<p>From 2002 to about the end of 2003 summer they really wasn't too much with the sound. Shady went off to school and Chicken started working full time snd left Drew by him self. That when Skip asked an up and comer at the time David aka Big D to join the sound. When he joined he soon linked up with a sound called Stalwart and been workin with them ever since. Both sounds teamed up and started playing every tuesday night on Bermynet (Bermuda's number one entertainment website and party organiser) and booking cruises at least once a month. Things were just getting started for the sound, when Henery aka Porta-G joined the family. they became stronger and were now getting forgien dubplates every week.</p>
<p>Young Gunz have been in a few sound clashes (Dj's busting out their dubplates in a music battle) and have done pretty good, and thats when summer 2004 came around and they were in the biggest sound clash of the summer. YoungGunz-Vs.-Rapid Fya-Vs.-Supatone. They finished second however the experience made them better. By then Scotty aka Round Head and Keegan aka Keebla had joined the sound thins were comming together even better now.</p>
<p>They are one of the few young sounds on Bermuda who are still going strong, they entertain the people by playing nice vibes all night and play what the people want to hear. They also play old songs if thats what the people want to hear.</p>

<p>Due to the running out of fresh water supplies, the World bank has supported the policy of water privatization. In 1998 the World Bank would not give a $25 million (US)loan to Cochabamba to improve water services unless it privatized its public water system, it was eventually sold to Bechtel who doubled water prices, making water bills account for over half of the average citizen's monthly wage. The loan that the World Bank granted was not allowed to subsidize the poor for water bills and this made the situation worse. On April 10 2000, hundreds of thousands of Bolivians marched to Cochabamba and in responce the government revoked Bechtel's water privatisation legislation, making it a victory for the thousands that couldn't afford to pay their water bills.</p>

<p>The Reykjavik City Museum (Árbæjarsafn) is the Reykjavik municipal museum and also the biggest Open Air Museum in Iceland. The Museum was founded in 1957, when the city authorities decided to preserve the old farmstead of Árbær which was located on the borders of Reykjavik. At the time there were plans to redevelop the City Centre of Reykjavik and the City authorities wanted to preserve examples of building around the farm. The first building was moved in 1961 and some 20 more buildings have been moved since. As of 2006 there are further plans to move houses to the site.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Museum is to give the public an insight into living conditions, work and recreations of the people of Reykjavik in earlier times. The Museum is opened from June till August, 10 – 17 every day. Special events are held during weekends and public holidays. During the winter months there are special guided tours by the staff Mondays, Wednesday and Fridays at 13.</p>

<p>Victor B. Geller is the author of Orthodoxy Awakens: The Belkin Era and Yeshiva University.</p>
<p>During a professional career that extended over four decades, Victor Geller played a significant role in the development of the Orthodox Jewish community of North America.</p>
<p>Prior to his retirement as Dean of Communal Services at the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS) of Yeshiva University, he occupied a series of important roles at Y.U., including the organization of many Orthodox synagogues in the post-war era. Most remarkably, perhaps, was his position as Director of Rabbinic Placement at RIETS. In this unique capacity, Mr. Geller was the only layman in America to ever supervise rabbinic placement.</p>
<p>Prior to joining the Y.U. staff, Mr. Geller also served on the staffs of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations and the National Council of Young Israel.</p>
<p>From Halifax to Vancouver, from Los Angeles to Miami, Mr. Geller’s travels afforded him the opportunity to study Jewish communities, large and small. A gifted speaker, he has lectured and written extensively about the ever-changing trends in Jewish life. His writing has appeared in many publications, including Legacy (HarperCollins), Tradition, Judaism, Jewish Life, Jewish Action, Jewish Horizon, and Jewish Spectator.</p>
<p>A decorated veteran of World War II, Mr. Geller and his wife, Hanya, made aliyah in 1999, and live in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Girandoni Air Rifle was a rifle designed by Bartholomäus Girandoni circa 1779. Also known as the Windbüchse, it was of the same basic size and shape as other muskets of the time, but was powered by compressed air instead of gun powder. It fired a 51 caliber ball, at a velocity similar to that of a modern 45 ACP, from a tubular amgazine with a capacity of 20 balls. With a full air resevoir in the buttstock the Girandoni Air Rifle had the capacity to shoot 30 shots. These balls were effective to aproximately 150 yards.<br /></p>
<p>The Girandoni Air Rifle was in service with the Austrian army from 1780 to around 1815. The advantages of a high rate of fire, no smoke from propellants, and low muzzle report granted it initial acceptence, but it was eventually removed from service for several reasons. While the detachable air resevoir was capable of around 30 shots it took nearly 1500 pumps of a hand pump to pump those resevoirs. In addition, the weapon was very delicate and a small break could make it inoperable. Finally, it was very different from any other weapon of the time and any soldier using it needed to be highly trained.<br /></p>
<p>The Girandoni Air Rifle was an important first. It was one of the first uses of a tubular magazine, the coil spring, and air compression for firearms. And, although it saw service for only 35 years, it was more advanced in design and technology then the Henry rifle which didn't arrive for another fifty years.</p>

<p><br />
Function templates Function templates are special functions that can operate with generic types. This allows us to create a function template whose functionality can be adapted to more than one variable type or class without repeating the code for each type. This is achieved through template parameters. A template parameter is a special kind of parameter that can be used to pass a type as parameter. These function templates can use these parameters as if they were regular types.</p>
<p>The format for declaring function templates with type parameters is:</p>
<p>template &lt;class identifier&gt; function_declaration; template &lt;typename identifier&gt; function_declaration;</p>
<p><br />
The only difference between both prototypes is the use of either the keyword class or the keyword typename. Its use is indistinct since both expressions have exactly the same meaning and behave exactly the same way.</p>
<p>For example, to create a template function that returns the greater one of two objects we could use:</p>
<p>template &lt;class myType&gt; myType GetMax (myType a, myType b) {</p>
<pre>
return (a&gt;b?a:b);
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Here we have created a template function with myType as its template parameter. This template parameter represents a type that has not yet been specified, but that can be used in the template function as if it were a regular type. As you can see, the function template GetMax returns the greater of two parameters of this still-undefined type.</p>
<p>To use this function template we use the following format for the function call:</p>
<p>function_name &lt;type&gt; (parameters);</p>
<p><br />
For example, to call GetMax to compare two integer values of type int we can write:</p>
<p>int x,y; GetMax &lt;int&gt; (x,y);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>When the compiler encounters this call to a template function, it uses the template to automatically generate a function replacing each appearance of myType by the type passed as the actual template parameter (int in this case) and then calls it. This process is automatically performed by the compiler and is invisible to the programmer.</p>
<p>Here is the entire example:</p>
<p>// function template</p>
<ol>
<li>include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; T GetMax (T a, T b) {</p>
<pre>
 T result;
 result = (a&gt;b)? a : b;
 return (result);
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>int main () {</p>
<pre>
 int i=5, j=6, k;
 long l=10, m=5, n;
 k=GetMax&lt;int&gt;(i,j);
 n=GetMax&lt;long&gt;(l,m);
 cout &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
 cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; endl;
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre>
6
</pre>
<p>10</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this case we have used T as the template parameter name instead of myType because it is shorter and in fact is a very common template parameter name. But you can use any identifier you like.</p>
<p>In the example above we used the function template GetMax() twice. The first time with arguments of type int and the second one with arguments of type long. The compiler has instantiated and then called each time the appropriate version of the function.</p>
<p>As you can see, the type T is used within the GetMax() template function even to declare new objects of that type:</p>
<p>T result;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Therefore, result will be an object of the same type as the parameters a and b when the function template is instantiated with a specific type.</p>
<p>In this specific case where the generic type T is used as a parameter for GetMax the compiler can find out automatically which data type has to instantiate without having to explicitly specify it within angle brackets (like we have done before specifying &lt;int&gt; and &lt;long&gt;). So we could have written instead:</p>
<p>int i,j; GetMax (i,j);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Since both i and j are of type int, and the compiler can automatically find out that the template parameter can only be int. This implicit method produces exactly the same result:</p>
<p>// function template II</p>
<ol>
<li>include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; T GetMax (T a, T b) {</p>
<pre>
 return (a&gt;b?a:b);
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>int main () {</p>
<pre>
 int i=5, j=6, k;
 long l=10, m=5, n;
 k=GetMax(i,j);
 n=GetMax(l,m);
 cout &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; endl;
 cout &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; endl;
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre>
6
</pre>
<p>10</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Notice how in this case, we called our function template GetMax() without explicitly specifying the type between angle-brackets &lt;&gt;. The compiler automatically determines what type is needed on each call.</p>
<p>Because our template function includes only one template parameter (class T) and the function template itself accepts two parameters, both of this T type, we cannot call our function template with two objects of different types as arguments:</p>
<p>int i; long l; k = GetMax (i,l);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This would not be correct, since our GetMax function template expects two arguments of the same type, and in this call to it we use objects of two different types.</p>
<p>We can also define function templates that accept more than one type parameter, simply by specifying more template parameters. For example:</p>
<p>template &lt;class T, class U&gt; T GetMin (T a, U b) {</p>
<pre>
 return (a&lt;b?a:b);
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>In this case, our function template GetMin() accepts two parameters of different types and returns an object of the same type as the first parameter (T) that is passed. For example, after that declaration we could call GetMin() with:</p>
<p>int i,j; long l; i = GetMin&lt;int,long&gt; (j,l);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>or simply:</p>
<p>i = GetMin (j,l);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>even though j and l have different types. But the compiler can determine the apropriate instantiation anyway.</p>
<p><br />
Class templates We also have the possibility to write class templates, so that a class can have members that use template parameters as types. For example: template &lt;class T&gt; class pair {</p>
<pre>
   T values [2];
 public:
   pair (T first, T second)
   {
     values[0]=first; values[1]=second;
   }
</pre>
<p>};</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The class that we have just defined serves to store two elements of any valid type. For example, if we wanted to declare an object of this class to store two integer values of type int with the values 115 and 36 we would write:</p>
<p>pair&lt;int&gt; myobject (115, 36);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>this same class would also be used to create an object to store any other type:</p>
<p>pair&lt;float&gt; myfloats (3.0, 2.18);</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The only member function in the previous class template has been defined inline within the class declaration itself. In case that we define a function member outside the declaration of the class template, we must always precede that definition with the template &lt;...&gt; prefix:</p>
<p>// class templates</p>
<ol>
<li>include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; class pair {</p>
<pre>
   T a, b;
 public:
   pair (T first, T second)
     {a=first; b=second;}
   T getmax ();
</pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; T pair&lt;T&gt;::getmax () {</p>
<pre>
 T retval;
 retval = a&gt;b? a : b;
 return retval;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>int main () {</p>
<pre>
 pair &lt;int&gt; myobject (100, 75);
 cout &lt;&lt; myobject.getmax();
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre>
100

</pre>
<p><br />
Notice the syntax of the definition of member function getmax:</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; T pair&lt;T&gt;::getmax ()</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Confused by so many T's? There are three T's in this declaration. The first one is the template parameter. The second T refers to the type returned by the function. And the third T (the one between angle brackets) is also a requirement. It specifies that this function's template parameter is also the class template parameter.</p>
<p><br />
Template specialization If we want to define a different implementation for a template when a specific type is passed as template parameter, we can declare a specialization of that template. For example, let's suppose that we have a very simple class called container that can store one element of any type and that it has just one member function called increase, that increases its value. But we find that when it stores an element of type char it would be more convenient to have a completely different implementation with a function member uppercase, so we decide to declare a class template specialization for that type:</p>
<p>// template specialization</p>
<ol>
<li>include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; class container {</p>
<pre>
   T element;
 public:
   container (T arg) {element=arg;}
   T increase () {return ++element;}
</pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>template &lt;&gt; class container &lt;char&gt; {</p>
<pre>
   char element;
 public:
   container (T arg) {element=arg;}
   char uppercase ();
</pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>template &lt;&gt; char container&lt;char&gt;::uppercase() {</p>
<pre>
 if ((element&gt;='a')&amp;&amp;(element&lt;='z'))
 element+='A'-'a';
 return element;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>int main () {</p>
<pre>
 container&lt;int&gt; myint (7);
 container&lt;char&gt; mychar ('j');
 cout &lt;&lt; myint.increase() &lt;&lt; endl;
 cout &lt;&lt; mychar.uppercase() &lt;&lt; endl;
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre>
8
</pre>
<p>J</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>This is the syntax used in the class template specialization:</p>
<p>template &lt;&gt; class container &lt;char&gt; { ... };</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>First of all, notice that we precede the class template name with template&lt;&gt;. This is a requirement in standard C++ for all template specializations, although some compilers, as an anachronism, support to declare template specialization without this prefix.</p>
<p>But more important than this prefix, is the &lt;char&gt; specialization parameter after the class template name. This specialization parameter itself identifies the type for which we are going to declare a template class specialization (char). Notice the differences between the generic class template and the specialization:</p>
<p>template &lt;class T&gt; class container { ... }; template &lt;&gt; class container &lt;char&gt; { ... };</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The first line is the generic template, and the second one is the specialization.</p>
<p>When we declare specializations for a template class, we must also define all its members, because there is no inheritance of members from the generic template to the specialization.</p>
<p><br />
Non-type parameters for templates Besides the template arguments that are preceded by the class or typename keywords , which represent types, templates can also have regular typed parameters, similar to those found in functions. As an example, have a look at this class template that is used to contain sequences of elements: // sequence template</p>
<ol>
<li>include &lt;iostream&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>using namespace std;</p>
<p>template &lt;class T, int N&gt; class sequence {</p>
<pre>
   T memblock [N];
 public:
   void setmember (int x, T value);
   T getmember (int x);
</pre>
<p>};</p>
<p>template &lt;class T, int N&gt; void sequence&lt;T,N&gt;::setmember (int x, T value) {</p>
<pre>
 memblock[x]=value;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>template &lt;class T, int N&gt; T sequence&lt;T,N&gt;::getmember (int x) {</p>
<pre>
 return memblock[x];
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>int main () {</p>
<pre>
 sequence &lt;int,5&gt; myints;
 sequence &lt;double,5&gt; myfloats;
 myints.setmember (0,100);
 myfloats.setmember (3,3.1416);
 cout &lt;&lt; myints.getmember(0) &lt;&lt; '\n';
 cout &lt;&lt; myfloats.getmember(3) &lt;&lt; '\n';
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>}</p>
<pre>
100
</pre>
<p>3.1416</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>It is also possible to set default values or types for class template parameters. For example, if the previous class template definition had been:</p>
<p>template &lt;class T=char, int N=10&gt; class sequence {..};</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We could create objects using the default template parameters by declaring:</p>
<p>sequence&lt;&gt; myseq;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Which would be equivalent to:</p>
<p>sequence&lt;char,10&gt; myseq;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br />
Templates and multiple-file projects From the point of view of the compiler, templates are not normal functions or classes. They are compiled on demand, meaning that the code of a template function is not compiled until an instantiation with specific template arguments is required. At that moment, when an instantiation is required, the compiler generates a function specifically for those arguments from the template. When projects grow it is usual to split the code of a program in different source code files. In these cases, the interface and implementation are generally separated. Taking a library of functions as example, the interface generally consists of declarations of the prototypes of all the functions that can be called. These are generally declared in a "header file" with a .h extension, and the implementation (the definition of these functions) is in an independent file with c++ code.</p>
<p>Because templates are compiled when required, this forces a restriction for multi-file projects: the implementation (definition) of a template class or function must be in the same file as its declaration. That means that we cannot separate the interface in a separate header file, and that we must include both interface and implementation in any file that uses the templates.</p>
<p>Since no code is generated until a template is instantiated when required, compilers are prepared to allow the inclusion more than once of the same template file with both declarations and definitions in a project without generating linkage errors.</p>

<p>Young Gunz first came out in1999 in Bermuda, they started Djing public dances and different events. CEO Drew aka Skip brought the sound out along with chris aka Shady, Chris D aka chicken, Justin aka Snake and a couple of other guys in the click.</p>
<p>As years went by so did Young Gunz, they slowly got bigger and and slowly started to accumulate dubplates (professional artist bigging up a their sound) from locals, when they got their first forgien dubplate which was Sean Paul, it been one good thing after another since that and they have never stopped.</p>
<p>From 2002 to about the end of 2003 summer they really wasn't too much with the sound. Shady went off to school and Chicken started working full time snd left Drew by him self. That when Skip asked an up and comer at the time David aka Big D to join the sound. When he joined he soon linked up with a sound called Stalwart and been workin with them ever since. Both sounds teamed up and started playing every tuesday night on Bermynet (Bermuda's number one entertainment website and party organiser) and booking cruises at least once a month. Things were just getting started for the sound, when Henery aka Porta-G joined the family. they became stronger and were now getting forgien dubplates every week.</p>
<p>Young Gunz have been in a few sound clashes (Dj's busting out their dubplates in a music battle) and have done pretty good, and thats when summer 2004 came around and they were in the biggest sound clash of the summer. YoungGunz-Vs.-Rapid Fya-Vs.-Supatone. They finished second however the experience made them better. By then Scotty aka Round Head and Keegan aka Keebla had joined the sound thins were comming together even better now.</p>
<p>They are one of the few young sounds on Bermuda who are still going strong, they entertain the people by playing nice vibes all night and play what the people want to hear. They also play old songs if thats what the people want to hear.</p>

<p>messiah is a line of powerful animation &amp; rendering products specifically designed to handle the most demanding character animation &amp; rendering needs. To meet the varied needs of studios and hobbyists, messiah is available in three forms, messiah:animate, messiah:studio Workstation, and messiah:studio Pro.</p>
<p>messiah:animate includes: animation &amp; rigging, host connections and plug-in API</p>
<p>messiah:studio workstation includes: animation &amp; rigging, rendering &amp; shading (1 node), host connections and plug-in API</p>
<p>messiah:studio professional includes: animation &amp; rigging, rendering &amp; shading (unlimited nodes), host connections, plug-in API and messiah:develop a visual plug-in development module (coming soon in a free update to for messiah:studio pro).</p>
<p>Overview.</p>
<p>All three versions of messiah include the full version of messiah:animate. messiah:animate is our core animation package whose award-winning technologies have been developed by, and in conjunction with, some of the industry's top companies and artists. It is a user-driven production-centered product that has become indispensable for everything from films and commercials, to music videos and games.</p>
<p>messiah:animate/studio can be used as a stand-alone animation package or as a powerful addition to Maya, 3D Studio MAX, LightWave and Cinema 4D. One of messiah's many unique capabilities includes the ability to set up an animation and, through messiah's host connections, run that animation and use it in any of the host programs messiah can connect to. Maya users love messiah's powerful and easy rigging capabilities, such as the ability to setup custom control rigs with Armature, without having to write MEL scripts. Another favorite is messiah's "smart bones", that work the way you want immediately, without requiring weight maps (though weighting systems can be used too).</p>

<p>Moyross is the largest housing estate in Limerick and is situated on the north side of the city. Built between 1973 and 1987, it is located near Thomond Park and the Limerick Institute of Technology. There are more than 1,200 houses in the estate. About 5,500 people live in the various estates that make up Moyross. Moyross is divided into different areas. These include Cosgrave Park. Daglish Park, Pineview Gardens,Delmege Park, Castle Park, Sarsfield Gardens, Craeval Park, Cliona Park, College Avenue and Glenagross. The Limerick estate has a notorious reputation for crime and violence. Recent years have seen serious crimes in Limerick being linked with feuds between criminal gangs within certain areas of the city, mainly Moyross, Southill and St. Mary's Park. Anti-social behaviour has escalated hugely in the second half of 2006, culminating with an horiffic petrol bomb attack in which two children suffered extensive burns after their mother's car was set alight.</p>

<p>Solid Gold Chartbusters is a British recording duo best known for "I Wanna 1-2-1 With You," a novelty-pop record which sampled a cellphone ring. Though BBC Radio 1 refused to play the song, it nonetheless climbed into the top 20 in December of 1999.

<p>Where do you get the info from that it was a top 20 hit?</p>
<p>I don't think <a href="../../../k/l/f/WP%7EKLF_cbf2.html" title="WP:KLF">WP:KLF</a> (<i>me</i> pretty much) has any interest in stubbing this out at the moment. It was a hugely insignificant attempt by Cauty to have a big hit record. It didn't work. Of course we know about the song and it has a few links, but we'll get to it when we get to it (if ever). If anyone else wants to create a stub feel free.</p>
<p>Note: "a British recording duo best known for "I Wanna 1-2-1 With You,"" is blatantly incorrect. They're known <b>only</b> for that one song, and most people would never have heard of them. If the article is created it should be called I Wanna 1-2-1 With You and be about the song, since they were one hit wonders and Cauty and Pratt already have articles. --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 15:28, <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_29.html" title="September 29">29 September</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> (UTC)</p>

<p>Ben Franklin Academy of Dekalb County, Georgia was founded in 1987 by former educators and educational researchers Dr. Wood Smethurst and Dr. Martha Bruner Burdette. Their background included significant work at Emory University researching children and adults in various group and individual settings. Their vast experience also encompassed such accomplishments as co-founding Atlanta area private schools, serving as chairman for multiple educational boards, and teaching experience spanning all ages of students in both public and private environments. With great knowledge of the educational system, Smethurst and Burdette saw a need for improvement in many aspects of schooling, especially individual attention and education. In November of 1997, Ben Franklin Academy was incorporated to meet the need for a non-profit mainstream school that offered quality individualized instruction in a caring, informally progressive setting, specifically devoted to students who wanted to succeed. The following June of 1988, the school officialy open its doors to the first class of twelve students. Since then, Ben Franklin Academy has increased its enrollment to 120 students and has had an admissions waiting list for the past five years. Since its founding, BFA has graduated over 600 students. The school was accredited as a Special Purpose School by SACS (Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) in 1994 and was reaccredited in 1999.</p>

<p>The Ben Franklin Academy is perhaps Atlanta's most unique school in terms of its operational process and direct teaching methods. Nearly all instruction is one-on-one, with each students cirriculum individualized to fit their specific needs. BFA requires that students participate in a work-study program, calling for the completion of 150 work hours per semester. To accomodate for the mandatory work schedule a typical school-day lasts only 3 and 1/2 hours. However, with extremely low student-to-teacher ratios the objective is to eliminate the bureaucracy and subsequent wasted time in convental schools with large class sizes, presumably leading to more time spent learning. Other noteworthy operations at the school are two fully stocked kitchens in which students may prepare a meal or drink as they so desire, food and drink permissible in the classrooms, a neck-tie dress code allowing hats to be worn, no hall passes or having to ask to use the restroom, and a fifteen minute break in which the students are invited to have a snack or with parental permission, smoke a cigarette in a designated smoking area.</p>

<p>Though limited by small enrollment and limited facilities, BFA has maintained a small but enthusiastic athletics program. The BFA 'Blazers' compete against other local private schools in basketball, baseball, and golf. Notably, Michael Fiore son of PGA tour participant Ed Fiore led the 2004 golf team to the Dekalb cities championship.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-09-29_1e73.html" title="Edit section: St. Andy's RFC (Rugby Football Club)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">St. Andy's RFC (Rugby Football Club)</span></h2>
<p>St. Andy's RFC (Rugby Football Club) is a Christian men's rugby team centered in Moscow, ID. They play rugby with other men's teams in the area, including many college teams. They are an independently governed team, and members of the Pacific Northwest Rugby Football Union(PNRFU). They were founded in the fall of 2004 by some college students. In their second season, they ratified a constitution and elected officers, establishing their system of government.</p>
<p>St. Andy's does not require a man to be a professing Christian to be a member of or play for the team, but they do require each player to sign a Player's Contract which obligates him to conduct himself in a way befitting a Christian. Players will be held accountable to their player contract.</p>
<p>They are committed to playing a style of rugby that glorifies our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore we are dedicated to an intelligent, hard-hitting style of play. In this, they seek to minister to their church, Moscow and the entire northwest rugby community. They expect an attitude of respect and humility both on and off the field.</p>
<p>Their goal is to be the best men's rugby team in the country. The church is in a position to gain significant influence over the sport of rugby because of its newness on the American sports scene. They seek to reform rugby culture into something the church can be proud of and glory in. To learn more about what they think about rugby and other things, take a look at their newsletters.</p>
<p>In the past they were entirely funded by the generous donations of individual sponsors. Building on their base of individual supporters, they are now seeking corporate sponsorship. For more information about how to support St. Andy's RFC financially, visit their sponsorship information page.</p>

<p>Combat Hapkido, or Chon-Tu Kwan, is a new martial art pioneered by Grandmaster Pelligrino. He started the martial art as a method of refining Hapkido into a real street self-defense style. The methods are borrowed from the traditional version of Hapkido and other tactics such as police defense tactics, use of weapons, most notably the don bang (short stick) and long stick, because of this, there is no sport aspect of the style and it is mainly used as a stictly self-defense style.</p>
<p>Combat Hapkido is also based on a scientific approach by focusing on areas of the body where the maxium defense against an on coming attack can be re-directed or stopped. The approach utilizes joint locks, major locks (legs, arms), throws, takedowns and weapons defense.</p>

<p>Leroy Hutson is an African American instrumentalist, composer, arranger, producer and multi-talented performer</p>
<p>He never achieved a level of success that his talent deserved.</p>
<p>Leroy first formed a vocal group in his native New Jersey, but emerged as a soul music talent while attending Howard University in 1970.</p>
<p>There with his room-mate Donny Hathaway, he collaborated on 'The Ghetto', a hit for Donny in early 1970.</p>
<p>Born on 4 June 1945, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.A., Leroy and Donny also sang in the Mayfield Singers, who released one single for Curtis Mayfield in 1967.</p>
<p>Later he teamed up with Deborah Rollins to form Sugar And Spice, recording several singles with some success.</p>
<p>In 1971, Hutson replaced Mayfield in the Impressions and recorded two albums with the group.</p>
<p>Leroy began his solo career on Curtom in 1973 and through 1992 established himself with a successful recording career, recording eight albums and charting with some 13 singles in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>On most of his work, he wrote, produced, arranged and played multiple instruments.</p>
<p>His most successful charting singles were 'All Because Of You' (1975), 'Feel The Spirit' (1976), 'I Do, I Do' (1976), 'Where Did Love Go' (1978), and 'Right Or Wrong' (1979).</p>
<p>When Curtom went out of business in 1980, Leroy's career was essentially on hold and he soon disappeared from the music world, re-appearing briefly for 'Paradise' in 1982.</p>
<p>He later worked for the UK based Expansion Label releasing the 'Shades Of Love' EP.</p>

<p>A unique design for the Early Bronze Age IV oil lamp appeared around 2300 BCE and disapperaed 300 short years later. What influenced the design and its quick demise? A major climate change in this region contributed to a shift from urbanism to a semi-nomadic lifestyle and with it, adaptations of an everyday utensil - the oil lamp.</p>

(originally scalawag) a white Southerner acting in support of the reconstruction after the American Civil War often for private gain. The term, of unknown origin, was used in the 1840s to denote a worthless farm animal and later a wrothless person. Scalawags included former Whigs and hill-country farmers with Unionist sympathies and constituted nearly 20% of the white electorate after the Civil War. Many held government positions in the South and advocated moderate reforms. The term was used also to refer to people who supported freedmen and Republican Party policies. See also carpetbagger</p>

<p>By Yoon</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>During the early 60s, two friends, one from Barcelona (Arnau) and one from Madrid (Campos) bought a plastics manufacturing company that was bordering on bankruptcy: Madel (Manufacturas Delgado=Delgado Manufacturing). Arnau is the son of the founder of Exin Bros, one of the largest toy makers company in Spain. The same company that made Scalextric slot cars , Exin castillos, Cine Exin and others.</p>
<p>In the begining, Madel manufactured all types of plastic products, not just toys. In 1966/67 they start developing a six-inch ‘poseable doll’. The idea being that it was the perfect scale to fit in a child’s pocket. Their dolls had unique joints based on human articulation . It would have probably been a great hit worldwide if it had been developed by a US company, and not by a small company from Spain…</p>
<p>The first contact with retailers was not successful at all. They felt like boys wouldn't play with dolls. Hasbro heard the same thing while trying to promote GI Joe. Despite the initial cool reception from retailers the product actually ended up selling quite well.</p>
<p>The first madelman figures were released during Xmas 68, in a small display box that was later changed to the standard box in 1971. The early madelman figures didn't have feet but rather pegs onto which the boots were fitted. Also, they had what collectors call ‘crystal eyes’, which were handpainted!</p>
<p>About 75/76, they developed the second madelman figure, which had jointed feet and painted eyes. A female figure was also added to the line. A third body type was released during the last years of Madelman in 82/84. Instead of being a new body, it was just a combination of previously released figures: torso, arms and chest from the male body and the legs of the female body.</p>
<p>Madelman figures were eventually manufactured in Mexico, by Exinmex. The molds made by Exinmex were the same as those made in Spain, but there were remarkable differences in the quality of both the costumes and accessories. Exinmex also released some figures that were different from the Madel Spain line.</p>
<p>The only problem with the figures were that they were too fragile, their hard fingers and knee and elbow joints were easily broken. Still, I don’t think that there are any other action figures from the 60s or 70s figures that are so poseable. Madel stopped making madelman figures in 1984. They eventually closed down all of their toy lines the same year.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Madelman has become so collectible not only in Spain, but in another countries from Europe and even the USA, is the quality of its accessories. You see, Madelman rarely painted their accessories. If something was made in two different colors, such as rifle, they would construct it with 2 seperate pieces, a wooden-like piece and an iron-like piece. Awesome considering the scale!</p>
<p>The Madel vehicles line is also awesome, a jeep that looks like a smaller GI Joe Five Star jeep (identical in every aspect but the scale), a helicopter, horses, caravan wagon, etc…</p>
<p>The variety of figures was quite impressive including Astronauts, Pirates, Cowboys, Military Figures, Super Heroes and even Eskimos!</p>
<p>Today, an increasing number of collectors have discovered the quality and variety that the unique madelman line offers.</p>

<p>Writing in the first century A.D., this Syrian writer supplies one of the earliest non-Jewish, non-Christian references to Jesus. His letter has been dated to sometime after 73 A.D., some 40 years after the crucifixion of Jesus. Writing to encourage his son to pursue wisdom, he uses examples of Socrates, Pythagorus and a "wise King" who was executed by the Jews. The British Museum preserves the text of this letter which gives early evidence of a historical Jewish King fitting the description of Jesus.</p>

The Legends of BhaiDooj</p>
<p><br />
BHAI DOOJ</p>
<p>The legends form the backbone of Indian festivals, and are a great medium for Hindus especially parents to inculcate interest in the younger generation and to impart values of Indian festivals to them. Unique and interesting legends are associated with the festival of Bhaidooj.

<p><br />
The Legend Of Yamaraj and Yamuna</p>
<p>In the Vedas Yama is god of the dead, with whom the spirits of the departed dwell. He was the son of Vivasvat, the Sun and had a twin-sister named Yami or Yamuna. Yami, Yama’s twin sister, was transformed into the sacred river Yamuna in whose purifying waters people bathe on holy days. Yama was given an equally important role and made the god of Death, whom all fear. On Bhai Dooj day, Yami or Yamaraja was called to his sister’s home Yamuna, where she offered Aarti and a small gift for her brother.</p>
<p>Yama then told her that on this day brothers would be invited to their sisters’ home and in return the brother would bring a gift for his sister. Until today this tradition is maintained with great love. As Yama's sister is Yamuna and she fed Yama to his satisfaction he said that from now on any brother who visits the sister on Bhai Dhuj day will escape the hand of Yamaraj -the sister prays for her brother.</p>
<p><br />
The Legend Of Lord Vishnu</p>
<p>When Lord Vamandev was pleased with Bali maharaj and appeared in Vishnu-rupa, Bali asked a boon that Lord Vishnu would be on every door at Patalaloka.

In order to make her husband return back to his original place, Laxmi plays trick on Bali.</p>

When Bali accepted that he will now onwards be her brother and told her to ask anything that she needs. Bali asked Laxmi what he can give her, Laxmi replied that you have my everything in your service - please release Lord Vishnu. Thus, Lord Vishnu was released from the service of Bali.</p>
<p><br />
The Legend Of Lord Krishna</p>
<p>According to one legend, on the day of Bhai Dooj, Lord Krishna, after slaying the Narakasura demon, goes to his sister Subhadra. She welcomes her brother with the lamp, flowers and sweets, and puts the holy protective spot on her brother's forehead.</p>
<p><br />
The Legend Of Lord Mahavir</p>
<p>Yet another story behind the origin of Bhai Dooj says that when Mahavir, the founder of Jainism, attained nirvana, his brother King Nandivardhan was distressed because he missed him and was comforted by his sister Sudarshana. Since then, women have been revered during Bhai Dooj.</p>

<p><i><b>Matrjoschka</b></i> is made and produced by the german artist Karin Hoerler 2006. With 95 hours (5700 minutes) playtime this is actually the longest film by time. The world premiere was at the light spectacle Luminale 2006 in Frankfurt-Germany. Matrjoschka was public shown on a outdoor 100sqm LED-screen at the DrKW-building. Starting on 23 april 6:00am it ends on <a href="../../../a/p/r/April_28.html" title="April 28">28 April</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> at 1:00am. During the night there was a break from 1:00 to 6:00am.</p>
<p>This film is available only in .wmv format (Video for Windows Media Player) on DVD. The changes, movements in scenes are ultra slow and not directly visible. Matrjoschka pushes the viewer to the limits of its perceptive faculty. It is impossible to watch the film in its entirety, as it is impossible to watch a flower blossom out. It is only realized that the bud became a bloom. The images and sequences are based on a single photo. The film shows a boy riding a bicycle, a street, houses, garages, sky. Through manifold artist work on every frame however it manifests a very complex visual structure, which reveals piece by piece the inherent notation of things, making their abstract pattern visible. While trying to decode these Cryptographics the viewer will realize that the sense or nonsense of the messages are left to his discretion. At the end of the film the apparent realistic image of the beginning has resolved into a colour- and formcomposition.</p>

<p>Chauhadry Muhammad Ali (July 15 1905- December 2,1980). He was born in Jalandar and completed his studies at the Punjab University. He was married to Razia Ghauri, with whom he had five children, respectively named Javed,Khalid,Shahid,Ali and Tahira.He was an extremely hard working man who also wrote the constitution if Pakistan and worked by Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's side at all times.</p>
<p>On October 24, 1954, Malik Ghulam Muhammad dissolved the Constituent Assembly of Muhammad Ali Bogra on the grounds that it had "lost the confidence of the people", and declared a state of emergency in the country. Muhammad Ali Bogra, however, remained as the Prime Minister, since he was again invited to form a cabinet known as the Ministry of Talents. On August 8, 1955, he was dismissed by the acting Governor General, Major General Iskander Mirza in the absence of Malik Ghulam Muhammad, who had gone on a temporary leave and was also subsequently forced to resign due to his ill health. Chaudhry Muhammad Ali was appointed as the new Prime Minister on August 11, 1955.</p>
<p>Chaudhry Muhammad Ali's greatest achievement was framing the Constitution of 1956 and its approval by the Constituent Assembly. The entire country with great joy and enthusiasm celebrated the promulgation of this Constitution on March 23, 1956. The 1956 Constitution was Islamic and democratic in character, acceptable to people of all parts of the country, and had the blessings of almost all schools of thought.</p>
<p>Chaudhry Muhammad Ali, however, could not come up to the bargaining and the deals necessary to reconcile the various interest groups into accepting the One Unit and the adoption of the Constitution. He proved to be a poor politician who failed to control his own party. This ultimately led to his downfall. His greatest blunder was the selection of Dr. Khan Sahib as Chief Minister of the Unified Province of West Pakistan, despite the opposition of the Muslim League. Dr. Khan Sahib was an old Congressman who had opposed the creation of Pakistan, therefore the Muslim League opposed his appointment. Dr. Khan Sahib, however, enjoyed the support of the President Iskander Mirza. He dropped Muslim League members from his cabinet, and by bringing the dissident Muslim Leaguers and other supporters, formed his own party, the Republican Party.</p>
<p>In the Central Government, the Muslim League shared power as a major component of the coalition without being in office in any province. The Republican Party kept growing in number and claimed to be the single largest party in the National Assembly. Prime Minister Chaudhry Muhammad Ali was urged by the Muslim League to act against the West Pakistan Ministry. Chaudhry Muhammad Ali believed that as a Prime Minister, his actions should be governed by the good of the country and not by the resolution of any party. He believed that he was responsible only to the Cabinet and the Parliament. Thus, he refused the demands of the Muslim League. Disgusted with the scenario, Chaudhry Muhammad Ali resigned as a Prime Minister on September 8, 1956, also resigning from his membership of the Muslim League at the same time. His decision to resign of his own accord is considered as a unique example of political decorum in the history of Pakistan.</p>

<p>Since his early childhood in Frankfurt, LPs and singles were his favorite toys. His family's interest in music has played a great role on the growth of his love for music. In 1985, the family decided to move to Istanbul where his career as a DJ was going to begin.</p>
<p>His professional music career started, when he became a DJ on one of the famous radio stations in Turkey. Right after showing up in the music scene as a radio DJ, he started to perform at the biggest clubs in Istanbul. Running fast in his music career, he had to give a short break to complete his military service between April-November 1997.</p>
<p>Upon his return to Istanbul, he took scene at Turkey's one and only dance station 'Radio 2019' as a DJ and production manager while he was performing at different clubs in Istanbul. In 1998, he became the resident of the most famous club in Istanbul for two years. His reputation in Turkey was spreading and the number of people appreciating his sound increasing with every event. The big break came in 2002 with the DJ of the Year award. DJ Tarkan was sponsored to play his eclectic house (deep, vocal, jazzy, funky, disco, techy) and deep, dark &amp; dirty tribal progressive sets, which he sharply forms depending on the time, the venue and the crowd, all around the country. His unique mixing style cemented his fan-base around the country, where he is frequently invited to play gigs in different cities.</p>
<p><br />
His creativity and talent was appreciated by the crowds and he was named number one DJ of the year in Turkey again in 2003 and 2004. Now he is at the rank 160 in The World's Largest DJ Directory. &gt;</p>
<p><br />
The momentum continued with bookings from different countries as diverse as Argentina, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Egypt, Georgia, Hungary, Kosovo, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkish Republic of North Cyprus and the US. Based on this success, Tarkan decided to spend more time on productions, releasing tracks based on years of musical experience. His productions and remixes were included in the tracklists and charts of the world's well known dj's like Tiesto, Sasha, Hernan Cattaneo, Nick Warren, Deep Dish, Sander Kleinenberg, Anthony Pappa, Dave Seaman, Danny Howells, Steve Lawler, Seb Fontaine, Lee Burridge, Markus Schulz and many more.</p>
<p>While doing collaborative productions, Tarkan became close friends with V-SAG from Greece. Both went on tours together and the Turkish-Greek friendship resulted in the No Smoking Recordings label, which is intended to only release the highest standard of deep, tribal and progressive house music. DJ Tarkan and V-SAG have initiated a campaign for the understanding of the music "as is", giving people the opportunity to discover the true meaning of music in its purest form instead of "chemically enhanced fun".</p>

<p>Zheleznodorozhniy (the word in Russian means "Railway") is a suburb of Moscow 10 kilometres east of the city centre, (though it is classified as a city in its own right) in the Moskovskaya Oblast (Moscow Region). As the name implies, it lies on a railway line - the line from Moscow (Kursk Station) to Vladimir, and the station lies at the heart of the town. Indeed, the railwayline is the main form of transport to and from the town - the road network to the area leaves much to be desired and is the subject of some controversy. The population is approximately 100,000. The city was established in 1952 from three worker's settlements: Obiralovka, Kuchino, and Savvino, and two villages: villages Temnikovo and Sergeevka. In 1904 the Aerodynamic Institution was founded in Kuchino - the first in Europe and the second in the world. Scientific work was headed by Professor N. E. Zhukovskiy of Moscow University - one of the founders of modern aerodynamics. The Aerodynamic Institute rise to the development of the settlement Kuchino as a centre of geophysical science, and made the city known to the scientific community in Russia and abroad. The building industry is currently the leading industry in modern Zheleznodorozhniy. Zheleznodorozhniy serves as a commuter town for workers in Moscow, and like most such communities, the most noticeable features of it are numerous blocks of high-rise apartments.</p>

<p>In the movie <a href="../../../e/x/c/Excalibur.html" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a> the actress Katrine Boorman (who played Igraine) is the real life daughter of the movie's director John Boorman. She appeared nude during the love scene when Uther Pendragon appeared to her disguised as her husband.</p>

Stomping his way into films and photo shoots, clearly he won the hearts of millions. This piece of Hardbody Muscle has worked with some of the best in the biz, (Bobby Blake, Carlo Cox, Max Stone, and the list could go on). Just when we thought this stud could not get any better, he takes the world by storm with his new look. “Last year I got back into doing videos again with the new look after a couple of years of laying off from that part of the business,” Carter said. “But all the while I had still been doing photo shoots and was dancing at different clubs around Chicago.” Carter can be seen in three new videos: Hard Sex (Raging Stallion), Fantasies of Black &amp; White, Part II (Thor Productions) and Black, White and Hotter (Gray Rose Productions). And he has several others in the works including what he says will be a “mind-blowing oral video” that was shot in San Francisco.</p>

<p>Toyon Bay is located on Catalina Island off the Coast of California. Originally inhabited by a group of natives called either Pipi Mari or Pimugnans depending on your point of veiw. It was sight of a boarding school for boys in the early 1900’s. During World War II the boys were evacuated and the Facility was turned into an OSS training camp. Patriots from China and American men were trained in guerilla war fare to be used behind Japanese lines in China. The OSS is the precursor to the CIA. After the war it saw time as a Boarding School, Singing Camp and an abandoned husk.</p>
<p>Eventually in 1978 it was purchase by Guided Discoveries, Inc. and has been a Marine Science Camp for students from all over the country. While attending this camp students of all ages learn to snorkel, learn Marine Biology and Island Ecology.</p>

<p>Blacklist is a band from New York that formed in 2003 and consists of group members Josh Strawn (vocals, guitar), Ryan Rayhill (bass), Glenn Maryansky (drums) and James Minor (guitar). The band's sound draws from post-punk, <a href="../../../c/o/l/Coldwave.html" title="Coldwave">coldwave</a>, and rock influences.</p>
<p>Blacklist's sound has been called atmospheric and anthemic, drawing comparisons to the darker side of British independent music from the 1980s such as the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comsat_Angels_d9b5.html" title="The Comsat Angels">The Comsat Angels</a>, <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Chameleons_2f10.html" title="The Chameleons">The Chameleons</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sound_96bf.html" title="The Sound">The Sound</a>. They also cite European coldwave (particularly French bands Asylum Party, Babel 17, and Little Nemo) as a primary source of inspiration as well.</p>

<p>The band formed in the summer of 2003 at a house party in Mahattan when Rayhill and Strawn discovered their mutual affinities for <a href="../../../i/r/o/Iron_Maiden_6b08.html" title="Iron Maiden">Iron Maiden</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sisters_Of_Mercy_3221.html" title="The Sisters Of Mercy">The Sisters Of Mercy</a>. Recruiting Charles Lunden on drums, the three began to forge a dark and dingy rock sound reminisicent of <a href="../../../r/e/d/Red_Lorry_Yellow_Lorry_c0b2.html" title="Red Lorry Yellow Lorry">Red Lorry Yellow Lorry</a> and <a href="../../../m/o/t/Mot%C3%B6rhead.html" title="Motörhead">Motörhead</a>. Adding Alex Chow (who had previously played with Rayhill in Red Red) on bass, Blacklist had its first sessions as a four piece. That lineup would not last for long. Only a few months later, Lunden left for art school in Italy and Chow departed to devote his energy to another band. Pared back down to a two-piece, Ryan and Josh set out to regroup and met Glenn Maryansky. Maryansky, after surviving the implosion of indie synth outfit Antarctica, had been sporadically working on an offshoot electronic project, ova looven. Eager to return to live drums, Glenn signed on and the three soon wrote <i>Dawn of the Idols</i>. With it's brazen bombast and unapologetically secularist lyrics (nodding to <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Bacon_d51b.html" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, <a href="../../../f/r/i/Friedrich_Nietzsche_159c.html" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and <a href="../../../s/%C3%B8/r/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard_528b.html" title="Søren Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a>), <i>Idols</i> would set the pace for the future of Blacklist, both in tone and content. During those sessions, they also wrote <i>Language of the Living Dead</i>, an ode to alienation and Slovenian philosopher <a href="../../../s/l/a/Slavoj_Zizek_5d7f.html" title="Slavoj Zizek">Slavoj Zizek</a>.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2005, with three songs nearly complete, the band entered the studio with producer Steve DePalo. Using the studio to realize arrangment possibilities that would have been logistically impossible without a fourth member, Blacklist translated their vision into a proper recording. With a three track demo completed, the band was invited to play their first show on July 30, 2005, appearing as a featured act at artist and DJ <a href="http://www.elizabethdeegallery.com/artists/schoolwerth/schoolwerth01.html" class="external text" title="http://www.elizabethdeegallery.com/artists/schoolwerth/schoolwerth01.html" rel="nofollow">Pieter Schoolwerth</a>'s semi-regular Weird Live Music Showcase.</p>
<p>The band needed a second guitar player to replicate the new recordings in a live setting. Maryansky persuaded ova looven cohort James Minor, a one-time member of both Compund Red and National Skyline, to take the job. Minor's aural texturing would later become a mainstay of the band's sound, creating a counterpoint to Strawn's more agressive style. Solidified as a four piece once again, the band's sound coalesced into a brand of dark rock music that some have described as the missing link between <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Comsat_Angels_d9b5.html" title="The Comsat Angels">The Comsat Angels</a>, <a href="../../../s/u/e/Suede_%28band%29.html" title="Suede (band)">Suede (band)</a>, and <a href="../../../g/u/n/Guns_%27n%27_Roses_707f.html" title="Guns 'n' Roses">Guns 'n' Roses</a>.</p>
<p>After playing shows with indie notables I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness and The Bellmer Dolls, Blacklist recorded a demo in May of 2006 with <a href="../../../j/a/m/James_Iha_9d82.html" title="James Iha">James Iha</a>. They followed up the recording sessions with a slot supporting the seminal industrial/psychedelic outfit <a href="../../../p/s/y/Psychic_TV_afa7.html" title="Psychic TV">Psychic TV</a> during their residency at Galapagos in Brooklyn and a music video for Language of the Living Dead, which was directed by independent filmmaker <a href="../../../e/v/a/Eva_Aridjis_8ad2.html" title="Eva Aridjis">Eva Aridjis</a>. In the Fall of 2006, two of the band's early singles appeared on the first release from Schoolwerth's label, Weird Records. Blackist is currently completing the writing process for a new LP, tentatively entitled <i>Nom de Guerre</i>.</p>

<p>Despite their dramatic, shadowy aesthetic, Blacklist owes more to the politically charged new wave rock of predecessors like <a href="../../../u/2/_/U2.html" title="U2">U2</a>, <a href="../../../m/i/d/Midnight_Oil_304c.html" title="Midnight Oil">Midnight Oil</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Sisters_of_Mercy_d069.html" title="The Sisters of Mercy">The Sisters of Mercy</a> than to angst and theatrics. Many have also drawn comparisons to the agitrock of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Manic_Street_Preachers_85b7.html" title="The Manic Street Preachers">The Manic Street Preachers</a>. Politically speaking however, they are difficult to pigeonhole. Strawn describes Blacklist lyrics as hostile to fundamentalism and authoritarianism, no matter what country, ideology or religion those things manifest from.</p>
<p>Strawn, the band's sole lyricist, describes himself as liberal, democratic and internationalist. He has been particularly outspoken regarding the post 9/11 political climate, offering criticism of George W. Bush, Islamism, and anti-war elements in both the U.S. and Britain.</p>
<p>Strawn's weblog, <a href="http://www.newhymns.blogspot.com" class="external text" title="http://www.newhymns.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">End Credits And New Hymns</a>, deals with themes of <a href="../../../h/u/m/Humanism.html" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, <a href="../../../s/e/c/Secularism.html" title="Secularism">secularism</a>, the progressive left, and the <a href="../../../i/s/l/Islamic_Reformation_8737.html" title="Islamic Reformation">Islamic Reformation</a>. As such, it bears much in common with a recent strand of British intellectual and political culture that would include the controversial <a href="../../../e/u/s/Euston_Manifesto_5962.html" title="Euston Manifesto">Euston Manifesto</a> and the radio show Little Atoms. Each is a proponent of Enlightenment values and a political left that takes <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Orwell_0bc4.html" title="George Orwell">George Orwell</a> and <a href="../../../t/h/o/Thomas_Paine_c9d3.html" title="Thomas Paine">Thomas Paine</a> as figureheads.</p>
<p>Blacklist can also claim <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carl_Sagan_68dc.html" title="Carl Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> as an influence, as Strawn has said that reading Sagan's pro-science manifesto <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Demon-Haunted_World_0ee8.html" title="The Demon-Haunted World">The Demon-Haunted World</a> was not only as politically impactful as his first encounters with the writing of <a href="../../../n/o/a/Noam_Chomsky_7341.html" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> or <a href="../../../k/a/r/Karl_Marx_3bcc.html" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, but that the themes of that book animate the spirit of the band.</p>

<p>GeRm is a multi-national clan playing in the Clanbase Ladders. GeRm has had members from the UK, NL, BE, South Africa, Israel, Germany, France and most recently our CS:S Manager from Spain.</p>
<p>A brief history:</p>
<p>In the beginning there was BFI - Brute Force and Ignorance. BFI married TWAT (Total war against Tossers) and begat GUI.</p>
<p>GUI played UT 99 and evolved into GeRm - Global Elite Rampage Masters back in early 2003 and switched to start playing UT2003.</p>
<p>After competing in the Clanbase Ut2003 ladder and playing in cup competitions GeRm had their first major success coming 4th in the Fall 2003 iCTF Cup. This led to promotion to the first division the following season and resulted in some of the hardest matches we have ever played in.</p>
<p>GeRm reached the heady heights of 18th in the ladder after a solid 11 match winning streakculminating in beating FnC and GoC in the same week. At this point the 2003 scene started to die as 2004 came out.</p>
<p>At the release of Ut2004 GeRm left the 2003 ladders behind and switched over to play UT2004 again competing in the Clanbase ladders and also taking part in the inaugral UCL league - www.ucl.eu.com retaining their position in a hotly contested 3rd division. So far we have been up to 18th in the ladderand made it to play offs of the iCTF cups but no further.</p>
<p>An Onslaught squad started but didnt finish due to lack of support within the clan.</p>
<p>GeRm took the silver position in the Div 3 iTDM Spring cup in 2005 after losing in the final to APOTA.</p>
<p>GeRm started a CS:Source squad and are currently playing in the clanbase Europe and UK ladders. The squad was looking to growin size to allow us to compete several times a week and has welcomed new members from outside the UT2004 community. However a lack of commitment to the game has meant it is now only played for fun after wars or in the odd cup competition.</p>
<p>Following the Fall 2005 iCTF 2k4 Cup *GeRm* has now left the UT2004 ladders and has finished the 3v3 Hosted iCTF Cup and has now switched over to COD2 full time. GeRm is playing in the Clanbase S&amp;D, TDM and CTF ladders and is looking to join other UK based competitive ladders and leagues. Their star player is L!kuL_B3aR, who regularly tops the team in S&amp;D and TDM wars.</p>

<p>Darren Barr (born 17 March, 1985) is a versatile member of the Falkirk squad. Having plied his trade in the reserve team - outings for the first team were rare for Barr - for a number of seasons, playing in numerous positions across the defence and midfield, manager John Hughes decided to loan Barr out to Scottish Second Division side Forfar Athletic in August 2005, where he remained until the turn of the year.</p>
<p>After this, Barr returned to The Falkirk Stadium where he returned to reserve football for the rest of the season. Since the start of season 2006-07 however, Barr has settled into a role in the centre of defence and has been a regular fixture in the Bairns' team.</p>
<p>Barr managed to notch his forst goal for Falkirk on <a href="../../../a/u/g/August_5.html" title="August 5">5 August</a> <a href="../../../2/0/0/2006.html" title="2006">2006</a> with the winning (and only) goal against heated rivals Dunfermline Athletic.</p>
<p>Noted for having a mature on-field attitude for someone with so few games under his belt, a bright future in the game is predicted by many for Barr.</p>

<p>Charlie Katebi kicks ass. Charlie is fucking awesome.</p>
<p>Combat Correspondent In the beginning Shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, with the lack of news coming out of the Marines' heroic stand on Wake Island, the Marine Corps recognized the need to have more news and photography emanating from the combat zones, and more assistance to civilian news media in getting into these combat areas and reporting the actions to the American people.</p>
<p>Brigadier General Robert L. Denig (named earlier) to organize and head up the Corps' first Department of Public Relations (DPR), supported by First Sergeant Walter J. "Joe" Shipman, set about establishing a special recruiting program that was to cause great consternation in Washington, DC, media circles.</p>
<p>First Sergeant Shipman promptly donned his dress blue uniform and went looking for the pros where they worked — at Washington newspapers. His pitch: "You'll get combat duty and Sergeant stripes if you can successfully complete boot training at Parris Island." He had plenty of takers with his guarantee of combat. So successful were Shipman's recruiting efforts in Washington, in fact, that he practically denuded every city room in the capitol. The Times-Herald, as it happened, was hardest hit, causing its vociferous publisher, Cissy Patterson, to complain directly to President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The president, in turn, passed the complaint to Major General Commandant Thomas Holcomb, who soon directed General Denig to do his future CC recruiting outside DC.</p>
<p>Although recruiting was already well underway, it was not until June 6, 1942, that an Associated Press story first reported: "Lieutenant General Thomas A. Holcomb, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, announced today that newspaper reporters of not less than five years experience are being accepted for enlistment as combat correspondents. After six weeks training as fighting troops, they will be given the rank of Sergeant and sent overseas with combat units. General Holcomb said the Marine Corps is sacrificing none of its high standards, and combat correspondents must meet all physical requirements for regular Marines."</p>
<p>Newspaper photographers were initially recruited for the program together with reporters and were similarly designated CCs, primarily because they very often wrote their own captions and stories to accompany their photographs. DPR conceived having reporter-photographer teams in the field with combat units, but not until the end of the war did this concept work out. The combat correspondent program was so successful in World War II that the concept remains today — exclusive with the U.S. Marine Corps — and CCs continue to "tell it like it is" wherever Marines see action.</p>
<p>More than 40 CCs lost their lives in combat in WWII and subsequent actions.</p>

<p><a href="../../../s/p/o/Spoiler.html" title="Spoiler">Spoiler</a></p>
<p>The book takes a mostly light hearted look at what might happen when two vastly opposing worlds and ways of life come into contact with each other.</p>
<p>Following a chance meeting with a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist_monk.html" title="Buddhist monk">Buddhist monk</a> in a <a href="../../../g/l/a/Glasgow.html" title="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> sandwich bar one lunchtime, painter and decorator Jimmy McKenna starts to develop an interest in <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhism.html" title="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> and begins to visit a <a href="../../../m/e/d/Meditation.html" title="Meditation">meditation</a> centre. The story is essentially about Jimmy's new found faith, and the reaction of his immediate family to this.</p>
<p>It is told from three points of view - those of Jimmy, his wife Liz, and their daughter Anne Marie - and follows the family as Jimmy's desire to lead a better and more meaningful life begins to have an effect on them all. To begin with, this proves to be to their detriment as Liz and Anne Marie cannot understand why Jimmy - who has previously been an <a href="../../../a/t/h/Atheist.html" title="Atheist">atheist</a> - would suddenly want to become a <a href="../../../b/u/d/Buddhist.html" title="Buddhist">Buddhist</a>. However, as the story unfolds, a series of events allow everyone to gain some insight into the choices Jimmy has made.</p>

<p>Born in Anchorage Alaska on February 5, 1988, this babe quickly became the idol of the region. Besides having a delicious smile, a seductive gaze, and an all around awe inspiring personality, she graduated Service High School among the top 3% of her Senior class; she graduated Summa Cum Laude and headed off to the University of Notre Dame, a highly selective Catholic College.</p>
<p><br />
LIFE AT NOTRE DAME</p>
<p>Emily pretty much owned Notre Dame. She joined the men's football team and became the captain in 6 months of tackling, and was in fact the first EVER hot woman to play in varsity college football. She quadruple majored in Pre-med, Chemistry, Engineering, and Native Studies, and earned a perfect 4.0. Upon graduating, she went back to Alaska and became a doctor.</p>
<p>Oh And got married.</p>
<p>LIFE IN ALASKA</p>
<p>She frolicked in Anchorage at the Anchorage Native Hospital for 6 years, during which she was repaying the community for the money it granted her for college tuition.</p>
<p>She married James Robert Irving, an eminent bum, on her birthday, February 5, 2011. She almost proposed to him because it was a leap year, but he got the jump first. She had 45 children (her mother, father, two brothers, and best friend Tee also joined) made her own society called "The Fabulous Fifty."</p>
<p>THE FABULOUS FIFTY</p>
<p>They slowly took over the world.</p>

<p>Forest of Shadows is a text forum game from Veneficus Zero and xTRIGGER092x. It originally started on the Paranormal Group on Bungie.net, then went to the official Bungie.net Flood forum, and then went to the TAPS forums. Forest of Shadows is about a dark forest, and you go to investigate it. You encounter many creatures on the investigation, and near the end of the game, it becomes a struggle to survive. The game ends based on how it begins. One day after the ending of Forest of Shadows:The Paranormal Group, xTRIGGER092x had announced he would create the official sequel exclusively for the Paranormal group. Thus, Forest of Shadows 2:The 4 Factions began. Very recently, FoS 2 ended, and the 3rd installment of the FoS series began. But this time, under the name FoS:Episode 1. In this game, the Forest of Shadows catastrophe ends. This sequel is a shorter game, hence the name "Episode 1." But, the FoS series doesn't end there. The FoS Episodes are part of a 3-game trilogy. The stories of Episode 2 and 3 have been confirmed, but have not been released to anybody. Currently, the only people who know are xTRIGGER092x and Veneficus Zero. During FoS 2, xTRIGGER092x had announced that an FoS video game could be created, and he would be trying his best to make it happen. If the game is created, it is scheduled to be released in 2007 or 2008. It will be on Windows PC's and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Ed Magedson is owner and operator of a controversial web site called RipOffReport.com. Mr. Magedson proclaims himself to be a consumer advocate. The basic premise behind his web site is that people who are cheated or otherwise 'ripped off' on services such as eBay (and other online stores and trading venues) can tell their story about the person who slighted them. His policy is to keep that complaint up regardless of any reconciliation or resolution between the two parties.</p>
<p>A number of people have complained about Mr. Magedson's tactics, alleging that he and his attorney work together to extort funds from the people and companies detailed in his 'rip off reports'. One of the most prominent of his detractors is a man named Steve Miller, who operates a site, Bad-Business-Rip-Off.com, designed to be a source of rebuttal against the accounts detailed on RipOffReport.com. Several other sites take either side of the controversy, with some claiming that Mr. Magedson does good for consumers and others alleging that he violates a number of laws including libel, trademark and copyright.</p>
<p>Several charges have been issued against Ed Magedson and he is currently a fugitive from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on charges or corruption and extortion.</p>

<p>The James space is an example of a Banach space with many unusual properties whose first construction led to counterexamples for several important conjectures in Banach space geometry. Helga Fetter found a new kind of spaces, in many ways generalising James spaces, with other interesting properties. These spaces, now known as Fetter-Gamboa p-spaces, have found wide acceptance as important counterexamples in the theory of Banach space geometry.</p>
<p>She has also conducted important research regarding Opial conditions, clarifying several long-held confusions in the area. For instance, in the paper <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=777931.777934" class="external text" title="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=777931.777934" rel="nofollow">Locally uniform Opial conditions</a> insight is given about small subtilities regarding even the definition of the concept.</p>
<p>Also insightful have been her contributions to the theory of r-UNC spaces, where her research has focused in fixed point results.</p>

"The Lesson", or "Le Leçon", is a short, one-act play by French-Hungarian playwright, Eugène Ionesco. This play is one of his most notable works, as well as one of the most notable works in the history of the "Theatre of the Absurd" genre, of which Ionesco was a pioneer.</p>
<p>The play takes place in the office/dining room of a small flat somewhere in France. The Professor, and elderly man of about 50 to 60, is expecting a new Pupil (aged 18). The third character is the Maid, a stout, red-faced woman of about 40 to 50, who is always worrying about the Professor's "health". As the lesson progresses, the Professor grows more and more angry with the Pupil's ignorance, and the Pupil becomes more and more quiet and meek. At the climax of the play, the Pupil is murdered by the Professor, after a long bout of non-sequiturs (which are frequently used in Ionesco's plays). The play ends as a new pupil is greeted by the Maid, a grim-looking smile spread across her pudgy face.</p>

<p>Otometry,literally, measuring the ear, is a field of study designed to measure the dynamic range of human hearing, primarily for the purpose of prescribing hearing aids.Developed by physicist John A. Victoreen,Ll.d, it relates the range of a defective ear to that of a normal ear in terms of sound pressure to improve audibility and speech understanding by means of a hearing aid, a sound pressure generator.It specifies the use of a damped wavetrain test signal and the decibel SPL, where 0dB has the equivalent pressure of .ooo2 dyne/cm squared</p>
