<p>This is obviously a POV-fork. This seems to be the lamentable stale-mate found in many of articles about so called <i>sects</i>: The main articles <a href="../../../l/o/r/Lord%27s_recovery.html" title="Lord's recovery">Lord's recovery</a>, <a href="../../../w/i/t/Witness_Lee_89d5.html" title="Witness Lee">Witness Lee</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recovery_Version_of_the_Bible_62c0.html" title="Recovery Version of the Bible">Recovery Version of the Bible</a> are in gloomy colors, not even mentioning the critical POV. The POV-fork is only critcism, and needs better sourcing. NPOV policy strongly discourages separate <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i> articles.</p>

<li><b>Merge</b> into article <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_churches.html" title="Local churches">local churches</a>, article contains quite some information which can be verified (and some is referenced already). Alternatively keep and add a summary in the Local churches article, per <a href="../../../p/o/v/Wikipedia%7EPOV_fork_3de8.html#Articles_and_subarticles" title="Wikipedia:POV fork">Wikipedia:POV fork#Articles and subarticles</a> There is also the point that this article contains quite some edit history since April 2004, which should not be deleted. Of course, the content should be cleaned up thoroughly regarding NPOV and sourcing, but that's IMO no reason for deletion.</li>
</ul>
<p>WHY IS THIS PAGE NOT DELETED YET? Why is a page in such dispute allowed to exist. The idea of linking an offensive page with opinions masquerading as facts ... this list of controversial opinions (unproven, unsubstantiated, not referenced, and not verifiable), it would seem that some have a sheer glee in paralysis through analysis, they want this debate to drag on as long as they can hang their dirty laundry out each day to dry! Well I for one think integrity is not up for debate and think that this so-called debate is a strategy to let cheap shots masquerade as fact. It seems this page violates the basic tenant of posting in wikopedia, in that most of the controversy are opinions and not verifiable or certainly not unobjective view point. (RS)</p>
<p>I think that the controversy article is worth keeping as a subset of the main article, the Lord's Recovery, as there is information included in it that is not found in the main article. It might get pretty cumbersome to try to integrate it into the main article so keeping it separate is useful. However, there may be a few places where a NPOV approach is needed to clean it up, although I thought most sections did aim for a NPOV.</p>

<p>For my two cents, please note that the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> article has had a <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLocalChurch_341d.html" title="User:TheLocalChurch">long history</a> of being blanked, vandalized, and contested in attempts to - in the words of sysop <a href="../../../d/j/_/User%7EDJ_Clayworth_c4dc.html" title="User:DJ Clayworth">DJ Clayworth</a> - canonize the movement. The forked article, <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_controversy_1cee.html" title="Local Church controversy">Local Church controversy</a>, was originally created by ongoing efforts to present the article on the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> in the most positive possible light while only grudgingly admitting that concerns existed by people outside the movement - the same sorts of concerns that have arisen with articles on <a href="../../../s/c/i/Scientology.html" title="Scientology">Scientology</a> or the <a href="../../../j/e/h/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses_173f.html" title="Jehovah's Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> for instance.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that this fork was created under false pretenses and against the spirit of Wikipedia, and didn't want to put too much effort into editing a page that I had hoped would simply be deleted. If this article is to be deleted, I wouldn't mind taking the effort to clean up the mess in the controversy article so that it can be folded into another article that meets the standards desired by the Wikipedia community.</p>
<p>I propose that the existing article be significantly revised and folded back into the article on the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Local_Church_3cc6.html" title="Local Church">Local_Church</a> as a section of the article. I also propose that this discussion be posted in the <a href="../../../l/o/c/Talk%7ELocal_Church_a602.html" title="Talk:Local Church">Talk:Local_Church</a> article, with a notice that this section was intentionally folded back into the original article and should remain there rather than being forked again into a new article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheLocalChurch_341d.html" title="User:TheLocalChurch">TheLocalChurch</a> 21:26, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As asked by Pjakobi, here some critical sources on the local church which I consider as reliable (though, of course, not neutral) - not complete, I'm in vacation away from my library. --<a href="../../../i/r/m/User%7EIrmgard_961d.html" title="User:Irmgard">Irmgard</a> 22:58, 9 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>merge</b> Let us try it. I know that articles dealing with cults and controversial sects and new religious movements are problematic on Wikipedia, because they tend to degenerate into ugly and unencyclopedic battles between well-informed critics (mainly former members) and well-informed adherents, see e.g. <a href="../../../p/r/e/Prem_Rawat_054e.html" title="Prem Rawat">Prem Rawat</a> and <a href="../../../s/a/t/Sathya_Sai_Baba_611f.html" title="Sathya Sai Baba">Sathya Sai Baba</a>. I do not know what to do about it. (I am myself an active critic in these two articles.) <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndries_db72.html" title="User:Andries">Andries</a> 23:20, 13 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
