<li><b>Keep</b> Perhaps you should be more flexible and await for the opinion of a puertorican. It is evident that you haven't heard about them because they don't live in the U.S. Keep in mind that they live in a relatively small island, so its plausible that they are well known there, but, due to the lack of funds, they have been unable to travel around the world.

Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the US and feels strongly about their music. This is a band with not enough funds to tour US and many few are capable of doing so.</li>

<p>COMMENT: How did so many people come across this article?</p>
<p>REPLY: Recently we puertoricans have come across this news, as more and more people realize that a known band is being deleted from this page more puertoricans will stand up</p>
<dl>
<dd>(A more rationale reply) Something I enjoy about Wikipedia is the idea of consensus. It's not like a vote <i>per se</i>. If I see on AfD that more than three people voted to delete and no one has voted to keep - I don't need to poke my nose in. Only when there is a disagreement will I look at the article and then weigh in on the debate. Here we have what appears to be a debate - but in reality it's deletes and sockpuppets. More people will enter the fray if they believe the voting is being skewed by puppets. Ifnord 23:27, 9 November 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"KEEP" I know all members of this band personally. They are rising stars and have the contacts to be big. There album do to come out in the next months will be extremly succesful down here in P.R. I know this because they are extremly passionate about there music. They are also racking up the gigs at battle of the bands they also play at most school or student organized activities and everybody loves them.</p>

<p>"KEEP" I am resident of Puerto Rico and i know this band personally and i think theyre great. They should not be deleted because they are unknow in teh U.S.for they have a great deal of followers here in P.R.</p>

<p>KEEP- they show a good sense of music and talent. They should be given the recognition they deserve. It is not easy to have a band like that at that age, I think that you should keep the article to it serves as an example to other musicians that wish to be in a band. This serves as an example to young kids and adults to never give up your dreams, just stick with them and you will acomplishe in life what yu want.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Enough already with the sock voting. You've made your point. However, Wikipedia is not the place to promote 'up and coming' talent.
