<li><b>Keep</b> Have any of you deletists ever even rode on the Viva system? Compared to conventional transit, it is a bus rapid transit line and deserves to be given the status of a rapid transit line! I agree fully that this is the biggest effort in the Greater Toronto Area since the subway, and they already have plans for a Transitway so just keep it as is. How do I know? I commute on viva to school saving precious time (going up 60 kms) and I live within 10 minutes walking distance to a vivastation. <a href="../../../p/h/i/User%7EPhil-hong_fac9.html" title="User:Phil-hong">Phil-hong</a> 03:43, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> It's a stub, put this info under Viva'a page. Other pages regarding vivastations should be deleted. It can come back later when it is a major hub connecting some form of fixed heavy/light rail transit services. Even though it's a BRT, it's still a fairly light bus service when compared to other transit systems around the world. Just be patient! Just take a few photographs and dump it in the wikicommons. <a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosNider_e31b.html" title="User:AmosNider">User:AmosNider</a> 2005 Oct 27

<li>Do you really think that will happen anytime soon? Isn’t it true that even in the 416 area they are talking about BRT?—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 08:15, 27 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Honestly, I don't think it will ever happen. Someone please take some photographs and let the photos speak for themselves. Don't need to waste a dedicated article on it. Put some captions under the photographs in a gallery and I think that would be enough. --<a href="../../../a/m/o/User%7EAmosNider_e31b.html" title="User:AmosNider">AmosNider</a> 07:11, 28 October 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>, <s>Comment</s>: Please give this some <i>time</i>. Viva was launched like just last month and the main Viva article is marked for cleanup for a "higher standard". You can't expect people to have much incentive cleaning up the main article if they see their sub-articles getting deleted even though the subject in question has been marketed as the biggest transit improvement in York Region in who-know-how-many-years. Also, you can't compare this to Singapore: This is Canada; we spent almost 10 years building just 4 subway stations, and the municipalities don't have a lot of money. (This is, at least in te marketing, the York Region equivalent to the Toronto subway. You have to treat these bus terminals like subway stations.) IMHO Promenade (vivaYork) has been wrongfully deleted for the same reasons (at least at this point of time).—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Wing</a> 03:15, 24 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>PS: To put this in perspective, please read the <a href="../../../l/a/c/LACMTA_Blue_Line_19ae.html" title="LACMTA Blue Line">LACMTA_Blue_Line</a> article. Many so-called “stations” on this light rail line are even smaller than “partialy covered platform<b>s</b>” (many have just one covered platform the size of a streetcar stop) and have no ticket vending machines, yet they are in Wikipedia. When I was in LA and rode the blue line the first time I was completely taken aback by their <i>smallness</i>. Please be rational in your votes.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 13:26, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Those are also unexpandable substubs, and should probably also be deleted. Just because a mistake has been made once does not mean it needs to be repeated. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 13:32, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Do you live in LA? Are you <i>sure</i> they are indeed unexpandable substubs? Promenade (vivaYork), which has been deleted and is the rationale for this article's deletion, is found to be a <i>large</i> terminal. Whoever nominated that article's deletion, and all who voted delete, apparently didn't even bother to check facts from even the external links.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 16:03, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Unless the building is a <i>particularly</i> large building, I don't see what the size has to do with anything. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:12, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This shows that you are not a Canadian. The growth of YRT and GO was featured in a TV program, and an official of GO was interviewed. When asked <i>why</i> GO stations do not belong to large, mixed transit-commercial-residential buildings, the official replied, "[paraphrase] because Canada has so much land, developers are not interested in cooperating with transit authorities to develop large complexes along with the stations". Unless a miracle happens, you will not find many "large buildings" in the 905 area, even if it's a major transit hub.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 16:22, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I spend about 1/3 of my time in Canada, pending my permanent residenence paperwork, although it wouldn't be unfair to say that Saskatoon and Toronto are only in the same country as a matter of technicality.&#160;;D<br />
But enough about ad hominem appeals. I feel this isn't an encyclopedic subject unto itself primarily because it is, in my estimation, an unexpandable stub, with no current information beyond where it is and the fact that it is indeed a bus terminal. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:39, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Please define "unexpandable stub", if you have not re-read the article lately. Also, if you were referring to Promenade, it indeed is one of those few miracles, as Promenade is a major mall in the area.—16:44, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernard_%28vivaYork%29&amp;diff=26538385&amp;oldid=26286088" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bernard_%28vivaYork%29&amp;diff=26538385&amp;oldid=26286088" rel="nofollow">your changes</a>, you've made the location very specific, and added the context that would be implicit if this were a mention in the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva_Blue_33d4.html" title="Viva Blue">Viva Blue</a> article. You've also added a paragraph about the fact that, for now, it is the end of the Viva Blue line, also quite appropriate to the <a href="../../../v/i/v/Viva_Blue_33d4.html" title="Viva Blue">Viva Blue</a> article. Seems like you've expanded it into an excellent merge candidate, and I am amending my vote accordingly.<br />
Is there any other possible expansion for this article as a subject unto itself? Was it <i>particularly</i> hard to get land for this specific location (moreso than the other Viva Blue or Viva York locations)? <small>Has it been the home of a cult of Marduk?</small> Is there some other claim of individuality, to make it not an interchangable member of a whole set (to wit, the Viva Blue terminals)? - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 16:59, 26 October 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As I do not live in the 905 area (I live in Toronto proper), I don't know. I could actually take the Viva to the terminal and see if there's anything else obvious, or maybe write a letter to YRT and ask for some info, but as a non-local this is probably the best I can do. And because of the timing of the AfD, the article will probably get deleted before I can find out anything.—<a href="../../../g/n/i/User%7EGniw_55a9.html" title="User:Gniw">Gniw (Wing)</a> 17:06, 26 October 2005 (UTC)

<li>Well, if it were merged, it'd be trivial to unmerge if you were able to uncover something. ¬_¬ If this gets deleted and you come up with a claim of individuality/notability, it'll be a slam-dunk undelete at <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_review_5db6.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion review">Wikipedia:Deletion review</a>. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><font color="#000000">Black</font></span></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 17:14, 26 October 2005 (UTC)</li>
