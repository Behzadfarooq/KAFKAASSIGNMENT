<li><b>Delete 2.0</b>. Another "hyped" brand-new website with little to no traffic. I don't care how many or how few sources it has, if I go to a social network or forum website and see <i>28</i> active users on their forums, it is clearly not notable enough for an encyclopedia.

<li>The main problem that I see is that this site is <i>not notable</i>, no matter how much media coverage it got. Wikipedia is not a mirror of AP/Reuters/etc- every story and subject that gets media coverage is not inherently notable (this is where <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> really fails in my opinion). Is the subject worthy of the coverage it received? No, it's not. The sources that covered it are extremely questionable in this case. They all merely re-worded or expanded upon information in the press releases. Like most gaming news websites, they pick up any crap story they can get. --- <a href="../../../r/o/c/User%7ERockMFR_f871.html" title="User:RockMFR">RockMFR</a> 18:21, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Per Tarinth. I looked at the references and read through the referenced articles. For the most part they appear to be independent of the subject and the discussions are non-trivial. I think that there is some confusion in MaxSem's premise, since the company was renamed recently. I think that evaluators are confusing the word "notable" with "prominent."

<li><b>Keep</b>, I'm the original author of the article, although it has been crufted out quite a bit since I wrote it. Still, the reason I wrote it is that it is a video game development company founded by a notable person, <a href="../../../j/o/n/Jon_Radoff_67ae.html" title="Jon Radoff">Jon Radoff</a>, who wrote one of the first MMORPGs, and because I found reliable sources to write the article. For example, <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10977" class="external text" title="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=10977" rel="nofollow">Gamasutra</a>, the most respectable online video game publication.

Note that this company is not just a social networking service, they are also developing video games themselves. <a href="http://www.gamers.com/index.php?run=news&amp;news_id=6753" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.gamers.com/index.php?run=news&amp;news_id=6753" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> <small><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">JACO</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">PLANE</font></a> â€¢ 2007-01-2 19:24</small>

<dd>Like stated, when I wrote the article I was not even aware there was going to be a website related with the company. I wrote an arcicle about a video game development company started by a notable person. The fact that they also have a website would not warrant an article on its own, and if that was all that is there to this company I would certainly agree that WP:WEB would apply, but it's not the case. <small><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">JACO</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">PLANE</font></a> â€¢ 2007-01-3 02:44</small>
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately we're discussing the article as it is now, not how you intended it when it created. The article focuses solely on the website with a trivial mention of its past and creator. That is what the discussion has to be based on unless you have an alternate version of the article to put forth which meets notability and verifiability guidelines.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 07:33, 3 January 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Cleaning them up and how they are listed is not the issue. Its what they are. No matter how they're listed, displayed or organized, it doesn't change the fact that they don't qualify as multiple non-trivial mentions.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 04:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I never claimed that it would make a difference. Since this AfD is mainly about the sources I just cleaned them up, nothing more, nothing less. We clearly disagree about the viability of these sources, but I just wanted to say I've cleaned them up and will be improving the article over the coming days. <small><a href="../../../j/a/c/User%7EJacoplane_198a.html" title="User:Jacoplane"><font color="#AE1C28">JACO</font></a><a href="../../../j/a/c/User_talk%7EJacoplane_6d73.html" title="User talk:Jacoplane"><font color="#21468B">PLANE</font></a> â€¢ 2007-01-4 04:57</small>
<dl>
<dd>The AfD is mainly about the notability, and the lack of sources which speak to that. Its not about the way the sources are displayed on the page. While reprints of the press release are reliable, they do not establish notability per <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>.

I agree that the article will be better once more information on that product becomes available.

<dd>And do you have something to back that up? You've basically made my point for me. This isn't something Gamedaily covers, so just because one of their staff have used their professional blog to write about it doesn't lend any credibility to it. The reason blogs can't be used as a reliable source for information is the lack of editorial oversight and the fact that its a self-published source. Do we have any evidence that Gamedaily approves what they can write in their blogs and edits them? If not, the blog is not only useless to gauge notability its useless as a reliable source.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 03:46, 5 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>The notability guidelines specifically address reprints of the press release. It makes no exception for how many or who reprints the press release. The only possibly exception I might see (which still isn't addressed by the guidelines) in that was if a major print magazine actually devoted valuable unpaid space to reprinting the press release and commenting on it/expanding on it. Otherwise it costs a website next to nothing to tack up their press release.

The guideline clearly states that kind of coverage is not acceptable to indicate a site is notable, regardless of how picky you claim the site is.

I see nothing there that would evidence that their letting any particular blog posting stand is an endorsement of that blog posting. WP:RS requires an assertion of editorial oversight not a conclusion drawn by an editor. WP:RS also states that any self-published material not covered by other sources is much less reliable.

This page documents an editorial staff. The top of every page includes an American Online an logo. Further, I'm unable to find any disclaimer that states that "blog" content does not reflect the opinions of the editorial staff. Even if this editorial information was only linked from the main page of the GameDaily site, I would argue that it is unreasonable to ask that every sub-section of a site contain a separate assertion of editorial authority. It's clear that the staff and writers of any part of the site are subject to management by an editorial staff, and ultimately answerable to the corporate oversite of America Online. A similar structure is common in many websites in general, and the gaming media in particular. <a href="../../../t/a/r/User%7ETarinth_29ad.html" title="User:Tarinth">Tarinth</a> 21:56, 6 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think we can all agree a blog is a self-published source. For it not to be a self-published source it needs to include an assertion of editorial oversight. The burden of evidence is on the person wanting the information included, not those wanting it removed. While every page doesn't need any assertion of editorial oversight (like a general story like other stories that write has done and I linked to) any section would could be seen as self-published do. As it is we don't know HOW they run the blog section of their website, so it makes the source suspect. Since we have no other source out there to bolster its credibility that makes it even more suspect. If we had a few other good sources that clearly demonstrated notability, it would lend credibility to the blog entry, and you could be more lax on requiring a mention of editorial oversight. Which is kind of the way that works. There is more than one way you can lend credibility to a blog to be used as a source, but it needs something. Even with something, its still only a single mention at best. Reviewing WP:WEB and the Next-gen article its clearly addressed by WP:WEB as being trivial. It only describes the content and the rest of it is a reprint of the press release.--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 23:02, 6 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Let me pose a hypothetical to you then. If a prosecutor calls a witness who states "I saw the defendant commit the crime". Then you would argue that the witness's testimony shouldn't be admitted until the prosecution can somehow prove the witness isnt' moved by mercenary motives or isn't some sort of pathological liar? From this matter stands presently it would appear to me that it is an internet publication of AOL (certainly well-known and independant of GuildCafe) and the website's contents has editors (thereby editorial insight), and accordingly it is reliable, and would fall under <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> #3.

<dd>No. In this case we have a source which is normally not allowed at all, a blog. Regardless of where its hosted. These are typically only allowed as sources in a very limited capacity in sourcing something about the writer, i.e. the author of that article warranted an article on wikipedia and announced he had cancer in it, that could be used as a source for that. In order for it to be used as a source for anything else it has to meet one of the criteria in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> which give it credibility, so far it only meets things which take away from credibility, namely the fact that no other site has deemed the subject notable enough for any in depth coverage. One can easily assume that in a publication the stories which are "printed" as stories have editors. If you want to draw the conclusion that that means all blog postings have editors and get their content approved, you can do that, but you need something to back it up. As I pointed out above, it wouldn't be unreasonable for them to say "Post what you want so long as its not anything that is going to get the company in trouble".--<a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrossmr_f6a3.html" title="User:Crossmr">Crossmr</a> 15:17, 7 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I guess since you don't want to look at his blog as having editorial insight (which is your guess, and something we still dont' know for sure yet) then Under <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> we have <b>"When a well-known, professional researcher writing within his or her field of expertise, or a well-known professional journalist, has produced self-published material, these may be acceptable as sources, so long as his or her work has been previously published by credible, third-party publications..."</b>. The author of that blog is a well-known net journalist covering gaming information (he's not interviewing presidents, but he's ceratainly a professional in his field). Accordingly since the author of the article is an established online journalist, even his blog can be said to be a reliable source. JN322 02:38, 8 January 2007 (UTC)
