Besides the fact I <i>hate</i> their misuse of the word <a href="../../../a/n/h/Anhydrous.html" title="Anhydrous">anhydrous</a>, I have concerns about the cluster of these three articles. <a href="../../../v/i/t/VitaCraft_Japan_ff27.html" title="VitaCraft Japan">VitaCraft Japan</a> is being justified by its association through <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamoru_Imura_58f6.html" title="Mamoru Imura">Mamoru Imura</a> to <a href="../../../v/i/t/VitaCraft_3078.html" title="VitaCraft">VitaCraft</a>, US company, which may or may not (?) make/sell <a href="../../../r/f/i/RFIQin_fb2b.html" title="RFIQin">RFIQin</a>, which is simply a 'better' (asserted) means for <a href="../../../i/n/d/Induction_cooker.html" title="Induction cooker">Induction cooking</a>. So the justifications are by their connections, with the most notable 'thing' being simply an enhancement (now with <a href="../../../r/f/i/RFID_4b20.html" title="RFID">RFID</a>!) of an established technology. But if these articles go away, then should <a href="../../../m/a/m/Mamoru_Imura_58f6.html" title="Mamoru Imura">Mamoru Imura</a> stay? I think they should be considered as a group.

<li><b>Do not Delete</b> When this article was tagged, it might not have had the <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html#Primary_criterion" title="WP:ORG">primary criterion</a>; however, on March 8th I fixed that. In my opinion, the following sources qualify as primary criterion, <a href="http://www.solidbizopps.com/articles/MLM_28385.html" class="external text" title="http://www.solidbizopps.com/articles/MLM_28385.html" rel="nofollow">SolidBizopps</a> &amp; <a href="http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22" class="external text" title="http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22" rel="nofollow">無水調理が出来る鍋, vita craftとは</a>. <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">User:Ocatecir</a> wrote this article reads like an advertisement; I would like to know what part of the article reads like an advertisement, so if the article does not get deleted, I can fix it.</li>

<li>Note, <a href="../../../r/f/i/RFIQin_fb2b.html" title="RFIQin">RFIQin</a> was the first article I created and I did not read all the wikipedia guides to writing an article, so when I wrote it, it sounded like an advertisement; <a href="../../../p/i/l/User%7EPilotguy_59e8.html" title="User:Pilotguy">User:Pilotguy</a> deleted RFIQin and then I re-wrote the article, Pilotguy approved it, and it was posted back up on wikipedia. RFIQin has more than enough sources that classify, in my opinion, as primary criterion and, in my opinion, is not written as an advertisement. RFIQin is made by <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Craft_Corporation_dd43.html" title="Vita Craft Corporation">Vita Craft</a>, however it is only sold in Japan under <a href="../../../v/i/t/Vita_Craft_Japan_b746.html" title="Vita Craft Japan">Vita Craft Japan</a> because there is an ongoing court case over distributing rights in the United States. When I was in Japan, I saw it featured (not as an advertisement) on two nation-wide television shows, in a magazine, and it is displayed at most major department stores; it is somewhat well known in Japan, but because it is not sold in the United States, it has only recieved a little press coverage in the United States.-<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherMannMcKay_9fd0.html" title="User:ChristopherMannMcKay">ChristopherMannMcKay</a> 15:57, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

I do not understand why you posted comments that are the opposite of this. Do you feel that the two companies that I referenced are trivial and somehow connected to Vita Craft?

<dd><b>Comment</b> While I am aware Wikipedia is not a directory of information, it <i>is</i> an encyclopedia that references companies that are notable, which according to Wikipedia guidelines, this company is. According to <a href="../../../o/r/g/WP%7EORG_1e12.html#Primary_criterion" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG#Primary criterion</a>, “The secondary sources in the criterion include reliable published works in all forms.. ..except for the following: Carrying merely trivial coverage; such as (for examples) newspaper articles that simply report meeting times or extended shopping hours, or the publications of telephone numbers, addresses, and directions in business directories.” The two sources (<a href="http://www.solidbizopps.com/articles/MLM_28385" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.solidbizopps.com/articles/MLM_28385" rel="nofollow">[3]</a><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den" class="external autonumber" title="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dsafari%26rls%3Den" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>) carry MUCH MORE than “directory-like information,” as <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> claims. Furthermore, according to Wikipedia Guidelines, these two sources are not <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html#Using_questionable_or_self-published_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">questionable sources</a> because the sources do not "express views that are widely acknowledged as fringe or extremist, are promotional in nature, or rely heavily on rumors and personal opinions" I hope this clarifies things. -<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherMannMcKay_9fd0.html" title="User:ChristopherMannMcKay">ChristopherMannMcKay</a> 03:53, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>I am still not convinced this company is notable. Both sources <i>are</i> promotional in nature and do not contain independent analysis of the company, both read like advertisements. Solidbiz seems to be trying to sell the reader on the business opportunity that is Vitacraft. Upon examination of the main website, the stated aim of Solidbizopps.com is to provide "everything you need to succeed while starting a new business."+ The fact that few articles on the company exist from any publication and the promotional nature of the provided sources (one of which is in Japanese) tell the tale of a company that is not notable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>+ Examples of advertising-like language from the Solidbizopps source:
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><i>"Vita Craft has grown through years of commitment and excellence."</i></li>
<li><i>"They would like to help you find the opportunity that allows you the flexibility and freedom you want and most importantly, the opportunity that suits your personality."</i></li>
<li><i>"the customers build lavish look"</i></li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>These are not the words of an independent source. <span style="font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; border:none; font-size:10pt; padding:2px; line-height:10pt; width:30em;">—<a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir"><font color="#660099">O</font><font color="#333333">cat</font><font color="#660099">ecir</font></a> <sup><a href="../../../o/c/a/User_talk%7EOcatecir_844e.html" title="User talk:Ocatecir"><font color="#333399">Talk</font></a></sup></span> 04:10, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Yes your right, the Solidbiz source is horrible, I will remove it.

The company's products are popular in Japan, over 90% of sales if I remember correctly; some of the products arn't even sold in the United States, so that is why there arn't many Enlgish sources.-<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherMannMcKay_9fd0.html" title="User:ChristopherMannMcKay">ChristopherMannMcKay</a> 04:48, 11 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Neither I or most other English-Wikipedia editors are going to be able to judge that until a better translation of the article is given. Right now the only remaining source is in Japanese and the google translation gives the same type of ad-words the other sources did. Because the only source is in a foreign language we have no idea if the article 1) proves notability 2) is written by an indpendent organization 3) if that organization is reliable and has a reputation for fact-checking.

<li><b>Comment</b> The following was translated from <a href="http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22" class="external text" title="http://ryouri.akekure.com/item/44/catid/22" rel="nofollow">http://ryouri.akekure.com/</a>. Ryouri.akekure.com is completely independent from Vita Craft. The web site is not an online store, but is a review site for cooking related products, written by a staff of writers; it is not a Blog. This web site is not an advertisement for Vita Craft, even though parts of this article might sounds like an advertisement, it is because that is the way the Japanese language is structured.</li>

<dd>Vita Craft, made in the United States, is a healthy cookware company that was created from as a result of research and development of two specialists from Seattle University and University of Wisconsin. The pans keep the natural taste of food and cook food in a healthy way.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Vita Craft is made on the basis of preventative medicine, “The health of the family should not be protected by taking medicine, but rather by using waterless, non oil, low temperature, and low pressure home cooking.” (Seems to be a quote from a Vita Craft spokesperson)</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>In other words, food can become medicine, but it can also be damaging. The type of cookware pots you use determines if you cook healthy food or damaging food.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Features of Vita Craft</dd>
<dd>-Has thermal efficiency, so the pans require less energy.</dd>
<dd>-Extensive 5-ply layer system.</dd>
<dd>-Can be used in multiple power sources, including Induction Heating of 200 volts.</dd>
<dd>-Can use cookware pans without excessive oil and can cook some items without oil.</dd>
<dd>-Can cook cakes without burning them like oven cooking often does.</dd>
<dd>-When you turn off the heat, the pans can still use heat stored inside the pans to cooke the food.</dd>
<dd>-Easy to take care of.</dd>
<dd>It has a long-term warranty of 10 years.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The most important feature of the cookware is the nutritional value that does not get destroyed because of waterless cooking. The lid to the cookware pans is designed with a vapor seal that makes it difficult for heat and moisture to escape. As a result, “waterless cooking” is possible to cook items like vegetables by using the water inside the vegetables. The loss of vitamins easily dissolves in water, likewise with waterless cooking, the loss of vitamins is held down to a minimum.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>When cooking items like meat, you need less salt because the taste of the food is natural and because excessive oil is not used.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>If you have not heard about Vita Craft pans until now, you might desire to buy the cookware.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You must get the price of Vita Craft from the official web site. While the cost may be high, the daily cost of energy will decrease, which will decrease costs in the long run.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Ranking of popular pots:</dd>
<dd>Gives ranking from 1 to 10 on the popularity of Vita Craft pans. (don’t think this needs to be translated).</dd>

<li><b>Do not delete</b> I agree with Christopher on this. I have provided the translated source in English, so hopefully this problem can get resolved.

<dl>
<dd>That 100 persons does not include any sales persons, mostly office admin and factory personal. In the U.S., Vita Craft pans are sold by individuals (not employed by the company) that recieve commission for every item they sell. Vita Craft's factory is fairly large, they produce many products that are sold in most every department store in Japan; Vita Craft is also paid to manufacturer pans for Health Craft—a company based in Flordia. -<a href="../../../c/h/r/User%7EChristopherMannMcKay_9fd0.html" title="User:ChristopherMannMcKay">ChristopherMannMcKay</a> 03:41, 12 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - Aagtbdfoua, I generally agree with you. However, COI is about editors who have a conflict; the subject itself, if notable, should not be "punished" because the editors have a conflict of interest. That being said, I often support deletion in close cases with a COI aspect. In my opinion, this is now a decent article, having been cleared of most of the advertising (though the reference to the vision of high quality cookware should probably go), and has just enough referencing to justify inclusion.--<span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:11pt"><a href="../../../k/u/b/User%7EKubigula_04dc.html" title="User:Kubigula">Kubigula</a> <i>(<a href="../../../k/u/b/User_talk%7EKubigula_3bdb.html" title="User talk:Kubigula">talk</a>)</i></span> 04:14, 13 March 2007 (UTC)
