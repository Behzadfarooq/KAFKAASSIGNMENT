<li><b>Delete</b> - article repeatedly asserts notability, but has no sources to back that up. It claims he was interviewed in a magazine, but does not cite it. The first reference is a 404 Error, for a non-existent site, and the second doesn't mention him at all. Article violates <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> and <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>. It also appears to be full of mistruths - the first 'rave' was in 1999? According to <a href="../../../r/a/v/Rave.html" title="Rave">rave</a> and my personal recollection of the 1990's, there were definitely raves before 1999. It also claims Snopes has an article about this, but it, well, doesn't. In fact, for a "famous" person, he has only something like 1400 GHits, none of which are reliable sources. Definitely shouldn't be included. --<a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaemo_8e11.html" title="User:Haemo">Haemo</a> 00:59, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> A separate article could be written for a high school football stadium. However, I believe it should include a photo, infobox and statistics (attendance, sell out streak, Championship games hosted, etc.). This is a stub of what could be a good separate article. It is does not rise to the notability standards for stadia in my eyes without the proper details. As a stadium article it would be deleted. However, since it is associated with a high school it can be merged.

<li>I wasn't comparing it to roflmao specifically. I just came up with something I thought would be very common in a search to help give perspective - don't take the "roflmao" comparison literally. In fact, I'll strike through it to show you're not supposed to draw a direct comparison. I was pointing out that "double posting" is difficult to pin down sources because it is so widespread in a search.

<li>As I've said already, your argument is fallacious. That you erroneously think that a Google Web search of the article title is the only way to find sources is one root of the fallacy. Once again, look at the example of <a href="../../../l/o/l/LOL_%28Internet_slang%29_6e70.html#References" title="LOL (Internet slang)">LOL (Internet slang)#References</a>.

<dd>Yeah basically. But that doesn't mean the info doesn't belong somewhere. I don't care if it doesn't get its own article. Policies aren't set in stone anyway, btw. Additionally, the forums would essentially be primary sources in this instance, which are allowable if they are used only to verify the fact that the term exists per <a href="../../../a/_/_/WP%7EA_5364.html" title="WP:A">WP:A</a>. Which means the article is either kept as a stub or a sentence or two is thrown into the internet forum article. Wikipedia policy can be bent a bit if it helps the wiki or an article or whatever.

<li>Yes, in looking at that category, there are a number of other articles which will likely need to go.

<li>Perhaps Internet forum terminology, of course verifiability would be key. But I still think my statement about the forums as primary sources holds water, provided there were enough of them to be considered verification. And sure these things can change, but there are very few articles on Wikipedia which involve active events, people etc that are static.

<p>Found several interlinked pages that look like an advertising campaign. A Google search reveals that the company is probably notable enough for an article, but I think that this current mass of pages and images needs to be cleared out - all current sources are self-published and I don't think that this can be turned into an objective encylopedia article without complete re-write and re-sourcing from scratch - by someone without a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Weak Keep</b> for <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Watt_Park_b552.html" title="George Watt Park">George Watt Park</a> It needs sources and cleanup, but he appears notable. However, the article smells of a copyvio (I don't have time to check)</li>

<dd>They all seem notable and I'm sure sources could be found. This seems like a major company.

<p>Also, I found a ton of articles from reputable gardening publications touting flowers they've developed. I Googled a few phrases from the article, and the only hits I got were to this article, so if it's a copyvio, it's from a print source. Also, <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Selections_025f.html" title="All-America Selections">All-America Selections</a> are significant honors in the world of gardening. Add it all together, and it seems pretty notable to me.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 06:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I just noticed <a href="../../../a/l/l/All-America_Selections_025f.html" title="All-America Selections">All-America Selections</a> is listed in the bundle. The article's atrocious, but I can't imagine deleting it. Again, it's a major award. If <a href="../../../m/a/n/Man_Booker_Prize_c5b1.html" title="Man Booker Prize">Man Booker Prize</a> were a spammy copyvio, we wouldn't delete it. We'd reduce it to a stub and let someone write a more acceptable artice. That's precisely what we should do here. And yes, merge the history.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 06:41, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>'<i>keep</i> the ones about the different companies, merging more detailed ones into the main article. This i partly a matter of unfamiliar sources; WSP is not as strong in the area of gardening (or agriculture) as in most other topics, so we don't know the sources that well,. But the way to improve it is to keep articles like these, and build from there. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 00:16, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> article on George Park, Park Seeds, and All-America Selections, <b>merge</b> others per <a href="../../../m/r/2E/User%7EMr.Z-man_cef0.html" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.Z-man</a> above. Reduce to stubs if necessary, but this company has been a big part of American gardening culture for decades; we need articles on them, and someone with some gardening magazines to hand should write good articles. I would be shocked if good 3rd party sources aren't available. <a href="../../../b/r/i/User%7EBrianyoumans_57e5.html" title="User:Brianyoumans">Brianyoumans</a> 18:53, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>After studying your recommendations and reviewing policies, I have attempted to bring the Park Seed, Wayside Gardens, and All-America Selection articles into compliance by editing out non-essentials. I respectfully request the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> article on George Park, Park Seeds, Wayside Gardens,and All-America Selections. The origins of Park Seed and Wayside Gardens are quite distinct, hence my request to retain separate entries</li>
<li><b>Merge</b> All-America Selections History into All-America Selections</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Park Seed Company Gardens, or possibly merge some pieces into the Park Seed article. Thank you for your advice and consideration.Claire F. Kuhl 20:19, 9 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - while a tempting solution, this article is more about a certain sound effect that happens to have been used for Goofy than a facet of Goofy itself.

<li><b>Comment</b> The Google search you linked proves that the sound effect exists, and that a few enthusiasts have cataloged its use on their personal web sites.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The article is in need of cleanup, yes, but I consider the basis valid.

<p>Lots of original research to start with, then article tells a few "toupee" jokes. Then there is a section called <b>Suspected toupee wearers</b>! (Very encyclopedic). Another section is titled <b>Toupee or not toupee</b>. Is this article a joke? Or maybe partly a joke disguised as a Wikipedia article? I would have attempted to improve it, but it's so bad just delete it and start again. Strathlomond 02:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Speedy Keep (with substantial cleanup)</b> Upon deeper examination, I really don't think this article is that bad, by Wikipedia standards.

<li>Oh, more shame. Geeze. Anyway, I did some clean-up. I was a costume designer in a past incarnation and have studied the history of toupees and wigs extensively--most of Wikipedia's articles in this area need work and clean-up tags, if someone could tag a handful of them it would be nice (I still struggle with templates). However, I don't have my research library handy, and there is little information on the web that I found to be usable. Still it is less original and more accurate than it was.

<li><b>Comment</b> This is a big part of toupee wearing, the mid-twentieth century comedy sketches and jokes on American television about people wearing toupees, and speculation as to who rugged over their linoleum. Plus business men pretty much had to wear them and the studios has celebrities wear them even in public. But I won't go there without some research and solid references. Popular culture is under-researched, over-original, and often inaccurate on Wikipedia. I once researched American patented toupee devices, that was something. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 06:19, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> agreed... and in a website on Toupee's the jokes would be appropriate (as would the speculation) but here in an encycopedic... no.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 07:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> In the realm of people's costume and accouterments, there is quite a bit of research done and written up, including the humorous aspects of what people wore and how they wore it. The white wigs worn by aristocrats at one time were routinely mocked in satires of their era, the wide skirts of women, the butt bustles, the hoops, just like the huge pants boys wear today are the subject of comic strips and comedy routines. I love to come across political satire, especially, when researching clothing of an era, to have a little insider fun with costumes. A well-referenced discussion of the humor would be a useful insight into the popular culture of toupees. However, it's probably not doable on the web, and would require substantial research at a university library. <a href="../../../k/p/_/User%7EKP_Botany_94ec.html" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> 07:52, 4 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> agreed a well refrenced discussion of the humor would be useful and interesting... and dare I say would be necessary to make the article comprehensive. But simply adding jokes? no. An example of a joke or two, within a section discussing the sociological seeting no problem.<a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalloonman_3871.html" title="User:Balloonman">Balloonman</a> 09:00, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> Your reasoning makes no sense. The article itself has four sources that are reliable. This number of sources is about par for the course for an article if this size, if a little above average. A significant number of relevant search results on Google would also partially speak to notability. I really have no personal opinion on this matter, but it seems to me that the subject of this article is notable enough to have a reasonably-sourced article.<a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELaMenta3_3753.html" title="User:LaMenta3">LaMenta3</a> 03:53, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> While it discourages against strict counting films and google hits, it has the policy "notable and prolific"-- but can you honestly think of a better meter of notability/prolifity than her large number of films or the 500,000+ google results? How many more films would she have to do before you considered her notable?

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There are basically three arguments going on here: 1) Whether she is notable; 2) Whether articles should be deleted merely for being poorly written or attributed; and 3) Whether pornography is a valid topic for Wikipedia. It's not an argument that has been specified until now, but it's in here. I agree that Gianna Michaels should be considered for an article based on the fact that she was nominated for the "Favorite Breasts" award (even if <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> requires a victory--I think that's a bit narrow in scope; Wikipedia doesn't drop non-pornographic actors for never having won awards). I am also concerned that a comment advocates non-consideration of the "keep" votes based on the commenter's gainsaying of the voters' comments without specific damning evidence. Additionally, it is very difficult to find real journalism about pornography because most major media seem to add a porn angle to a story if said angle is particularly lurid, the better to increase sales. As a result, it would seem that the central notability criterion is a bit circular in this case. As for the unspoken argument about pornography's place in Wikipedia: here is my evidence that the argument is taking place. We would not be having this discussion if the actress performed in some other genre than pornography. Consider that there are quite a few performers (most of them, admittedly, young actors, singers, and musicians) who have only come to prominence in the same three-plus year timespan as Gianna Michaels. My feeling is that pornography is a part of the human condition. As such, it deserves clear, unbiased reportage. I do not feel Wikipedia should be a directory of porn stars; performers come and go. It should, however, be a leader in such coverage, if only because nobody else seems to be showing up until there's a tabloid-quality headline and byline to be had. Gianna Michaels has had a great deal of success in a fairly short time in the industry, much like, say, <a href="../../../c/l/a/Clay_Aiken_b79b.html" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> has had in music. (I dare say she has sold more media, in fact.) —<a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoomshadow_80d4.html" title="User:Boomshadow">Boomshadow</a></li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - On the basis that she just does sex scenes and doesn't "act" in features. Nothing is outstanding or groundbreaking about her.

<li><b>Keep</b> - Referring to <a href="../../../b/o/o/User%7EBoomshadow_80d4.html" title="User:Boomshadow">Boomshadow</a>'s comment, I personally think that <a href="../../../p/o/r/WP%7EPORNBIO_e966.html" title="WP:PORNBIO">WP:PORNBIO</a> in this case is slightly distorted as had Gianna been a model who primarily made her name in the video market rather than website scenes (hence the number of sites about her and her appearances <a href="http://www.giannamichaels.co.uk/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.giannamichaels.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">[37]</a>) to begin with she probably would have more notability to check against the lists. Judging by her <a href="http://www.overture.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.overture.com/" rel="nofollow">overture</a> search ranking per month which is approaching 50,000 unique searches (49281 for last month to be exact) I definitely think that she should be kept it. The wikipedia page for her is high in search engines such as <a href="http://www.google.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/" rel="nofollow">google</a> as well so if she was deleted people would continue to recreate this page until it was finally accepted she was notable (at some point in the future as she continues to grow). On this and a number of other factors, including her varied and high profile work according to the <a href="http://www.iafd.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.iafd.com/" rel="nofollow">iafd</a> and the pure number of fans and dedicated sites/pages about her I would say she is a definite keep, even if the article could do with a bit of expansion in some departments.</li>

<li><b>weak delete</b>: Only three advocates contributed, and they appear to be of one mind—I expect it's one person. The article has stood for three months: plenty of time to develop notability—but hasn't. The interesting bits are without references. Removing the <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">unverifiable</a> bits would leave an empty article. The reasons for <i>weak</i> is a) it seems like more notable information might be on its way and, b) there are a lot worse articles remaining. Nevertheless, plenty of local businessmen would be at least as notable, but don't meet the intent of <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a>. —<a href="../../../e/n/c/User%7EEncMstr_d026.html" title="User:EncMstr">EncMstr</a> 03:04, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

These issues need to be decided based mainly on policies and guidelines, so whether or not he would "pass the criteria at the Idol Wikiproject" isn't relevant. On the flip side, the references provided above sound like they're probably enough to satisfy <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>, so I modified my recommendation above to "Keep pending references" assuming those sources are cited in the article and can be verified. <a href="../../../d/u/g/User%7EDugwiki_6c77.html" title="User:Dugwiki">Dugwiki</a> 16:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I was assuming the Wikiproject guidelines grew out of AFD discussions, but maybe not. The sources can be verified by anyone with access to Factiva. I'll incorporate them somewhere, just to show that sources exist, but I don't have the time or interest to add sources to the entire article, which I think is ultimately necessary.

<dd><b>Keep</b>, because 1) deletionism is ruining Wikipedia and 2) American Idol has such a large fan base, people are likely to be interested in all of the contestants. Let's not turn away readers of the site, just because select individuals don't care about some information. If anyone out there is interested and the article is factual, keep it. If you don't like it, read something else, but don't ruin things for the rest of us. BTW, WTF is with all these anti-AI deletion bandwagoning!? Is someone a rejected contestant and wants to supress information about other contestants or something?! Anywway, this guy has discopgrahy even, so . . .

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> There is absolutely <b>no</b> violation whatever, in any way shape or form of any copyright law at all in this list. You cannot copyright information, and that's all that this list is: information about what Rolling Stone said the greatest albums of the 80s are. Anyone can report what the list is. Only original writing in Rolling Stone is copyrightable, and there's a big difference. I think it's worth having a number of "best" lists when they come from some authority on the subject. It helps people decide what they might want to listen to, buy, pay attention to or read about. The more the better, and that should include this one. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENoroton_ba4e.html" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> 08:30, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as a copyvio. It is my understanding that lists (like anything else) have copyright protection as long as there is any creativity involved in compiling or arranging them. So while a simple, chronological list of the Kings of England or "The Top Selling Records of All Time" <b>may</b> not be protected, a list of "My Favorite Kings of England" or "The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's [in Our Opinion]" is certainly protected. Also, if it's a close call whether an article is a copyvio, I think we need to err on the side of deleting it. (Not that I think it's close here at all.) Besides all of that, London Calling came out in 1979 (even though it hit the US in 1980), so the whole list is suspect IMHO. --<a href="../../../b/u/t/User%7EButseriouslyfolks_e848.html" title="User:Butseriouslyfolks">Butseriouslyfolks</a> 01:35, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as copyvio.

<li><b>Delete</b> Per US law, the "expertise" which is used to compile the list constitutes creative input. That is what makes a list copyrightable.

<dd>I agree that this posting should <b>not be deleted</b> as well as the other postings under that search title. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. Encyclopedias, especially online ones where one isn't concerned with book shelf space, should include organizations, products, etc. that are 'recent' but very popular, notable, and well-known to a specific demographic or geographical location. I use wikipedia because it exposes me to things I would have never known before since it is not notable or recognized in the area in which I live. If this organization, for example, was only a group of 20 people who got together and drank coffee--that is not notable. However, they are making a difference in their community, has been recognized by leaders in the community, and with such a large group, they can only be 'notable'.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 216.80.119.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_216.80.119.170_7f1e.html" title="Special:Contributions/216.80.119.170">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><span id="inconvenienttruth">There is no polite way to say this</span>, so I'll just say it. You're obviously too young to remember the composition, timeline, impact and effects of the cracking scene ca. 1985-1995, and you have no idea what the giants whose shoulders you are standing on were up to in their heyday (and they or their successors apparently still are to an extent). I'm having a hard time to refrain from throwing words like "trigger-happy" and "complete ignorance" around. I wish people didn't have such short attention spans and would pay more attention to history, including the history of the IT industry.

<dd>IMHO the above is a <a href="../../../s/t/r/Strawman_argument.html" title="Strawman argument">strawman argument</a>. In an AFD, credible (established &amp; verifiable) sources are a <i>tool</i> to establish the article subjects's notability/credibility. Articles on notable subjects are kept (and subsequently improved where necessary). Articles on non-notable subjects are deleted. Once the balance of evidence indicates that a subject is indeed notable, an article is kept. The above note implies that because of a perceived lack of established mainstream sources, the article should face deletion irrespective of its subject's (implicitly conceded) notability. That turns things on its head. Established sources are the means towards the end, not an end in themselves. Granted, established sources are almost always a better tool to establish notability than other, inherently less powerful indicators. (Such less powerful indicators that have been used in AFDs include ample circumstantial evidence, abundant less well established sources, obviousness/common knowledge/accepted wisdom, expert testimony [eg. "I am a marine biologist and I can confirm..."] etc.). But the purpose of an AFD is <i>not</i> to prove disputed individual assertions within an article, it is <i>only</i> to determine whether the subject of an article does or does not deserve an article; ie. whether it is notable. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 15:37, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Thats kind of the issue. In order for content to exist here there has to be an assertion of notability.

<li>Unidentified user please calm down this is a civil discussion. Crossmr: Personally I would assume that "It was founded in 1990" and the vast variety of consoles would lend itself to their notability but if not I could do some research and find some. The only thing I ask is, and I don't know if you did this before-hand because I just looked at the article out of curiosity for the first time, but to mark it as needing varification, or as a stub or something (I'm still new on Wikipedia) instead of marking it for deletion. I believe every informative article should be welcome on Wikipedia as someone may be looking for information on Paradox and this is a good source (perhaps with a little more information, a great source.) And Vironex, he's saying that the article needs more sources citing how elaborate, and more evidence of how popular the group is.<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberwolff_eca4.html" title="User:Syberwolff">Syberwolff</a> 04:58, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Because wikipedia has a threshold for inclusion and articles which do not meet that threshold get removed. So far the comments have been in the same vein as the article.

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li>Wow. This article even comes with an editorial about the deletion policy and an editorial about free speech. Now, before I cast my&#160;!vote, lemme tell you a little something about the free speech provisions of the first amendment to the United States Constitution: <b>THEY ONLY APPLY TO CONGRESS</b>. The amendment says that Congress shall not make laws abridging the freedom of press/speech/et cetera, and Wikipedia is not congress - ergo, this doesn't apply. In otherwords, there is no way that Wikipedia can even remotely possibly violate your constitutional rights to freedom of speech. It's simply impossible. Don't believe me? <a href="../../../f/i/r/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution_7435.html" title="First Amendment to the United States Constitution">Look it up</a> and read the whole thing.

<li><b>Comment</b> One of Wikipedia's inherent biases, which I don't have a ready solution for, is that groups which operate far enough outside the mainstream that the legitimate press either can't or doesn't cover them, are at an inherent disadvantage. However, that doesn't change the fact that all information on this site must be verified. There's plenty of useful material out there that is simply not appropriate for Wikipedia. After all, this is an encyclopeida, not the aggregate of all human knowledge. If this group is written about later, they can have an article then. Groups like <a href="../../../s/k/u/Skull_and_Bones_93ca.html" title="Skull and Bones">Skull and Bones</a> existed for decades before there would have been enough good info or media coverage to write a Wikipedia article about them.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 17:46, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>This is insanity. Do NOT try to make this about "credible sources". You either have an agenda or are trying to cover up your initial screw-up that was suggesting to delete something YOU never heard about. This is a warez group, they don't use Hilton &amp; Knowles for press releases, they don't give interviews, they try to stay OUT of the media. There are articles and links quoted, but THEIR sources are not reliable enough? These high standards would get a lot religious articles in trouble. Can you please point out exactly what you are after? A glossy paper print of "Top of the pops of the warez scene"? I have no affiliation with Paradox nor the warez scene (other than seeing their stuff on my Amiga 15 years ago), but I do read on the web from time to time about them and other childhood heroes like Fairlight and Razor 1911. Ok, angry rant.Finishing off with a source.

<li>Dennis maybe you should go actually read the <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">WP:LAWYER</a> page. After you have done that tell me which side of this debate it sounds to you like it's describing. I would especially look really hard at numbers 2 and 3 on the list at the top. Not trying to be a dick here but honestly you are completely offbase throwing that one out there. I don't see syberwolf throwing alot of legal terminology your way, I don't see him being overly anal about technicalitys in the rules. Just debating a subject is not wikilawyering. Further a notable source has been provided, the APC mag Vista crack article. It establishes notability and is a reliable source. Not every single source in an article needs to establish notability. Other rational arguments have been made for the case of notability as well but you seem to be to caught up in the letter of the policys to have heard them. You are a human being not a RULEBOT5000 please start acting like it. No one needs to change any policy here and no one is suggesting that we do. Here's a qoute from <a href="../../../c/r/e/WP%7ECREEP_d9fc.html" title="WP:CREEP">WP:CREEP</a> that you ought to take note of <i>"Our editors are volunteers, and are not obliged to follow procedure if they feel following them doesn't benefit the encyclopedia."</i> and another from <a href="../../../l/a/w/WP%7ELAWYER_7fd4.html" title="WP:LAWYER">WP:LAWYER</a> <i>"Wikipedia policies and procedures should be interpreted in a commonsensical way to achieve the purpose of the policy"</i> and another from <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> <i>"If the rules prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia, ignore them."</i>. If anyone is acting like the wikilawyer here it is you. It's good to know the policys and often very good to follow them but keep them in perspective for what they are. - <a href="../../../a/r/c/User%7EArch_NME_45a5.html" title="User:Arch NME">Arch NME</a> 03:55, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>Notice how once you prove to him that he's wrong he won't even admit it. I think that '<b>Abiding by the letter of a policy or guideline while violating its spirit;'</b> perfectly describes the current situation. He in interpreting the rules on notability by the letter and violating the spirit of wikipeda itself, to provide information that is truthful. All of the information on the group has been proven to be truthful in one way or another. I believe that the sheer volume of sources we have alone would also provide notability. We have in my oppinion showed many times over how notable this group is and in several different forms. I am amazed that people still deny their notability.<a href="../../../s/y/b/User%7ESyberwolff_eca4.html" title="User:Syberwolff"><font color="#339900"><sup>SyBer</sup></font><font color="#003399"><sub>WoLff</sub></font></a> 22:18, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I currently can't be arsed (due to the amount of material) but <a href="../../../t/e/x/Textfiles.com.html" title="Textfiles.com">textfiles.com</a> could be trawled for info about PARADOX' activities. A cursory Google search seems to return a number of articles related to the group <a href="http://www.google.ie/search?q=paradox+site:textfiles.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.ie/search?q=paradox+site:textfiles.com" rel="nofollow">[45]</a> (though not all of these hits are). <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 03:12, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>This appears typical of Wikipedia, a valid article up for deletion on a whim. A few of my own articles have been erased for no good reason and this bad taste the Wikipediaphiles (similar to audiophiles but for Wiki) are leaving with internet users is doing nothing for the general feel good factor it had a year ago. On the topic of Paradox, I'm sure I could go and dig out a dusty CDR from 8 years ago, find the FILE_ID.DIZ file and the related .NFO, fire them up onto Geoshities and call that conclusive proof.

<li>You're being far too optimistic here. The people you're talking to have never heard of FILE_ID.DIZ and .NFO files. See my <a href="#inconvenienttruth" title="">original comment above</a>. <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 01:00, 8 March 2007 (UTC)

(Again, it's obvious to me that the OP had no idea of the significance of the cracking scene in the history of IT, much less being actually qualified to assess the relative importance of the major players at the time.) <a href="../../../8/6/2E/User%7E86.56.48.12.html" title="User:86.56.48.12">86.56.48.12</a> 01:52, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>To Djrobgordon: I'm under no obligation to explain anything to you here. These are all voluntary contributions. If you want me to help you, try asking politely. If you don't want to do that, then you're welcome to pay me by the hour and I'll help you anytime you want. Also, is stating an obvious truth really an insult? I may not have been particularly polite above (that's a fair criticism), but I stand by my words insofar as I believe they were right on the money. Now obviously I could dig my heels in and not tell you anything, because you didn't exactly ask a friendly question, but anyway: There was significant overlap between the <a href="../../../b/b/s/BBS_e769.html" title="BBS">BBS</a> scene and the <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a>-<a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracker.html" title="Cracker">cracker</a>/<a href="../../../c/r/a/Cracktro.html" title="Cracktro">cracktro</a>/<a href="../../../d/e/m/Demoscene.html" title="Demoscene">demoscene</a>. Both FILE_ID.DIZ and *.NFO files frequently accompanied <a href="../../../w/a/r/Warez.html" title="Warez">warez</a> found on BBSes. Watch this documentary for details on the BBS scene: <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" class="external free" title="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/</a> Apart from that, in the words of <a href="../../../k/e/i/Keith_Olbermann_9105.html" title="Keith Olbermann">Keith Olbermann</a>: "Use teh Google!" If you did <a href="http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/" class="external free" title="http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/" rel="nofollow">http://justfuckinggoogleit.com/</a>, you would probably discover that there's this really nifty encyclopedia out there, which just happens to have articles on these subjects: <a href="../../../f/i/l/FILE_ID.DIZ_aa0e.html" title="FILE ID.DIZ">FILE_ID.DIZ</a>, <a href="../../../n/f/o/NFO_3fa0.html" title="NFO">NFO</a>/<a href="../../../2E/n/f/.nfo.html" title=".nfo">.nfo</a></li>

<li>86.56.48.12: You're not helping me, you're helping the article. If you actually have an interest in keeping it, you have a better chance of changing someone's mind by explaining your point. The only purpose of your comment was to point out the ignorance of others, and that's not civil or productive. Do you honestly believe it added any substance to this debate? As to the above comment, those files would prove that this group exists, a point with which no editor has disagreed. The objections to this article are that it doesn't meet Wikipedia standards for <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a> and that there isn't enough <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a> to write an article. There are plenty of arguments above about why PARADOX is notable, but none about how it meets Wikipedia notability standards. There are plenty of sources, but almost none of them are usable to establish notability. I have no problem changing my vote on an AfD when the article comes into accordance with standards, but it hasn't happened here.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 02:41, 8 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No references or origins noted. The hoax worry enhanced by the unexplained name.

<li><b>Delete</b>.I kind of know the author of this article and I can confirm that this is a private constructed language that was only dreamt up a couple of days ago. It's not a hoax. But it's lack of notability does indeed mean it doesn't belong on Wikipedia, and I told them that when they first created the article.

<li>'<b>Keep</b> Hello all. I am the author of this page and of much of the content. I am not thoroughly familiar with the rules of what does and does not constitute a wiki entry. But, my main concern is that this entry is being considered for deletion merely on the basis of age. This is a new language. It's a little older than a few days in concept, planning, and execution but I have only recently began to publicly ask for assistance with the project (outside of a group of enthusiats, linguists and contributors). Now, about Toytonic. Toytonic is the product of an ongoing collaborative effort between linguists and language educators to develop a language that is based on PIE and it's early daughter languages while evolving those systems into a more dynamic language. Toytonic is based on the word roots of PIE and several functional features of other Indo-Eurpean languages. These ancient forms have been modified to place the language at a point that accounts for the evolution from PIE that most linguists agree to be inevitable natural changes (mostly phonetic). Then, the language is structured to be absolute (everything has only one meaning). It should be simply in structure and easily learned in a short period of time. The efforts have resulted in a grammar, basic vocabulary and rules for adding to the lexicon, and some spoken and written speech. The next step will be to compile a larger lexicon with cross-references to English, German, and Spanish. From there an effort will begin to begin establishing a literature through writing and translation. As is stands, the language can be spoken and written, has been and will continue to be. That constitues a language. The entry is not complete (it takes some effort to write this in wiki form so as not to confuse non-linguists). But, even in a non-completed form, there is already more information on Toytonic on wiki than many attested languages. There are also several other constructed, engineered, and even fictional languages with multiple wiki entries. My main point is that Toytonic is no different now than Esperanto, Klingon, or most other constructed languages were in their infancy. And then other people said they should not be considered languages. Today there are large communities of both and even native speakers in each. Shouldn't Toytonic be considered on its merits and not just on the fact that you've never heard of it? -- Drew.ward</li>

<li>Its <i>merits</i> for the purpose of an encyclopedia have only to do with notability.

<li>Since you put quite much effort into creating of this page, I would suggest you copy the entire article into a sub-page of your userpage (but without linking it from other articles). That way you can improve it further until – as you hope – it becomes much more well-known and elaborated and until you indeed have found linguists that want to work on this project. Also, if Esperanto had been invented 3 days ago, we would delete it as well. The point is that being a few days old makes your language almost by definition non-notable (maybe it will grow famous, in future, though); plus Google doesn't show even one related hit for "Toytonic". — <a href="../../../n/-/t/User%7EN-true_dbda.html" title="User:N-true">N-true</a> 17:21, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. No references or origins noted because this idea was dreamt up a few days ago. The name is a reference to the site on which the idea was first posted. It HAS no merits. The "article" is abuse of Wiki in an attempt to gain credibility (user is posting links to the Wiki entry). The "language", while proclaiming to be a simplification, combines the worst of all linguistic and orthotic ideas. It is as legitimate as Jimmy Wales' degrees in religion. While numerous synthetic languages exist, in natural language terms this one isn't even up to the stage of "meaningful grunting". BadDoggie 16:23, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Neutral</b>: While there are a lot of Google hits the page does look like an ad and the creator, I suspect, is the artist or her production company (See: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Gaiamusic_4df2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Gaiamusic">contribs</a>). This was that user's only contribution. Additionally I am not sure if any of the first few pages of web hits establish notability. I saw a lot of concert announcements, some cds for sale stuff, her myspace and website, her record company etc etc. This may seem like a lot of sources but I don't know if they are reliable, especially regarding notability. I mean, a lot of NN bands have production companies and websites and CDs and concerts.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Yes, there are quite a few Ghits, but when you begin looking at them, they are page after page of ads for selling CDs, artist/label promos, blogs, and brief myspace comments/"reviews". If there was a single notable independent review, I couldn't find it in the first five Ghit pages or skimming through the next five.

<p>If this rivalry ever existed, it was only for the 1987 season. Neither of the respective team articles (<a href="../../../d/e/t/Detroit_Tigers_a55b.html" title="Detroit Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto_Blue_Jays_5982.html" title="Toronto Blue Jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>) refer to any rivalry between them. Not that my opinion carries much any weight, but I'm a Tigers fan, and I can think of at least three teams I'd consider bigger rivals. Not that a Google search is terribly valuable here, but the phrase "'Detroit Tigers' 'Toronto Blue Jays' rivalry" doesn't turn up much indicating that there is one. This article is completely unsourced, and is authored almost entirely by one editor. Only incoming article link is from the dubiously sourced <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_rivalries_9132.html" title="List of Major League Baseball rivalries">List of Major League Baseball rivalries</a>.

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>. Aside from the fact that they used to both be in the AL East before the 1994 realignment, and thus had the same "rivalry" as any other set of two teams that fought for the same playoff spot, this is <b>positively un-notable.</b> In fact, I'd be hard pressed to find a less notable rivalry if I was just drawing names out of a hat. Yankees - Red Sox, definitely, that's a rivalry. Giants - Dodgers, sure, Yankees - Dodgers, even if they rarely meet, I'd still consider a candidate for a rivalry based on the World Series battles of the 50s. Hey, maybe you can even make a case for Twins - Rangers (both ex-Washington Senator teams) or the handful of "paired" expansion teams (Rockies - Marlins springs to mind, since they were both in the NL). Jury's still out with me on those last two hypotheticals. But Blue Jays and Tigers is absurd. --Action Jackson IV 06:44, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

In contrast, the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_York_Yankees_cfbf.html" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> article clearly mentions the rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox throughout the article.

<p>The result was <b>limited keep, with qualifications</b>. Nearly every commenters agrees that the fact of the eclipse on a given day is notable and encyclopedic. The dispute is whether this particular eclipse warrants an individual article, as it is not significantly different (from a layperson's point of view) from any other exclipse. On reading the debate, there is consensus here to <b>merge</b> the raw data from this article to a <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_lunar_eclipses.html" title="List of lunar eclipses">List of lunar eclipses</a>. To my great surprise, this article does not yet exist. Such a list should be created forthwith, and this article merged to it.

<li><b>Reply</b>: The same thing happens with the Earth and the moon and the Sun. They are simply visible from different locations due to the rotation of the Earth, or something like that.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sorry to blather so much. But this could be resolved by having an article on <a href="../../../t/o/t/Total_lunar_eclipse.html" title="Total lunar eclipse">Total lunar eclipse</a>, if they are different from the partial ones, which they are. Anyway, again nothing inherently notable about any individual total lunar eclipse. The information could be in one article for all total lunar eclipses. Otherwise, since this stuff is predictable far into the future, we could fill the wiki with articles about lunar and solar eclipses for all time.

<li><b>Keep</b>: While I agree there's nothing <i>inherently</i> notable about any individual total lunar eclipse, that doesn't imply that all total lunar eclipses are necessarily not notable. Each total eclipse is actually different since the relative positions of Sun, Moon and Earth are never exactly the same, leading to a different experience from Earth for each.

<dd>One more thing, if this, or any other eclipse, is notable, say for duration (which I don't know whether duration of eclipses and totality and such varies or not from eclipse to eclipse) then, perhaps I would feel differently about an individual article for the eclipse but I just don't think it is feasible to have one about every single eclipse, it just doesn't make any sense to me.<a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_mcmurray_93f4.html" title="User:A mcmurray">A mcmurray</a> (<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_mcmurray_aaf1.html" title="User talk:A mcmurray">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_mcmurray_ce89.html" title="Special:Contributions/A mcmurray">contribs</a>)

<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be hard pressed to find a unifying characteristic amongst DreamWorks villains, Warner Bros. villains, etc., other than the film studio that released films of them. At least with Disney villains the argument can be made that they were mostly created around the same circumstances - animated feature length movie rated either G or PG, must be family-friendly while remaining unlikeable somehow, and a lot of the early ones were made by Disney himself or whoever. But in respectable film literature (i.e., stuff that isn't written by a random stoner with a Bachelor's), there does not exist categories like the ones mentioned above. Pixar hasn't released enough movies on their own for any list to be even remotely substantial (the list of Pixar villans would number about 14, assuming two villains in every feature length movie). DreamWorks is a "you film it, we release it" sort, and the list of DreamWorks villains would feature everyone from the Gladiator bad guy to the bad guy in <a href="../../../s/h/r/Shrek.html" title="Shrek">Shrek</a> - unless we reduced it to just the DreamWorks "animated" features, which would leave us with a list similar to Pixar. Ditto Warner Brothers - they release a <i>lot</i> of movies. Unless we're narrowing down the Warner Brothers criteria to <a href="../../../l/o/o/Looney_Tunes_dcd6.html" title="Looney Tunes">Looney Tunes</a>, it makes no sense to create a laundry list of villainous characters whose only common trait is that eventually, the script containing them was given to some dude who then shopped his movie around and had it picked up by Warner Brothers. In closing, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Disney_Villains_8f6a.html" title="List of Disney Villains">List of Disney Villains</a> is fanpage fluff, but of the sort that's probably borderline fine for an encyclopedia. List of animated villains may also be encyclopedic. List of Pixar/FOX/WB/DreamWorks/whatever Villains might as well be List of Villains whose names begin with B and were born west of the Ural mountains. --Action Jackson IV 20:45, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

This actual article is a housing development not a neighborhood, and the content is mostly real estate advertising photographs of some of the local landmarks. NN, and not RS, as there are no sources of any sort whatsoever.

Google gives many results abut the locality. As regards the notability, any geographical place (like a village or part of a big city) is notable and there are many articles relating to villages and smaller towns. The population of United India Colony is certainly more than many villages (with small population running into 100s). Any geographical place should find a mention in Wikipedia - for example we have <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiraya%2C_Nagano_bf49.html" title="Hiraya, Nagano">Hiraya, Nagano</a> with a population of only 645 whereas in two/ three apartments of United India Colony more than 1000 persons may be living. Some examples of more such pages are: <a href="../../../n/a/b/Nabua.html" title="Nabua">Nabua</a> or <a href="../../../m/a/q/Maqewa.html" title="Maqewa">Maqewa</a>. Accordingly, I am inclined for continued inclusion of this page to Wikipedia and to allow its growth over a period of time though I am unable to assert right now notability of the place. BTW, <a href="../../../u/t/c/User%7EUtcursch_88c9.html" title="User:Utcursch">utcursch</a> has done a good job by merging the contents with <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodambakkam.html" title="Kodambakkam">Kodambakkam</a>. I am not sure, but it may not be a exactly a part of <a href="../../../k/o/d/Kodambakkam.html" title="Kodambakkam">Kodambakkam</a> though it is adjacent to Kodambakkam.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Most of the comments above seem to note that the topics don't deserve separate articles (with which I agree). So, I merged (maybe a little prematurely, but I still think it was a justified move per <a href="../../../f/i/c/WP%7EFICT_c17c.html" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> #2) all of the articles into <a href="../../../k/i/n/List_of_places_in_Total_Annihilation%7E_Kingdoms_3046.html" title="List of places in Total Annihilation: Kingdoms">List of places in Total Annihilation: Kingdoms</a>. All of the articles in this AFD are now {{<a href="../../../r/_/f/Template%7ER_from_merge_eed7.html" title="Template:R from merge">R from merge</a>}}s to the main list, which I have organised based on two sources (noted at the bottom of the list), shortened to exclude some trivial information, and given a short summary at the start to clarify things. I would argue that these articles (now redirects) should be <b>kept</b> as:</li>

<li>Are we talking about different articles?

<li>Try looking at the references already in the article. Scamdog, as one example, is a reliable third party source.

<li>Do you have any respect for the idea that the first priority of an encyclopedia should be, to hold correct information?

<ul>
<li>This encyclopedia is a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wiki.html" title="Wiki">wiki</a> -- something which <i>anyone</i> can edit at any time. Anyone can change an article so that it presents false information--if we simply discarded everything that was misleading or out of context <i>without even trying to correct it</i>, we'd have no encyclopedia. Perhaps you should have some respect for that! And if you're not in the business of building the encyclopedia (of which research is a critical component), I am confused as to why you're even here. -- <a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlack_Falcon_a2d9.html" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a> 17:42, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<li>This exchange becomes a bit lengthy and off topic here. Some clarification and (if I can restrain myself) a last word on this: Micronations and investment scams aren't just the area I'm contributing here. Occasionally I stumble over articles in this area (perhaps doing interwikis etc) and in a small percentage of these accidents I find the article just that bad, that I'd prefer it deleted. Anyway, now that I'm involved, and anticipating a <i>keep</i> outcome, perhaps I myself will do the cleanup, stating up front in the article that it is an old scam and cut out all the "micronation folklore" with an axe. But I fear, as long as the article doesn't get deleted, it's random walk in quality space will always lead back to micronation folklore. --<a href="../../../p/j/a/User%7EPjacobi_dff5.html" title="User:Pjacobi">Pjacobi</a> 18:11, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well, when you run across bad articles, and you don't feel like taking the time to fix them, for whatever reason, there are plenty of options besides deletion. Even a simple cleanup might be appropriate, though there are other, more specific options, that might be better instead. Now as regarding this case, if you do believe there's going to be an on-going problem as to this page being misleading, or mis-used for some purpose (such as to support the "reality" of the scam), that would be something that ought to be addressed, but I don't think deletion is a better solution even in that event. After all, deletion doesn't prevent there being false information out there, either on Wikipedia or the Internet, it just means there is one less source for the truth. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 23:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Does not cite sources, has no references, and does not even assert any academic notability - and thus fail <a href="../../../a/t/t/WP%7EATT_3bcb.html" title="WP:ATT">WP:ATT</a>, and probably <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE</a>. Speaking as someone trained in economics, it also appears to be total gibberish - the description of what the topic is does not jive with the common academic use of the term "economics", (For instance, "urban land economics"), and instead reads like some kind of social prescriptive system. Furthermore, it includes terms which appear incoherent - "Ultimate Economics" - and a "sector of quality of life economics" section which make little to no sense, and is probably wildly at odds with reality. I'm strongly inclined to this is probably something someone made up at school, and thus falls under <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, or is a hoax. Furthermore, the phrase itself has only 195 Ghits, and literally none of them have anything to do with the topic discussed here. This should be <b>deleted</b>.</p>

<dd>I should note, however, that there is probably some sub-discipline with economics <i>somewhere</i> called "quality of life economics", but I can tell you that this isn't it.

<li><b>Delete</b> per <a href="../../../n/e/o/WP%7ENEO_68d4.html" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. Some economists do indeed deal with "quality of life" issues, but this article is essentially about a neologistic concept (perhaps entirely made-up) that attempts to define a certain class of economic <i>systems</i>. From what I can tell, the economic system described approximates the theoretical model of the modernised burgeois democracy (the degree of conformance between theory and reality can be disputed). I cannot make sense of the article's mention of the "biospheric environment": the "biosphere" <i>is</i> the environment.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I may be biased because I created this article, but I think it has merit. For one thing, the amount of music tracks in SpongeBob (particularly the Associated Production Music) is immense, just like Ren &amp; Stimpy. As such, it's worth cataloging it. It's not like the article is a two sentence affair of worthless information or anything, and much of the APM info hasn't been released anywhere before this, making it a handy resource that you can't find on other sites. In addition, it would be highly unrealistic to put all of this information in the main SpongeBob article (because it would get way too long), hence the branch off to its own article, where things can be fleshed out more. You argue that this article is 'listcruft'. First of all, it's impossible to know whether something is only useful to a limited amount of people without polling everyone who watches SpongeBob. Second, while I admit the article is basically a laundry list of all the songs used on the show, the list is constantly changing, since the show is still running, not to mention people are finding songs on the APM site all the time, and therefore new songs can constantly be added. <a href="../../../s/b/2/User%7ESb2007_13b1.html" title="User:Sb2007">Sb2007</a> 02:05, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. Music plays a very important part in the program and therefor an own article is justifiable in my opion. The theme tune is a popular song for children and adult fans alike and therefor is notable. Due to the amount of songs listed it would be unwise to merge this into the main article, as this would just bloat the article. In my opion this article is very useful for people looking for information on the music of SpongeBob and is very notable due to it's theme tune popularity alone. <a href="../../../p/o/e/User%7EPoeloq_4256.html" title="User:Poeloq">Poeloq</a> 02:10, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> 864 hits (I got 855) is actually pretty good for an abstruse cosmological theory. Encouragingly, most of these links are to bona-fide publications in various physics journals. As for the nominator's claim that this is a “one person theory”, the publications I found are by a number of scientists from different institutions. While I'm not convinced as to the merits of the NGT, it certainly appears notable enough, has a number of potential verifiable sources (all these published papers), and appears to attract physicists rather than cranks, which is a good sign. No, it is not a mainstream theory, but then <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#PAPER" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not paper</a>; there is room here for less popular theories, as long as they are legitimate. The article could use some more citations, but this is grounds for editorial work, not deletion. Again, I'm <i>not</i> saying that NGT is true; I'm not supporting the theory, but I am supporting its inclusion on Wikipedia. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 00:22, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

Once someone's found additional ref, saves others from having to do the work over, and supports the argument for keeping the article if lack of RS were part of the problem, as here. <b><a href="../../../d/g/g/User%7EDGG_945e.html" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> 02:04, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I added three references as you requested. Only one of them is an overview by the theory's author; the remaining two, by other authors, address possible relationship with <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_theory.html" title="String theory">string theory</a>, and current (as of Nov. 2006) developments. There are many other, less general papers out there, dealing with various aspects of the theory. I am neither an expert nor an enthusiast in the article's subject, so I do not expect to be making many more edits to it. Nevertheless I think that the request for deletion is unreasonable; this is a valid and recognized scientific theory of current interest; there are independent, third party sources; there seems to be little substance to the nominator's allegation that this is a theory nobody but its author contributes to. <a href="../../../f/r/e/User%7EFreederick_2a42.html" title="User:Freederick">Freederick</a> 11:55, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>. Wikipedia does not, AFAIK, have an "impact factor" requirement. The citation pattern for this theory is not too atypical, and as the papers are, in most cases, refereed, they pass the "verifiable source" requirement without a lot of third party citations. It's not a slam-dunk case for being notable, and no one would be clamoring for an article if there weren't one written already. But since the article is there, and not badly written ... <a href="../../../b/m/_/User%7EBm_gub_59c9.html" title="User:Bm gub">Bm gub</a> 15:48, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<p>Advertisement, no independent indication of notability. Note that article was created recently by someone with only one previous edit (in mid-2005), and has also been edited by Nicolasb71, whose only edits have been spam edits to include the Reporo product (Either he's associated with the company, or wants to give that impression). In the event that the article is *not* chosen for deletion, it still needs most content removed, as it is ad material that appears elsewhere on the net. <a href="../../../f/o/u/User%7EFourohfour_c17e.html" title="User:Fourohfour">Fourohfour</a> 13:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: I'm sorry if my language and style of writing was wrong for wikipedia, i should have read the WP Policy first, forgive this is my first article creatation and was ovally eager to get something down. i have re-written this from scratch more or less. also i don't have any thing to do with Reporo, i do however use use the service. i was searching around random topics on wikipedia and noticed it didn't have a page....hence this mess now... please comment on the rewrite, if any changes are needed. i'd like to put some more technical background stuff into it but am have hard time finding any information.

<p>I wrote BOTH articles. The facts in them are true and I was a member of the board and witnessed all accounts. I have documentation and correspondences to prove all points mentioned. It was a member of the current theater company that came along and changed the original, deleting information on the demise of the original founders, which was the intent of the original article. If there was a problem with the title not reflecting that, I have no problem with the change of title. That's why I wrote the second article and added in "The Founders Story." This theater company is the only one of it's kind to our knowledge (being a membership musical company that produces staged readings) and had several West Coast Premiere's including Sondheim's PASSION. I have been contacted by many people thanking me for writing the original article as it was never publicized as to why the original founders were no longer a part of the company and the current company has withheld information from the public and in fact doesn't tell it's current membership about the original founders at all. That's why they chose to delete the information from the original article, so people couldn't find out that they kicked the founders out of their own company with no foundation and even prevented them from attending the meeting in which they were removed (which is against Robert's Rules of Order.) I would rather have the original article The Musical Theatre Guild removed and my new one The Founders Story left in. If the current theater company wants to write their own article leaving out truths, they can surely do so.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../m/t/g/User%7EMtguild_acc2.html" title="User:Mtguild">Mtguild</a> (<a href="../../../m/t/g/User_talk%7EMtguild_bcbc.html" title="User talk:Mtguild">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mtguild_7aee.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mtguild">contribs</a>) 23:31, February 24, 2007.</small></p>

<p><b>Merge</b> This entry has given me some questions. Its a nice article in itself, and I did check the website, but is this really a <b>notable guild</b>. The article title <i>Musical Theatre Guild - the Founders Story</i> sounds like a book. I live in UK so this article may be something that relates purely to Los Angeles but really if this article is agreed as being <b>noteworthy</b> then it should be in an Musical Theatre Guild article with The Founders Story as a headline on the page. If founders are then coming onto Wikipedia to vandalise articles that contain the truth (but its not pleasant for those it talks about) then it should be taken up via the appropriate channels. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 16:03, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Here's what happened. <a href="../../../m/t/g/User%7EMtguild_acc2.html" title="User:Mtguild">User:Mtguild</a> wrote the article Musical Theatre Guild. Another editor removed some material from that article which Mtguild thought was important, and rather than re-insert it, he wrote this response article (It appears that Mtguild is one of the "Founders" in question. The deleted information concerned how the two men who formed the group either left or were forced out of it. Take a look at <a href="../../../d/j/r/User_talk%7EDjrobgordon_b90e.html#re:_Musical_Theatre_Guild" title="User talk:Djrobgordon">this discussion</a> on my talk page, if you want the justification in his words. I urged him on his own talk page to edit the original article, if it omitted important information. The problem with a merge here is that I can't find any sources on the internet, even unusable ones, that verify Mtguild's account of how the group's founders left. Policy states that when it comes to controversial information, the burden of proof lies with the editor arguing to keep it. Accordingly, I can't see adding his account to Musical Theatre Guild. And obviously, an article can't exist when its author has admitted its only purpose is to provide a second point of view of a topic already covered in its own article.--<a href="../../../d/j/r/User%7EDjrobgordon_ce64.html" title="User:Djrobgordon">Djrobgordon</a> 16:20, 4 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is quite a hornets nest isnt it. Whatever is decided via AfD will cause problems for someone associated with this guild. After reading the discussion you pointed me at - I come to the conclusion that an edit war may start on this article. This guild does not seem very famous outside LA so really we have to question is either article worthy of a place on wikipedia. Im coming to the conclusion that it is not and this might be better suited on a personal website which would be harder to be vandalised. --<a href="../../../p/r/i/User%7EPrincessBrat_4583.html" title="User:PrincessBrat">PrincessBrat</a> 16:51, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> The expected coincidence of playing the same day as a holiday does not automatically make it notable. Especially when compared to games/events that are specifically celebrated around holidays, such as the Thanksgiving Classic and <a href="../../../l/a/b/Labour_Day_Classic_f420.html" title="Labour Day Classic">Labour Day Classic</a>. The attempt at tying the playing of NBA games with memorials for 9/11 is nothing more than revisionist history. <a href="../../../r/e/s/User%7EResolute_4bb9.html" title="User:Resolute">Resolute</a> 20:08, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Reluctant delete</b> Though it's a nice-looking article, I think this is pushing things, even from an inclusionist's standpoint. I know basketball, and there's nothing especially significant about playing on Memorial Day. The games just don't have the same cultural resonance as the NFL's Thanksgiving Classic. Really, no date-specific game in the NBA does. I'd hate to see this get nuked, though.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - what Portland12 says is true, but we're not just looking for verification; Wikipedia policies also require that a biographical article should establish <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">notability</a>.

<li>The artist is notable, on a more local/cult status perhaps than on a nationwide status, but in a climate where the major record labels dominate, someone must support the indie labels, and the 'indie' artists. The album in question appears to be linked to the Probe Plus label, a renowned label which has supported unsigned bands/artists and got music to listeners, which is the important point. If we ourselves are debating this deletion, then thats a good pointer to the fact that everyday people can have a say in what we want to say - which is democratic, thus this particular artist, though being on an indie label, still can reach the ears of a limited audience, and democracy can still work, without domination from bigger authorities.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Portland12 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Portland12_2e13.html" title="Special:Contributions/Portland12">contribs</a>).</small>

<li><b>Comment</b> indeed, this is a democratic discussion but WP has a number of well-defined policies for biographies which you would be advised to familiarise yourself with in order to prevent the article being deleted, namely <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>, <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>.

<p>Regarding the notability of the artist (after reviewing your references above)he has independent and non-trivial sources with several reviews of his album by un-related music websites, some as far as South America and throughout Europe, he's on the UK based Channel 4/Music page and also has a number of well visited myspace profiles.<small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Portland12 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Portland12_2e13.html" title="Special:Contributions/Portland12">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p>Autobiographical vanity page, IMHO. The author was (I'm almost certain) using sock/mock/meatpuppets to remove speedy deletion tags - but a claim of notability was made, making it ineligible for speedy deletion.

<li><b>Delete</b> - According the article, the individual in question is well known to those who belong to a subculture in a particular locale, but after reading the external links given, that claim seems dubious.

<p>My name is Aaron Samuels and a fan of Aaron's. You state you are 'almost' certain Mr. Kelley is using mock _____ to comment on this page, I am most certainly not one of them. I have been anticipating an article to be found on him in Wikipedia, and am glad as a user he is finally here. If you delete this article, you will be using bad judgement, and it is a shame. The term 'used for vanity' is extreme, and would be considered defamation in legal terms. Please carefully consider your words and the way you choose to make claims to people. This is a professional forum, I hope, and let's carry ourselves professionally and with dignity.

My opinion (which might be wrong) from reading the article that it looks like a thinly disguised advertisement for a fairly standard product/service. This is, I guess, why the other tags were already assigned to it.

His writings are not part of a curriculum and have not been cited. He did not create a new theory, nor is he considered an innovator by his peers. He's one of ten thousand sports writers.

<p>There are hundreds of sports athletes who are not viewed as such with pages on Wikipedia and there are countless sports writers with a smaller following than the current writer considered. Dave Golokhov does has been written about by multiple non-trivial sources such as USAToday and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. His article reach is along the MSN Network, which includes having his articles featured on MSN.com - the internet's largest website. There are only a handful of Canadians who have accomplished that feat. When googled, 11 pages worth of content surfaces. Furthermore, his recent appearance on a sports talk show - The Grill Room on Sun TV, makes him their youngest guest ever. His articles are referenced on Wikipedia pages, such as NFL Superstar Chad Johnson (Top 10 Sports Showboats) as well as 'List of Famous NHL Linemates'. If a page like this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buffery" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buffery" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buffery</a> is allowed to exist, then surely this page should as well. --<font color="blue" face="Matisse ITC">Dave</font>]] 23:33, 4 March 2007</p>

<p>There already exists an article on the <a href="../../../f/o/o/Footlights.html" title="Footlights">Footlights</a>. This one simply provides a list of past presidents of the organisation, the vast majority of whom are not notable. The Footlights do not deserve two articles, even if there are some interesting people on this list but they are already mentioned in the main article. <a href="../../../l/i/n/User%7ELincolnite_dc5e.html" title="User:Lincolnite">Lincolnite</a> 17:35, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<p>Non-notable TV station, which may not even be operating (if the talk page is to be believed). Although Google results for <i>"Capital TV"</i> look good, when specific statements are searched for there are no sources that establish the station's notability.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> - although most TV stations have some claim to notability, the nominator's research shows that this one may be quite obscure (and may not even be operating).

<li><b>Comment</b> For the history of this article, see the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_3b0c.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God">first AfD</a> and the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Mathematics_and_God_%282nd_nomination%29_457f.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mathematics and God (2nd nomination)">second AfD</a>.

<li>Which is why I'd prefer to merge the content. But once the content is merged into the more appropriate article, I don't care whether this title remains, so I'm ok with a delete outcome as well. But if you want an actual argument for deletion: "Mathematics and God" as a title seems to presuppose the existence and uniqueness of God (else it would be something longer like "Mathematics and Gods" or "Mathematics and Religion" or "Mathematics and the Christian God" or "Mathematical arguments for the existence of God"); that presupposition is a violation of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 16:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

The length an breadth of that article was a big part of the reason people "voted" keep (I say voted because they mostly left the discussion afterwards). This material fit better at <a href="../../../r/e/l/Relationship_between_religion_and_science.html" title="Relationship between religion and science">Relationship between religion and science</a> and elsewhere, and was removed in January per talk page.

<li>Umm, ok. But I'm saying it was expanded, and then the consensus was to deflate, because the material belonged elsewhere. What is left shouldn't be kept. If you think you can write an encyclopedic expansion go ahead. If the article is deleted before you get a chance, you might write it in your user space.

<li>The <i>essay</i> which he links in defense of local interest topics does not carry the weight of a policy or guideline, and therefore has little relevance to this discussion. The only thing intimated by the references is that this is a place where kids from a certain college go to get drunk. Were it not located as it is, doubtless it would lose even that distinction, showing it to be incendental rather than substantive: the same sort of notability as owns the notorious backally in my city where kids from a certain ghetto go to sniff paint stripper. As for the musical performances, it has not been shown, in the larger scheme, that this venue is suitably notable in that respect either. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 04:14, 5 March 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I recognize that it's not policy or a guideline at all. However, it's not even in defense of local interest: <i>"Has The Phyrst been the subject of any reputable publications, demonstrating more than local interest?"</i> seems to indicate to me that GChriss expresses doubt as to the notability of local attractions. I'm with you on this - the only reason I said "weak delete" instead of flat-out "delete" was to leave open the possibility of more notable or significant sources, since I would likely not be surprised if they do in fact exist. — <span style="font-family: Tahoma;"><a href="../../../p/s/u/User%7EPSUMark2006_e6e5.html" title="User:PSUMark2006"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #036;">PSUMark2006</span></a> <a href="../../../p/s/u/User_talk%7EPSUMark2006_44f0.html" title="User talk:PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">talk</span></a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_PSUMark2006_b7c5.html" title="Special:Contributions/PSUMark2006"><span style="color:#69C">contribs</span></a></span> 04:27, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>There is no coverage of this in third-party reliable sources. The only sources cited in the article are either first party, or reference forum posts and other such non-reliable web content. There's not even any indication as to what ingredients produce the effect, and most of the claims about the product seem to be heresay or material culled from the producing company's advertising. The article makes claims that are tantamount to claims of pharmacological efficacy, but there's no confirmation of this by reliable medical journals or such like. In the absense of sufficient coverage, this is not notable. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeranged_bulbasaur_e29c.html" title="User:Deranged bulbasaur">Deranged bulbasaur</a> 19:25, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> Even though the page can be seen as an advertisement for a product, spice is a reasonably common product in the UK. The article is definitely <i>not</i> just an ad, because it contains critical information for example about overdosing and Leonurine. Also, the section about legality is an interesting read. If you think this is just an ad article you must delete <a href="../../../c/o/c/Coca_Cola_060a.html" title="Coca Cola">Coca Cola</a> too... And it's kind of unique and worth mentioning too, because there really aren't all that many legal products out there that claim to mimic the effects of marijuana and that come even close to spice. Now, as for references to support my claims, I'm afraid I can provide none! I say keep and <i>try</i> to find some references but keep in mind that this will be hard due to the nature of the topic. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlex.g_3ad4.html" title="User:Alex.g">Alex.g</a> 18:25, 9 March 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b>. It has gained notablity - I remember seeing it <i>all over the place</i> when looking for a boot CD on my own. Had I been able to find a download link at the time, it's likely this CD would have been able to solve the technical snafu I was having (instead it took about five hours of Google-massage before a working entry leaked out that wasn't spam or crippleware). It seems the "warez" scene is at a disadvantage, as by part of its nature it's near impossible to find what the more overly bureaucratic-minded editors would consider a "reliable source" of information. Once a "reliable source" publishes something about a warez outlet or whathaveyou, it tends to disappear rather rapidly. I believe the standards should be different with something like this, which still serves a useful enough purpose (if memory serves me correctly, it was one of the first "free" boot CDs of any sort, legal or not), and carries a legacy that, even if it's part of the youth-corrupting and profit-killing warez industry, passes notability. --Action Jackson IV 21:24, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It would take some money for some of the problems you can fix with Hiren's Boot CD. I don't think there are freeware alternatives to such things as data recovery. However, there is some freeware on the CD made by hackers, crackers, and freelance developers IIRC. The pirated software I've seen in the CD's list have mostly been in partitioning, data recovery, and antivirus plus the DOS utilities if they aren't from FreeDOS. --- <b><font style="color: #0000AA; text-decoration: none;">Jocke Pirat</font></b> - <small><a href="../../../j/o/c/User_talk%7EJocke_pirat_2f22.html" title="User talk:Jocke pirat">Talk</a>&#160;: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Jocke_pirat_f0d4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Jocke pirat">Contribs</a></small> 21:24, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p><b>Delete</b>. There are no regulations for being a political party in Denmark, anyone can claim it. This group seems to be very small, and is unlikely to get the necessary signatures to stand for elections. I just Googled the group, and see that the group has got some media attention for its extreme racist policy and participation in violent clashes with persons from the left and immigrants. I didn't know about the group, but it is possible notable enough - because of its violent history on the far right scene - to have an article here. In that case it needs to be completely rewritten. Now it reads like an ad. Better delete until then. <a href="../../../b/e/r/User%7EBertilvidet_529b.html" title="User:Bertilvidet">Bertilvidet</a> 21:36, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> I put a number of cleanup tags on this on 22nd February. I was keeping an eye on it to see if anyone did improve it.

<li><b>Keep</b> I did a search for the estate, and true to what was said it is a notorious estate particularly for the death of Rikki Neave . This is backed up by a local police report on crime. I've added a few links and some information. Seems a pity the place has to be notorious for crime - but perhaps some notoriety is better than none! <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 16:33, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> My concern at deleting this article is that information on smaller communitites tends to be entered by local people. For obvious reasons the Welland estate may not be well endowed with the type of people on Wikipedia (although there are a few hoodlums on global warming controversy!) What I'm trying to say, is that if this were a middle class village rather than a city estate it may well have had its own well-written entry. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHaseler_25ad.html" title="User:Haseler">Mike</a> 17:08, 5 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, a desire to have a biographical article is not grounds for deletion, so that desire isn't likely to sway the argument. I suppose you could take Wikipedia to court over privacy concerns, but so far the consensus has been against the subject of an article desiring its deletion getting their wish. As far as the article goes, I don't see a problem with the content, but if you do think there are concerns, you can bring them up on the talk page. Notability, however, is likely to have been met, given the membership in <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Orb_b6b5.html" title="The Orb">The Orb</a> which seems to be a marginally prominent band. <a href="../../../m/i/s/User%7EMister.Manticore_9949.html" title="User:Mister.Manticore">Mister.Manticore</a> 01:24, 5 March 2007 (UTC)

<p>Though a short article may be appropriate, all the tiny bits of information eagerly and meticulously collected by some very focussed fellow wikipedians do not meet the relevant content criteria and in parts violate the subject's privacy, so a discussion regarding <i>fairness of tone</i> or <i>npov</i> is not even requirred – it would strongly be, though, if this article wasn't deleted. -- <a href="../../../n/y/x/User%7ENyxNyx_7cba.html" title="User:NyxNyx">NyxNyx</a> <b>⌘</b> 23:37, 4 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>COMMENT</b> There clearly should be a Wikipedia article for Ellen Simonetti - her experience has highlighted important issues regarding blogging and employment. The article as it stands now (3/7/07) is just fairly pathetic, however - some seem to have launched a hatchet job on Ms. Simonetti. I suggest distilling the article down to the basic facts and then perhaps write protecting the article for a time until things settle down. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 24.41.39.124 (<a href="../../../2/4/2E/User_talk%7E24.41.39.124.html" title="User talk:24.41.39.124">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_24.41.39.124_4327.html" title="Special:Contributions/24.41.39.124">contribs</a>) 13:54, 7 March 2007 (UTC-8)</small></p>

<p>It appears that the subject's problem with the article (which she submitted herself, originally), is that it does not continue to be employed as personal puff piece and mechanism for conducting online sales of the subject's books and other ebay sales. The current form of the article (5 Mar 07, 17:41 GMT) is both factual and relevant. -Not Dilbert</p>

<p>Note from user chulcoop - soory dont konw how to do this any other way to add to the debate.<br />
Nearly all references are to comments made on Ellen Simonetti (aka) Queen of Sky's OWN BLOG.<br />
As she herself put them there then "privacy" issues do not apply<br />
Ellen is an internationally famous fired flight attendedant, her story was shown worldwide.<br />
The first reference was to a BBC News story on her suspension and then her firing.<br />
The first Entry for this item was by the woman Queen Of Sky herself.<br />
On the Shilpa Shetty entry it talks about mafia links, extortion and other things.<br />
If there are specific sources you dont agree with then make that argument.<br />
Is th BBC not a good source, Her own web journal?<br />
Indeed on the BBC site it links to her journal.<br />
I feel this is censorship by fans of hers and it must be stopped.<br />
Keep the page. Check out the references. Read her Blog.<br />
Also if you check out <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm" class="external free" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3974081.stm</a><br />
then on this bbc website it links to her blog (Queen of The Sky but she calls it queen of sky) mentions her name Ellen Simoetti<br />
There is a BBC source what more do you want? Additional by ch: also if you do a google search <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti" class="external free" title="http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.co.uk/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLG,GGLG:2005-48,GGLG:en&amp;q=ellen+simonetti</a> then you will find lots of news articles about her case. She has also appeared on Elder,Montel and Talkradio and given lots of TV appearances. Some of these, including Montel and Talkradio can be found on her blog at <a href="http://queenofsky.net" class="external free" title="http://queenofsky.net" rel="nofollow">http://queenofsky.net</a> (also the same as <a href="http://queenofsky.journalspace.com" class="external free" title="http://queenofsky.journalspace.com" rel="nofollow">http://queenofsky.journalspace.com</a>) On her blog she has even set up an email address she has asked the media to write to if they want to "book" her. As stated if you scrap this entry for puttin unwanted truths in you must also scrap the shilpa shetty article for stories about racism, shilpa poppadom, shilpa fuckawala [sic], an apparent indecency complaint and other things. If you dont you are a hypocrite. I have provided sources for all things stated. The SWDYM site i have also linked to the Terms and Conditions on their website. What more do you want? QofS has gone out of her way to promote herself in the media,in fact she wants as much media work as she can get. So why should you censor a Public Figure? Also she has written a hardback novel which is on amazon about her firing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1" class="external free" title="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Ellen%20Simonetti&amp;page=1</a><br />

<li><b>Comment</b>: Points and accusation listed in the article may well be „true“, but they go far beyond the scope of relevancy. An encyclopaedic lemma should not prepare a law suit but restrain itself to give the more important facts.<br />

<p>reply by chulcoop. I am new to wikipedia so hope you will be understanding in this.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilpa_Shetty</a></p>
<p>Please, just do it. If you think the contenet there is relevant then why is mine not? I talks about exact words said during a british TV show and as i said talks about popadoms and someone being called a "cunt". Check out the entry for yourself.</p>
<p>If you dont want to then why not? Why do you only want to police Ellen Simonetti, who is afterall just a fired flight attendant rather than allegations about the former British Miss England, an Indian film actress and a pop singer in the UK?</p>
<p>In the latter, the British Prime Minister was involoved, the Indian Government were involved, the British Chancellor was involved, the Indian Film company was involved, an efigy was burned in India.</p>
<p>Allow the good and the bad. It is a topic ABOUT someone based on articles THE SUBJECT has written.</p>
<p>Why do you care? If it is true what is the problem?</p>
<p>Ellen aka QofS was in worldwide news about 2 to 3 years ago. She did lots of interviews. If you check out her website and look at the "famous fired pics" you may even remember the story.</p>
<p>If anything i did was infactual fine.</p>
<p>But dont allow the Shilpa Shetty entry to remain intact while moaning about this one.</p>

<p>COMMENT</p>
<p>chulcoop's words above reveal his/her true intention: to assault and harras rather than inform. For example, chulcoop purposefully distorts the content found on the referenced advertiser. In truth, the site is an adult matchmaking site that allows adult content to be posted within a user's profile. By claiming it is a hardcore "porn" site chulcoop is distoring reality at the expense of Wikipedia's credibility.</p>
<p>The entry at hand should be rolled back to its most nuetral entry. chulcoop is free to continue seeking his/her agenda elsewhere. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 67.83.176.54 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_67.83.176.54_b484.html" title="Special:Contributions/67.83.176.54">contribs</a>) 06:24, 5 March 2007 (UTC-8)</small></p>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Strong Delete</b> She does seem just about notable, although it is very marginal, but starting your own article is a no-no and if we don't follow this there will be a free-for-all. If someone independent wanted to re-create an article about her, with proper refs (not to her blog or any others) then it might well survive. but not this one. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 23:39, 5 March 2007 (UTC) I am amending my vote to Strong Delete in the light of the excessive amount of comment by Chulcoop which goes well beyond what is reasonable in an AfD debate and risks disrupting the process. If we allow this sort of thing the whole of WikiPedia will degenerate into farce. And yes <a href="../../../b/l/p/WP%7EBLP_e1f5.html" title="WP:BLP">no-one can create their own Wikipedia article</a> not even The Queen of England. <a href="../../../n/b/e/User%7ENBeale_6ecb.html" title="User:NBeale">NBeale</a> 09:46, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, a public person generally cannot make a page about themselves. If you "broke" the "story" about the website, and you are currently battling with her, then you too are have a <a href="../../../c/o/i/WP%7ECOI_9b98.html" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> and should not be editing the page. As it is, you are subverting Wikipedia for your own petty squabbles. If you "broke" the "porn" scoop, then you are aperforming <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> which also not allowed. We absolutely positively cannot take your word for any of these statements, and we have no reliable proof that a single thing you have said is true. As it stands, the only thing we can ascertain at this point is that you are here clearly pushing a very baised agenda. Please stop, and take your dispute elsewhere. There are plenty of websites that offer free blogs and hosting where you can post any fact or rumor that you dare. I remain convinced that this is a notable subject, but I'm not going to cry if it gets deleted. I do recommend that the closing admin consider <a href="../../../s/a/l/WP%7ESALT_ca07.html" title="WP:SALT">salting</a> as well, as Chulchoop has already stated that he is willing to re-create the article again with sockpuppets if he has to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEllen_Simonetti&amp;diff=112682914&amp;oldid=112681522" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AArticles_for_deletion%2FEllen_Simonetti&amp;diff=112682914&amp;oldid=112681522" rel="nofollow">[89]</a>. - <a href="../../../c/o/s/User%7ECosmicPenguin_d36b.html" title="User:CosmicPenguin">CosmicPenguin</a> (<a href="../../../c/o/s/User_talk%7ECosmicPenguin_ed60.html" title="User talk:CosmicPenguin">Talk</a>) 02:51, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>STRONG DELETE</b> Unfortunately it is now clear this marginal entry should be deleted.

<p>comment by chulcoop</p>
<p>the entry Heather Armstrong</p>
<p>is also just an article about a famous fired blogger.</p>
<p>If her page can exist why not this one?</p>
<p>There must be consistency on Wikipedia and peeps need to know the truth.</p>
<p>COMMENT While each entry must stand on its own merits, the Heather Armstrog entry is distinquishable from the Ellen Simonetti entry as the Armstrong entry is not repleat with harrassing edits from an unethical, self-serviing maniac who has no regard for the Wikipedia rules. Here, the Siminetti entry would be fine if it was limited to a nuetral presentation of relevant facts. Unfortunately, the barely literate chulcoop insists on inserting drivel, minutia and distortions. 68.245.197.0 03:18, 7 March 2007 (UTC)</p>
<p>note from chulcoop</p>
<p>OK then. It is all tidied up now I think. Someone can possibly improve on the spelling and Grammar.</p>
<p>Her entry is now similar to that of Heather Armstrong.</p>
<p>Shame you guys dont like having facts when the Shilpa Shetty entry alleges links to the mafia and other stuff.</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference? Why has that entry not marked for deletion? It talks about "cunts" and "fukawalas" and other things.</p>
<p>Please explain the discrepency.</p>
<p>Is it cos one is indian and the other is a yankee?</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b> - thank you - the article is much better now. There is still some cleanup to be had, but we can take care of that with tags. Everybody who&#160;!voted delete, please review and reconsider your vote on the cleaned up and netural article with regards to <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. Chulcoop - please note the extensive list of references at the bottom of the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shilpa_Shetty_564b.html" title="Shilpa Shetty">Shilpa Shetty</a> article - most references are to a mainstream news site in India and the UK, and every single one is to a website with some sort of editorial oversight. This is different then a personal blog where an individual may post anything they wish, true or false, without any sort of editorial control. Just because something gets posted on a blog, does not mean it is true.

<p>note from chulcoop</p>
<p>Wik rules state however that a subjects own blog CAN BE USED AS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF THE SUBJECT.</p>
<p>I was trying to point out things that Subject had said on their blog with the source being the Subjects blogs.</p>
<p>Blogs are not generally considered reliable souces but if it is the Subjects Own Blog then this is different.</p>
<p>Somewhere on here of discussion i provided a wik link to prove this.</p>
<p>But ive had enough.</p>
<p>You can read about "Wogs" on a terry wogan entry and as i said on the shilpa entry.</p>
<p>All i was doing was stating fact as sourced on the subjects own blog.</p>
<p>I think you need to understand the difference between general blogs and a subject's official blog.</p>
<p>Wik rules state that subjects own blog should override any other evidence unless the latter is clearly over self promotion.</p>
<p>DOnt blame me thats what wik rules state.</p>
<p>I wanted to try and provide a balanced view esp as i read about fukawalas popadoms and cunts on Shilpa Shetty.</p>
<p>maybe different editors have differing views of what should be on here.</p>
<p>Some are more traditionalist and think this should be like the enc britanica others think more modern and honest sourced comments and minutae for example cunts and shilpa derupa is acceptble.</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> As Epstein says, and has been said many times, full professors at research universities are N, having passed several external reviews by experts for their notability in the profession. We don't establish notability in WP, we see if the profession has established notability. -- This doesn't apply to every college, but it does to major research universities and Chicago certainly has long been at the very the highest level of US universities in Economics.

<li><b>Comment</b>, sorry to be slightly snappy about this one, but no matter if the person is notable or not there are no reliable second party sources anywhere (the link to the university web site is not a second party source, but one that is associated with the person) in this article.

The articles are subscription-only, so I didn't read them, but from the snippets from Google it appears that they also document significant notability beyond the professorship itself.

<dd>Yes, I'm sure David is already aware of this. You seem to be confusing the issue of sourcing and deleting content with deletion of articles themselves.

<dd>The point is the only thing that is attributable is that Kaplan is a professor and that he has several publications, the rest of the article should go. That would also mean that it is sourced i.a.w. WP:ATT and WP:BPL and there would be no problem keeping it.

</dl>
<p>First, somehow I got confused with ATT and BLP, we are talking BLP now:</p>
<p>(quote) Wikipedia articles must be based on reliable sources (unquote)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(quote) Biographies of living people must be written conservatively and with due regard to the subject's privacy. (unquote)</p>
<p>There we have notability where it claims:</p>
<p>In 2001, he was Visiting Professor at NSEAD, in Fontainbleau, France. He is a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research ... Sources?</p>
<p>References to his jobs as Editor ... sources&#160;?</p>
<p>Teachings, sources?</p>
<p>So far with my references problem.</p>
<p>Additional, why is the Family section relevant? Why is there a link to his family's website? are we Myspace or something?</p>
<p>I am not trying to be a Prick, but these are concerns that have to be addressed and most probably the cause for this article to be nominated for AfD to start with. <a href="../../../a/l/f/User%7EAlf_photoman_ad72.html" title="User:Alf photoman"><font face="Amazone BT">Alf</font><font face="Aldine401 BT" size="2"><sup>Photoman</sup></font></a> 00:23, 6 March 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd><a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> says that self-published sources may be used for non-contentious material about the source itself. Most or all of the content here may be sourced in this way from Kaplan's two web sites. If you have some reason for believing that this policy does not apply because some of this material may be contentious (I ask this of you a third time: what if anything in here is contentious?) then much of the professional activity is also sourced at <a href="http://catalogues.uchicago.edu/gsb-folder/gsb0607.pdf" class="external free" title="http://catalogues.uchicago.edu/gsb-folder/gsb0607.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://catalogues.uchicago.edu/gsb-folder/gsb0607.pdf</a></dd>
<dd><s>Re the family information: it's not a basis for notability, so I don't know why we're discussing it here, but are you arguing that biographies of all persons should be stripped of anything that does not directly relate to their notability? For instance, should we remove birth and death dates?</s> On second thought, the family info was quite inane. I removed it. —<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDavid_Eppstein_0880.html" title="User:David Eppstein">David Eppstein</a> 01:16, 6 March 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Well, instead of having this fight all that was necessary is to add that link to the article and bingo... no problem.
