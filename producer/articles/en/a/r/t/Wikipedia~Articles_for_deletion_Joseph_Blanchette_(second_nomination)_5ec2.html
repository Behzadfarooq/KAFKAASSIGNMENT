<p>A Flash animator, of which there is no shortage, article replete with "famous for" and "popular" but scores &lt;20k ghits, re-creation of subject previously deleted at <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Joseph_Blanchette_1b21.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joseph Blanchette">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Joseph Blanchette</a> (puppetry in evidence), but this article had a parallel existence at Legendary Frog.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> Legendary Frog is one of the most noticeable Flash Animators out there. If you think there are other Flash animators out there worth a page then make it.

<li><small>Keep it: Legendary frog is truly a legend, his animations have marked a new meaning for animation on the canvas known as the internet. His parodys are funny.

<li><b>Don't Delete</b> More people have heard about Legendary Frog than Andrew Dice, but he still gets an article. Joseph Blanchette has a forum with thousands of fan members. I think he's worthy of note, especially if someone wants to build the entry. It's not like we're asking the administrators to make it. There's nothing detrimental about this page. It's informative. If you can give Leeroy Jenkins, and All Your Base Are Belong to Us a page, then Legendary Frog is enough of an Internet success to include too. Yeah I know this is a second vote, but I had more to say, and I like to have the last laugh.

<li><b>Keep but rename?</b>. I side with the opinions so far that he <i>is</i> one of the more well-known Flash artists. But.. would this article stand better under the name "Legendary Frog" as opposed to Joseph Blanchette? Like the Homestar Runner article is "Homestar Runner," not "The Brothers Chaps." --<a href="../../../c/r/i/User%7ECrisu_ca1c.html" title="User:Crisu">Crisu</a> 02:54, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I think it's ridiculous to delete Legendary Frog's entry, he used to be really really big and his movies have been watched many many times and had a large impact on a large part of the flash community. I don't understand why EVERY SINGLE WEB COMIC EVER MADE, for example "pixel comics" with no creative value whatsoever and without much notibility can have an entry (I don't remember the names but they are indeed plentiful) when one of the most influentious flash animators can not? I don't think every flash artist should have an entry (I just voted "Delete" for Fredthemonkey.com) but the most famous should definately have a page. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 14:59, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> it's not "&lt;20k ghits" like the nominator suggests but more than 25,000 on "Legendary Frog", furthermore, a "LegendaryFrog" OR "Legendary Frog" gives 48,700 hits. I think the previous voters, obviously misinformed, should all re-consider their votes.

<ul>
<li>He is a flash animator but he's definately among the more famous ones. Why discriminate against flash animators but allow every single web comics, many probably seen by much much fewer people than LF's movies? Also, it's not about his homepage and where it may be hosted but about his movies, only posted on NG because he hasn't allowed them to be uploaded elsewhere. If he had, I bet they'd be over the entire web by now.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:08, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Here's some evidence of his notability, except for the fact that he gets 50,000 hits on google, his original cartoon <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/70212" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/70212" rel="nofollow">All Your Pie</a> has been viewed 600,000 times, another original, [<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/135265" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/135265" rel="nofollow">Kerri's big invention</a> almost 700,000 times. A selection of his video game parodies come in at 2,700 000 hits (<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/58184" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/58184" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>), 1,500 000 hits (<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/169933" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/169933" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>), 800,000 hits (<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/64772" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/64772" rel="nofollow">[4]</a>), his most viewed Lord of the Rings spoof is 1,400 000 hits(<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/88286" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/88286" rel="nofollow">[5]</a>), and generally, his many other movies have been watched somewhere in the range of 400,000-1,000 000 times. This is probably more than some television shows. He's been active since at least 2002 (the date his most popular Final Fantasy spoof was released) so there's no novelty factor to his name, there's no "he's not big enough now but might be later" (IMO). <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:24, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I just realised his movies can be viewed at <a href="http://www.ugoplayer.com" class="external text" title="http://www.ugoplayer.com" rel="nofollow">UGOPlayer</a>] as well, where his movies have been watched a grand total of 7,104,423 times (at time of writing). Come on people, be reasonable.<a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 03:39, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Here's a list of all web comics with their own articles on Wikipedia: [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_webcomics" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_webcomics" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>]. How many is that, a hundred?? I question that more than a handful of them are more known than Legendary Frog. If Legendary Frog had been half as known as he is and made comics with the same themes as his animations, then he would DEFINATELY be on that list. Can anybody explain why this is fair? <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 08:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> LegendaryFrog's highest listing appears at 52 on Newgrounds' <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/list.php?which=top50" class="external text" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/list.php?which=top50" rel="nofollow">top 50</a> in user votes. <a href="../../../f/a/g/User%7EFagstein_330b.html" title="User:Fagstein">Fagstein</a> 22:40, 20 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That list is VERY fickle and changes a lot every single week (in favour of new submissions), and LegendaryFrog actually holds the record of most movies in the top 50 at one time (<a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/20" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.newgrounds.com/ngmag/devspot/spotlight/20" rel="nofollow">[7]</a>(. That said, I'm not saying the list is the basis for the inclusion, not at all, it has literalyl NOTHING to do with him. I am not saying Legendary Frog should be included because of quality, but because of notability. Also, could somebody PLEASE explain why we keep all the webcomics but delete this? I'm still waiting for a response. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 03:32, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Very well known. He's a well respected flash artist and his name has been able to make many a flash movie noteworthy. To exclude him would cause a large upset among his fan base. In example of this would be someone such as Fred the Monkey who has made a flash showing his anger at Wikipedia for putting his entry on the cutting block.--68.102.189.69 02:45, 21 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It's completely irrelevant whether his fanbase would be upset or not, that has nothing to do with the purpose of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMackan_e4e7.html" title="User:Mackan">Mackan</a> 03:32, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I may be incorrect, but my understanding is that the purpose of an encyclopedia is to give information. That is what this page does.

<ul>
<li>I agree, but there's a big difference between Ted Smith from Boise, and Legendary Frog who has tons of fans. He's well known in the online community. If he has fans dedicated enough to make this page, then there is no reason this article should be deleated. I agree that not everything deserves a Wikipedia entry, but Legendary Frog is well known enough, and talented enough to earn one.</li>
