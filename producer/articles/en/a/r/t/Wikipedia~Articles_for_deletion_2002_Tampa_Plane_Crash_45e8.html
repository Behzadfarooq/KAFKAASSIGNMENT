<li>Possible <b>merge</b>, and I wouldn't call it completely non-notable. I actually remember this event being on the news. It's probably not worthy of its own article, due to lack of much occurring, but what about having Plane crashes in Florida or Plane crashes in 2002 for this sort of purpose? There is some decent information there, and if it's deleted then the info is gone.

<li><b>Strong Delete All</b> These plane crashes are utterly non-notable from an encyclopedic point of view. The reasoning that these subjects should have their own article "because it reminded people of 9/11" means that 9/11 is encyclopedically notable and not these incidents. Wikipedia is not a news report database, and as I keep saying, there are many stories (even ones which receive worldwide coverage which people in Scotland hear about) in the news media that are <b>not</b> encyclopedically notable. Widespread media coverage is <b>not</b> guarantee of notability. This is not the the myth of <a href="../../../i/c/a/Icarus.html" title="Icarus">Icarus</a>. These incidents were of substantially less consequence than, for instance, the <a href="../../../c/a/v/Cavalese_cable-car_disaster.html" title="Cavalese cable-car disaster">1998 USMC/Italian cable car disaster</a> or the <a href="../../../c/h/i/Chinook_Helicopter_Crash_%281994%29_4ac5.html" title="Chinook Helicopter Crash (1994)">1994 RAF Chinook crash on the Mull of Kintyre</a>. These were not large scale air disasters, but they both had serious long-lasting effects on much broader and vital contexts (US-Italian relations in the first instance, and the British counter-terrorism in Northern Ireland in the second). The two crashes in this afd did not. Will the general public care much about the two afd incidents in 100 yrs time or even 10 yrs time? Some people seem to want to put everything that's reported in the news media in wikipedia, but that's not what an encyclopedia is for.

<li><b>Comment</b>, notability or non-notability of these incidents is merely a matter of opinion. Sorry, but Bwithh has made a very compelling argument. These plane crashes have no demonstrated long-term effect or impact even 4 years after they happened. There is no reason to believe they will have more impact or "notability" as time progresses.--<a href="../../../i/s/o/User%7EIsotope23_35fd.html" title="User:Isotope23">Isotope23</a> 17:49, 4 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>'<b>Comment</b>, there are lots of articles on this encyclopedia that have no long term effects even after four years.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I remember hearing about this when it happened. Nothing has reminded me of it until today. It had no long term impact- or even a short term impact. It was forgotten within a couple of weeks. It remided people of 9/11? A toy plane hitting a wooden block tower would as well.

<li>Both of these incidents made international news at the time because they occurred not very long after 9/11/01, and because both of them involved planes crashing into buildings.</li>
<li>Small plane crashes do occur every day, but <i><b>plane crashes into buildings are quite rare</b></i>, which makes these incidents more notable than they would otherwise be.</li>
<li>As <a href="../../../p/r/e/User%7EPresN_40fd.html" title="User:PresN">PresN</a> has stated, nothing much happened so their importance as news was transient, and they have been forgotten by most of us. The articles seem to overemphasize the importance of the events.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, they are verifiable events, uncommon in nature, and remarkable for their timing—so that's a reason to keep, possibly trim them down a bit, and maybe merge them.</li>

<li>If the Tampa crash article was named "2002 teenager crashes small plane into a tower", then I'd remember it without clicking.

<li><b>Comment</b>, Both of these crashes are notable since they (again) arouse fears of another september 11th style attack and fears of terrorists using small airplanes as wepons, the security of airspace over a major city and security of small aircarft which is always the case in the post 9/11 world. <a href="../../../s/t/o/User%7EStorm05_96b4.html" title="User:Storm05">Storm05</a> 17:51, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
