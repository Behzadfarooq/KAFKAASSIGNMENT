<p>The result of the debate was <b>MERGE</b> to <i>La Salle College</i>. I do not think that having <i>every single</i> reference to an article neither in the article nor in English is meeting <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. This is the English Wikipedia, and as it stands it is impossible for most people in the world who choose to read this article to verify its contents. One or two of the sources even require registration! However, AGF says that the sources say what it is claimed they do and this only barely touches the two-thirds level, so I think a smerge to the school is probably enough. I'm just going to redirect and leave the merge to someone else from the history; painful detail about the headteachers upbringing would not work well in that article, nor would much more than a mention in the infobox. -<a href="../../../s/p/l/User%7ESplash_a61b.html" title="User:Splash">Splash</a><small><sup><a href="../../../s/p/l/User_talk%7ESplash_3435.html" title="User talk:Splash">talk</a></sup></small> 22:43, 6 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: The principal of one of the ten most famous schools in Hong Kong is more than enough of a notable person to be mentioned here. Moreover, the article is in this current non-neutral state only because it has received heavy vandalism from people against Paul Lau, which are anonymous users. If these vandalism materials are being reverted, the article is certainly neutral in general. The current state of the article without a biography section, is only a transitional state as if many other comprehensively-written biographies were at their early weeks. I believe with this proposal of deletion rejected, the article will certainly receive improvement and expansion. As an experienced editor on Wikipedia and a person who knows Paul Lau in real life, I'm certain that I can expand the contents of this article while keeping it neutral, provided that it's not being deleted right here. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 13:43, 27 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, as per Deryck C., I do not agree that the article is not notable. In fact, a number of principals of the schools under the category <a href="../../../s/e/c/Category%7ESecondary_schools_in_Hong_Kong_36cc.html" title="Category:Secondary schools in Hong Kong">Secondary schools in Hong Kong</a> have their own article.

<li><b>Delete</b> as not notable or significant. The school of which he is principal, <a href="../../../l/a/_/La_Salle_College_a869.html" title="La Salle College">La Salle College</a>, does seem notable. This is <i>not</i> the same as making him <i>independently</i> significant or notable; at most he deserves a mention in La Scalle's article.

<dd>With the school's fame, Paul Lau often appears on newspapers in Hong Kong. This give him enoughly significant importance to have an article, according to the rule stating <i>Persons achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events</i> on <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a>. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 01:18, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> - I would be delighted to reverse my opinion if you can provide verifiable sources for your assertion Lau has achieved "renown or notoriety" via newspapers in Hong Kong.

<dd>Comment: Sources supplied below. I would be happy to provide on request translations of the Chinese sources cited below. On the other hand, even if this article is to be deleted, <i>speedy</i> delete/merge doesn't seem to be an option because the article has been existent since December 2005. Speedy is only applicable to new articles. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 16:22, 2 March 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I must admit that I can't read Chinese and the scmp.com references require me to subscribe/pay for access, so I can't use the sources (that have been kindly provided) to verify Lau's notability.</dd>
<dd>It might also be interesting to note that there is no article about, for example, Anthony Little, the Head Master of <a href="../../../e/t/o/Eton_College_8864.html" title="Eton College">Eton College</a> (a notable English school).</dd>
<dd>Finally, I do think the best place for verifiable sources is within the article itself. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 18:52, 2 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>My comment about Anthony Little is that he definitely deserves an article. He doesn't have one just because nobody wants to do this, perhaps tedious, job. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 08:33, 3 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Final comment: As most users proposing a "delete" stated that they would reverse their vote if verifiable sources are provided and those sources are already stated above, there is no point to delete the article. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 14:27, 4 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd>You may retain your "delete" because it's up to your own choice, but <i>you cannot verify the sources</i> doesn't mean <i>the sources are non-verifiable</i>. <a href="../../../d/e/r/User%7EDeryck_Chan_2dc3.html" title="User:Deryck Chan"><font color="brown">De</font></a><a href="../../../d/e/r/User_talk%7EDeryck_Chan_4045.html" title="User talk:Deryck Chan"><font color="green">ryc</font><font color="#007DFF">k C.</font></a> 07:01, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>One even more unreasonable point concerning your action is that you don't know how to read Chinese, but before you ask for help in translation or verification of the sources you conclude that you cannot confirm Lau's notability. There are many many Wikipedians who are neutral about this issue and knows how to read Chinese, such as <a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> or <a href="../../../j/i/a/User%7EJiang_5faa.html" title="User:Jiang">Jiang</a>. They can act as neutral adjudicators in this dispute.

<dd>I asked for a source to verify the article's content. None was provided. (The article still lacks any references, by the way). Sources were, however, provided for those who could read Chinese and/or were willing to pay for the information. I was very careful in phrasing my subsequent comment, in that <i>I</i> couldn't verify the article's content. Then you declared that I had verified the content; when I commented on this incorrect assertion you declare me to be "unreasonable". This does not seem terribly polite. I am entitled to a viewpoint, however incorrect you might deem it to be. <a href="../../../s/l/i/User%7ESliggy_825f.html" title="User:Sliggy">Sliggy</a> 16:36, 5 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I know that I might be a bit impolite, but please note the fact that Microtony and I provided sources. It's your problem not knowing how to read Chinese.
