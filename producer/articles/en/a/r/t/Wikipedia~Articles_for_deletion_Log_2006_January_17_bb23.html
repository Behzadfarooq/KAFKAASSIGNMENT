<li>However, he's done more than just MLVWM. Is he had, I would say merge, but since he has done other stuff, which can't go on the MLVWM page, it needs its own page.

<li>People, seriously. Ever looked at <a href="../../../n/o/t/Wikipedia%7ENotability_%28people%29_893d.html" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability_(people)</a>? And have you looked at the article?? A very short bio on a Japanese guy who wrote some source code for a mac app when he was a student in <b>1998</b> and collaborated on some kind of cable. Notable? BachRach, fair do's for defending the little guys but is this Wikipedia or The Online Mega Web Directory of Absolutely Everything in the Whole World Ever? You know the answer. If the things he created are notable then they should mention who created them. And my final word on the subject, this is from my talk page by the author of the article: "Thanks for the link to the guide on Notable subjects.

<p>This article remains completely unverified. At the last AFD (which was "no consensus") some felt there hadn't been enough opportunity for verification. Some votes were conditioned on verifiability. All agree verification is required. So, hopefully there will be consensus this time. I am hoping we can keep the discussion to the topic of verifiability, as that's something everybody agrees is required (no point in a rehash of the usual school debate).

<li>Comment: It's probably not necessary, but I'll recap the history, and issues:
<ul>
<li>The article was created on September 3, 2005</li>
<li>The article was first AFD'd on January 3, 2006. This was also the first day is was tagged as "unverified", making some feel there was no proper attempt at verification. However, there's been ample time since then.</li>
<li>Only two sources exist to show the school exists: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/geniushomeschool/" class="external text" title="http://www.geocities.com/geniushomeschool/" rel="nofollow">the school's own web site</a>, which is a free web host; and <a href="http://www.deshijobs.com/view_emp_job2.php?userid=6307&amp;PHPSESSID=8fdfafbbf150daa25500092f59b43fed" class="external text" title="http://www.deshijobs.com/view_emp_job2.php?userid=6307&amp;PHPSESSID=8fdfafbbf150daa25500092f59b43fed" rel="nofollow">a couple job adds like this</a>, on a site which anybody can make an add themselves.</li>
<li>The school's own web site gives contradictory info on what grades they teach. It's not clear if they teach up to grade or eight, or wish to do so.</li>
<li>The creator of the article has a user name, that's remarkably similiar to own of the school's owners names, suggesting self promotion.</li>
<li>The creator of the article was asked two weeks ago to provide verification, and has not responded.</li>
<li>Finally, there is not even a claim this school is licensed, and could be a fly-by-night operation. There's no truly independent verificaiton of existence. --<a href="../../../t/h/i/User%7EThivierr_c8ff.html" title="User:Thivierr">Rob</a> 03:06, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't see how this can be considered unverifiable. The article states: "Genius Home Collegiate School is a website that claims to be for a school which opened in 2005 in the Mirpur-10 Senpara Parbota Area of Dhaka, Bangladesh.". If you go to the website linked, you can see for yourself that that is indeed exactly what it claims to be. Now, as to whether or not that claim is correct is open to question--however, the article does not make the claim that the website's claim is correct; it simply states that the website makes that claim. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 22:59, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>In which case, wouldn't this then fall under the realm of the <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> guidelines, which it would also appear to fail?. -- <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESaberwyn_4405.html" title="User:Saberwyn">Saberwyn</a> - The <a href="../../../z/o/i/Zoids.html" title="Zoids"><font color="blue">Zoids</font></a> Expansion Project 23:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Everything that exists is worthy of inclusion; everything for which verifiable information is present should have an article. It's clear that this website exists; it's also clear that verifiable information about the website is available (all you have to do is go to the website itself); therefore, it should have an article. <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 23:23, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Would you then support putting all their claims about themselves back in, so long as it was still qualified with "They claim" (or to be more accurate, "someone claiming to be on the staff of this self-proclaimed school claims")? Because an article that does nothing but repeat the subject's claims about itself is called an 'advert'. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 23:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly would, and your last sentence is incorrect. It is only an advertisement if it is done with the purpose of promoting the subject--the key thing here being "purpose". <a href="../../../k/m/w/User%7EKmweber_6c59.html" title="User:Kmweber">Kurt Weber</a> 00:19, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No doubt they're <i>accidentally</i> promoting themselves. So we have an article, which once we've pared away the non-verifiable, simply repeats what's on a webpage -- meaning that the article is a webpage repeating another webpage. Congratulations, you've once again mistaken the map for the territory:
<ul>
<li><i>In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography</i> - "On Exactitude in Science" by <a href="../../../j/o/r/Jorge_Luis_Borges_2dc9.html" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Comment: This is a school article, not a web site article. Let's keep in mind the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genius_Home_Collegiate_School&amp;oldid=28396168" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Genius_Home_Collegiate_School&amp;oldid=28396168" rel="nofollow">original version</a>. Now, a couple editors (including me) removed as much unverifiable information as was possible. This wasn't done to save the article, but to avoid wantonly/knowingly spreading misinformation. I'm frankly a little PO'd that my good-faith attempt to avoid lies being spread, has been twisted into attempts to keep this article. This was actually used to justify the last "no consensus (keep)" result. Editors should be able to remove unverified claims, without it causing bogus articles to be kept.

<li><b>Comments</b>. With due respect to all who have taken great pain to read the page or visited the school site and put their comments to keep or delete. I'll not put any request. However, I'd like to add that whatever was written in the school page was true - no less, no more. It's true that the school is not famous or very old. However, the school committee is trying to develop it as a low cost sustainable model for better education to the local cummunity. The school is not set to make big money. Besides academic activities, the school have successfully arranged several rounds of polio imunization and health check-ups for students and all the members of their families (all free of charge) and several fairs in its second year. This has been appreciated by all the people living in the community. In recognition to this, this school was placed in record by Prothom Alo, the most popular daily in Bangladesh, as one of the mentinable institutes of Mirpur, Dhaka (please see Prothom Alo <a href="http://www.prothom-alo.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.prothom-alo.com" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>, in Noksha, 25 July 2006). I'm really sorry if I have done a big upset to wikipedia. I'd rather suggest other renowned schools of Bangladesh to come forward and put information about their institutions. 09:07, 04 December 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Removed "vote for me" language from the article. In general I'd like to see candidates included, but could not find anything on google. Many local papers have poor web presence, so this doesn't mean his campaign hasn't been covered, only that it's not online.

Now if it were saying "rumor is this movie is being planned..." then yeah, crystal ball issues.

<li>Everything is possible, but one should be cautious about such a charge. The user you accused, tried, unsuccesfully to upload an image they took from imdb. Now, her agency has a good quality image of her, which they could easily have used, and would wish to use. They wouldn't need to take one from imdb (who have protection that causes the resulting image to be corrupt, see Image:Summer.gif). After all, its probably the agency that supplied imdb. If the agency "got it right" for imdb, they would get it right here.

<p>Ok. Later. I'm going to bed. I'll see your (Fair) decision in the morning. But yeah, I'm 18. If you're going by notability here, how much notability do you expect me to have amassed in the film industry in a mere 18 years?

<p><b>Drinicomment</b>Ok, I see this is becoming ugly, so I encourage both of you to take a break. Some friendly reminders:</p>
<ol>
<li>AFD is not a vote, the result isn't decided by the number of votes on each side. It's decided by arguments, so everyone state their case, let other people ocmment, and wait until the period closes. Attacking or criticizing other people's opinions isn't going to change the procedure nor it's likely to help each cause.</li>
<li>Entries aren't "owned", so it's not "my biography" or "your biography". Spikejonze, if you wrote an entry about yourself, please go and read <a href="../../../a/u/t/Wikipedia%7EAutobiography_dc44.html" title="Wikipedia:Autobiography">Wikipedia:Autobiography</a> to see if this entry fits, and if not, make the changes to improve it so it fits the criteria and you'll have a strong case about this.</li>
</ol>
<p>And now a friendly warning: If I see anybody else attacking or namecalling (or other things mentioned on <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>) I'll have to put some blocks her and there.

<p>Yet another non-notable podcast (Alexa rank: 1,297,463). <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Case_1b0d.html" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> 05:41, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As one of the hosts of this podcast, I take a bit of offense at it being called non-notable. It is currently ranked #79 out of nearly 12,000 podcasts on Podcast Alley. Last month it made it to #41. As to whether it is deleted or not, I don't particularly care. One of our listeners put the article up, and it doesn't seem to violate any of the 4 reasons for deletion listed in the Wikipedia deletion rules. It exists, it is verifiable, there is nothing currently in the article that shows any bias, and since it is released under Creative Commons, nothing about the podcast or any mention of it violates any copyright. I don't seem to recall "the opinion of one user of Wikipedia who finds the article irrelevant" being listed in the rules for deletion section. --Chuck Tinsley, Co-Host <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 12.218.115.252 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_12.218.115.252_6355.html" title="Special:Contributions/12.218.115.252">contribs</a>).</small></p>

<p><b>Holy Father</b><br />
I would like to nominate the article <a href="../../../h/o/l/Holy_Father_eebd.html" title="Holy Father">Holy Father</a> for undeletion review or at least I would like a stub to be made for the article for Holy Father. The rcc's pope is only "Holy Father" to at least some rcc members, but not to everyone. Redirecting automatically to a their pope is not NPOV and more would agree if more knew about what was going on here. The article was doing fine for some months before TCC/Csernica blindside afd'd and had support from "other" people that didn't have much to do with the article. TCC/Csernica could have discussed about the page instead of afd'ing.</p>
<p>I would like the article to be protected from being redirected exclusively to their pope. I would think some people would like to know the history of the original use and the rcc title. --<a href="../../../j/e/o/User%7EJeolmeun_40df.html" title="User:Jeolmeun">jeolmeun</a> 07:36, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li>Please allow the page to remain for 30 days while the Wiki Software is ported. The site does function--it simply has little content at this time. Although the site may not have many matches on Google the matches it does have are ranked very high. In fact, when searching for GetOutOfJailFree the site is mentioned in the second result on the first of eight pages of results. I do not understand the statement about a "bad feeling." Yes, it may flop but we here at GetOutOfJailFree do hope that the site does make headlines. In fact, the article does NOT state that this is a "new site." This site is not new--it was started in September of 2004. Thank you for your consideration.- <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanKilo_559e.html" title="User:DanKilo">User:DanKilo</a>

<li>A note, if the site has been around that long, I would expect more websites to link to it.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This is a fairly well know and long running mathematical website which has a useful focus for educational mathematics.

<li><b>Keep</b> per Salix alba and Edgar181. I fully agree with Halidecyphon that we should not "copy every tech magazine's annual "best of the web" to wikipedia", but sometimes stuff gets selected for a good reason, and sometimes nobody's documented importance in other ways and such an award is the first verifiable distinction that gets added. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 20:37, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep.</b> A well-known and respected educational website, very frequently linked to from Wikipedia articles.

<li>I'd like to qualify my comment a bit. I think my conclusion that WP:WEB would be wrong if <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cut-the-knot.html" title="Cut-the-knot">Cut-the-knot</a> didn't satisfy it, is incorrect; the proper conclusion is that WP:WEB does not apply in this case. As a guideline, WP:WEB need not apply in all cases. Furthermore, I agree there is a problem of "webcruft" and I see Halidecyphon's nomination as an commendable effort to get rid of it. The nomination may have been a mistake in this particular instance but that is not so easy to determine for an outsider. -- <a href="../../../j/i/t/User%7EJitse_Niesen_c0c4.html" title="User:Jitse Niesen">Jitse Niesen</a> (<a href="../../../j/i/t/User_talk%7EJitse_Niesen_3715.html" title="User talk:Jitse Niesen">talk</a>) 12:41, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I strongly support Wikipedia's many external links to cut-the-knot, mentioned above. But does it <i>necessarily</i> follow that we need an article about the site itself? —<a href="../../../b/l/o/User%7EBlotwell_e987.html" title="User:Blotwell">Blotwell</a> 01:22, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>no vote</b> I got a whiff of the current activity through the good services of Oleg the gatekeeper. I thank every one for their involvement and vote. I wish to add my two cents and apologize in advance if the result appears worth a nickel. First, with a deep appreciation for Michael's effort, I still do not care for the article. Neither do I plan on editing it in any way. Second, I think, you fellows have to decide whether the category of Educational sites belongs in an encyclopdia or not. It may be of interest to consider the difference between an "encyclopedia" and an "online encyclopedia." If the category is present then I would think that my site is as educational as a next one. Third, the web awards, traditionally made prominently available to the visitors are of no great value. A group of SciAm editors is not a Nobel prize committee, of course, but they can be as misguided as the latter. Thus I would not place a great score on their award. Perhaps, MERLOT is a little different. It's a volunteer organization and I assume there was a chance for a broad participation as is the case in the wikipedia voting. Fourth, while I did not write the <a href="../../../c/u/t/Cut-the-knot.html" title="Cut-the-knot">cut-the-knot</a> article, I added quite a few links to my site. I do not know whether anybody else did. Thus the number of links from wikipedia to my site may not be a trustworthy criterion for site evaluation. The suitability of the links may. I am rather proud that I had no difficulty supplying a great quantity of good quality links. Fifth, google became an unruly behemoth. They dropped cut-the-knot.org from their indices on January 6, I believe, the reason for which I may only surmise. The idiots left all the entries for cut-the-knot.com, which is a (secondary) domain parked on top of .org. Alexa's index of .com is in the 500,000s, that of the (primary) .org was in the 50,000s. On an online forum hosted by google somebody suggested that their maneuver was due to the fact that there was a 302 (temporary) redirection from one site to the other, not the expected 301, which means "permanent". The trouble is that the redirection is from .com to .org, and not the other way round. You may want to know why I have this arrangement. In the beginning it was a plain .com site. When it began breaking the bandwidth limit and the penalty gew excessive (there was a month when the site's upkeep cost me $400), I made a copy on a different server, dubbed it cut-the-knot.org and would switch to it before incurring unsustainable penalties at cut-the-knot.com. My efforts notwistanding, the site was evicted from its shared server, at which point I simply parked it on top of the existing .org. It was so long ago, that most of the links to the site are via .org, some are still to .com. As you see, google's behavior is just a smack under the belt. Well, I am sorry. It looks like a dime's worth - just do not know to whom. Thank you all again. Alexander Bogomolny</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. The Original Research is speculating the cloud of smoke is "the unseen creature" that killed the pilot (there's no way to know that); in asserting that "Locke came face to face with the creature" (again, unknowable); in saying it "attacks him for unknown reasons...using what appeared to be some sort of appendage"; and in stating that it makes noises like "moaning", "machine-like" and "growls." This is pure interpretation of whatever the smoke cloud may be, and is not (as yet) deserving of a separate Wikipedia article. —<a href="../../../l/e/f/User%7ELeflyman_bdea.html" title="User:Leflyman">LeFlyman</a> 18:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Addendum</b>: Some have suggested "merge" for this material, however, it's not been revealed as yet just what the "smoke cloud" is, and whatever we might say about it would be speculative in nature.

<p>The article title is a protologism -- that is, a word that has recently been invented and has not even gained enough linguistic currency to be considered a neologism. The article is also a POV personal essay, and covers much of the same ground as <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>. It had been turned into a redirect to <a href="../../../c/r/i/Criticism_of_Wikipedia_b88c.html" title="Criticism of Wikipedia">Criticism of Wikipedia</a>, but we generally try to avoid letting Wikipedia be used as a method to cultivate the usage of protologisms and neologisms.

<li>The article subject is indeed a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/protologism" class="extiw" title="wikt:protologism">protologism</a>, and the article contents are the personal opinions and analyses of two Wikipedia editors (possibly one and the same), being published directly in Wikipedia.

See <a href="../../../l/e/m/Talk%7ELemnian_language_f519.html#Translation" title="Talk:Lemnian language">Talk:Lemnian language#Translation</a> to see what spawned it.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. One merge "voter" provides no rationale. The other's rationale makes no sense, because the article provides no information other than raw data (i.e. when it's held, how many people attend), so how can it provide an insight into the community?

<dd>Guys, I'm going to elaborate on my reasons why this info is pretty pointless in the grand scheme of the Bankstown article, and an encyclopedia in general. Let's take another example of a time when a small few-thousand people get together to celebrate: Fourth of July in the United States.</dd>
<dd>Now, from where I stand, a merge here would be equevilant to picking a single article on a random American township, and then specifically saying that they have a celebration on the Fourth of July. Unless I'm highly mistaken, and I may be, <i>most</i> places in the United States put together some kind of shin-ding to celebrate whatever it is.</dd>
<dd>Bankstown is not made unique or different from the status quo by running christmas carols in this format, no more than Randomville, United State (population 18,000) would be made unique or different by announcing to the world that they have a Fourth of July event.</dd>
<dd>I still say delete, as per above, but would happily support a couple of lines being added to the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Carols_by_Candlelight_a16a.html" title="Carols by Candlelight">Carols by Candlelight</a> article - something along the lines of "This format has been replicated multiple times by the various local councils in Australia, who run their own, smaller events. These are in a similar format and style to, but not directly linked, to the larger events held in the capital cities.", but fancier. -- Saberwyn</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> i dunno, who knows for sure that more people <i>will</i> watch this page for vandalism? if they arent obligated to, then more vandalisms will happen if the person who wrote them is believed, he said he would keep writing: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RockAbilly.US&amp;diff=33617937&amp;oldid=33106622" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RockAbilly.US&amp;diff=33617937&amp;oldid=33106622" rel="nofollow">[11]</a>. this <b>should</b> be treated with as much care as the infamous john siegenthaler, sr. page, but only problem is, more people know about his history and what is and isnt true about him.... .with this music groups comparitive low profile, and since they doont have a nat'l platform (USA TODAY) to defend themselves, how will people know what is true and what is slander. with that i say delete.

<p>Can anyone confirm this singer's existence? No real Google hits, and the 'official' website is hand-made junk (those CD covers look totally fake), although I haven't attempted to listen to the songs linked on the page since I'm in a public place without headphones at the moment. <a href="../../../h/u/n/Hun.html" title="Hun">Hun</a> which links to the page should also be removed. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> 15:22, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>He is indeed a singer who entered the charts in 2004. Just typing Gone Before It Happens Hun refers to official release dates, but his albums weren't released. I can't confirm the Unisong thingy (although I believe looking at their site that many people enter for each country). The official Beth fanclub site refers to their duet (called Ineluctable).

<dd>Could you sign your entry, please? I'm not convinced. Everything that I can find using your search terms seems to be on user-editable sites, or else the links don't work. The pictures of the guy also do not seem to match with his reported age. In addition, a search for "Lucien Salandiak" on Google gets exactly three results; two from Wikipedia, and one which is a copy of a Wikipedia entry, plus he does not show up on discogs.com as either Hun or Lucien Salandiak. I can hardly believe that there would be zero proper results for a search for his name on the web. <a href="../../../o/s/g/User%7EOsgoodelawyer_264a.html" title="User:Osgoodelawyer">Osgoodelawyer</a> 20:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I typed in Luciak (like the site), and I have found some fan sites for him (for example, www.angelfire.com/gundam/luciak/). Thaliafan</p>
<p>I bought his single in 2004. therefore, i confirm that he is real. The song was called Gone before it Happens but on the CD, it said that his site was hunweb.com, nothing to do with luciak. Benidict Wong</p>

<dd>No I'm sorry if it came across that way I am just trying insert similar comments wherever I find these sorts of disscusions. We have a large backlog of Transwiki materials at Wikisource and a lot of them are unverifiable copyright (<i>especially translations</i>) or non-english <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=transwiki&amp;go=Go" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=transwiki&amp;go=Go" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>. And it is hard to contact the WP editors doing the transwikis as they don't sign up for accounts. So I am just trying inform editors to Transwiki responsibly as we don't want copyright material sititng in the backlog for too long.</dd>

<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Barno's reason to merge doesn't wash; I've read half a dozen full-fledged books on the browser wars and none of them even touches on this. Besides, this wouldn't fit in the article, like at least 2/3rds of all merges from AfD that either throw the size of the article devoted to trivial matters out of whack or cover something all but tangentially related to the article. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 13:39, 23 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Weak keep</b>, 16-year-running annual convention of 2000 isn't generally very notable, but is notable in its field per Locus magazine and Monicasdude. I think SF fandom and its conventions are just barely enough of a widespread field (rather than just a fringe niche) that long-running cons like Arisia squeeze within the "notable in its field" part of the importance criteria. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 21:17, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> Google search shows various mentions of this convention, but most relevant hits in the first few pages are niche websites or fan activity. Did the Boston Globe ever do an article on Arisia, especially one that discussed community tradition rather than holding it up as "look at what the silly nuts in their Darth Vader costumes are doing"? Such a citation would help the article and the Keep votes. <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a> 23:18, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> as per <a href="../../../b/a/r/User%7EBarno_d725.html" title="User:Barno">Barno</a>.

<dd>Well , the wikipedia NPOV policy actually states that all POVs should be presented, this being a far cry from the belief of some editors that anything that is controversial should not be presented under the guise of being POV.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Although the article describes the point of view of the film, the article itself doesn't express any particular point of view. Wiki's NPOV rule is meant to prevent articles from being written with a particular point of view. The NPOV rule does not preclude having articles about subjects that represent or possess a particular point of view. As for it being a non-notable film, there are hundreds of wiki articles on films, TV shows, comics books, etc, that aren't particularly notable. The film exists, thus it has as much right to be written up in a Wiki article as any other film. Simply the fact that it was premiered at the American Film Renaissance Festival in Hollywood makes it notable. Its not just some home movie of unknown people. Its obvious that the person wishing to delete this article simply finds the film offensive. This consideration for deletion is nothing more than an attempt at suppressing information that some party dislikes. Take a look at IrishPunkTom's user page - it clearly states that he is a member of some group called the Muslim Guild. Obviously, he would dislike this subject matter. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 14:32, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's what held me up at first as well -- it had a fairly significant amount of links in Google, so I voted for keep. But Google News only uncovers two news links to it, and from what I can see, it has only been shown in one particular film festival, and there's no talk for getting it distributed. That kind of clinched it for me, so I changed my recommendation to delete. I do note, however, that the film festival that it appeared in, the American Film Renaissance, doesn't have a Wikipedia article yet. That, IMO, is more notable than this film, and should be added. — <span style="font-variant: small-caps"><a href="../../../t/-/b/User%7ET-Boy_4523.html" title="User:T-Boy">T-Boy</a></span>: <small>(<a href="../../../t/-/b/User_talk%7ET-Boy_2fe0.html" title="User talk:T-Boy">complain bitterly</a>) (<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_T-Boy_b210.html" title="Special:Contributions/T-Boy">laugh contemptuously</a>)</small> 06:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

The rest of it seems like nothing more than a description of the film's contents in a fairly mundane fashion. If there have been any Islamic groups, (or other groups), that have issued statements condemning or criticizing the film, it would be appropriate to add a section in the article documenting those statements.<a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 16:24, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I don't think that saying this is about censorship is at all ridiculous. If one compares the obscurity of this film to all the other documentaries at <a href="../../../d/o/c/Category%7EDocumentary_films_8671.html" title="Category:Documentary films">Category:Documentary films</a>, this film is probably actually more notable than many of them. A lot of them get fewer hits on Google and didn't get showings at film festivals. Also, there is good motivation for this film to be censored. Its really close to being a hate film aimed at Muslims, (maybe beyond just being close actually). It claims to contain information that people need to know about Islam, but it documents massacres committed by Muslims against people of other religions over a thousand years ago. Those incidents are not exactly pertinent in todays world, unless you are trying to just scare people and stir up negative feelings about Islam. If this film had been aimed at Jews or Catholics, I would be willing to bet it would have been a Jew or Catholic nominating it for deletion. Sorry, but assuming the best intentions in this case is simply burying your head in the sand. <a href="../../../n/o/r/User%7ENortonew_82d5.html" title="User:Nortonew">Nortonew</a> 03:05, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

That book was more popular on Amazon than The Nazi Connection to Islamic Terrorism (book) with every other sign showing that it was just as important. Wikipedia is not paper but along with that Wikipedia should not be systemically biased. So, that is my major worry in all of this.

<p>I'm not entirely sure this one, but it strikes me as a neologism / original research and google seems to return mostly porn rather than the hip-hop meaning used in the article.

<li>I appreciate your input Dragons flight. I was surprised, when I checked out the page, that someone requested it be deleted. At first, I had no idea 'why' it was put up for deletion. If anything, I would expect a comment on improvement, or the like, but not a deletion. Well, after I read Kappa's comments, I do believe I was probably mistaken in naming the article "Videogirls." It would probably be more appropriate to name it Hip Hop Models. The more I think of it, the more appropriate it sounds. I'll go ahead and change the article title, but I'll first wait a response from you. I'd appreciate if we could come to an agreement rather than you taking the drastic measure of having the article entirely eliminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In response to you saying I possibly invented the phrase "videogirls," that is not accurate. It has been used in the media (e.g. VH1) and elsewhere, but it is not as popular, of course, as the word model. Nevertheless, I am now leaning towards using the word model instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>By the way, I am the person who created this article, and further articles of the same nature. I went through a lot of trouble and used up quite some time, so, obviously, it's not easy seeing it go, as Dragons flight recommended. If you have questions, let me know.</li>

<dd>I withdraw my suggestion that this be deleted, noting both the much improved name and the expansion of content. In addition the strange name, the original item I tagged had fairly little by way of content that didn't feel like someone's opinion piece, i.e. the original research remark above. There are still some things I'd like to see addressed. In particular what is the foundation for the list of "Successful Hip Hop models"? Following the links, some are identified as hip hop models but others are described as singer/actress and other broader categories. In some cases there is very little evidence presented to associate with hip hop at all. I would note that to be a successful hip hop model one would need to both be identified (or self-identify) as such and then be successful at it, noting of course that one could be a successful singer/actress without having had success at hip hop per se. I'd like to see this list substantiated with trade publications or something like that. Otherwise it will be something of an open invitation for anyone to add their favorite music video actress regardless of quality.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Another issue is one of categorization. Is there really such a thing as a "hip hop model" as a well-defined category? I'm noting that the phrase gets even fewer hits than videogirls did. Do these women really view their careers as defined by the hip-hop genre, or are they more generally seen as models/dancers/actresses/etc? I have really no expertise in this area with which to say, but I am suspicious, as I imagine most entertainers would be glad to get work wherever they can get work. For example, would these women really refuse to work in a music video that wasn't <a href="../../../h/i/p/Hip_hop_music.html" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a>?</dd>

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Lastly, and this is really a minor point with no bearing on the deletion discussion, I find it surprising that an article like this makes no explicit mention of the role race plays in this issue. If it is almost entirely constrained to black (and latino?) culture, as is my impression, then that should be mentioned. Are there any white hip hop models? Not apparently from the list of successful ones. <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> 06:16, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I also support renaming this article rather than deleting it. For those who have never heard of this phrase, I should mention it is not that common, but it is used here and there.

I should mention that is completely not true. First, I have cited everything I've mentioned in the article, with quotes to back up several things. Second, the demand for Hip Hop models is very strong. I don't see how anyone could say otherwise.

<dd>This discussion is not going where it needs to go. The only issue that is being addressed here is whether this article should be deleted. The majority believe that it should not be deleted provided that there be some changes. I have made drastic changes to the quality of the article, and hopefully others will add to it. For those who don't believe this needs to be part of an encyclopedia, what about an article on cheese? Do you remember the last time you had a conversation about cheese? Well, there was a lengthy article on cheese on the frontpage. I really don't think it is fair for people to mark a topic that they are not interested in as being "garbage" or non-notable. If you don't think it is worthy of being in an encyclopedia, trust me, there are others who do believe it should be. Don't force your opinion on anyone, and don't threaten a deletion. That is not right. If you have people question what should and should not be part of Wikipedia, the only topics that will be left are those of serious historical value such as the Holocaust. Yes, the Holocaust should be part of Wikipedia, but does that mean anything that is less significant should not be? Please consider the fact that you may simply have no interest in Hip Hop or modelling. That could very well be why you don't think there's any signficance to this. Let me ask you this, though. Why is it that this industry probably is worth several million dollars and has big names such as Playboy joining it if it is not worthy of mention? Also, why is there an article on pornstars on Wikipedia when there should not be an article on Hip Hop models? <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStiles_56da.html" title="User:Stiles">Stiles</a> 20:20, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The following is a response to <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragons_flight_9489.html" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a>. You have questioned whether this article should be entitled Hip Hop models. The answer is that it should be. You have seen, by following links to several Hip Hop models, that some are not considered Hip Hop models in their own articles. All models in the list I created have done 'other' work, in addition to work they have done in Hip Hop music videos. That does not mean that they are strictly Hip Hop models. I never suggested that, and perhaps as a clarification, I should mention something about this in the article. Furthermore, there are some models that are better known as being something other than Hip Hop models. That does not mean they should be eliminated from this list, because their value as Hip Hop models is well appreciated, and they are, nonetheless, recognized by many as being models from Hip Hop videos. Should a model indentify herself as a Hip Hop model to be on this list? No. That is simply not a reasonable requirement for this definition. They may call themselves models who have done work in Hip Hop, but they may not take on this particular title. Consider the fact that President Ronald Reagan could be listed on a list of actors as well as a list of presidents. I may put him on a list of presidents, but that does not mean he wasn't an actor. If you asked most people who Ronald Reagan was, you'd probably hear "president," although he very well deserves to be on a list of early 1900s actors. I realize you wanted the list substantiated. That is not a problem. Simply take a look at interviews that these models have done with magazines that are considered strictly Hip Hop magazines. I think the fact that these models did an interview with a Hip Hop magazine shows that they know they are popular amongst Hip Hop fans. I cannot take credit for every article is linked to from this list, but the articles I have created have reference to these models having done work as Hip Hop models and interviews they have done with Hip Hop magazines. I cannot be expected to keep track of all articles and make sure that each article has a reference to their Hip Hop work. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStiles_56da.html" title="User:Stiles">Stiles</a> 20:35, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Is there really such a thing as a "hip hop model" as a well-defined category? I'm noting that the phrase gets even fewer hits than videogirls did." If you go from one Hip Hop fan to another, most will not call these models "Hip Hop models." They'll use slang terms such as "eye candy," "dimes," "Hip Hop honeys," etc. The problem with slang is that it changes all the time, and that it is not exactly appropriate for an encyclopedia. That is why this article is titled Hip Hop models, and not "Hip Hop honeys." There is really nothing that can be done about this with the exception of having all these slang terms re-directed to Hip Hop models. Most models see themselves as being models, perhaps to further their careers rather than tying themselves down as being Hip Hop models, but they do this, like I said, for furthering their careers. They know very well that they have strong ties to the Hip Hop modelling industry, and that it would be more appropriate to call themselves Hip Hop models, but they won't do so for obvious reasons. You generally won't hear an lawyer say something like "I am an Intellectual Properties lawyer" at a social gathering. That lawyer will likely just say "lawyer", for the sake of ease. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStiles_56da.html" title="User:Stiles">Stiles</a> 20:35, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Looks like this is a keeper then - which is strange as he wasn't important enough to warrant an article when he was alive. Would this have happened if he was an unremarkable scientist who, although he'd graduated and had recently been accepted into a small, unaccomplished team of researchers, died before achieving anything in his field? I doubt it. If he'd written an article on himself while he was alive it would have been vanity, and if it'd have been created after his death because he'd spent a few weeks in a lab and then crashed his car people would have scoffed. If a sportsman does it though, it's fucking legendary - put it down in the annals of time lest we forget that which we didn't think enough of to record at the time. What an absolute crock of shit... still, thanks for voting. Newsmare 21:40, 21 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It's not a question of "having both" or "drawing the line", in my view. A redirect is a tool to help users find articles. I think it's likely that many people will type in the plural in this case...why not assist them?

<li>The word is now commonly used in code written by Teesside students, which is not publishable because of licensing issues. However, the term has also been used verbally (and possibly within source code) by certain games company employees, generally those employed by companies with strong University of Teesside connections. (Blitz Games, Fusion Digital, Halch, and Mere Mortals are a few examples.)

<li><b>Keep</b>. I work for a respected mobile-phone games company in London, having left Teesside two years ago and obviously I have many contacts from my time there, namely one of the 'creators' of the Lolgorithm. The term is now used in many of the programming circles i frequent both verbally and in code ( namely comments) and I fail to see how anyone can conceivably 'prove' its existance when it is used in copyrighted code. This doesn't alter the fact that it exists in (albeit) small programming circles and it demonstratably will become increasingly more widespread. I feel that many of the negative comments displayed here are from people that have no link to the industry that has coined the phrase and therefore will never use it. I feel that these aforementioned views carry no more weight than unsubstaniated claims either. I suspect that I will come under scrutiny as I cannot explititly use the company name without prior permission I would quite happily give details to contact myself, so as to supply 'evidence' of this phrases extended use.<small>—<i>The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by</i> 80.229.49.63 (talk&#160;•&#160;<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.229.49.63_9a35.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.229.49.63">contribs</a>) , and is the user's only edit.</small>

While tangable evidence of this word is difficult to provide, for the aforementioned reasons, a simple survey of use of the word found several members of the United Kingdom games industry are aware of the word's existance, and use it in verbal discourse and written source code on a daily basis.

<li><b>Keep</b> I have come across this word numerous times while working in the games industry. I've noticed the word has become very much common place and has spread mainly via word of mouth and through working code. I would personally like this word to stick, although not known globably, it has become a valuable means of describing ones code which is notably messy and funny while producing unexpected, yet pleasing results. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 81.104.80.71 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_81.104.80.71_183d.html" title="Special:Contributions/81.104.80.71">contribs</a>) 16:34, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</small>

<li>Keep - For an encyclopedia that freely includes nonsense, fictional articles concerning such topics as Gundam and Zoids this article seems by comparison to be a far more worthy contribution. Deleting articles and then inviting users to write them again due to their own good will is a disgraceful manner in which to act. This article should be kept and all discussion pertaining to its removal ceased or expunged.

<li><b>Keep</b> This word is used widely by tutors and supervisors all over the United Kingdom when they refer to the work of their underlings. It's a slang term, and not easily verified, as it will not be written in formal reports, papers, or other. The only type of paper that would have this published would be a general socialogical paper discussing how supervisors and leaders discard their work as not "industry standard".

<li>Keep* Many of my friends at University use this word frequently to describe comical outcomes from programming errors. This may not be a word in the dictionary but it is still used by many people. The word bug for instance, to describe odd errors, is not a proper word, as it describes a small insect like creature, but was coined when a moth caused a computer problem back in the days of the beginning of computing, but now it is as commonplace a word as any. Maybe someday this word will too acheive this status.

<li><b>Keep</b> I've recently find out about the existance of this term and the great programming practice about it - to give the source code a new, better, funny look.

<p>After a <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Saugeen_Stripper_03c0.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Saugeen Stripper">disputed first nomination</a>, this article was closed as a no consensus, but deleted out-of-process by another admin. As the first close was controversial (the closer, for example, counted two accounts with very few edits, which is almost always a bad idea, and there was a clear majority for deletion that was borderline rough consensus), and there was support for a relist at DRV, I am relisting this now. My vote is <b>delete</b>, as its basically a news story that isn't even really newsworthy, much less encyclopedic.

<dd>Well, most admins would have discounted 2 votes, making it 6 to 10, and remember it's not just about the votes.

<li>I disagree. The question is not whether "will this article change Wikipedia much" but "will all articles like this one change Wikipedia much". If we start having 1 article for 1 event that makes a national newspaper, that will hurt Wikipedia (note that we have Wikinews for things like this). Keeping an article is a precendent that will affect next AfD discussions.

I disagree with having a wikipedia article for every temporary headline, and this is obviously just a short-term story that got passed around because it had pictures of a naked girl. The only way I would vote keep on this would be if the incident turns out in the future to have longer-lasting repercussions, such as being the subject of a book, or leading to a major lawsuit, new legislation or some newsworthy change to school policy. For example, <a href="../../../r/o/s/Rosa_Parks_bff2.html" title="Rosa Parks">Rosa Parks</a> did a small thing by just not giving up her seat on a bus, but it had large consequences and was definitely encyclopedic.

<li>1. the article hasnt even been up 3 days, and is in the process of being finished, but yet people who know nothing about the site etc are being allowed to have a say.</li>
<li>2. already, 2 (former) users have reared their heads in one form or another and added their $0.02 to the discussion. comments they have made bear all the hallmarks of sour grapes. FYI, the users in question were banned from the site for being unable to exersize the MINIMUM amount of self restraint the warp asks for.</li>
<li>3. comments on theawrps current status being used to justify the deletion are to be honest, pretty irrelevant, as the site is going through a series of major changes and is not yet back up to 100% operating capacity. as one of the site administrators, i can vouch that site visits are slowly climbing back up to the amount the warp had before its troubles, and every day we get more members, either returning users or new members.</li>

<ul>
<li>Thanks Black_Rift for informing me of Pikachus bullshit. My god Pikachu you do tell a lot of crap and retell stories changing things.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>-Firstly my site was never canned, my mate who hosted my account ended his business attempt when he moved to work at Intel. I also never left the Warp to come back to it. I frequented the Warp as i ran my site, my site was once part of the Warp don't forget till i realised to move away from it would be better for my site overall and it was. Haven't you noticed Pikachu how NON of the runners of sites on the Warp Network frequent your forums? They used and abused the 2MB free space and advertising the Warp offered.</dd>
<dd>-Secondly i was never banned for troll bait or Northern Ireland or anything like that, i was banned for being passed on staff forum postings. I was subsequently unbanned by the site owner when he realised i didnt hack the site and that one of you mods passed me info especially about your slander and libel. I was only banned afterwards by BrotherDrake the former owner for no reason other than his loathing of me.</dd>
<dd>-Thirdly even your site boss and several other mods agreed with me on this; i defended myself in those flame threads, i didn't start them, i only defended myself to which more assault was poured onto me when the other person couldn't admit that they were wrong.</dd>
<dd>-Fourthly i didn't blackmail BrotherDrake, ask him did i ever demand anything off him. I only stated to him that i didn't sign a confidentiality form, he automatically assumed it was a blackmial attempt. Yet no such threat or demand was ever made so technically no blackmail.</dd>
<dd>-Fifthly BrotherDrake hated me because i wasn't scared to stand up to him and his demands for money. He demanded money for the site when he did nothing for it other than let it die, i challenged him on this. He loathed me due to my frequent shows of fearlessness whe i tcame to talking back to corruption of the Warps heirarchy. I love the Warp and was sad to see it in the sorry state as he left it in.</dd>
<dd>-Sixthly the Warp is so shitly run by you and the others that you let morons roam around the site. I've had no problems on any other forums on the net, in fact on some i am very respected for my input, on the Warp the only problem was my standing up to Drake and a few corrupt mods who abused their powers such as you. Did you know i was going to be made a mod on the Warp? Yeah i was so much a badguy that i was gonna be alongside you in the ranks. Yet my promotion was canned when Drake assumed i was attempting to blackmail him.</dd>
<dd>I personally don't care if this wiki page gets deleted or not, i do however object to the bullshit you seem to keep posting on the article and here. Shall we leave me out of this now and return the point of this debate; the deletion of this wiki article? Trying to make other debaters here look bad when your own history is very dubious isn't a good thing. My $0.02 on this wiki page is as follows:</dd>
<dd>My vote on this Wiki page is reserved as its a 50/50 decision for me; Its a yes for deletion when it comes to the behind the scenes backstabbing that plagues the site. However its also a no for deletion as the site was once great and i beleive that under Nekiel it can become great again and that LordBunny's vision can come back stronger than ever. I'm only posting here primarily to refute the libel being posted against me.</dd>

<li><b>comment</b>: thanks for restoring the page feller, but after we have talked about it we have pretty much decided to host the "history of" page on the warp somewhere, firstly to stop people tampering with it and secondly because of the surprisingly snobby attitude of wikipedia users who seem to judge a site on its alexa rating as opposed to its content or user contribution level.I, as the original author of this article, hereby request for it to be removed as soon as it can be. anyone wishing to view the finished thing is welcome to come and have a look at it on the site once i get it finished off. <a href="../../../p/i/k/Pikachu.html" title="Pikachu">pikachu</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 84.65.64.4 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_84.65.64.4_4552.html" title="Special:Contributions/84.65.64.4">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>comment</b>: The Alexa rating Pika does give an indication of site popularity and as you can see on Alexa the Warps traffic has dropped considerably over the last 2 years. The Warps traffic rating is boasted by its more successful affiliated sub-domain sites such as Tigers of Veda (which is advertised on the GW Gateway) and Liber Astartes (which is scheduled to depart your network). On Alexa as they are part of the www.thewarp.net domain they are included in your traffic ratings.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>In fact Pikachu a great idea for your redone version of the Warp.Net Wiki article would be including sections on the networks affiliated sub-domains seeing as they supply most of the sites traffic. In fact they supply most of the Warp networks substance and meat Mabus, aka Angelis_Mortis 23.40, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> The blog itself is only a half year old and doesn't actively advertise its presence since its a student-run community. However, the blog records 300-400 hits daily, and encompasses a large quantity of visitors from different geographic regions of the United States. From what I've seen, the article is worth keeping, due the the noteability the site receives in certain high school circles. And to Liberatore: you incorrectly cited Google for showing linked page statistics. You showed only a search of cached pages within the site. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Ahttp%3A//tangst.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Here's the link you probably meant</a>.

</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> but, maybe this article should be marked as a stub, or have a request for additional information placed on it? I think its a good history and description for the community it portrays, but it seems the complaint is primarily centered on a lack of neutrality or quantity of information. If this is the case, there are less drastic means that could be used, such as a "stub" marking or "neutrality" notice. <a href="../../../7/1/2E/User%7E71.65.223.142.html" title="User:71.65.223.142">71.65.223.142</a> 21:09, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> but, like the others have said, as a stub. The blog is 5 months old. After a rocky start with one administrator doing everything, it's experienced increased growth in the past two months. Because it's community based, the growth stops and starts depending on current events in those areas. Obviously, neutrality is an issue. I'd bet that the creator of the article is an ardent fan of the site. By the way, there are a couple of sites that link to the blog, it's just that there aren't any notable sites that link to it.

<li><b>Comment</b> Um, wow. The lines are rather clear. Per policy, it seems pretty obvious that it shouldn't be an article, it doesn't met notability standards. Stub status I'm not that sure about. As the creator of the site (not the article), I'm starting to not care about the outcome, but I'm still terribly biased so I'm going to refrain from declaring. I just ask that <a href="../../../c/a/l/Calton.html" title="Calton">Calton</a> stop taking potshots at the supporters (mentioning how many edits someone does or doesn't have isn't valid - there are numerous ways to make thousands of edits without being accredited any, like getting a new computer, not bothering to get a Wiki account, or using different computers at the library). Looking at the history of this discussion, he tried to delete something, which I think isn't allowed per Wikipedia deletion policy. Am I right about that?

<li><b>Delete</b> until such time as there is sufficient mention of the man from respectable (and identifiable) sources in the literature. Currently he only has faceless internet entities vouching for him. If however this article is kept, it will need a lot of editing. The whole thing reads as if it has been posted by Robin himself or else a very uncritical fan of his. Too much waxing lyrical; too many relatively unimportant details that serve only to bolster his image; not enough hard facts. It all smacks of POV. Personally, I <i>would</i> like to find out more about Robin Artisson, to find out whether his information has any good sources or whether it is invented. I remember emailing him a couple of years ago trying to find his source (and a tune) for a song (Dick Darvall's song), but receiving no reply. There's plenty of other stuff that really grabs my interest, like his mention of "Dame Hyldor" as a name for the Goddess in (Northern England? I forget... he mentions it somewhere on his Meadows of Elfhame site). I would like to know whether these are his own inventions/intuitions or whether they pre-exist him. Given his claims of not believing in oaths of secrecy, we should be able to come up with a bit more concrete information to tie him down. Also, I note that many of the posts in the anti-deletion camp have remarkably similar wording and language patterns. I think I might pop over to one of Artisson's sites and compare with some of his writing there! (This is partly copied from my post to Talk:Robin Artisson, but I've changed my conclusion a bit since then.) <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a> 12:01, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Comment to Matthew Brown</i>: You've heard of him now. And that, I think, is the point. For someone who is called "not notable" by the "delete" crowd, he seems to have the power to cause quite a ruckuss, and invoke quite a lot of emotion out of quite a lot of people. And for someone who isn't known or notable, a lot of people here seem to know him- and even know enough about him to tell us all what multiple crimes he's alleged to have committed, etc. Yeah... he's well known for being "not notable"- notable, after all, is a rather neutral term, to "be of note" doesn't imply anything automatically positive or negative, nor is there some objective standard for who is "notable" when it comes to fringe communities and alternative communities like the heterogeneous neopagan world. jontelpo</dd>

He has contributed to articles upcoming in "The Cauldron", one of Britain's most read occult magazines, as well as "Pentacle" in the UK. He is published in the "Pagan Awareness Network" journal in Australia. He is a well-known personality in the neopagan world. Despite the clear attacks of the people who don't want to see him here for their own personal reasons and vendettas, his name and writings are well known in neopagan circles, and I thought he deserved an article. The user who called for this deletion is "Ashley Y", a person who also uses the Wikipedia rip-off and trash site "Encyclopedia Dramatica", where she has made countless libelous statements against Robin Artisson. You can see them here in the history page of the article made against him there: [http://www.encyclopediadramatica.com/index.php?title=Son_of_art&amp;action=history] The user "Swisscelt" has also tried to smear him at that site, and you can look at that history page and see his name, as well. Both of these users have personal grudges against Robin. They are not objective. Many authors and artists choose to self-publish for reasons of creative control. Being self-published is still published. People voting against this article- like <a href="../../../m/o/d/User%7EModemac_38eb.html" title="User:Modemac">Modemac</a> have already made personal attacks against Robin, calling him a "troll" and an "asshole". This is a violation of Wiki's rules, and troll-like behavior, evidence of the true motivations of people trying to remove this article. There is not a shred of verifiable evidence that Robin has spammed "hundreds" or even "dozens" of groups, anywhere. —Ravenflight</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - as he has in his own Son of Art group "secret supporters," in various groups to keep an eye on anyone speaking against him. He has a severe messiah complex, and if you ask for resources, he'll attack you with such immaturity that he isn't taken seriously in the pagan community. Most of the "Do not delete" are his sock puppets, or secret supporters. He bases his work on Nigel Jackson, whom his history is as mis-guided as Margaret Murray's, and the "mystically inclined" is as much nonsense as his "recovery" of ancient lore. In otherwords, he's making stuff up. I've seen him troll, and his Michael Quirke that's "a traditional pagan" is in fact, a christian, who tells the old stories. So, added on, is liar. He is self-publicized, meaning no publisher would take him seriously more than likely. Also, he bases his work on R.J. Stewart, whom is a very new-age author. His online group is only an ego boosting, and his "wealth" of knowledge is shotty, poorly researched, or just plain off. DELETE him, and let him get a dose of reality. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 70.95.96.243 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_70.95.96.243_b1ee.html" title="Special:Contributions/70.95.96.243">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>If you feel that way, just don't read his work. It's not meant for the spiritually desolate agnostic anyway. It must be horrible to not believe anything unless it's been on National Geographic thirty plus times. I also don't think being an armchair anthropologist such as RA dissenters are qualifies one to say what is true and what isn't just because they haven't had the blessing of learning outside of their Google searches and Ronald Hutton books (who actually likes Robin's work!&#160;!gasp!).

Robins works have been enjoyed by many these past few years and he certainly IS a notable character in the pagan community, whether one agrees with his discussion style, or ritual methods and history or not. Both his internet writings/poetry, and now his hard copy full length book have proved to be workable or at least inspiring to many. Ashley_y has stated in her own entry that she is nothing more than a "fiddler" and corrector, and not noted for originality.

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE!</b> I have seen this "Ashley Y" attack Mr. Artisson relentlessly in several other on line communities, as well as the rest of the "deleters" This harassment includes libelous and false information to this Encyclopedia Dramatica entry, to spread vicious lies about him across the internet, to anywhere they could find to spam the link. I am forced to wonder if others of the same mind such as Swisscelt, have been asked to help in the deletion of this valid article, for the sole purpose of causing drama where it is not appropriate. Mr. Artisson is a very well respected Pagan author in my community, and several neopagan bookstores are currently carrying "The Witching Way Of The Hollow Hill" , which has been heralded as one of the most profoundly meaningful works, rivaling that of the Masters. I do hope the Wiki Staff recognizes the extreme conflict of interest in regards to these "pro-deletion" comments, and takes swift action to prevent further vandalism to this wonderful article. I fail to see how and "Pro-Artisson" camments can be catagorized as personal attacks, when the sole purpose here of all of the people that want this article deleted is a misguided personal vandetta/attack. If you don't appreciate Mr. Artisson's ground-breaking work, then you are free not to view this article,and voice your opinions about him in your own blog, or whatever it is you have. I attend many Pagan gatherings and nearly every person I meet for the first time is aquainted with and acknowledges the importance of Robin's work, and he is quite notable, I assure you. I do hope the Wiki staff sees these personal attacks for what they are. This man has sold a great deal of books, and has been authoring many on line articles for years. To even consider he is not "notable" is laughable, and an obvious attempt at censorship. AGAIN:DO NOT DELETE... --Lupinespirit</li>

I have been on this heathen path for over thirty of my forty years and have learned quite a bit myself. I can say with all honesty that Robin knows his subject extremely well, more so than 99% of the pagan authors out there. I find it sad that a few naysayers who do not like him because he dares to disagree with them are allowed to harass and slander him wherever he goes. It irks such people to no end to see the truth about Robin and be brought face to face with their lies. Talk about a detachment from reality! Leave him alone and go find someone else to bully. Robin's work, writings and websites can and do stand on their own. If you don't like it, don't read it! But please do not try to censor him and spread lies.

<p><i>Comment</i>. You've heard of him now. And that, I think, is the point. For someone who is called "not notable" by the "delete" crowd, he seems to have the power to cause quite a ruckuss, and invoke quite a lot of emotion out of quite a lot of people. And for someone who isn't known or notable, a lot of people here seem to know him- and even know enough about him to tell us all what multiple crimes he's alleged to have committed, etc. Yeah... he's well known for being "not notable"- notable, after all, is a rather neutral term, to "be of note" doesn't imply anything automatically positive or negative, nor is there some objective standard for who is "notable" when it comes to fringe communities and alternative communities like the heterogeneous neopagan world. jontelpo</p>
<dl>
<dd>Please read <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>, for an explanation of why we cannot yet conclude Robin Artisson to be a notable figure. We need mention of him from a reputable published source (and not, of course, just from his own books). If he is well known to a large online community of witches then there's a good chance that at some stage soon he will appear in someone's book or article on the subject, however we have to wait for that <b>primary research</b> to appear first (see <a href="../../../n/o/_/Wikipedia%7ENo_original_research_6b05.html" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>). Now I've always felt that magic and witchcraft are essentially esoteric activities not suited for the mainstream anyway (learning about magic can only be done by learning to dig deeper than the surface, searching for more than what's presented up front). I know well the fringe community of magical New Zealand, and some of the communities of parts of England and Australia. The most proficient occultists (and those who have been most influential in the magical and pagan scenes) tend not to enter the spotlight. How many pages will you find doing a web search for Michael Freedman? How many for Paula Jacobs-Wedo? How many for Jack Taylor? Very few, although their influence in New Zealand, through their orders, schools and students has had a huge effect in shaping NZ's occult community. (They do however appear in a few reputable books on the subject.) So don't worry too much if there's currently not enough documentation on Artisson to support an article. It should be forthcoming fairly quickly if he has such a strong following. In the meantime, unless you're hoping to convert a whole load of people, I wouldn't worry too much. <a href="../../../f/u/z/User%7EFuzzypeg_d333.html" title="User:Fuzzypeg">Fuzzypeg</a> 12:17, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>I don't know that this is "quite a ruckus" -- you didn't see the multiple <a href="../../../g/n/a/GNAA_29cf.html" title="GNAA">GNAA</a> deletion votes. By Wikipedia standards, this is a tiny, tiny little dust-up. How many votes are on this page, anyway -- fewer than fifty altogether? I wouldn't call that "quite a lot of people."

<dd>Internet phenomena and personalities show up on Wikipedia, of course -- look at <a href="../../../s/o/m/Something_Awful_6a6b.html" title="Something Awful">Something Awful</a>, for instance -- but generally they have to be <i>very</i> well-known, to where they're mentioned by multiple large media outlets (print or online).

<li><b>Keep/REDIRECT</b> to <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-romanticism.html" title="Post-romanticism">Post-romanticism</a>. It is not bogus, <i>Tapsharru</i>, just because you say so. And the philosophy is notable. It is NOT the same as Romanticism and the movement/philosophy is backed up by many artists and a university professor. --Nikitchenko 03:03, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Post-romanticism exists as a concept synonymous with late romanticism. <i>The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage</i> (2002), p. 292, mentions Mahler and Richard Strauss as composers who can be called late romantic or post-Romantic. James Hepokoski, in the <i>Cambridge History of Nineteenth-Century Music</i> (2001), p. 456, points out that either <i>post-romanticism</i> or <i>late romanticism</i> in the context of musical history is to be seen as pejorative expressions coined by the the "high modernists, supporters of the dissonant, 'new music' in the years before and after the First World War" and that composers such as Mahler and Strauss (and a few others) are better defined - and saw themselves - as [early] modernists. Regardless of the pejorative nature of the term, that is the use of "post-romanticism" that the author is referring to as established. Any other usage so far still seem to be a late idiosyncracy. However, if you have academic references (or even notable non-academic references, such as some coverage in magazines or newspapers with a non-negligable circulation) which back up your claim about the notability of this "post-romantic" philosophy, Wikipedia can have an article on it too. In either case, the current <a href="../../../p/o/s/Post-romanticism.html" title="Post-romanticism">Post-romanticism</a> "article" doesn't tell us anything about the philosophy in question. It is not even a whole line. Actually, it is just an excuse for an external link. <a href="../../../u/p/p/User%7EUppland_6e89.html" title="User:Uppland">u p p l a n d</a> 08:11, 21 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Your research would be more productive in the article then here. If you favor for all that info about post- to be in Romanticism then you can do it, if you donot then somebody else will have to do it. What is put in the article is all thats had been contributed so far... Thank you for the information. --Nikitchenko 11:05, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

<p>Renomination. The <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Ramifications_Thereof_6a0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ramifications Thereof">last AFD</a> was closed as a keep, with the only keep votes being cast by new users (one of whom is the creator of the show). I think it needs more examination. Googling "Ramifications Thereof" is tricky, as it's a pretty damn common phrase, but <i>"Ramifications Thereof" "cable news" -wikipedia</i> got me 15 unique hits (most not related to this). <i>"Ramifications Thereof" zen master -wikipedia</i> got me 36 (again, most not related). By "cable news" I think it means "public access", which is usually not encyclopedic. At the last AFD one user said "From what I can tell, this show does have a following in Northern California" but didn't give any evidence, and I can't find any. -<a href="../../../r/2E/_/User%7ER._fiend_b7de.html" title="User:R. fiend">R. fiend</a> 20:45, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>aloof to the relevance police</b> this is my program. that is my true and legal name. it airs on public access stations just north of san francisco. it certainly has merit in my opinion. find me another program in the united states that airs photos of war casualties, which i do, respectfully, for a few minutes at the end of each program. honestly, i think its the most relevant cable information source from san francisco to seattle but i will certainly lose no sleep over its deletion from an information pool which could equal ably be attributed as possessing questionable significance, also.</li>
</ul>
<p>i don't know how many people watch it. it's unverifiable and i'm philosophically opposed to polling. polls are used to influence opinion rather than reflect it. please don't participate in them.</p>
<p>not that its really anyone's business... i spoke with james s. as a result of a conversation we had concerning a three hour interview i did in berkeley with leuren moret, a former whistleblower at lawrence livermore national laboratory and renowned scientific specialist on depleted uranium munitions.</p>
<p>in summation: i dont give a shit what you do. life must be good if this is all you have to worry about. you know you've arrived when you have nothing left to prove. peace out.<a href="../../../z/e/n/User%7EZen_Destiny_7e8d.html" title="User:Zen Destiny">Zen Destiny</a> 01:27, 19 January 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment for now</b> Article is completely uniformative. Maybe if it had some meat it would be worth keeping. Like links to streaming videos or transcripts or something. As it is it doesn't even say what city it's in, what channel, what time. If it's trying to inform me, it's failing. <a href="../../../g/a/n/User%7EGangofOne_5411.html" title="User:GangofOne">GangofOne</a> 21:35, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> unverifiable. Among other things, I find it difficult to believe that a real news program would be unprofessional enough to be produced by someone using such a silly pseudonym. At best, it's somebody's cable access show, at worst, it's a deliberate hoax. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 22:46, 17 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> based on my conversations with producer, the show does play on cable access but I believe it exceeds the 5,000-audience notability threshold. I have invited Zen to expand the article. Sorry about the apparent unfamiliarity with name styles in California. --<i><a href="../../../n/r/c/User%7ENrcprm2026_854a.html" title="User:Nrcprm2026">James S.</a></i> 01:51, 18 January 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>. Unverified and (so far) unverifiable. "Because I said so" is not verification, especially if you don't explain how you came to be talking with him in the first place. And since, as I understand it, the 5000-audience threshold means 5,000 people actually watching it, not just potentially, you'd better have the ratings book to demonstrate audience share. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 05:36, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> I still say keep on this. The show may or may not have a following in its home market. I believe it should stay.

<li><b>Keep</b>. In the first place, I <i>am</i> Mike Delizia. The text from my Stumpers e-mail message is original with me, and first appeared on a BBS called Grex ten years ago. There is absolutely no copyright violation here. As to sources, the process I describe is one that I witnessed myself, as it was happening. It is not my opinion or speculation, it is simple observation. (It took place over the course of a generation -- that is, the people saying "I could care less" in 1970 were the children of the people who were saying "I couldn't care less" in 1950. The older [i.e., my] generation continued, and in many cases continues, to say "I couldn't care less.") To my knowledge, there are no sources and can be no sources for this information apart from the observations of people present at the creation. In any case, my description of the change is original with me and is absolutely accurate. Mystery solved. I would love to see it remain here on Wikipedia. If you want to cite my Stumpers e-mail or my Grex post as "sources," you have my permission to do so. No hard feelings, whatever you guys decide to do. Btw, if you want to see my original posting on Grex, go to <a href="http://www.cyberspace.org/" class="external free" title="http://www.cyberspace.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberspace.org/</a>. Find your way to the Grex conferencing system on that site, then go to the Language conference, then read Item 72. My post is Response #25, dated March 22, 1995. All the best, golaud (mdelizia@aol.com).</li>
<li><b>Whatever</b>. Lukas points out that my article now falls under "original research," which is not allowed on Wikipedia. There was no research involved, just paying attention and reporting, but I do understand the problem: I'm not a professional linguist; why would anyone take my word for this? But would it be possible for somebody else (Lukas?) to write the article using my e-mail to Stumpers as a source? What I'm wondering is, how the heck do you get something like this out there if not on Wikipedia? --Golaud 15:20, 18 January 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The point of the OR prohibition is that we record <i>accepted</i> knowledge, and what constitutes "research" is not important. Questions like "how the heck do you get something like this out there if not on Wikipedia?" are handled at <a href="../../../r/d/_/WP%7ERD_c7a5.html" title="WP:RD">WP:RD</a>, but have you participated in the forum Lukas mentioned? Those folks are likely to have indexed recordings and transcriptions of casual conversations dating back at least to the 1950s, much more <i>persuasive</i> than your informal memory of the sequence -- even tho your insight into this (IMO plausible) process may be the sort of germ of academically publishable study that some PhD candidate is waiting for the chance to sharpen her linguistic tools on; you may eventually be the subject of a footnote thanking you by name for your role as an "observant amateur-linguist informant".<br />

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I could handle being a footnote, I think. (I would've entered all of this anonymously, in fact, as I've entered a number of titles and edits on Wikipedia, only Wikipedia made me create an account this time.) Anyway, the thought of researching "indexed recordings and transcriptions of casual conversations dating back at least to the 1950s" gives me a migraine, so somebody else will have to do that part. <b>In the meanwhile</b>, why can't my entry stay here as a goad to serious scholars willing to undertake the drudgery? The sequence I've outlined is indisputably true, and I would think anyone with an ear for language will recognize that fact. I am a living relic of that era, and as good a source as any transcriptions you're likely to find. (Harrumph.) Still, as I said earlier, no hard feelings if you decide otherwise. --Golaud 03:17, 20 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><i>Policy relating to fancruft</i>
<dl>
<dd><i>As with most of the issues of <a href="../../../i/m/p/Wikipedia%7EImportance_0cbe.html" title="Wikipedia:Importance">importance and notability</a> in Wikipedia, there is no firm policy on the inclusion of obscure branches of popular culture subjects. It is true that things labeled fancruft are often deleted from Wikipedia. This is primarily due to the fact that things labeled as fancruft are often poorly written, unreferenced, unwikified, and POV - all things that lead to deletion. Well-referenced and well-written articles on obscure topics are from time to time deleted as well, but such deletions are highly controversial. It is also worth noting that many articles on relatively obscure topics are <a href="../../../f/e/a/Wikipedia%7EFeatured_articles_569d.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a>. Generally speaking, the perception that an article is fancruft can be a contributing factor in its deletion, but it is rarely the sole factor.</i></dd>

<li><b>Keep</b> I have encountered the word "commieblock" many times in different architecture forums on the internet. I always thought that the first part "commie" came from "communism" and not "communal" though. A commieblock is different from tower block in that the style used usually some kind of brutalism. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 80.111.141.29 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_80.111.141.29_9ff7.html" title="Special:Contributions/80.111.141.29">contribs</a>) 21:50, 19 January 2006.</small> <small>(user has 3 contributions)</small></li>

<p>Not an article, and unlikely to become one. All this is is a definition of a term and the rules of writing in one (unspecified) context. There will be other ways of using this term (eg. Essay for History).

<dd><b>What type of crap is this?</b> You want deletion rule 43 subsection 394B(iv)? I stated that this term has many unrelated usages, and I cannot see how an encyclopedia article can be written here. If you want to talk about policy, you say 'it will expand into how to write one soon' - but <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> a 'how to', so it can't do that. The point is, it gives the definition of the term within some section of US schooling (I presume, because there is insufficient context to judge). Actually, taken generally, every piece of info is simply wrong. 'Historical essay' more usualy means an essay by a historian taking any form whatsoever, thus it is not neccessarily a 'written assignment' it may not 'include a thesis' it may, or may not be 'supported with facts or sources'. If we rewrite the article to be general enough to be correct, we'd be left with 'an Historical essay is an essay pertaining to some subject of history - the essay may take any form whatsoever'. And that would be a dicdef - and we'd delete it. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 10:22, 18 January 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Just to clarify, I am the subject of this article and this AfD is neither false modesty nor a fit of pique. I just think any internet notability I had is long-gone except for the accident that I have a very unusual name and have been on the internet for long enough for that name to end up all over Google.</p>
<p>Going down the factoids in the article: marriage to another person with a Wiki article? Should every spouse of everyone with an article have their own article? I don't think so. "More accurate diary" (not "most")? I have been waiting for six months for someone to notice it has not been updated. Heavily involved with Gnome? Not right now, but in the past, yes -- but as part of a cast of hundreds. Perhaps, by now, thousands. Translations? I largely put other people's work in CVS, not mine. "Is often said".. well, yes, I complain about this, but again, encyclopedic value..? No single item in this list is remotely notable on its own. I'm really not convinced that the combination is either. And <a href="../../../b/i/o/WP%7EBIO_dc33.html" title="WP:BIO">WP:BIO</a> (which I found as I wrote this) confirms me in that view.</p>
