<p>Is this an article about the new breed of electronic warfare? No, rather a discontinued webcomic, found <a href="http://www.digitalwar.co.uk/" class="external text" title="http://www.digitalwar.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li>Of course, Wikipedia is not paper. I feel however, that a comic strip who's only claim to notability is appearing in a college paper just isn't good enough. I have written for my college paper, and there are 2 comic strips which run on it. How is a college newspaper's comic strip more notable than all the other sections of the newspaper? You can check out one of the college comic strips <a href="http://tevong.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://tevong.co.uk" rel="nofollow">here</a>, notable?

<li><b>Hypothetical merge</b> What if I made an article for the college paper (which I think is more clearly notable) and added this "Dockboys" thing to that page? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - Personally, I would be against that. As mentioned before, this article was written by the ilustrator of the comic, Scott Drummond. I believe that an article should be balanced, with important topics getting wider more detailed coverage than less important points. There is no way I would vote to delete an article for the <a href="../../../u/n/i/University_Daily_Kansan_5d86.html" title="University Daily Kansan">University Daily Kansan</a>, but I would have problems with it if the article included all this Dock boys vanity. At most, the comic would just have a few lines mentioned in the article. Readers should not think that Dockboys is the only thing in the paper, nor its most notable aspect. - <a href="../../../h/a/h/User%7EHahnchen_68e9.html" title="User:Hahnchen">Hahnchen</a> 15:12, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Reply</b> - My point about Google, is that it is sometimes used to see how well known a specific website is. The more hits it gets, the more its generally thought to be well known.

<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. There's no consensus to keep, but something of a split between a merge and a delete. There's not much to merge, and User:Irishpunktom has replaced the article with categorisation (see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Reeves&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44203648" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vic_Reeves&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=44203648" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>). I can't close as a merge <b>and</b> delete because of GFDL issues. I shall therefore, with the new category scheme and the comments about not watering down the Observer article in mind, close as delete. That's not to say an interested editor can't add a mention to the <a href="../../../o/b/s/Observer.html" title="Observer">Observer</a> article, but honestly I don't see anything worth saving. <a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 11:30, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article seems completely pointless. At the moment, it's just a couple of links to a fairly old, obscure list, which anyone could find with a quick google search. I can't see how it could be improved either, beyond regurgitating the list, which would be pointless and copyright infringement. If people want to mention this list in the articles of the people who were in the list, why not just link to the list?

<li><b>Comment</b> article is almost too incomprehensible to judge. if this "samurang" is indeed a korean cultural forgery (despite the POV, it indeed may be such), it may be a <i>notable</i> one - a possibility that the original AfD doesn't go into. i mean, maybe this idea/invention - the idea, apparently, being that korea once featured a samurai-like class of "samurang" who preceded japanese samurai - has gained huge currency in korea and is believed by hundreds of thousands of people. until we have <i>some</i> idea of how widespread this idea is in korea, we should hold out the possibility of keeping and improving the article <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Comment</b>. It is true that being wrongly believed by huge numbers of people is a kind of notability, and there may be something in this but you really have to present it properly or not at all, its not the same as someone creating a really badly written article about "Pepsi" which you can easily label as keep &amp; cleanup. Each case has to be judged on its merits, given the history of this article and the niche interest it holds, I don't see any justification to keep it unless someone who knows what they're talking about has a go at it. We must be very careful not to build a slanted record of history here - one man's biased, nationalist rhetoric becomes an 8th-graders class project.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I am the original author of the article and just revised it. I would like to ask you to judge by the current version.<br />
Yes, I am a non-native speaker and I admit my English is not good, but I think what really matters is whether we share background knowledge. I'm not sure about it. I want to know what obstructs your understanding.<br />
Notable? Google returns 10,400 hits for samurang <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Samurang" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Samurang" rel="nofollow">[3]</a>. Doesn't it suffice?<br />
Does anyone claim this story? I added three related webpages to the article. You will see this (absurd) story is actually believed by some. I used to assume no one would take it seriously, so I was shocked when I met a proponent on the Net. That's why I created this article.<br />
Does it really a Korean cultural forgery? Read the article.

By the way, I want to ask Deiz. Which do you think is 5% half-truth, 95% nationalistic spin? The story of samurang or my explanation against it? --<a href="../../../n/a/n/User%7ENanshu_9373.html" title="User:Nanshu">Nanshu</a> 14:33, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, didn't mean to insult your English - the main problem with my understanding of the article is my total lack of familiarity with the subject matter. Anyway, let me ask some questions: 1.) "samurang" are (according to people who believe that they exist) a korean class that came before the japanese samurai, right? 2.) the "samurang" did not actually exist, right? 3.) the "samurang" idea is a product of korean nationalism, or something like that, right? 4.) most importantly, in korea, <i>how widespread is the idea of the "samurang"? How many people believe in the "samurang"?</i> Thanks - <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P.

<li>Hi Nanshu, good on you for doing up the piece and answering the comments here. My comment "stuff like this is usually 5% half-truth, 95% nationalistic spin" was a general comment based on my experiences in Korea where I came across many such nuggets of disputed history. While I stand by my comment - there is plenty of rubbish out there where Koreans believe one thing and the Japanese believe another, and such stories almost always get embellished with supplementary depth, colour and shade over time - I am happy to see the article improved and brought towards a neutral point of view. I am switching my vote to <b>neutral</b>, as I still have concerns about the POV and verifiability. I trust it is plain from my comments that my concern is this must be properly sourced and referenced or risk being open to question. Also please don't take offence from my comment about your English (I wasn't in Korea for the weather, I know how hard it is!) but the English Wikipedia does demand a native standard of English in articles, such as would be found in a published English-language encyclopedia. If the content of the article is brought up to scratch you'll find someone who is happy to clean up the English. <a href="../../../d/e/i/User%7EDeiz_a644.html" title="User:Deiz"><b><font style="verdana" color="#990000">Dei</font><font color="#FF6600">z</font><font color="#990000">io</font></b></a> 20:56, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Bobby, I think I've already answered your questions above. Haidong Gumdo, which broke into numerous organizations due to factional strife, claims the samurang were an elite class of warriors of Goguryeo. Most Koreans believe Goguryeo was a Korean kingdom although the characterization is disputed by China, and Goguryeo was destroyed long before samurai emerged in Japan.<br />
It is almost impossible to prove the nonexistence of something. But it is safe enough to say that the samurang did not exist because there is no evidence for the existence. When Koreans are blamed on absence of evidence, they usually claim, "<a href="../../../t/o/y/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi_ab20.html" title="Toyotomi Hideyoshi">Hideyoshi</a>/Japanese imperialists burnt evidence (so we cannot prove it)." I heard this plenty of times and always think if Japan had had enough time and money to do such a stupid thing, mighty Japan would do something for her own good instead.<br />
The samurang were cooked up by Haidong Gumdo and it pander to people (or potential practitioners) with nationalistic narrative.<br />

<li><b>Keep</b>. I don't pretend to understand the underlying issues, but from the version I read I understood that it alleges that a <a href="../../../f/a/l/False_etymology.html" title="False etymology">false etymology</a> of the word <i><a href="../../../s/a/m/Samurai.html" title="Samurai">samurai</a></i> has been circulated in Korea for propaganda purposes. I have no basis for an opinion as to whether this is true, or widely circulated, but it is interesting; and where unfamiliar cultures are involved, that's good enough for me. <a href="../../../i/h/c/User%7EIhcoyc_ccde.html" title="User:Ihcoyc">Smerdis of TlÃ¶n</a> 15:27, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Since the Haidong Gumdo community is steadily growing and more and more people are bound to look up "Samurang" I'd recommend keeping the version submitted by me earlier for NPOV reasons. People should be made aware of the controversial nature of the term and the numerous indicators that it's actually a neologism. The current version is also too heavy on the Samurang/Samurai wordplay. Whether the words are related or not has little bearing on whether one group was modelled after the other since the similarity (though unlikely) could be purely coincidental. I'd also like to learn more hard facts about those legal actions that were mentioned. Information about the trials written in English is very hard to come by. SpiralKnot 15:37, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> The "idiosyncratic usage" clause of <a href="../../../g/t/_/WP%7EGT_7ea5.html" title="WP:GT">WP:GT</a> means that a low number of google hits for a single <i>name</i> for a concept/subject does not automatically render the actual <i>subject</i> of the article nn. While there is no clear and universal term that can be used for a rename, we find enough evidence of "chinface" on google to see that it's not a protologism. Since the subject of the article is notable (per Ohnoitsjamie), the mere lack of a universally-known name for that subject should not compel a deletion. So, we have a reasonably notable subject with a somewhat-lesser-known name - this makes it a particularly poor candidate for transfer to wiktionary and a reasonably decent candidate for WP inclusion. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Keep</b> I don't know if this is most commonly refered to as chinface, maybe it should be moved to chinhead or chinman.

<li><b>Keep</b> I first saw this on America's Funniest Home Videos (or maybe Funniest People, I just know a full house actor hosted the show) at least ten years ago.

<p><b>Delete.</b> POV fork. 90% of this article is a direct copy from another article (Francis Schuckardt) except that in this article only the negative accussations against Francis Schuckardt are included with the omission of any answers to the accussations - an obvious backdoor attempt around Wiki policy and guidelines. In addition, 90% of this article is not about Chicoine, but about Francis Schuckardt. Lastly, Chicoine is not a significant enough figure to have his own page. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthanasius303_994e.html" title="User:Athanasius303">Athanasius303</a> 01:45, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Chicoine is as significant a figure as Schuckardt in the traditionalist Catholic movement, maybe even more so. He had the courage and insight to break up a destructive personality cult. Much of the information that is mostly about Schuckardt should be merged or deleted. After 1984 Schuckardt fell into obscurity. Chicoine lead a congregation of traditionalist catholics until he died. More information about Chicoine is needed. (Laurie Pipan)

<ul>
<li>Outside of the small Mt. St. Michael's group, Denis Chicoine is not a significant figure. He has never been covered by the major networks as Bishop Schuckardt has been and outside of his connection with Bishop Schuckardt, he has almost no historical position. <a href="../../../a/t/h/User%7EAthanasius303_994e.html" title="User:Athanasius303">Athanasius303</a> 22:16, 21 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge "Aftermath &amp; Recovery" section and delete</b> - per all above, the Chicoine article seems to be a way around the neutrality dispute - Chicoine is not notable except as an accuser, and thus the bio article functions as a way to bring up and rebut his accusations <i>without having to address their validity</i> - which would have to be addressed in the Shuckhardt article itself to get the POV tag removed. What little new information is present in Chicoine should be moved into Shuckhardt, and the POV dispute in the latter article should be resolved there. Perhaps the POV-removal process will yield further gems like this one from the Shuckhardt talk page: "Since it is a minority view that Shuckardt is a bishop of the Catholic Church and that his excommunications carry weight, the footnote purporting Denis Chicoine is in hell for eternity is both inappropriate, melodramatic, and hateful." <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li><b>Keep</b>: How can it be a POV-fork? It's a different person! This appears appears notable. Article needs cleanup to address POV issues but its not a reason for deletion. The deeper problem, which I think the accusations of POV-forkery are indicative of, is that a lot of the content in both <a href="../../../d/e/n/Denis_Chicoine_1d92.html" title="Denis Chicoine">Denis Chicoine</a> and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Francis_Schuckardt_ccb2.html" title="Francis Schuckardt">Francis Schuckardt</a> should be moved to the articles about the organizations which they were associated with and the ideas that they promoted.

<li><b>Keep</b>. First off the bat, if an article is written badly, it should be marked for cleanup rather than deletion, thats the general way we deal with those articles on Wikipedia (see <a href="../../../c/r/_/WP%7ECR_d625.html" title="WP:CR">WP:CR</a>). The topic itself is certainly notable, from my observations it is probably the second most popular mod for the Battlefield series (behind Desert Combat). Google backs the notability up rather convincingly: <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22point+of+existence%22+battlefield&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22point+of+existence%22+battlefield&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=" rel="nofollow">[13]</a>.

<p>A concept which appears to be not very notable, not yet anyway. It was listed on a blog by an academic, but the blog is only 2 years old, and the word doesn't seem to have been published? A google search gives 160 hits but most of these pertain to a computer programming concept.<a href="../../../b/l/n/User%7EBlnguyen_6bfa.html" title="User:Blnguyen">Blnguyen</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/n/User_talk%7EBlnguyen_584f.html" title="User talk:Blnguyen">Have your say!!!</a> 03:23, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Notes</b> from some googling: 1.) The term has notability and validity as a principle in behavioral psychology formulated by <a href="../../../e/d/w/Edwin_Ray_Guthrie_1c8c.html" title="Edwin Ray Guthrie">Edwin Ray Guthrie</a> much longer than two years ago. 2.) The way the term is used by the referenced academic is at best tangential to its actual meaning - the actual "recency principle" has nothing to do with criminology; the academic is merely applying it to a type of interrogation tactic. 3.) The WP article in question mischaracterizes the point the academic is making (the "recency principle" is used not to have a suspect incriminate himself, but to allow <i>the interrogator</i> to insert incriminating information onto a recording of the interrogation <i>without the objection of the suspect</i>, who is distracted by a new topic of inquiry). <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.</a> 11:11, 16 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Keep and change completely</b> in light of the above. 1.) add information about interrogator use of the "recency principle" to an article about interrogation tactics. 2.) alter "recency principle" article so that it only includes actual information on the actual recency principle, as described by Edwin Ray Guthrie. I'll do this if no one else wants to. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.</a> 11:11, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Keep/rewrite</b> since there is a real recency principle in psychology (we have, in fact, had lectures on it very recently). The article is needlessly specific about interrogation, however. -- Mithent 19:30, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Someone asked why this particular time is relevant. It is relevant since Muhamamd is a very notable name. The list could be named "list of non-Muslims who meet Muhamamd", but that would excluded people who meet the Muslims that fleed to ethiopia. Those people where very prominent, the first Caliph was one of them, and another would become Muhmmads wife. So the list is expaned to include non-Muslims that where involved in such a notable situations. Remeber, people from 1400 years ago are not remebered if they where non-notable, specialy not non-Muslims in Muslim books. And c'mon, we have <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_United_States_Presidents_by_height_order_a0e5.html" title="List of United States Presidents by height order">List of United States Presidents by height order</a>.

Seems like family trees are acceptable. Though non-notable family trees (which this is not, Ali is certainly a notable figure) may be deleted under non-notability. I will see if I can find the village pump link. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 04:35, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> No, I didn't make it up, thank you - follow the link and you'll find <i>" Wikipedia articles are not: [...] Genealogical entries, or phonebook entries. Biography articles should only be for people with some sort of fame, achievement, or perhaps notoriety. One measure of achievement is whether someone has been featured in several external sources (on or off-line). Relatively unimportant people may be mentioned within other articles (e.g. Ronald Gay in Persecution of gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and the transgendered).

<li>I stand corrected - sort of. It does say that "biography article should only be for people with some sort of fame" and Ali clearly qualifies. I do however maintain that there seems to be some consensus that certain family trees belong on Wikipedia.

<p>Twelve Ranks of the Companions</p>
<p>The Companions were divided into twelve ranks by the scholars. This division was made according to the <b>chronological order</b> and some groups are also included in others. It was accepted by the majority of scholars:</p>
<p>1. The four Rightly-Guided Caliphs, namely Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali, and the rest of the ten to whom Paradise was promised while alive. They are Zubair bin Al-Awwam, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah, Abdur-Rahman bin Awf, Talha bin Ubaidullah, Saâd bin Abi Waqqas and Saeed bin Zad, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p>2. Those who believed prior to Umarâs conversion and frequently gathered together secretly in the House of Arqam to listen to Allahâs Messenger, upon him be Peace and Blessings.</p>
<p>3. Those who migrated to Abyssinia in the first hijrah (migration) for Allah's Sake.</p>
<p>4. The Helpers (Ansar) who were present at the first ceremony of taking the Oath of Allegiance to Allahâs Messsenger at Al-Aqaba.</p>
<p>5. The Helpers (Ansar) who took the Oath of Allegiance to the Messenger at Al-Aqaba, the following year.</p>
<p>6. The first Emigrants (Muhajireen) who joined Allahâs Messenger before his arrival in Madinah during the Hijrah (Emigration).</p>
<p>7. The Companions who participated in the Battle of Badr.</p>
<p>8. Those who emigrated to Madinah during the period between the Battle of Badr and the Treaty of Hudaybiyah.</p>
<p>9. The Companions who took the Oath of Allegiance to Allahâs Messenger under a tree during the expedition of Hudaybiyah.</p>
<p>10. Those who converted and emigrated to Madinah after the Treaty of Hudaybiyah.</p>
<p>11. Those who became Muslims after the conquest of Makkah.</p>
<p>12. The children who saw Allahâs Messenger either during the Conquest of Makka or during the Farewell Pilgrimage, or in any other place and on different occasions.</p>
<p>According to this ranking, Khalid bin Al-Waleed would come in Rank 10, since he accepted Islam after the Truce of Hudaybiyah.</p>

<dd>Thanks for that. Yes, she did do a Widcombe church page, and she did the Skinner page, but I take it that these are matters she happens to know about. Since she also did this page <a href="../../../t/o/t/Tota_pulchra_es.html" title="Tota pulchra es">Tota_pulchra_es</a>, a page reflecting on Mary and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which is contrary to Baptist and other Protestant theology, so it is unlikely that she has POV issues, whereas there is systematic deletion of Christian related articles going on all over Wikipedia. I think it is one thing when there are two sides trying on the one hand to increase Christian content and on the other to delete it, but it's a pity if the contributions of someone who had no such intention, and was merely writing about something local to her, should be caught up in this. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_fb92.html" title="User:Usenetpostsdotcom">Uncle Davey</a> <a href="../../../u/s/e/User_talk%7EUsenetpostsdotcom_1e10.html" title="User talk:Usenetpostsdotcom">(Talk)</a> 12:43, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Good evidence, hadn't seen that. I'd add and re-clarify that he writes for the Evangelical Times which has a circulation of about 40 000. I believe that he is therefore notable as a journalist.

<li>Nice one Slowmover. But if you search, you'll find lots of reviews of the book (The Edge of Known Reality and Beyond) coming from independent reviewers/publications.

<dd>Hi guys, it's me again, I'm a bit of a newbie to this and I'm just wondering: is the page kept purely on votes for delete or keep, despite the fact that a lot of the delete votes came in before evidence was displayed? <a href="../../../a/b/b/User%7EAbbyemery_4417.html" title="User:Abbyemery">Abbyemery</a> 07:53, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>No. Only one vote per person is allowed, but the decision is not made by the volume of votes (therefore, multiple votes by one person make no difference anyway). After 5 days, unless it looks like more time is required, an Admin will review the debate, decide if there was a consensus, and act on the consensus. This looks like no consensus to me (IMHO), so it's likely that this page will not be deleted. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 15:49, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<p>It has been claimed that the four doctrine articles are pov forks. They are not. Each one is a distinct doctrine. They are not "split into multiple articles solely so each can advocate a different stance on the subject", they are all <b>Sunni</b> doctrines, it is <b>not</b> different views. It is several <b>different doctrines</b>, not views. Just like the <b>doctrine of trinity and virgin birth are not the same thing</b>. Further, all articles are linkt to the Sunni view article, and the Sunni view article links to them, so there is no risk of not finding them. However, i do admit that the articles need heavy editing.

<p>Given that contributors to these AFD discussions have treated each AFD individually , and different outcomes have resulted - some delete, some keep, some merge/improve - Striver's direct advocacy of voting by others for retention of all his AFD articles seems to me to suggest that&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>his articles generally warrant a high suspicion of <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> violation</li>
<li>his (apparently passionate) votes and AFD comments should perhaps be accorded less weight</li>
<li>his repetition of arguments that have been successfully and cogently countered in recent previous AFDs means those arguments should be afforded almost no weight at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>These comments are NOT a reflection on Striver or the belief system with which he is aligned. I do note however that <a href="../../../s/t/r/User%7EStriver_47ea.html" title="User:Striver">his stated goal</a> is <i>to present a specific POV</i>. It seems to me therefore that this means&#160;:</p>
<ol>
<li>His contributions will <b>need</b> editing to ensure NPOV</li>
<li>Some of the detailed material contributed will be better replaced by links to specialist web-sites - it is not Wiki's role to replicate all the information on the net, but provide concise summaries of key (notable) information (in this case to English-speaking readers) and links to appropriate specialist material</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, Wiki is not a soap-box, and Striver needs to be content with the consensus of the community on <b>all</b> his work. As it says at the bottom of every page&#160;: "If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it."&#160;:) <a href="../../../w/i/k/User%7EWiKinny_8a19.html" title="User:WiKinny">WiKinny</a> 18:32, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

His c. 500 page <i>The Early Islamic Conquests</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981) was called "a major contribution to the understanding of early Islamic history" by the reviewer in the <i>International Journal of Middle East Studies</i> 1983, p. 577.

<li><b>Keep</b> 53,000+ members denotes some sort of importance. Even if all of them aren't active, it is still a remarkable number. Wikipedia's million plus editors, though a large number are indefinitely blocked vandal accounts, a million accounts is a significant number.

<li>Your going to have to be more explicit than that. As you can clearly see, I have added my opinion on that article, so I clearly know that that article exists. And since all of these pages are on your watchlist already, you shall see that I have expressed to keep on the Ali article. So I am clearly judging each article on its merits. Yes, she has prominent half-sisters, but that is because of who THEY married, not because they were notable on their own. Now, unless you can convince me that every wife of the Prophet deserves a family tree, I'm convinced that she does not deserve one. <a href="../../../p/e/p/User%7EPepsidrinka_5aab.html" title="User:Pepsidrinka">Pepsidrinka</a> 19:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: The policy is known as "verifiability", not "verification." Just because something does not have sources does not mean that is cannot have sources. I am strongly in favor of adding sources everywhere, but unfortunately, if we started deleting articles solely because they are unsourced, then there might not be much left of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../a/r/d/User%7EArdric47_8ef5.html" title="User:Ardric47">Ardric47</a> 00:38, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>There are a lot of outlandish claims and obvious problems with the article. They start at the third sentence: "<i>He was almost immediately born as an orphan because of his parents's subsequent exposure and fall to the AIDs virus and the perpetual lacking of clean drinking water.</i>" There is exactly one confirmed case of <a href="../../../a/i/d/AIDS_b1c7.html" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> from the 1950s, and it was stored plasma from someone in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1959. If he was born in 1959 this means his parents had to have both died from AIDS in 1959 or 1960, long before it was known to exist (the next single known case is in 1969.) This sentence is obviously false and I think much, if not all, of the rest of the article is too, and I won't waste my time checking every single claim in here. <a href="../../../g/r/a/User%7EGrandmasterka_6922.html" title="User:Grandmasterka"><font color="red">Grand</font><font color="blue">master</font><font color="green">ka</font></a><a href="../../../u/p/l/Special%7EUpload_3661.html" class="new" title="Image:Blend Flag.jpg">Image:Blend Flag.jpg</a><sup><a href="../../../g/r/a/User_talk%7EGrandmasterka_5f38.html" title="User talk:Grandmasterka"><font style="background:purple"><font color="yellow">Impart wisdom</font></font></a></sup> 05:55, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> It is quite intresting indeed because some users on wikipedia might not remember that they too were once "newbs" on this site by nevertheless wish to contribute just the same. Just because u dont have a long list of contributions behind you does not mean you have not spent hours on hours reading articles from this site and gaining experince on how this site works. Instead of labeling articles as "crap", one might take the less agressive approach to suggest change and actually SCROLL DOWN THE PAGE to find the link. I m sry to inform u that this is not a page on Geroge Washington or Newton, but rather a page on a smaller figure of science and education. Though his contributions to science were just as important, there have not been countless sources written about Mr.Tang yet. Well initially, this article has a base. Though small, it is there and one should attempt to EDIT and HELP and PROVIDE SUPPORT and CHANGE rather than partake in a warpath with lists of accusations. A person of experince should rather, in my opinion, take the time to find the correct info and edit the actually article. Besides, experience should fear the vitality of youth. <small>âThe preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnny_Zhou_3a2c.html" title="User:Johnny Zhou">Johnny Zhou</a> (<a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnny_Zhou_4193.html" title="User talk:Johnny Zhou">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Johnny_Zhou_86fc.html" title="Special:Contributions/Johnny Zhou">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li><b>keep</b> Non-notable as it may seem to you, it is a VERY notable parser - possibly the best, most flexible etc. I started this article when I tried to find out more about GOLD and was surprised to find no article about it. Just because people aren't contributing to the article doesn't mean it's non-notable. It is notable. Because it's not commercial it doesn't have a strong marketing arm to make people more aware of it I guess. To those of you who are voting on the AFD, please don't just say "delete" because you haven't heard of GOLD. <a href="../../../d/o/n/User%7EDonama_e47e.html" title="User:Donama">Donama</a> 11:50, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>To begin with, I would hardly call the attendees of The 18 Cup a group of friends. Hardly anyone likes anyone. Secondly, if ours is a vanity page as you seem to think, I believe this is just another example of someone with power flaunting it. How could this be anything but a vanity page for KJPurscell to say that HIS game is the greatest in the world. To finish with, there are visitors to the page in question who do not participate in the tournament, though who want to know who in fact holds the Cup. It is an important contribution to the Wikipedia as a whole in the view of the dozens of people who view it to gain valuable information from it.

<li>I have just read the things you point to and I think they are deplorable. What I have said (and I believe you have misread)is that people have accused all contributors and supporters of this page of being vandals. Clearly neither Tex Mex or myself are, we have kept things civil and tried to keep within the wiki guidelines throughout this ordeal. This whole process is most disappointing and does not reflect well on many people who have come in provocitably asking for the page to be "nuked". If you must vote to delete this humble page then do so with the same sense of civility that Tex Mex and Myself have defended our newbie page. But I guess that Wiki policy on not biting the newbies doesn't apply when there is a wave of hysteria. Tmothyh 21:50, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe you should have read <a href="../../../y/f/a/WP%7EYFA_410f.html" title="WP:YFA">your first article</a>. There is a prominent link to it when you are creating a page. Also, I don't consider this a wave of hysteria, not by a long shot. Does it look like we're biting you? If it does, we apologize. A good idea is not to participate in Wikipedia's affairs (basically, Wikipedia namespace) until you have 50-100 edits. By this time, you have a good feel for the project, and you usually don't get caught up in things like this. <a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">Ï×¤×§Î¹</a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_Esperanza_5f28.html" title="User:SFGiants/Esperanza"><font color="green">Ð</font></a><a href="../../../s/f/g/User%7ESFGiants_f4f5.html" title="User:SFGiants">ÐÏÏ</a> <a href="../../../s/f/g/User_talk%7ESFGiants_c3b8.html" title="User talk:SFGiants">âº</a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions%7ESFGiants_1766.html" title="Special:Contributions:SFGiants">â»</a> 17:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I am in support of my colleague here. The fact that it has already been mentioned that a wide variety of people do in fact view this page as a source of information seems to be the reason why a few vandals have come out of the works. And the fact that because this has garnered some heat over the recent days is hardly reason enough to have a load of people support the deletion of this fine article because a friend was vandalised, or there is controversy associated with the entry. There is no reason to suggest a strong delete because you were not vandalised. All I see this page being used for is personal enjoyment of people challenging vandals to attack them, inciting a "Wiki-war" in the hopes that, and I believe this to be true, someone tracks the people down and makes troubles for them. This nomination for deletion is nothing more than another opportunity for a person with some power or nothing to do to nit-pick and start a fight with people who don't know better. Rather than challenging the reckless minority and making our simple article look bad and worthy of deleting, take the high road, as two of us have done and either help in fine-tuning of the article, or giving advice, as the respectable Elkman did (and I thank you for your advice pertaining to My Space, as it seems almost certain that our poor article will be deleted now), or sit back and don't meddle in problems that don't concern you. If you believe the article should be deleted, fine, leave your vote and reason, but do not turn this into a barbaric flame war. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 05:31, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, if anyone is knowledgeable in the My Space processes, please, we request your help to transfer our information over to a new page and set it up so that it can act as a 'community-page' <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 05:34, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>You may think that. Personally, I don't have anything against the article, it just isn't notable enough. Really, you should put it on <a href="../../../m/y/_/My_Space_1ad7.html" title="My Space">My Space</a> or <a href="../../../e/v/e/Everything2.html" title="Everything2">Everything2</a> (in my opinion, Everything2 would be more appropriate). I don't think anybody is trying to turn this into a flame war, either. Remember, <a href="../../../a/s/s/Wikipedia%7EAssume_good_faith_2000.html" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">assume good faith</a>. Also, you should tell your friends who also support this article to stop vandalizing user pages. Sorry if this is stereotyping all supporters of this page as vandals, but most of them are. This just happens too much in debates like this. We are making this article look worthy of deleting, because <b>it is</b>.

If you read this policy with an open mind, I think you will agree. On a final note, I don't think anybody reads this page for "information".

<li>I have indeed read the vanity guidelines, and this is where the controversy, for myself, begins. For example, I know it's not compulsory, but for me, in my own shoes, to "assume good faith", I would be much more ready to do this if, for example, this had happened: "Suggestion: before beginning any deletion procedures on a vanity article, it is sometimes found that by simply politely informing the creator of the article that this appears to be a vanity article, and by pointing him or her to this page first, that the author him or her self will sometimes easily agree to the deletion him or herself, thus saving much waste of time and energy on the parts of all concerned parties." Also, there have not been many edits because the information contained within the page will only change per the winner each week. The article is not there to further the 'popularity' or 'fame' of The 18 Cup, it merely exists to inform those that want to know about the past week's winner and current champion. Because this is an non-advertised Tournament, please do not rule this a vanity article because two of the competitors are writing it, as, on the vanity guidelines, this is not reason enough because the "subjects" are writing the article. There have been no vanity edits, such as links that promote the event or the individuals, no photographic material, and the article is quite clear and straight forward. We have salient and verifiable facts in here, and, because the tournament is not advertised, there are, of course, only a few select places where these facts can be corroborated, such as participant's blogs. Finally, I see no real information that should be on a user page that cannot co-exist with this article. My vote, do not delete because some people don't know how to contain themselves. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 09:45, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>The problem we have here is that eight of the votes are due to vanity or other reasons other than notability, such as the persons who are voting just to incite vandals. If these people feel the need to continue for a vote which has less backing of all the reasons, then, of course, they are free to. But, in reference to these people that feel the need to vote for a delete on NN, as per Wikipedia "curtesy rules" as I have read them, please explain your vote for us. As the Notability page says, not all notable subjects are famous or important. It is well understood by us that this article is not of a 100% neutral point of view, however, as Ï×¤×§SFGiants has put forward, to really have a complete grasp of the method and nature of a Wikipedia Article, an author would need 50-100 edits and the like. We don't have that amount of edits, nor did we when we started the aricle, however, we are working on trying to get our heads around this, and will continue to in the future, in the hopes to improve this article, as well as the greater Wikipedia. Also, this article doesn't fit under any of the eight entries under the "What Wikipedia is not" entry: "Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate collection of information", nor does it have anything to do with the future, or predictions. Even the Notablity article says that the definition of notability is subject to some conjecture, and that some editors may instead mean: original research, which this is clearly not, unverifiable, which this is, or a vanity page, which some people are now realising it is not this kind either. The article, by the Wikipedian definition of importance, is relevent to a reasonable number of people as well. Lack-of assumption seems to be key to the notability of an article, do not assume that something isn't notable because you havn't heard of it. There are people within our community that have heard of this tournament, and a substainial amount of these people read this article for the information it contains, such as winners, any new participants, etc. Also, I am not sure about this specifically, but if the first vote is how this article was put up for nomination for deletion, I believe that this nomination should be taken down because of the lack-of-backing for a nomination for vanity, as it is quite clear this is not a vanity article. I also raise the question as to how this page was "discovered", was it searched for, in which case it is somewhat notable, or was it a chance for someone else to just raise thier level of "activity" on thier own user page, and to appear more like an editor. Finally, please, tell us why this article should be taken down on terms of notability, not for one or two, but for the case of all the votes, so that you can pay us the curtesy and help us keep non-notable articles off this project. <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETex_Mex_f752.html" title="User:Tex Mex">Tex Mex</a> 04:54, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>By way of backing up my non-notable vote, as per the request by Tex Mex - the article does not establish <i>why</i> this poker tournament is notable. None of the players are notable, the venue isn't listed, the pot is a mere $2 per player, it has only been running since last year, and it does not receive media attention. It therefore appears to me to be a non-notable subject. <a href="../../../c/n/w/User%7ECnwb_9e49.html" title="User:Cnwb">Cnwb</a> 06:06, 20 March 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In order to give you a first flavor about the issues at stake, I would like to refer you to the following website that shows the result of a poll undertaken during the coming week and targeting around 100,000 Lebanese citizens (Sample representing 3% of the WHOLE LEBANESE POPULATION).</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>PLEASE CHECK THIS WEBSITE:</dd>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Then, I would suggest that you read the biased article developped by AladdinSE that totally contradicts the Lebanese opinion reflected by this poll, and many other polls that reflect the opinion of the majority of the Lebanese people.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It is not acceptable to delete the Lebanese version and to retain and protect the Syrian NEGATIVE AND BIASED version developed by AladdinSE.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I would propose that you APPEND this article along with the Syrian version of AladdinSE, as a starting point for discussion. We could afterwards discuss every detail, in order to reach some common understanding, and develop TOGETHER a unified version characterized by historical objectivity.</dd>

<dd>Hello, <a href="../../../f/a/r/User%7EFares_S_2d8d.html" title="User:Fares S">Fares_S</a>. It may well be that the present version of <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aoun_1049.html" title="Michel Aoun">Michel Aoun</a> does not reflect the view of a majority of Lebanese. However, this is not important here.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, Wikipedia is written from a <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">neutral point of view</a>, not from a Lebanese (or Syrian, or Swiss, or American...) point of view. So what all of you should do is work on a version of the article <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aoun_1049.html" title="Michel Aoun">Michel Aoun</a> that fairly presents <i>all</i> points of view, for example like "Lebanese think that he did X, while Syrians think that he did Y".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Second, this debate is not about the content of the article <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aoun_1049.html" title="Michel Aoun">Michel Aoun</a>. It is about whether the article Michel Aoun - A Lebanese Perspective should be kept. Wikipedia policy is clear here: It is a <a href="../../../p/o/v/WP%7EPOVFORK_52ab.html" title="WP:POVFORK">POV Fork</a> and must be deleted for this alone. It does not matter if it is the best thing ever written on Wikipedia. Take what's good about it and use it to make <a href="../../../m/i/c/Michel_Aoun_1049.html" title="Michel Aoun">Michel Aoun</a> better.</dd>

<p>Wonderful, useful, nicely formatted.... and unmaintainable. Wikipedia is not an almanac. I'm racking my brain for some place where this nice list could be kept... any ideas? If not, it would have to go, would it not? It will slowly rot... <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 08:33, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. From my talk page: I could redirect Sixtieth session of the United Nations General Assembly, the current session, to the list, archive it when the 60th session is over, and denote changes in ambassadors during that session if possible.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>We have articles on the membership of the U.S. House of Representatives with 435 members and manage to keep articles on every member, as well as an accurate list of every member, so I do not see how keeping track of an international body of less than 200 people should be more difficult. I came to Wikipedia looking for this list, and it wasn't there, so several months later I decided to spend a few hours tonight coding it myself.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>Even then, the United Nations clearly updates the list of ambassadors on their own periodically, and, with each update, marks the latest changes in membership. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDaniel_Bush_238d.html" title="User:Daniel Bush">Daniel Bush</a> 08:42, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Daniel, you make good points and I find them pretty compelling. I guess my concern is, what happens down the road when you go on to other stuff or - God forbid - are struck by a comet or something. However, since UN Ambassadorships are pretty dang notable, the idea that other people would likely step in and keep the list updated is a reasonable one, although one I'm not <i>sure</i> I find totally convincing. You bring up another issue,though, when you speak of linking.... Here is what Wikipedia has done for the list of 500 richest humans. Every year Forbes Magazine publishes a new one, so we have articles on (something all the lines of) "500 richest people (2004)", "500 richest people (2005)", etc (obviously each article is similar but not identical). I wonder if perhaps the article should not be <b>rename'<i>d to</i></b> <i>List of ambassadors to the United Nations (sixtieth session</i>? Since Wikipedia is not paper there is no reason not have a list for each session? <a href="../../../h/e/r/User%7EHerostratus_0c14.html" title="User:Herostratus">Herostratus</a> 16:16, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Absolutely not. One list is sufficient. Note that out of the 200 or so people on it, in the last year only 17 have been replaced. The year before, 36. That is not an unmaintainable figure. Once I've got every ambassador stubbed (already done 20 or so today), as they are replaced, it is not difficult to create a new category, called 'Category:Former ambassadors to the United Nations', and populate that. There's probably a ton of people who could akready go in that category. <a href="../../../p/r/o/User%7EProto_9b77.html" title="User:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">Proto</font></span></span></a><font color="#555555"><b>||</b></font><small><a href="../../../p/r/o/User_talk%7EProto_e025.html" title="User talk:Proto"><span style="text-decoration:none"><span style="text-underline:none"><font color="#007700">type</font></span></span></a></small> 17:07, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete or Merge</b> this article already had an afd on Feb. 9 05 with the result to merge into the <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> article. The closing administrator of the afd put <i>"I have no idea how to do this, so I'll just slap some templates on the article"</i> just to put a merge tag and wait for someone who knows how to merge articles to merge it into <a href="../../../s/h/i/Shi%27a_Islam_4b8a.html" title="Shi'a Islam">Shi'a Islam</a> (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Misconceptions_about_the_Shi%27a_9cc2.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Misconceptions about the Shi'a">See here for previous Afd</a>). Some contributors to the article however keep on consistantly taking out these merge tags however to try and save the article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Misconceptions_about_the_Shi%27a&amp;action=history" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Misconceptions_about_the_Shi%27a&amp;action=history" rel="nofollow">See the Page history</a>). So, since the revert war has been going on for some time now, I figured I'd just put up another afd in the article because just leaving the merge tag would result in the tag being taken off. With regards to why this article should be deleted, it is essentially a <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">fork</a> article which is enough to warrant deletion and in addition is not very well written.

<dl>
<dd>However from my web-name, you can tell that I am a urologist and as a 'radical prostate cynic' I have read a lot of literature on cancer of the prostate and the complications of its treatment. At present your article does not say Helgason's age, qualifications, area of interest (e.g public health, surgery or social work), rank or position at the Karolinska.</dd>
<dd>All we have established is that he has about 40 citations and 33 of these are listed at pubmed. Reviewing these he is the first or last author of 14 and about 10 are in international, first rate journals.This compares with Walsh, Pat (I bet this comes out red) who has over 500 citations mostly in J Urol.</dd>
<dd>Interestingly the most important articles in the treatment of prostate cancer in the last 5 years have come from Sweden e.g.(N Engl J Med. 2005 May 12;352(19):1977-84).These articles have multiple authors but Helgason is not one of them.</dd>
<dd>In short I believe I am in a position to know who the major workers in Prostate cancer are and Helgason is not one of them.</dd>
<dd>By the way, Helgason's papers are usually co-authored by 5 or 6 - is it your intention to write vanity pieces about all of them? --<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 04:41, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

Wikipedia is not PubMed. Additional evidence of notariety outside PubMed might change my mind, such as if he has been quoted (more than once) in newspaper stories as an expert about his field.

<li><b>Comment:</b> Helgasons work has had substantial impact in the field of treatment for localized prostate cancer in Scandinavia. His contribution has been to highlight the importance of quality of life aspects after treatment (e.g. impotence, urinary leakage) and bring to light that a substantial number of prostate cancer patients are emotionally isolated in spite of present psychosocial support, indicating that psychosocial services need to be adjusted for the needs of men.

<p><b>COMMENT 2</b>: There appears to be some miss understanding by someone called Porturology that Helgason is urologist. As far as I can see from Swedish publications Helgason is no urologist. He (I think) is psychologist and public health scientist. He is involved in several aspects of health including psychological effect off treatment for different cancers and tobacco prevention. For me he is best known for his work in stop smoking services but I can recall front page articles in Swedenâs biggest newspapers (and TV) some years ago on his studies regarding sexual interest of old men and how treatment for prostate cancer could ruin menâs life since they became impotent etc. I tried to find these articles but they seem not still to be on the internet. However I did find many media articles links (directly to newspaper articles) from Sweden and other Nordic countries that are still available on the internet for Helgason. Most are on his work in tobacco and emotional problems for men with prostate cancer. I my view Helgason is outstanding for his clinical impact on so different fields = tobacco cessation, impotence, quality of life, prostate cancer, emotional problems, care of dying patients and their spouses etc.. In Sweden there are few people with this wide spectrum of impact. Also I looked at his over scientific publications (some were helgason a and some helgason ar) and as I can see they are more the 50? I did not know that he also was doing research in getetics in Iceland. This is what I found just now as links to on line newspaper articles on Swedish search engines. I tried to explain in English what each article is about:</p>

<li>Comment I have alittle difficulty with your posting. This is your first and so far only contribution with Wp. You pretend disinterest in the subject (e.g.you are not sure what his qualifications or profession is) but you then are able to quote numerous news clippings in which he is mentioned. This has many of the signs of sock-puppetry.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 06:20, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I don't think you read Porturology's comments very well. It is not that he believes Dr. Helgason is a urologist, but that as a urologist himself, he has a more expert perspective on the significance of Dr. Helgaon's research. Generally the most important authors to a scientific paper are listed first or last; of Dr. Helgason's approx. 50 publications, only 14 list him as first or last author. This is an indication of a respectable career, but is not (in my mind) evidence that he is important enough to list in an encyclopedia. He may in fact be more important within Iceland/Scandanavia than his publication record suggests to some of us. You are free to try and improve the article during the debate if you wish. Explain the context and significance of his research within Iceland or Scandanavia and include references to significant national newspapers that quote him regarding his research.<a href="../../../t/h/a/User%7EThatcher131_a696.html" title="User:Thatcher131">Thatcher131</a> 05:35, 19 March 2006 (UTC)

<li>Thank you User:Thatcher 131 You have admirably expressed my opinion. One of Helgason's main interests is the complications of treatment of Cancer of the Prostate. I know this literature very well and Helgason with &lt;10 articles, of which he is the prime author, in first class journals is no where near being an internationally noted expert in this field. I am surprised he has not personally intervened in this debate as it must be terribly embarrasing for him.--<a href="../../../p/o/r/User%7EPorturology_8c86.html" title="User:Porturology">Porturology</a> 06:13, 19 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>MERCY MY FRIENDS</b>: When I opened my e-mail this morning I had received mail from a person drawing my attention to an ongoing debate on this internet cite regarding my works and my person. After having scanned through what has been written (since I sent in my comment and asked people to stop) I feel I have to commend on some of the things stated in this strange debate:</p>
<p>1)In my previous mail I published my e-mail address so that people could communicate with me directly. I am therefore a little surprised that âPorturologyâ did not write directly to me with his questions. And âPorturologyâ you are right, this is a little embarrassing for me but also amusing. Makes you feel like a PhD student defending a thesis. Unfortunately I have other things to do than to follow debates on the internet. I actually though I had put a stop to the debate with my previous comment.</p>
<p>2) Nordic/Scandinavian people do not like to discuss their own work. It is considered to be inappropriate (especially in Sweden)to sell your self in any way. I know this is somewhat different in other countries but there you go! Different behaviour protocols in different parts of the world is what makes the world interesting.</p>
<p>3) When I did my PhD in 1997 on prostate cancer it received a lot of media attention. Probably not because it was a good work of science. Probably mainly because it dealt with subjects of media interest like sexual functioning, and the dilemma of trade-off between intact sexual function and curative treatment for localized prostate cancer. Also, it included a population based epidemiological study on male sexual functioning in men without prostate cancer up to 80 years that was considered to be relatively representative owing to a fair response rate. Also. at the time there was a heated debate in Scandinavia (and still is) on whether or not to treat localized prostate cancer with curative intent in if so what treatment to choose. So I became the victim of circumstances. My interest in the prostate cancer debate (treat or not to treat) diminished after I realized that there is a lot of politics and money involved and strong lobby groups primarily interested in selling them selves and their products. After that my work in the field has mainly been on emotional isolation of middle aged men and prostate cancer patients. However, emotional isolation in men is a also a typical media subject. So the bottom line is that my work in the area of prostate cancer has probably had this impact in the media owing to the nature of the subject. This media attention is troublesome since it takes up lots of time an energy and is nothing to strive for.</p>
<p>4)I thank âKnutâ for his (her?) interest in my work (thanks for these links). However, I need to correct him/her on one aspect. My works on medical and psychological databases are unfortunately presented under both Helgason AR and Helgason A. This often leads to some confusion since my brothers name is Agnar Helgason and he also publishes under Helgason A. Articles on genetics published under Helgason A. are my brothers articles, not mine. I know less about genetics than an average chimpanzee. Sorry if I disappointed you on that.</p>
<p>5)I do not fully understand the focus on my prostate cancer research in this ongoing debate on my work. The fact is that my work on tobacco prevention and in particular smoking cessation (both clinical, educational and scientific) far outweighs my work in prostate cancer at the moment. I have PhD students in health psychology in two different departments at the Karolinska = public health sciences and oncology and presently my work in smoking cessation takes up 75% of my time. Presently we are e.g. developing a telephone based service for risk drinkers based on our experience of running a smoking cessation quitline from 1998. These services are free of charge and rigorously evaluated. In oncology my PhD students (at the moment)are mainly doing work in palliative care. So please âUser:Porturologyâ and others cool down the prostate cancer debate.</p>
<p>6) I do not understand why people do not use their real names in debates like this? It is much more interesting to know who you are talking to. Is this some kind of policy on the Wikipedia?</p>

<p><b>Delete</b>. The article "Point system for penalties" has existed since May 2005. In that time, no explanation has ever been added to this non-article describing what a "point system for penalties" is. The sum total of the article is a "list" of countries that have "point systems for penalties" that includes only two items. The only article linking to "Point system for penalties" is "<a href="../../../r/o/a/Road_Traffic_Safety_Law_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China_0ff4.html" title="Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China">Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China</a>". That article states, among other features of the law, that "The point system for penalties was integrated into the new law." It does not explain what the "point system for penalties" is, how it works, how important it is, or what this means to citizens. Instead, it links to "Point system for penalties", which, in lieu of explanation, states, "see Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China." This reflexive loop provides no information about the topic. A template citing lack of sufficient context was placed in July 2005, and was removed by another user the same day. I placed another such banner in February 2006 and added the comment to the talk page that I would be nominating the article for deletion the week ending 17 March 2006 if no additional information had been added. There has been no activity on the article since I placed the {{context}} template. This is not an article, it expresses no useful information, and it serves no purpose other than to take up space. Clearly no one has any interest in saving it, and after my involvement I still have no better idea of what a "point system for penalties" is. Delete it. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECanonblack_67f7.html" title="User:Canonblack">Canonblack</a> 12:25, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If I am allowed to reiterate, <a href="../../../j/c/u/User%7EJcuk_0c1b.html" title="User:Jcuk">Jcuk</a> the "article" has been "alive" for ten months and no one has yet seen fit to expand this into an article at all; why should we expect this to change in the future? Without <i>defining what a point system for penalties or motoring offences is</i>, the article is meaningless. In response to <a href="../../../n/i/f/User%7ENiffweed17_42c4.html" title="User:Niffweed17">Niffweed17, Destroyer of Chickens</a>, there is no data here to merge. The point is that a "point system for penalties" is not described here or in the parent article. Simply merging the two named countries into the parent article is meaningless when the <i>subject itself</i> has not been defined.

<li><b>Keep</b> We'd all prefer that the creators of the page had given their attentions to something of a "core" encyclopedic nature, I guess, but this is clearly of interest to any player of the game, and the main article for the game is already too large to contain it.

<li><b>Cleanup and keep</b> In the light of other comments and a review of the material, I think that removing the how-to parts of the article would be an efficient compromise. <a href="../../../%28/a/e/User%7E%28aeropagitica%29.html" title="User:(aeropagitica)"><font style="background: #800080" face="Ariel" color="#FFFFFF"><b>&#160;(aeropagitica)&#160;</b></font></a> 18:04, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Keep</b> &amp; some cleanup.

<dd>Is this really the first time this kind of thing has occured such that it could be called precedent setting? I mean there are tons of articles on video game characters. Anyway I think it's fair to say that Wikipedia has a somewhat broader scope than other encyclopedias. <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDv82matt_009a.html" title="User:Dv82matt">Dv82matt</a> 02:13, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Now that I think about it the article should probably be renamed. Morrowind is a huge game with over 1000 characters and the article only lists a few of the most significant ones. Maybe it should simply be called "Characters in Morrowind" or maybe "Notable characters in Morrowind". <a href="../../../d/v/8/User%7EDv82matt_009a.html" title="User:Dv82matt">Dv82matt</a> 02:38, 22 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

I am strongly opposed to this deletion. I only have time presently for a few comments. I reserve the rigt to return and expand and revise my remarks. Mr. Deasy is a unique individual because of his education, temparment, skill, and training. He is a Phd. physicisct with heart. His a clear author who has introduced obscure physics, including the opaque Heim Theory to the masses. Deletion of this page would be a needless travesty. It was very useful to me in assesing the credibility of the Heim Theory wikipedia article. I'm increasingly dishearteded of the small mindedness of some of the Wikipedia community. As my three legged labrador retriever Max increasingly communicates, it cuts down on his beach play time replying to all the B.S. that goes on here.

<dd>AFter having had to deprive Max of some valuable beach play time, I have composed this addition to my above written comments, to wit:</dd>
<dd>I feel there is a case for retaining Hugh Deasy, as not only is his book "Grannies" rather good and entertaining, but he is known in other circles. As a cartoonist he was quite successful in the 1980s in Ireland, with one fine political cartoon, reproduced in his book, making the pick of the year of Phoenix, which is the Irish Private Eye. So he is not only self-published â others have posted his cartoons. edit on cartoons as cartoons in these present times seem to be able to move the world--Will314159 15:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>While on the subject of cartoons 2 or 3 in Phoenix, dozens in 'Disarm', where he worked on the editorial team and discovered he functioned well in running up a quick cartoon to illustrate a 'breaking news' item. He probably could have done that on a bigger circulation paper - but astro-research beackoned. In 'Disarm' he had a running cartoon strip. Also, came 2nd in the Sunday Times competition for shcool-children to complete a super-hero cartoon strip -his entry was then re-produced in full in one of the 3 largest circulation newspapers of the time, the "Irish Press".</dd>
<dd>But of course he was not always kow-towing to the establishment, so the fact that he published cartoons in the Irish CND newspaper Disarm might not please the powers that be â could this be a reason for the move against him&#160;:-) &#160;? Speaking Truth to Power!</dd>
<dd>So he is not only a bit of a writer but an acknowledged artist â he has exhibited at ESOC as you can see from his home-page. He was also a bit of a child prodigy, winning prizes for his poems on Irish TV and Radio. Note that he is also planning to bring out a book on a science topic later this year â this time with a science publisher. The Wikipedia policy is to support budding writers and painters â if they are in that situation of being excellent but yet relatively unknown, then it is not fair to deny them even a small stub of an article, I take it that this is not really the issue at stake here, but more the supposed vanity aspect.</dd>
<dd>However, note that struggling writers must be pro-active in some sense or they will die in obscurity. On top of all that he is part of a small team controlling such key satellites as Envisat (major environmental data source), Integral (gound-breaking observations of high energy astrophysical objects) and ERS-2 (data from which recently confirmed the growth of ice in central Antarctica). So yes, I think this page should be retained, as well as the companion article on his book and the mention he gets in his uncleâs page.</dd>
<dd>If the problem is that he wrote that article, then consider myself the author of the Hugh Deasy article, and therefore that impediment is thereby removed. Max sends his felicitations.</dd>
<dd>the above comments have been relocated from the "Hugh Deasy" article Discussion Page.</dd>
<dd>Addition. I was led to the Wikipedia Heim Theory Article by the stupendous publlicity on Heim theory in 2006 due to the New Scientist and Scotsman article about the recent paper about the Hyperspace aspects and the Air Force taking the FTL aspects seriously. The talk pages turned up the name HDeasy consistently and Googling revealed his identity. He has revealed himself to be the most consistent and lucid elaborator of that theory. He is cogent writer and a PhD physicist and a working scientist. this is a rare combination. As a budding writer, illustrator, and cartoonist, that rare combination deserves a Wiki contribution. I plan to do a rewrite of the article in a few days.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">user:Will314159</a> 15:10, 16 March 2006 (UTC)

<p><b>Delete</b> Clearly Vanity. I believe that he is the Physicist that you are refering to above. Although I am lead to believe (by somebody who claims to know him) that he has spent the last twenty years working at ESAs ESOC control center. In ESOC he works on very simple parts of a number of missions, all in a very minor role. I would also appear that the only person defending this page is the user Will314159. Looking at the edits that this user does shows a bit of a history of defending anything Hugh Deasy posts to the wiki. This, in addition to the rather curious way that the Will describes Hugh Deasy i.e. in the manner of an intimate friend (he does seem to know an increable amount of detail about him), and the writing style, which seems very, very similar to Mr Deasy's himself, I would rather suspect the Will314159 is a ghost account created by Mr Deasy to back up his own none existant claims.<small>âThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 192.171.3.126 (talk â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_192.171.3.126_be24.html" title="Special:Contributions/192.171.3.126">contribs</a>) .</small></p>

<li><b>Comment</b> These rebuttals and surrebuttals are well surrealistic. Either you are criticized for having no personal knowledge and therefore not being verifiable. Or if you have personal knowledge and can verify facts, then you are a friend and are biased. For those skeptical souls that think the aforementioned and here dissected Irishman Hugh Deasey on this St. Patrick's day is NON NOTABLE, kindly do a GOOGLE search on his name. then please report back the number of hits. Moreover, compare the number of hits to some of the Wiki subjects of the articles you have authored. And if those subjects come out with less hits, let's start nominating those less notable personalities for deletion.

<li><b>Comment</b> I am working on a major rewrite of the subject page. While taking a break, i noticed most of the posters above are unsigned or ANONYMOUS. I too share with Slowmover, I see that from his information, a love for APL but have now discovered Maxima. I noticed he has authored numerous articles on minor actors in the OUTER LILMITS sci fi series. This brings up the problem of balance in Wikipedia. Stargate 1 has a portal with episode guides. We have an episode guide to all of the SEINFELD series. You can elucidate yourself on Babylon 5. But you have a problem with "Hugh Deasy." For me the context of "Hugh Deasy" is that he is the foremost popularizer of Heim Theory in the English Language. Heim Theory is tremondously important is that it is a brute force take the Bull by the Horns direct quantization of General Relativity. Heim quantized spacetime directly and used a discrete form of calculus to avoid the singularity. Unfortunately in his old age Heim started using mystical terms and became embraced by New Age Gurus. Deasy with his Physics knowledge and familiarity with Sring Theory and LOQ cuts through the BULL and gives a scientific assesment. Heim Theory has recently climbed to the news and is being taken very seriously by certain Aerospace circles. That is the importance of the "Hugh Deasy" article. To give this author the support he deserves for his tireless effort. Yes, he is a notable cartoonist and author and has other interests. But I have revealed my interest and my entry in the discussion. I wish the detractors would be as honest and not hide behind their anonynimity.--<a href="../../../w/i/l/User%7EWill314159_8d98.html" title="User:Will314159">user:Will314159</a> 17:35, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Sign your post with 4 tilde characters (~) at the end and the wiki software will insert your username and a timestamp when it processes your edit. And please let's not make this worse by arguing semantics about what is "anonymous" and what is not. In Wikipedia, editors who don't sign in and contribute under a chosen username are considered "anonymous", even though their real-world identity may not be known. IP addresses can be spoofed, etc, but user logins are more reliably from the same person each time, so they develop a local identity here over time which earns them credibility. That's the point. <a href="../../../s/l/o/User%7ESlowmover_6914.html" title="User:Slowmover">Slowmover</a> 20:58, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</dd>

The details about the Heim theory don't belong on that page. The link to the Heim theory page is enough; the duplication of this content is a bad attempt to make the article longer. Also note, that these statements are not accepted by the scientific community, this is not made clear in the addition. I don't think believe anyone wants this page removed for political or personal reasons.

<li><b>Comment</b> Let's see what we can agree on. First, the rules: The subject article is a biography of a still living person. The criteria is notability. A google search result is evidentce. What facts can we agree on. This has turned into a lively discussion. There are many comitted and vociferous anonymous detractors. That in itself speaks for notability and being famous. Some of the criticisms are petty. They admit that Mr. Deasy is a "rocket scientist" but say he is a "minor" rocket scientist. They admit he is a cartoonist, but say he only has "one" cartoon. Others say the Wiki article is self published and a vanity article. The proponent says as a budding author, there is a certain amount of self-promotion, in any case the article has been rewritten by another, the cartoonist career is much more extensive, he is a published author. His Google hit count stands at 59,100. While it is not the quality and not the quantity of hits that is persuasive, the quantity is not easily discounted. Mr. Deasy has made a name for himself as the leading English speaking elucidator of Heim theory. It's the quality of the elucidation that counts here. Heim theory had been embraced by a New Age following. But Heim theory is a honest to goodness quantization of the metric of General Relativity by a creative invention of a discrete calculus equivalent to what is now called the finite method for Tensor Calculus. it takes a physicist to appreciate that and to put it in proper context and Mr. Deasy is the man that did it. He was and is uniquely qualified by his training, experience, skill, bacground, artistic background, to bridge this esoteric and obscure theory to the English Speaking World. To me that makes him notable and famous To appreciate that, you have to be more than a programmer, you have to have a physics &amp; a liberal arts background. But the most telling argument of all for the retention of the subject article is the length of this page and the extent of it. Surely that interest engendered herein is the most telling for the retention of the subject article. Take Care!--24.179.98.1 15:41, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Can I suggest you put your name in double quotes when working out your Google hit count so that you don't unnecessarily over-inflate your ego. A Google on "Hugh Deasy" yields a mere 223 hits while the 59,000 is picking up lots of unrelated pages. And, if you really think Google hit counts are a good measure of fame, there are 29,800 for my name (with quotes) but no Wikipaedia entry (nor should there be). (Most hits for my name are online book stores selling a book I co-wrote). I think the page should be deleted because it seems quite clearly a vanity page and the only user other than Hdeasy in favour of keeping it has a suspiciously similar writing style (bar the occasional accidentally on purpose typo). <small>âThis <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Opk (<a href="../../../o/p/k/User_talk%7EOpk_48de.html" title="User talk:Opk">talk</a> â¢ <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Opk_8ae0.html" title="Special:Contributions/Opk">contribs</a>) .</small> <b>User's 2nd edit at Wikipedia</b> --<a href="../../../k/i/n/User%7EKingboyk_1675.html" title="User:Kingboyk">kingboyk</a> 12:03, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> First off, I'd like to point out that being the most noted pusher of an somebody elses idea (or theory, if you wish) is very nobel &amp; should be encouraged, but this does not merit the inclusion of your own personal entry. As pointed out above, that is what the user pages are for. In refernece to the number of hits Hugh Deasy gets on google, the answer is 225 (not thousands, 225). Of the 225 pages you find that they are mostly links to entires in the wiki (created by the person himself), refreneces to his self published book (created by himself), his personal web page (created by himself), and references in physic group talk pages (again, created by himself). There is absolutly no merit for the inclusion of this page. A self published book, and a cartoon allegedly printed in a magazine thirty years ago are the only items that can be consided here. The support of Heim Theory can not. In the future, should it prove that Hugh Deasy's work in bring Hiem Thoery to the world has a lasting import to mankind, then somebody can think about including a page.

<li><b>Comment</b> Battling with "nattering nabobs of negativity" to use a hitsorical phrase is second nature and "no problemo." There is a lot of latent agression and spite quite unbecoming to a beacon of knowlege on this board but that is a horse of a different color. There seems to be a "legion de deleteurs" ready to spring forth and issue execution warrants on this board akin to the reign of terror. By the way, Googling a term in quotes does indeed act as a filter but deletes pertinent search results and is not a measure of notability or prevalance or famousness in the online community. I could have summoned and organized a " legion of includeurs" to counter the "deleteurs" but I chose not to. I preferred to draw the smallminded people out. The neutral comments are appreciated. The provocative and <i>ad hominem</i> comments belong to low class people unworthy of being associated with a great encyclopedia. . Take Care!--Will314159 17:44, 20 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>This person seems to be on the threshhold of notability for Wikipedia. I'm forcing the issue for three reasons: (1) there are several claims made in the article that need citations, including one about the film <i>Proof</i> that should be in IMDb if it's true, but isn't there; (2) Wikiquote now also has <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Paul_Sally" class="extiw" title="q:Paul_Sally">an article on this person</a> (which has also been nominated for deletion), using the WP article to support a notability claim; and (3) to get a current "temperature" on the WP community's feelings about professor notability. I'm hoping this review will encourage interested editors to improve both articles in order to convince the respective communities with <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, <a href="../../../r/e/l/Wikipedia%7EReliable_sources_7c0b.html" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a> for the anecdotes and quotes. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 15:43, 16 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> - one of the more important professors at the University of Chicago, which is one of the five or six best math schools in the US. He is widely considered an innovator in the teaching of mathematics. He runs (and I believe started) an influential teaching program which trains high school teachers in higher mathematics. Because he is funny and charismatic, some of his former students have added amusing anecdotes to his article, which I believe is what is motivating this move for deletion. That doesn't mean he isn't notable; <a href="../../../r/i/c/Richard_Feynman_1f56.html" title="Richard Feynman">Richard Feynman</a> is a good example of an eminent scientist who is also an amusing personality.

<li><b>Keep</b>. I think if you look at the discussion on the talk page of the article so far, you will see that I am among the foremost of critics of the article that believe things should be verified and notability established and so forth. But I can't agree with your motivation for nominating this article for AFD. AFDs should be kept distinct from content disputes. If you dispute some assertion, AFD is not supposed to be a battleground for verifying some fact. Not to mention that the disputed facts are not what I would regard as essential to a claim of notability. The article claims he is a widely recognized math educator. This has nothing to do, for example, with whether he was the math consultant for the movie "Proof" or whether some anecdote about him is correct. It has plenty to do with the achievements and awards noted. In fact, my research into this has convinced me he is more than notable enough and not anywhere near the "gray" area that you would need to see where to draw the line. In addition, I suspect his research may be quite significant also, but I have difficulty determining this due to my lack of expertise, which is why I have prodded others on this talk page to supply the info. --<a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChan-Ho_Suh_fb4b.html" title="User:Chan-Ho Suh">Chan-Ho</a> <a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChan-Ho_Suh_d5f7.html" title="User talk:Chan-Ho Suh">(Talk)</a> 07:20, 18 March 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I apologize for making this nomination sound like it was primarily a content dispute by listing that reason first of the three that I gave, but as I said above, I had two others that led me to make this a general AfD instead of my usual talk page discussions. The possibility of an AfD had been raised twice already on the article's talk page, so I was hardly out of line to make it official. Frankly, I suspected it would pass, and the above votes seem to be confirming this. However, I saw no point in raising the content issue if the article was going to be deleted, so I waited until the consensus was strongly leaning toward "keep" to post the specific content argument on the talk page. Finally, Wikiquote, which rarely has more than 2 or 3 participants in its AfDs (still VfDs there), benefits greatly from Wikipedian input on debatable articles that have been nominated in both projects. I felt that this nomination would clear up doubts already expressed <i>here</i>, help Wikiquote in its efforts, and perhaps incidentally resolve the content issue, one way or another. I believe this was an efficient multiple use of this forum. ~ <a href="../../../j/e/f/User%7EJeffq_074c.html" title="User:Jeffq">Jeff Q</a>&#160;<a href="../../../j/e/f/User_talk%7EJeffq_cdb7.html" title="User talk:Jeffq">(talk)</a> 10:28, 18 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Delete</b> The article as is, although, after the last edits, the text is mainly mine, contains no useful information at all. We need either to purge it or get a proper article with historical references to <b>Nationalism</b> in general vs. the Icelandic <b>Ã¾jÃ³Ã°ernishyggja</b> which are not the same concepts. In order to deal with the topic one would need to compare nationalism and patriotism (both of which are covered elsewhere) and provide the history of the very few genuinely nationalistic "nationalistic" movements in Iceland. The only example I can think of is the extremely ineffectual Nazi Party, which did in fact exist, but was mostly the object of derision. <a href="../../../i/o/_/User%7EIo_b23c.html" title="User:Io">Io</a> 19:16, 15 March 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>And to those say otherwise, try to explain that to myself and the others that meet at my ku'rapha home group gatherings. When we see lives changed daily because of the words and support of our spiritual brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Yes, some people tell me that I can't believe something that they refer to as nonsensical new age crap.</p>
<p>But wasn't one of the reasons people came to america was to have the freedom to worship their God in the way they saw best, and is it so wrong that I want to share with others the joy that I found in Ku'rapha?</p>
<p>I don't want to press my beliefs on anyone. In fact part of Ku'rapha is equality, and the includes other religions and belief structures. Ku'rapha is about providing a different way of looking at the world. And providing support for those in need.</p>

<li>Do Not Delete and myself stating that I believe this, does not make it notable??? I'm sorry but it seems like you are telling me that my beliefs are not valid.

<li>DO NOT DELETE: You say that, but could not the same be said of many of the other beliefs on this site? Besides... these aren't so much my "deep thoughts" as you call them, as they are the beliefs of a body of people. "religion is defined 1. Belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers regarded as creator and governor of the universe. 2. A personal or institutionalized system grounded in such belief and worship. 3. The life or condition of a person in a religious order. 4. A set of beliefs, values, and practices based on the teachings of a spiritual leader. 5. A cause, principle, or activity pursued with zeal or conscientious devotion." My belief.... OUR belief is OUR religion.

<li>&#160;:DO NOT DELETE: I don't think that it's wrong for this to come up for discussion, but I do think it wrong that people say that it's not a valid belief when that are MANY people who belief this to be truth. I started a study group in late 1999, with a group a people who wanted to find the truth. And decided that the truth was everywhere and no where at the same kind. The name Ku'rapha came about because of our groups rituals of tattoos and piercing. Ku - Chinese for pain. and Rapha - Hebrew for healer. for in the pain of the Tattoos and Piercing, we found spiritual healing. not unlike many African tribes do. After much debate, we decided to write out the something to post it on our favorite internet website. Wikipedia.org. We thought that the Wikipedia community would be most open to us. and help us in our quest for global legitimacy. I pray you keep this Ku'rapha page up in Wikipedia's online database, in order to show others that it is okay to think for yourself. to question the things you've been taught growing up. For the truth to set you free, you most first know that truth. and how can one find the truth, if you do not question everything? you can't. You don't have to believe my beliefs to be the way to God or Enlightenment. Please Except them as OUR Valid beliefs. ~~ Russell L.

<li>Right, but how do we verify your claims? Is it unfair for us to ask for some way to verify what you say? You understand the need for verification, right? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P. Smith Sr. Jr.">Bobby P.

<li>Verify to me that the Angel Moroni came and spoke to Joseph Smith. you can't. All you can say is that 'some guy' said this, or 'some gal' said that. Am I not also 'some guy' who is able to make statements as well? The validity of those statements were made on someones spoken word. Now I might not be speaking these words aloud to you, but I'm saying them never the less. The religious belief of Ku'rapha is valid, and notible enough to be placed on Wikipedia. ~ RLD</li>
<li>The idea is not to verify the truth of your beliefs - it is to verify your claim that "many" people hold them. Sorry, I should have been more clear. Anyway, <i>how</i> many people actively follow ku'rapha? And can you verify that number, or some number like it? <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<li>I don't know what a number will prove, being that you are so set on disblief. that and i can't prove to you the number. i mean, all i have in a word. and in my belief my word is enough. the strong stand against our belief shows that world really isn't as open minded as we believe it to be.... to answer your question on number. 4 groups ranging from 8 to 15 memembers each, and we're been growing fast.... so do whatever you want. delete, don't delete, it doesn't matter. i'll just repost this once we get our website up. and again.... and again.... i'll repost it add info... report it add info. until you stupid people are happy. i understand that the enemy was blinded the eyes of the unbeliever, and i understand that i can only do the work of a man. but nothing can happen outside the will of the Observer. so if this is the will of "o" i'll will accept it. ~RLD</li>

<li>Do Not Delete per above Rev. Po-Jay The size of the following should not be in question. The only question at hand is "does this purposely mislead the users of this reference tool?" The answer to this question is NO. It is an informative look into the Ku'Rapha belief. This is merely a start. There are followers of this religion. Remember, there is a separation of Church and of State. Our Constitution has ensured this. Based on this separation, law cannot declare someone's beliefs to be unconstitutional, unless they violate other peopleâs freedoms. This document provides no extremely controversial information. This document harbors no ill-will to other people or religions. This is merely an honest attempt to document a theology that is in its infancy. To delete this is to stifle R.L. Davis and his followers. Is it asking too much to allow this document to survive? I could spend a few hours and point you to many article within this tool that provide dis-information, so why kill an article with real merit?

<dd><b>Comment</b> Wikipedia is not the government, so the constitution is irrelevant. The only relevant questions for listing in Wikipedia are: Is it <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>? No. Nobody except the person or persons posting here have ever heard of it. Is it <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">notable</a>? No. Same reason. That's all.

Also, there is the <a href="../../../h/e/a/Heaven%27s_Gate_%28cult%29_f833.html" title="Heaven's Gate (cult)">Heaven's Gate (cult)</a>, with only <b>39 Members</b> and they are on here (yeah, i know they were a bit "crazy" but that's not the point). I don't agree the number of members as reason not to list a religion. Even Jesus Christ only started out with 12 followers, granted Wikipedia wasn't around then, but I think you made my point about number members not being the real factor. ~ RLD(User:Rdsvn01)</li>

<li>Do you want to Verify it? You are most welcome to join one of our meetings. There are many people there who are more than willing to talk to you about Ku'rapha as our combined faith.

So you can meet us and see that it is very much real, That way you can be a "VERIFIABLE" source. But, Po-Jay already did that for me. I'd Like to note that Po-Jay isn't an active Member of Ku'rapha. But he has joined us for a few 3F groups. (fyi: 3F stands for "Fun, Food, and Fellowship", and 3F groups are a great time for Ku'raphites and Non-Ku'raphites alike)...

<dd>This deletion is nothing personal against you or your religion - Wikipedia has fairly well-established guidelines about notability and verifiability. Verifiability requires published sources of some kind - click on this link: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. The policy is non-negotiable - it's <i>not</i> meant as an insult against your religion, it's meant to protect Wikipedia and make it a more reliable source. Please try to understand that this is nothing personal against you - you seem like an impassioned person with strong beliefs, and that's admirable. It's just that until your religion is better-established and has published sources that document it and its membership, we <i>can't</i> include it here without violating the consensus rules of the community.

<li>yes i have... many times over now, but the rub still remains. it states that the article needs "credible references" and "credible sources" but never defines what "credible" is. I consider myself credible, thus making me a credible reference and/or credible source. It also states that "Wikipedia articles <b>should</b> use reliable published sources," but never does it say that it <b>NEEDS</b> reliable published sources. Though still "reliable sources" is defined by having some credibility to it. now going back to what i stated before, i consider myself CREDIBLE. Whether you wish to accept that is up to you, but in no way violates the "Reliable sources" or "Verifiability" policies set forth by Wikipedia. ~ RLD (User:Rdsvn01)</li>

You say that Joseph Smith's meeting with the Angel Moroni is "Vefifiable" but he was the only person who was there. and none of you have ever spoken with him. i'm here now, telling you that these are my beliefs, and that mine and my follower's beliefs should be aloud to be heard. and left for others to read about. if that's what you call "mumbo jumbo", so be it. ~ RLD (Fifth opinion by this user. <a href="../../../g/a/z/User%7EGazpacho_8dfc.html" title="User:Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a>)

<li>Do Not Delete per above Rev. Po-Jay Okay Gentlemen, we are splitting hairs. While it is true, this is being discussed outside of the "Wikipedia" confines, it by no means should give anyone the impression that it is a joke. This is a serious topic. I find it very entertaining that a website such as this, would even question the validity of that which cannot be validated. This is a Theology Gentlemen. R.L. Davis' Theology has as much right to be here as any other. I will tell you something else that may confuse or infuriate you... I am an Ordained Minister and according to YOUR requirements to prove validity, my nod counts as validation. Should I present you with the Doctrine of my Ordination? I can very easily do so. I find it so hard to believe that a tool, such as Wikipedia, that has historically not "always" been exactly factual, cannot let an religion document its existance. I am not a practicing member of this Ku'Rapha, but I totally support it's motive and physical existence. Let this be the end, my brothers... I will leave you with a re-itteration. I am a Reverend and I say it is valid. That makes it valid, according to your own rules. BTW- I am Rev. Jason E. Brown (re:earlier posting) as doctrinated on my papers. (Sixth opinion by same user.)

<li>Please just read this: <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. That's wikipedia policy. This is nothing against your religion, and it's nothing against your personal credibility. It's just that we need a <i>reputable published source</i> documenting your religion and its membership. As I said above, if you ever get such documentation, I will happily vote "keep" next time you make an article about Ku'rapha. <a href="../../../b/o/b/User%7EBobby_P._Smith_Sr._Jr._bd1d.html" title="User:Bobby P.

<p>DO NOT DELETE!! do you realize that you are asking RLD to prove all ov the worlds religions! he stated that it is based off of all beliefs. so here is the thought- untill all of you jackasses can prove that Jesus really did rise form the grave and Moses really prted the Red Sea, and spoke to a burning bush and can proveid this proof and its not hearsay. you have no proof of your beliefs eother. lets face it thats all they ar is your beliefs nothing more.being that i am a trans-channeling intuitive medium, and my guide is a Pharaoh from ancient Egypt and has first hand knowledge of the MISSinterpritations of the bible, here is a clue- its symbolic NOT literal- it was the REED sea he alledgedly parted not the RED sea. my advise to all of you re-read EXIDUS and do it with an open mind.68.225.200.180 13:43, 18 March 2006 (UTC)Prince Pharaoh</p>

<p><b>Last statement...</b> sorry.... here is the deal, Ku'rapha is my belief. And it is very real to myself and others.... but i totally agree with the fact that there is NOT enough information to have it placed on Wikipedia. it's just that i enjoy to argue. even when i know i am wrong, and will lose. you all will be seeing ku'rapha again as a entry... BUT i will be prepared with more "reliable sources" to back myself help. and when that time comes, i hope to see you all here again. Thank you all for the great time. And sorry for causing all this so called unfunny joke. (which i also disagree on&#160;;] ) so until we all meet again. good-bye ~ RLD (User:Rdsvn01)</p>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> It is definitely <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>; CNN et al covered it pretty extensivly when it happened. It also had some long term effects in the state of Michigan as laws were later passed to expel and bar anyone convicted of participation in a riot from all public universities in Michigan. The article itself is rather poorly written though and makes no strong case for inclusion or importance. I actually witnessed this incident (well part of it anyway) and to this day one of the funniest displays of idiocy I've ever seen is a drunk college kid pick up a canister of tear gas that landed by him to throw it back at the police; thus burning his hand AND getting a big dose of gas in his mouth and eyes as he yowled in pain. I can't really say Wikipedia is any richer for having this article but I'm invoking <a href="../../../i/a/r/WP%7EIAR_951f.html" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> for a keep.

<li><b>Tentative keep</b>. While the editing pattern surrounding this article (particularly the dumps to other wikis of a basic stub) do look rather like astroturfing, I <i>think</i> the French wikipedia article (<a href="../../../../fr/d/a/n/Daniel_Schneidermann_d1e5.html" class="extiw" title="fr:Daniel_Schneidermann">fr:Daniel Schneidermann</a>) <i>looks</i> like he's sufficiently notable (writing for two very notable newspapers, appearing on TV, a number of books published).

When I click on a link in one of the subcategories in <a href="../../../g/o/l/Category%7EGolf_clubs_and_courses_561d.html" title="Category:Golf clubs and courses">Category:Golf clubs and courses</a> I want to find an article that might enhance my knowledge of golf.

I want to see all the golf categories well populated one day (I'm the biggest contributor to them) but not filled up with random clutter that makes it harder for people to identify worthwhile articles, and makes random clicking full and pointless.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I can't delete a golf course article based on a POV criteria like we should only have articles on "<i>the great courses</i>". If we are going to go down that road, why not just keep articles on the "<i>great</i>" universities, or the "<i>great</i>" highways, or the "<i>great</i>" towns, or the "<i>great</i>" football players, or the "<i>great</i>" stadiums? Why not make things simple and only have articles on films that have won academy awards, or scientists that have won nobel prizes, or hall of fame athletes? Everything else is just getting in the way of the random clicking, right? Well I hope we never go down that road. Life is made up of the great and the less great. This course must be important for the people who play on it and the local economy. Furthermore, this nom speaks like he owns the golf category and that he should be the one to decide what is <i>worthwhile</i> to be included. The editors who submitted the info did not see it as pointless, or "<i>random clutter</i>" and I'm satisfied that these editors are treating these courses in keeping with wikipedia standards. Therefore I see no grounds for removal. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:01, 17 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I can't delete a golf course article based on a POV criteria like we should only have articles on "<i>the great courses</i>". If we are going to go down that road, why not just keep articles on the "<i>great</i>" universities, or the "<i>great</i>" highways, or the "<i>great</i>" towns, or the "<i>great</i>" football players, or the "<i>great</i>" stadiums? Why not make things simple and only have articles on films that have won academy awards, or scientists that have won nobel prizes, or hall of fame athletes? Everything else is just getting in the way of the random clicking, right? Well I hope we never go down that road. Life is made up of the great and the less great. This course must be important for the people who play on it and the local economy. Furthermore, this nom speaks like he owns the golf category and that he should be the one to decide what is <i>worthwhile</i> to be included. The editors who submitted the info did not see it as pointless, or "<i>random clutter</i>" and I'm satisfied that these editors are treating these courses in keeping with wikipedia standards. Therefore I see no grounds for removal. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 01:03, 17 March 2006 (UTC)
