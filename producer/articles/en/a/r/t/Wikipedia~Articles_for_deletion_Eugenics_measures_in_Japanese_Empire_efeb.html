<p>This might be the most horribly garbled article I've ever seen.

<dd><b>Comment</b> Well done on cleaning it up. You should appreciate that many of us have no expertise in this area. So an Afd seems appropriate to me for the original state of the article - either somebody knows and cares, or they don't and if nobody does then delete is a good course of action. <a href="../../../d/l/y/User%7EDlyons493_783b.html" title="User:Dlyons493"><font color="#00FF00">Dl</font><font color="#44FF00">yo</font><font color="#99DD11">ns</font><font color="#DDDD11">493</font></a> <a href="../../../d/l/y/User_talk%7EDlyons493_049d.html" title="User talk:Dlyons493"><font color="#DDDD11">Ta</font><font color="#00FF00">lk</font></a> 13:07, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd><i>Comment on comment</i>: <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_deletion_baa2.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">The policy page</a> tells me things like 'use extreme caution merging any material', which I really don't like (merging is key to some clean-ups); and anyone can see this article should be moved to a grammatical title. So I don't accept that gun-to-the-head is a good way to expedite clean-up. <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7ECharles_Matthews_cceb.html" title="User:Charles Matthews">Charles Matthews</a>

<dd>Charles Matthews is definitely right about not using AfD for cleanup. We already <i>have</i> {cleanup} available as a tag, and that's much more appropriate (per nom who states in the AfD itself that the "topic is notable"). Voting "keep", BTW, doesn't obligate a voter to do the cleanup her/himself—doing so is great, but not everyone has expertise in everything. <a href="../../../l/u/l/User%7ELulu_of_the_Lotus-Eaters_298a.html" title="User:Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters">Lulu of the Lotus-Eaters</a> 16:31, 27 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Was cleaned up significantly since Paul's nomination.

<li><b>Move</b> What salvageable content is here should be moved to the 'Eugenics and the state, 1890s-1945' section of <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a>, which is a very fine article and is where readers can find additional information as well as context. With respect, I find the cleanup commendations confounding. The <a href="../../../e/u/g/Eugenics.html" title="Eugenics">Eugenics</a> article illustrates a number of highly dubious assertions in this. Most notably, the author has conflated a science (genetics) with a social philosophy (eugenics), unless I have somehow missed the Japanese eugenics degree available as a pre-war discipline. Also, the last line, <i>Eugenic thinking probably had wider effects. Japanese soldiers received instruction on how 'inferior' Asian and European races were to be treated. Military personnel who violated these instructions were severely punished</i> is nonsense. Since when did Japanese society, especially the military, need eugenics to promote a world-view based on racial superiority? Instead, the theory of eugenics and social Darwinism worked well within a social system that already fostered such a view. Bottom line: moving this to Eugenics will get this content the cleanup it desperately needs.

<li><b>Comment</b> I still stand by my nomination, and while the article is much less of a mess than it was, my reasons for the nomination included the lack of references, the vague information, and the poorly phrased article title. As I did indeed say, the topic is notable and article-worthy, but it would be better to have a one sentence stub than a badly titled, vague, sloppy article. Sure, I could have added the cleanup tag and forgotten about it, but in my opinion it's better to start from scratch. Hey, look, there is potential for an excellent article about the topic, but let's do it right, eh? (Note: I was going to follow Neutrality's suggestion and create the article Eugenics in imperial Japan, but I was unsure as to what the article itself should consist of.) <a href="../../../p/a/u/User%7EPaulHanson_59b8.html" title="User:PaulHanson">Paul</a> 19:16, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

<li>Will you vote to delete an article, not nominated here for lack of references, before requesting that references be supplied?

<li>Hi Charles. I did not want to vote, because I have no detailed knowledge about japanese war crimes. In this case I learned that some Wiki-Links lead to well documented articles <a href="../../../s/a/d/Sadao_Araki_3670.html" title="Sadao Araki">Sadao Araki</a> or <a href="../../../i/n/t/International_Military_Tribunal_for_the_Far_East_b0d0.html" title="International Military Tribunal for the Far East">International Military Tribunal for the Far East</a> for instance, so my critical question me be without substance.
