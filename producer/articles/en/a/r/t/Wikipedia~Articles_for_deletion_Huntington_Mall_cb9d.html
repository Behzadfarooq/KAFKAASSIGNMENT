<li><b>Delete</b> - Wikipedia is not a place to create an article for every mall in the US. The <a href="../../../m/a/l/Mall_of_America_3a18.html" title="Mall of America">Mall of America</a> is notable due to its astronomical size, but I find nothing notable about this one. --<a href="../../../z/s/i/User%7EZsinj_4f9a.html" title="User:Zsinj">Zsinj</a> 02:30, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> for now. The criteria for mall inclusion should probably be the focus of a centralized discussion. Until then, the articles should be kept by default. (note: I am now going to add that it is the largest mall in <a href="../../../w/e/s/West_Virginia_4016.html" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>, for what its worth. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 04:24, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Youngamerican. It'll be much easier to delete after such a discussion that to recreate it. My personal feeling is that it and similar large malls should stay. <i><b>×</b></i><a href="../../../m/e/e/User%7EMeegs_1f3c.html" title="User:Meegs">Meegs</a> 05:40, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Being the largest mall in WV isn't that big of a claim to fame (by itself). This mall looks no different than the hundreds of other malls across the country. If there is more to it than the standard department stores and being "the largest by area" in a small state, then it might be worthy of inclusion. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 15:20, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

Also delete <a href="../../../m/a/r/Martinsburg_Mall_dd26.html" title="Martinsburg Mall">Martinsburg Mall</a>, the other mall in <a href="../../../s/h/o/Category%7EShopping_malls_in_West_Virginia_d5a0.html" title="Category:Shopping malls in West Virginia">Category:Shopping malls in West Virginia</a>. - <a href="../../../s/q/u/User%7ESquibix_398c.html" title="User:Squibix"><span style="color:#000;">squibix</span></a><a href="../../../s/q/u/User_talk%7ESquibix_8aa7.html" title="User talk:Squibix"><span style="font-size:80%;color:#999;">(talk)</span></a> 18:58, 29 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. Just another shopping mall. That it's "the largest in [insert small political unit here]" means very little. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 00:48, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I've been doing some research on the mall about some crimes that have taken place there. In the 1980s, there was a serial rapist that attacked women in the then-poorly lit parking lot. A man was tried and convicted, only to have his convistion quashed years later when it turned out that the DNA lab guy was a liar and a fraud. Furthermore, just a few years ago, a Marshall University student named Samantha Burns was kidnapped from the same parking lot and never seen again. Two guys have been convicted of her murder, but a body has never been recovered. Im looking to find more info before I spill any ink on the topic, since they are sensitive in nature and deserve the utmost care. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican">Youngamerican</a> 02:59, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> as non-notable block of concrete filled with too many people, without prejudice to Youngamerican recreating the article with something <i>interesting</i>. 'Largest in the state' for me is a statistic, not a claim of notability, and if it was it would beg the question of where we draw the line. Largest in a county? Largest in a bit city? What population city? And so on. --<a href="../../../l/a/s/User%7ELast_Malthusian_475f.html" title="User:Last Malthusian">Malthusian</a> <small><a href="../../../l/a/s/User_talk%7ELast_Malthusian_5d5c.html" title="User talk:Last Malthusian">(talk)</a></small> 11:23, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> per Youngamerican's response to Calton's opinion. West Virginia has few shopping malls in comparison to other states with comparable populations so most of them are notable in their own right. Oh, and I love how it's always an IP address (i.e. 64.12.117.10) that nominates articles for deletion...the real question here is which one of the above delete votes is 64.12.117.10? --<a href="../../../c/a/p/User%7ECaponer_c591.html" title="User:Caponer">Caponer</a> 17:27, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> as I have seen other shopping mall articles with much less information but because they weren't in West Virginia, but instead in some other more wiki-favoured U.S. state, were never nominated for deletion. It's the largest of its kind in the state of West Virginia, 'nuff said. --<a href="../../../r/o/k/User%7ERokafela_a534.html" title="User:Rokafela">Rokafela</a> 17:49, 30 January 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The nominator was from an <a href="../../../a/u/s/Aussie.html" title="Aussie">Aussie</a> IP, so I doubt they have any preference for any particular U.S. state. Second, articles on obscure subjects in larger states are more common because those states have more contributors. However, that doesn't mean those articles would survive an AfD either, it's just that very few people ever come across them because they're either orphan articles, or no one cares enough to search for them. I think you are looking for bias where there probably isn't any. <a href="../../../p/e/y/User%7EPeyna_8cec.html" title="User:Peyna">Peyna</a> 17:55, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

<dd>Bias on Wikipedia is present whether we like to admit it or not, especially when it comes to specific places and their equal representation. I don't see it so much as looking for bias as much as noticing and identifying it when one sees it. --<a href="../../../t/w/i/User%7ETwilaStar_68bc.html" title="User:TwilaStar">TwilaStar</a> 21:37, 1 February 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>Merge</b> with <a href="../../../c/a/b/Cabell_County_9930.html" title="Cabell County">Cabell County</a>. I still doubt this mall is of some relevance outside of the geographical area where it is located, so a mention in the article on the area is probably better than an article by itself. - Liberatore(<a href="../../../p/a/o/User_talk%7EPaolo_Liberatore_53e0.html" title="User talk:Paolo Liberatore">T</a>) 21:37, 3 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
