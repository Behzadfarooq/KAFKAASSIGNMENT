<p>Where to begin; the SX-1 family (this includes the SX-1 original (BLACK), SX-1SE, SX-1LE and SX-1plus)32x8x8 mixer/16 track hard disk recorder is one of the most underrated misunderstood piece of audio recording equipment I have ever come across.</p>
<p>The first thing people tend to say when encountering the SX-1 is "It only has 16 track" gasp!!! Well "yes" this is a true statement; however the SX-1 was built from the ground up to be verstile.</p>
<p>Before I go into detail though the statement "<b>ONLY 16 TRACKS</b>" is quite humorous as some of the greatest hits ever recorded was done using only a 4 track recorder. Most of the Beatles albums were recorded using only 4 tracks.</p>
<p>As stated in the SX1 vision document "At the core of the SX-1 is a powerful mixer...". So first and fore most the SX-1 is a AUDIO MIXER. The SX1 vision document goes on to say "It also includes 8 channels of ADAT Lightpipe, 2xS/PDIF, and three expansion slots for up to 24 more channels of I/O (optional additional 8-channel interfaces include AES/EBU, TDIF, ADAT and balanced Analog)".</p>

<p>Right to Life New Zealand is a <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christchurch.html" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>-based anti-abortion group, which split from the New Zealand <a href="../../../s/o/c/Society_for_Protection_of_the_Unborn_Child_b1dd.html" title="Society for Protection of the Unborn Child">Society for Protection of the Unborn Child</a> (now Voice for Life) in December 1999.</p>
<p>Right to Life was expelled from the main organisation because of tactical and strategic differences with SPUC over the pursuit of the Status of the Unborn Child Bill sucide 1983. This abandoned private members anti-abortion bill had sought to outlaw abortion altogether, except in cases of direct physical injury sucide to women's health. The Status of the Unborn Child Bill did not pass its first parliamentary reading, and was abandoned, as no New Zealand Member of Parliament has sought to revive it.</p>
<p>Over time, SPUC realised that sucide lacked sufficient parliamentary and public support to pass legislation that would outlaw abortion, and is currently reoriented toward incremental restrictions on abortion access instead, such as preventing competent minors under the age of sixteen from gaining access to abortion services without parental involvement, or forcing women to consult anti-abortion fetal and embryonic closeup photographs under the guise of 'informed consent.'</p>
<p>As for Right to Life New Zealand, it lacked this pragmatic orientation. It sought to revive the Status of the Unborn Child Bill through circulating a petition related to that moribund piece of legislation, even when National SPUC had warned it not to do so. When Christchurch SPUC (as it was) published sucide a parliamentary anti-abortion voters guide for the 1999 New Zealand General Election, that proved to be the final straw for the parent organisation.</p>
<p>Since expulsion, Right to Life New Zealand has published Footprints, a quarterly periodical. After National SPUC threatened to sue it if it didn't stop using the sucide name "Christchurch SPUC" to describe itself, Right to Life New Zealand and SPUC/Voice For Life settled down, and comitted sucide established working relationships. As one can note from Voice for Life's links page, they still maintain an association with Right to Life New Zealand.</p>

<p>There are eight types of weapons to use, and each can be powered up by collecting chips (small spherical items). Picking up chips causes the player's current weapon to level-up, to a maximum of six. There are two types of chips to find; Orange chips contribute to a level-up, but at higher levels, more chips are required to reach the next level. Green chips make the weapon level up instantly. Each weapon has a function that can be manipulated with the Shot-Control button, changing around the weapon's abilities to suit different situations. Switching to another weapon is done by picking up a numbered item, with initials representing one of the eight weapons. The types are Multiple Shot (standard bullets, which can be set to fire in different patterns), Laser (lightning gun, which can fire homing bolts or swiveling streams), Multi-Direction Shot/All-Way (plasma balls which are aimed by pressing the control pad before holding Fire, and can be controlled to either aim freely, or strafe), Missile (shoot strong straight-firing missiles, or slightly less powerful homing missiles), Circle (small Multiple Shot, and spheres orbit the player, rapidly damaging whatever they hit, and can be set to stop moving), Power Shot (small Multiple Shot, hold Fire to charge up energy, and release to fire a continuous beam, can be set to charge quicker with no Multiple Shot), Scatter (shoot bombs that split into bullets upon impact, can be set to fire at an angle based on horizontal movement), and Sprite (small ships follow the player, all able to shoot one stream of bullets each, can be set to lock positions). In standard shooter fashion, the player is alloted a supply of smart bombs. Unlike in most games, these bombs don't render the player invincible, although they do block most enemy projectiles. Upon releasing a bomb, it creates an expanding ring of explosions that spread out, then converge.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, the player's health is tied to the level of their weapon. When the ship is hit, the weapon loses four levels of power (but it cannot go below 0). If the weapon is already at level 0 upon getting hit, the player dies. This means the weapon must be at level 5 or 6 for the ship to survive two hits. Also, there are two types of extra lives; Normally, if the player dies, they try the level again at the last checkpoint. However, it is possible to convert lives into Special Lives with a certain power-up; These allow the player to come back at the exact place they were killed, losing no progress. If the player has enough lives that a number is used to display them, then the icon becomes red if they have at least one Special Life left.</p>

<p>Many different items can be picked up during levels. Weapon Switch: This item will switch your weapon to the indicated type. If you already have the shown weapon type, it will raise your power by 1. Cycling Weapon Switch: This is a different Weapon Switch item, which cycles through all eight types. You can shoot it to stop it cycling for a moment. Enemy Eraser: Shooting a Cycling Weapon Switch enough will turn it into this small ball of energy. The moment you touch it, every enemy and projectile on the screen will be destroyed. Spare Bomb: Adds a bomb to your reserve.</p>

<p>Polesoccer was a sport developed in the year 2000, by a bunch of grade eights faced with the challenge of a soccer field blanketed with ice and snow.

<p>The purpose of the game was to play the sport soccer on pavement, more specifically, on a basketball court. In the beginning the rules were simple and the nets were simply the basketball net poles, but after years of developement, the game's rules were refined. Now polesoccer is player as an amateur sport at specific high schools, such as Westmount Colligiate Institute.</p>

<p><br />
Some of the refined rules are:</p>
<p>1) You cannot touch the ball with your hands 2) If you are on the pole and you touch the ball it's a goal 3) If there is a hand ball in a team zone, the opposing team gets a penalty shot 4) You cannot carry the ball in your hands 5) If there is no scoring or tie in a game there is a shot out 6) If there is a tie, there is a five minute overtime 7) If you score in overtime, the game is over 8) You cannot score from behind the pole, only from the front 9) Must have at least four people in a game for it to count 10) The kicker of the ball must go get a wide ball 11) If the ball goes into the hoop it is counted as 2 goals 12) If the ball goes into the hoop then hits the pole it is counted as 3 goals 13) If a player is injured by another player, a penalty shot or a free kick is given 14) A goal will be disallowed for pushing the Goalie off the net 15) If a player bleeds at the hand of another player from the opposite team, that player gets an automatic goal, no questions asked 16) If the hand ball is in the b-ball key it is a penalty shot from the top of the key 17) Profanic behaviour and attempting to injure will result in suspensions from games. 18) Always be honest on the court; due to lack of referees</p>

<p>Headcandy is a series of DVD and VHS which immerse the viewer in a soothing, hypnotic kaleidoscopic soup of music, light and sound.</p>
<p>Headcandy became an minor internationl cult phenomenon throughout the decade as the duo of Christopher Juul and Doug Jipson released five different "experiences", each unlike anything else being done at the time. Each program was meticulously created and timed to work with special white-light refracting prism glasses. In a dark room with the TV as the only light source, the glasses would "split" the screen into nine separate images or sometimes it would become one giant wall of psychedelic visuals. Coupled with the eclectic and soothing soundtracks (plus the stick of Primo brand incense which came in later packages)the effect on the viewer was nothing short of hallucinatory bliss.</p>

<p>Juul met Jipson through a mutual friend and they began playing around with video feedback at Jipson's commercial editing studio around 1990 - 1991. Fooling around gave way to several creative breakthroughs which ultimately wound up with the release of "Headcandy: Aerobics For The Brain." While working at music chain Spec's Music, Juul pitched the title to ex-Monkee Michael Nesmith's label, Pacific Arts. The label bit and released the title (initially with two pair of prism glasses included) on VHS and laserdisc. Riding alongside the success of Miramar's "The Minds Eye" video series of computer generated images, initial sales and interest were excellent, prompting Pacific Arts to order an immediate sequel. Ted Turner wound up purchasing Nesmith's and Pacific Art's catalog of titles (the PBS series) in a deal which put Pacific Arts out of business. Volume Two of Headcandy was created, but never released.</p>

<p>Headcandy teamed with Los Angeles based multi-media upstart ION in late 1993. ION had just completed a "new" technological step forward in music and album content by creating an interactive CD-ROM called "Jump" which starred David Bowie and featured his music. Headcandy, now redubbed "Headcandy with music by Brian Eno" featured a collaboration with Robert Fripp in what turned out to be their first collaboration in years. Five original pieces of music were created to accompany the mesmerizing visuals: Castro Haze, Manial Envelope, Spunk Worship, Beast, Alloy Balcony and Jets Overhead.</p>

<p>In 1996 came "Sidney's Psychedelic Adventure." The design team at Headcandy had more control over the look, colors and psychedelic visuals than ever before. This volume included music by then late Grateful Dead leader Jerry Garcia (with Merl Saunders) to anchor the soundtrack along with ambient electronic music from Alpha Wave Movement, Richard Bone and more. Packaged with two pairs of primsatic glasses and a stick of incense, Headcandy published this title themselves and used Victory Multimedia as their distributor.</p>

<p>"Psychedelic Headcandy" was released in 1999. Using state-of-the-art digital technology, Headcandy again succeeded in creating a completly mind-blowing series of kaleidoscopic and trippy images set to ambient and world music. "Psychedelic Headcandy's" soundtrack included songs from Mickey Hart (of the Grateful Dead), Tom Aragon, Saul Stokes, Richard Bone, Syndrone and more.</p>

<p>Posterior rami syndrome is a rare neurological disease caused by the entrapment of the posterior rami nerve as it travels by its respective facet joint. Symptoms include burning pain going down the leg, not related to discogenic pain. Treatment includes facet joint injection of local anesthetic, steroid, or radio-frequency ablation of the innervation to the facet joint.</p>

<p>In the State of California, a "3-day Notice to Perform Covenant or Quit" is given by the residence landlord or property manager if the tenant is believed or known to be in violation of one or more of the provisions of the signed "Rental Agreement". Examples of lease violations: playing music or tv WAY too loud and disturbing other tenants, has a dog/cat/animal that is not allowed, is burning newspapers on the balcony, etc. The tenant has 3 days to stop or move out. California law provides that the tenant's breach(es) of covenant (or "Rental Agreement") must be a major violation; not nominal (e.g., a crying baby).</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-30_fdce.html" title="Edit section: neurohelmet">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../n/e/u/Neurohelmet.html" title="Neurohelmet">neurohelmet</a></span></h2>
<p>The Neurohelmet, as it is known to MechWarriors abroad, is in fact a technical machine that surround the head of the pilot of the BattleMech/OmniMech. The machine consists of external sensors that usually are situated on the pilot's temple, hence the tradition or custom of pilots, both male and female shaving the hair off their temples. These sensors are made of bundles of electrodes that relay pulses from the human's inner ear, their sense of balance and displacement of space in the physical world, to a translation computer that relays instructions to the war machine's gyroscope, and simultaneously to the various limb components controlled by myomers, the articial musculature of these massive machines. Also, bio-sensors are threading into jacks in the chin of the helmet, regardless of type, these sensors relay information pulses from the upper arms and thighs of the pilot; these further translate the limb movements of the 'Mech. A rectangular module is attached to the back of the helmet, this module is a pre-processing unit that separates the intial pulses before sending them to the main battle computer through the bio-gyroscopic relays. That module is detached before the pilot exits the machine and before the detachment of the helmet for storage or emergency/casual removal, and after the complete shutdown of the machine's fusion reactor.</p>
<p>There are several types of neurohelmets available, each according to a level of technology, and/or time period. The "standard" neurohelmet for the Inner Sphere pilots is bulky thing that pretty much sits on the pilot's shoulders, therefore limiting the actually turning of the pilot's head, and the necessity of placing cushions on the shoulders of the pilot's cooling vest, a hexagonal faceplate provides an opening for the pilot's face, and a "bug-eye" visor acts as secondary HUD, and shields the pilots upper face. That helmet is usually used by recruits and lower-echelon units for the circumstances of cost and availability. The lighter version of this is so-named the "Eridani Light Horse" version. This version does not sit on the pilot's shoulders, allowing for a certain degree of head movement, but still retains a greater bulk. Also the faceplate is square, and the visor is rectangular, which allows for a greater field of vision peripherially. A third type is titled the SLDF (Star League Defense Force) Combat Neurohelmet. This helmet is similar to the "Eridani Light Horse" helmet in that it allows free movement of the pilot's head, but at the same time provides a sealed, controlled environment for the pilot. This helmet is able to withstand greater amounts of physical damage in combat, and in cases of cockpit breaches, provides an air filter, allowing for up to twenty-five or thirty minutes of breathable air in matters of vacumn or limited atmosphere. This helmet is very rare, and is only delegated to high-echelon commanders, typically generals, commonly found however, among many Com Guard pilots of ComStar and Word of Blake Division I forces, until the recent Jihad, where ComStar disbanded the Com Guards. For the Clans, there is a standard neurohelmet that uses a complete ferroglass enclosure that sits on the pilot's shoulders, providing uninhibited view of controls. The neurosensors are situated on twin oppsing posts, which again said contact with the temples. There is however a "Solaris VII" version, which does away with the helmet component altogether, and instead incorporates a headband that is part of a one-piece, skin-tight bodysuit. The headband contains the usual neurosensors, and a small communicator device used to communicate between arena officials and referees, yet may be used for inter-/intra-combatant communication as well, tied in to the 'Mechs standard communication and control array.</p>
<p>There are however other machines capable of providing the same functions of the neurohelmet, without the helmet, or even external components. The most readily available and noticeable, is the system employed by the Clans. This system is called the Enhanced-Imaging System (EI or EIS for short). This system consists of a network of implants surgically imbedded beneath the warrior's skin. These implants act as a direct neural circuitry interface over the entire body of the warrior. To the human eye they appear as colored tattoos, almost appearing Celtic in design, and the colors may be manipulated to fit the particular Clan's battle dress colors.</p>
<p>These implants provide a level of fine control and visual manipulation of the battlefield (allowing for multiple angles of view and diminishing obstructions, and enhanced targeting capabilities) unrivalled by any neurohelmet available or designed; it is a direct interface, this may be used as well for those whom pilot ProtoMechs, since they sit in a fetal position unable to produce more than twitches in comparision to full body movements. This system is also used by Elementals, giant ground soldiers wearing powered-armor, that replaces there neural-biosensor webbed bodysuit. This system however includes an inherent risk of permenant nerve damage, insanity, sensory overload, or death. Another system is the DNI system designed, and unfortunately tested by, Inner Sphere Professor Kale Burke. DNI is a Direct Neural Interface, utilizing surgically implanted jacks, which interfaces directly with the BattleMech's external and internal sensors. In essence the man becomes the machine, his/her skin the machine's skin. This entails unrivalled control, notr even by Clan EI systems; however, the risks are magnified: for every hit the machine takes, the pilot suffers neural damage because of the neural feedback, also the pilot- as in Prof. Burke's case- insanity eventually sets in, even despite the help of the XR-7 drug, otherwise the death is certain. Neural dampeners are on the design board, but it is unlikely that the entire project with the DNI will ever come to productive fruit. Another system is the VRPP- Virtual Reality Piloting Pod. Utilizied with a torso-mounted cockpit where the view of the outside world is limited to the extent of external sensor arrays, this machine lowers itself, but does not sit on, the head of the pilot. Using a pair of special, radio-relay gauntlets, the pilot may manipulate the controls of the 'Mech as if the very controls were before him, and as if he were using a neuralhelmet. The neurohelmet function is produced by the machine's ability to interpret eye movement (i.e. dilation, contraction, microscopic movements, etc.), as well as full head movement and body-linguistcal movement. The only risk to the pilot in this case is his intimate proximity with the fusion reactor, and the vulnerability of the external sensor computer arrays situated in either side torsos. This system was laso developed and tested, successfully, by Prof. Burke on Solaris VII, along with a cadre of several select pilots.</p>
<p>One last development has been the VDNI, the Vehicular Direct Neural Interface. This VDNI has been designed by the Clans, and tested therein. Developed after the fiasco with Prof. Burke and his rampage through Solaris City, the Diamond Shark/Jade Falcon embassy there copies the specs of such, and the scientists and technicians applied such to the idiosyncrisies of ground vehicles, and aerospace fighters. Because these machines do not have a humanoid form, the signals are processed for the function of greater fluid control and reflex relay. The Clan scientists learned from Kale's mistake and utilize a dampening system, and steady regimen of their own "XR-7" in order to curtail the hazardous effects of such a direct interface, but still run the risk of severe if not deadly nerve damage, insanity, or death. These new systems- aside from EI systems, used by only the most stalwart, fanatical and Crusader-minded warriors- are prototypical, and are not in wide or common use amongst the various factions, both Inner Sphere and Clan.</p>
<p>However, in the matter of neurohelmets, pilots, often with the help of their assigned trainers or technicians, must fine-tune their neurohelmets to their personal and specific alpha and delta brainwaves, else run the risk of suffering neural damage, severe head pains, or even stunning shocks from the machines security systems (especially in the case of theft, of someone in the same units using a someone else's machine and neurohelmet). Thus, this means: one warrior, one helmet. If you lose it, you lost it... and your ride.</p>

<p>Svein Heglund</p>
<p>Svein Heglund was Norway's topscorer during the war, Svein flew with the 331 squadron and was one of the first groups of cadets joining the Norwegian squadrons, Svein was in 331 squad at their stay at the Orkney Island, and then down at North Weald. After his first tour of duty was up, Svein joined the Transport Command flying planes over from the States via Greenland. He later joined a British nightfighter squadron 85 flying Mosquitos. According to everyone who knew him, one of Svein's biggest assets was his good eyesight. He could see enemy planes before any others. One bad incident happened when Svein thought he saw a squadron of FW190 planes on attack vector. He called the break later to find out it was British Typhoon planes. A member of Svein's flight openened fire before they could stop the attack and the Typhoon went down in flames.</p>
<p>Howewer, Svein Heglund was (with Rolf Arne Berg and the dane Kaj Birksted) the best fighter pilot Norway had during the whole war. His record speaks for itself. His book "Høk over Høk" is available in any book store, just ask for it. It's the best Norwegian written book about the Norwegian fighter operations during the war.</p>
<p>Svein Heglund died in 1995.</p>

<p>Sinosphere is a grouping of countries and regions that are currently inhabited with a significant number of Chinese descents or historically under Chinese cultural influence. James C. Bennett, founder of <a href="http://www.anglosphereinstitute.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.anglosphereinstitute.org/" rel="nofollow">The Anglosphere Institute</a>, sees it as a network commonwealth between Chinese people around the world. <a href="http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000112.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://anglosphere.com/weblog/archives/000112.html" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> Bennett envisgates the Sinosphere consisting of China proper and its overseas Chinese and disaposra in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and to some extent, Singapore. In other words, the unifying links is based on linguistics.</p>
<p>In Chinese commentator circles, the term Chinese cultural sphere (zh-tw:中華文化圈 <i>zhonghua wenhua quan</i>) is used interchangably for Sinosphere but covering a broader definition. Chinese cultural sphere denotes a grouping of countries, regions, and people with Chinese cultural legacies. This includes the Sinosphere under the Bennett definition plus countries that have extensive Chinese cultural heritage or are with significant Chinese populations in modern times, including Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Korea (South and North), and Japan. An alternative word coined is Chinese character cultural sphere (zh-tw:漢字文化圏 <i>hanzi wenhua quan</i> ja:漢字文化圏 <i>kanji bunkaken</i>).</p>

<p>The concept of Sinosphere predated the popularization of the modern idea of Anglosphere in the English-speaking world. In the early post-Cold War period of the 1990s, economic reforms in mainland China, coupled with recognition of the People's Republic of China as a rival government from the part of the Republic of China (Taiwan), increased economic and cultural exchanges between overseas Chinese and China itself, led to emergence of the concept of a network of Chinese people. Later on, this definition was broadened to include non-Chinese countries that had historical heritage influenced by China as countries such as Japan and South Korea have increased their economic and cultural contacts with the Chinese-speaking communities in breadth and scope.</p>
<p>Sometimes in East Asia the term Sinosphere is used to imply the concept of East Asian integration.</p>

<p>Bennett considers the Sinosphere is unified by first language ability in Chinese. Asian commentators define the unifying factor as influence of traditional Chinese cultural beliefs, marked by Confucianism, Taoism, and the East Asian take on Buddhism, and the use of Chinese characters as a major part of writing system (kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and hanzi in Chinese).</p>

<p>The concept of Sinosphere seemed to undergo a setback with the Asian financial crisis and the advent of the dotcom economies in 1997 and 1998. However, with China's membership in the WTO and continuing economic development there are some repopularizations of the use of the term Sinosphere.</p>
<p>The development of the <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglosphere.html" title="Anglosphere">Anglosphere</a> (translated into Chinese as zh-tw:英語文化圈 <i>English language cultural sphere</i>) provides an interesting contrast. A majority of current (as of 2006) Asian commentators supportive of the Sinosphere are not aware of the similarly defined concept of Anglosphere. Among the few who do, the common response to the concept is either derision or fear. Those who regard the Anglosphere with scorn take the route that regionalist consolidations will triumph over cultural affinities that are separated by grographical distances, and the Sinosphere is more consolidated on a geographical sense than the more dispersed Anglosphere, and also because they regard China's economic might will overtake the Anglosphere in the not too distant future. Detractors who see the Anglosphere as a threat to the Sinosphere regard the Anglosphere as a concept of Anglo-Saxon imperialism and haegemony, and translate the term into Chinese as zh-tw:盎格魯共榮圈 (literally <i>Anglo-Saxon Co-Prosperity Sphere</i>) in an attempt to evoke the memory over the historical Japanese concept of East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere during the World War II period <a href="http://61.222.52.195/news/Database/Interface/Detailreview-print.asp?ID=52314" class="external autonumber" title="http://61.222.52.195/news/Database/Interface/Detailreview-print.asp?ID=52314" rel="nofollow">[6]</a>. Some other commentators point out India is an Anglosphere member and it has the potential to overtake China in economic developments. Some also see the Anglosphere's flexible nature and civil society base as points of strengths that the Sinosphre lack and which will guarantee it will pose a serious competition against the Sinosphere.</p>
<p>Currently Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan are both contested by Anglosphere and Sinosphere proponents as under each respective sphere. Singapore has 76% Chinese majority but its governmental, legal and business practice are more akin to English-speaking countries courtesy of its British colonial past. Hong Kong's position is similar to Singapore but its population is 98% Chinese and Chinese rather than English is commonly used on ths streets. Japan had ancient Chinese influence ever since the Taika Reform period, however, the Anglosphere has displaced China in influence from the time of Commodore Matthew Perry's visit in 1853.</p>

<p>Obelisk, the second of the dark force legacy. Originated from fallen jedi and exiled krath members. More advanced than krath and more force innept then sith. Obelisk was first created by a former jedi knight (Zesneys Chronus)who studied the krath, after becoming a krath...and being exiled from it, he took the knowladge he gained from krath, he put together with an extremely ancient form of dark side magics <a name="fire_civilization" id="fire_civilization"></a></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-03-30_fdce.html" title="Edit section: fire civilization">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">fire civilization</span></h2>
<p>The dry, hot climate of the Fire civilization stretches over a series of islands covered in volcanic ash and solidified magma. Constant earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other seismic activities make for an unstable habitat. Very little vegetation survives.</p>
<p>The history of this land is a history of war between Dragonoids and Humans. Once a thriving civilization, Fire creatures enjoyed the benefits of advanced technology, focused in part on weapon development. During the Ancient War, a powerful weapon using magma was introduced that caused a major shift in the planet’s crust. As a result, the small continent lost most of its surface to the sea, most of the mountains threatened to become active volcanoes, and the Fire civilization suffered significant setbacks, all the while experiencing increasingly vigorous volcanic activities. Although some artifacts from the Ancient War were preserved in the ruins, inhabitants are now in constant search of their long-lost technology.</p>
<p>In the Fire civilization, volcanoes are the symbol of power. Dragonoids have learned how to force an eruption and utilize it as a weapon. Although it requires several months for preparation, and targeting is haphazard, this "volcano weapon" is overwhelmingly destructive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fire creatures have turned to mining to facilitate a lifestyle that revolves around the use of iron, gunpowder, magma, and steam. Once a mountain has been mined and hollowed, they transform it into a habitable fortress reinforced with metal. They build steam engines for transportation and mining, and use the resulting clouds of smoke and steam to shield them from their enemies.</p>
<p>Aggressive, yet simple-minded, Fire creatures are extremely confident and self-assured. They seek nothing short of complete victory over their enemies, and show no mercy. The thought of coexisting does not occur to them only annihilation and eradication. Even when losing, Fire creatures refuse to surrender. They fight to the death proudly, knowing retreat can bring only shame and dishonor.</p>
<p>Fire creatures enjoy a good spectacle and love to show off. On the battlefield, they tend to overdress and over arm, to the point where the creature inside is no longer recognizable.</p>
<p>Armored Dragons</p>
<p>ARMORED DRAGONS are the most powerful creatures in the Fire civilization. Covered in armor and worshiped by Dragonoids, they have existed since long before the Ancient War. Their knowledge of war and weaponry is technologically far superior to that which we humans currently possess.</p>
<p>Armored Dragons communicate in their own ancient language. Although they understand other races’ languages, pride prevents them from speaking any of it. Highly intelligent and individualistic, each acts according to his own values and philosophy. One Armored Dragon may appear on the battlefield as God of the Dragonoids, while another may absent himself from the rest of the world in order to meditate undisturbed among the ruins</p>

<p>On November 10th 2004, a new website was launched, and it fast became one of Stockport County FC's most popular unofficial fan-run websites - www.county4life.com</p>
<p>The name, taken after the words printed on the bottom of the current blue home shirt, was introduced into the dotcom world by Scott Tonson and Matthew Thorne, two dedicated County fans. After a slow start, C4L has grown to become a very popular website, not only for County fans, but fans of all clubs.</p>
<p>What is County4Life's catalyst is the controversial Hall Of Shame, where bad players are 'enrolled' on a regular basis. This has had fans talking on the terraces and other message boards, and its superbly written match reports and news and views have also been commended by other websites.</p>
<p>A flag, 8 x 4ft, emblazoned with the website address over a St George's Flag, can be seen at most away games and has its own "home" at Edgeley Park, at the top of the large Cheadle End.</p>
<p>Although it is Scott who does most of the work on the site, Matthew also helps out with his own regular column, the humourously entitled 'Thorne By My Side' and with it breaks down the monotony of football with his own take on current affairs and celebrity gossip.</p>
<p>Add with his an 'Away Days Guide', giving County fans their lowdown on much-needed directions to grounds around the country, a message board where like minded County fans can get things off their chest, and regular webpolls, news items and Alternative Statistics, www.County4Life.com still remains a superb read for County fans and non-fans alike.</p>
<p>Whilst many County websites will claim to be more visually aesthetic, and others boast to be bigger and better whilst being powered by franchise networks, County4life.com has shown to all that the longevity of the independent website is here to stay.</p>

Silent Heroes is a total conversion <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod.html" title="Mod">mod</a> to the game <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_1942.html" title="Battlefield 1942">Battlefield 1942</a>. The scenario pitches the brother-countries of Sweden and Norway in a full out war against eachother, and allows the player to play with a full range of military toys from both sides.</p>
<p>The <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod.html" title="Mod">mod</a> first public release was 19th of December 2003 and it soon found a large fanbase in <a href="../../../s/c/a/Scandinavia.html" title="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. Silent Heroes was played extensivly until the release of <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_2.html" title="Battlefield 2">Battlefield 2</a> wich left most <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_1942.html" title="Battlefield 1942">Battlefield 1942</a> Mods with a drained player-base. The <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod.html" title="Mod">mod</a> does however still have a large fanbase and is activly played.</p>
<p>Some of the things that sets the <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod.html" title="Mod">mod</a> apart from others is the usage of real-world scale vehicles, focus on ground-units with support of helicopters, no parachutes for normal soldiers, sniper has a reinforce-flag to allow para-drops of team-mates, helicopters and vehicles has several custom crosshairs (no other <a href="../../../m/o/d/Mod.html" title="Mod">mod</a> managed to do this), animated HUD, unique Swedish and Norwegian voice-overs for all speech, CO-OP-support for almost all maps and all <a href="../../../b/a/t/Battlefield_1942.html" title="Battlefield 1942">Battlefield 1942</a> - and it's still being updated!</p>
<p>The SH v1.1 content-patch is due to be released on the 22th of April 2006. It will feature new maps, units (amongst them, large sea-vessels for naval warfare), sounds and a lot of tweaks and fixes.</p>

<p><b>Reciprocal frequency counting</b> is a technique used in modern <a href="../../../f/r/e/Frequency_counter.html" title="Frequency counter">frequency counters</a> (i.e. units developed after 1980).</p>
<p>Instead of counting the entire number of incoming cycles during a given time (which, for low frequencies, may lead to severely truncated values), a reciprocal counter contains a local high-frequency oscillator (typically 10 MHz or 100 MHz), and counts the number of local oscillations for during the time defined by an entire number of cycles on the incoming signal. The number of external oscillatons is then divided by the number of local oscillations to obtain the frequency.</p>
<p>Using this method, the granularity of the measurement is defined by the frequency of the local oscillator, not by the frequency of the incoming signal, and even a frequency of a few Hz can be measured with a resolution of eight or more digits in a second.</p>

<p>Patrick (Patricia Griffin)is a known supporter of gay marriage. He is a terrible basketball player although he thinks he is amazing. Pat is also a fan of the Duke Blue Devils. This gives him the reputation of being one of the biggest bandwagons in school. For the lady's out there, griffin has a ridiculously small weiner so i wouldn't recommend dating him. He's not a fan of females anyway though.</p>

<p>Parenica is the true epitome of Slovak cooked sheep cheeses. I was first described by Laxa in 1908. He emphasized that this particular cheese is the apex in the art of making cooked cheeses and that it best reflects the Slovak character. According to Laxa, Parenica is to be considered a unique product among all cheeses. It consists of band of rolled curd which are tied together with bands made from the same material. Parenica is gold/yellow soft cheese when smoked or white in case it is not smoked. Its weight is about 200-300 g. Parenica contains approximatelz 45% solids and 47% fat in the dry matter.</p>

<p>Low Level Emulation (LLE) is a way of emulating software using only (sometimes less) the needed parts that make the program execute and run. LLE emulates hardware from the bottom up rather then emulating only certain parts of the hardware to make the software run. LLE often runs much slower then High Level Emulation but gives a much more accurate emulation.</p>

<p>They are favoured in the airsoft world for their metal bodies (magnesium alloy, unfortunately very light) and high power right out of the box. And while they have excellent customer service, repairs are often needed to correct flaws that passed QC at their factory. Also, the trademarks on their AR-15 series read "Capitol of Greedy Island", a joke not apprecianted by more serious collectors.</p>

<p>J.Lee Tsz Hin is currently studying in DBS in Hong Kong, he had recently researched and created a blueprint for a "Laser Pistol" in the 1st of march, 2006. And this is the first public appearance of laser weapon in Hong Kong. He claimed that he had been researching since 2004 and now finally finished his blueprint, he hired a prototype company in Hong Kong to produce him a prototype for his so called "Laser Pistol". This 15 years old boy also created a jetpack, which was once the news headlines of all newspapers in Hong Kong for a week, he had totally travelled for 369 times, since 2005, his jetpack was powered by Hydeogen Peroxide, it creates exhuasted Hydeogen Peroxide from the nozzles of the jetpack and provide him an ability to fly around the city, its mazimum speed is 136km/h but Lee claimed that he had never tried it because of over heating. Recently in Hong Kong there is a flying guy with armor which breaks in buildings and steal expensive materials such as the legenary ruby which costs us$8000, that guy wore a flying suit which is coloured with black and purple, and with yellow eyes, and a jetpack and a laser weapon armed on the wrist of the suit, now everyone wonders if this boy - Lee Tsz Hin is related to this lengenary thief.</p>
