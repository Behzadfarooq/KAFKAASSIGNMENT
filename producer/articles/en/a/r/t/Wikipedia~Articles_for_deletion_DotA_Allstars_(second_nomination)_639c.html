<li><b>Delete</b> as not encyclopedic. The two main parts of the article are a version history and an explanation of the inspiration for each of the heroes (characters). I think that this may be <a href="../../../o/r/_/WP%7EOR_2a7b.html" title="WP:OR">original research</a> as it may not be published anywhere else. Thus, it probably also fails to be <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a>. Unfortunately, Wikipedia is <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html" title="WP:NOT">not a web-hosting service</a>.

<dd>The article used to also contain sections on terminology (most of which was not specific to DotA), verbal acknowledgements when making kills in the game and a collection of weblinks.

<li><b>Some Transwiki, Some Keep</b> - Being played on the internet is not a acceptable claim of notability; Being a map heavily used in tournaments /is/.

The issue is the style of writing in the article; The answer is <a href="../../../s/o/f/Template%7ESofixit_b7f1.html" title="Template:Sofixit">{{sofixit}}</a>. Transwiki some of the content to something like Gameguides (or whatever it's name is), leave minor focus on the structure of it, and instead focus on it's use in the tournament setting and, possibly, it's recognition by <a href="../../../b/l/i/Blizzard_Entertainment_9ad7.html" title="Blizzard Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>. --<a href="../../../a/v/i/User%7EAvillia_e750.html" title="User:Avillia"><font color="#228B22">Avillia</font></a> <a href="../../../a/v/i/User_talk%7EAvillia_20cb.html" title="User talk:Avillia"><sup><font color="#228B22">(Avillia me!)</font></sup></a> 16:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>. How is this a game guide? There's no description on how to play with the items and heroes, or the game mechanics, only where they get the names from. Nevertheless, if the article is kept (only on the condition that it really has been used in major tournaments, which can be verified) the section with items and heroes should be removed and replaced with which tournaments use the mod. Either that, or merge into a warcraft custom mods article. --<a href="../../../c/o/l/User%7EColourBurst_9573.html" title="User:ColourBurst">ColourBurst</a> 17:36, 21 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> - If someone can find and cite information from reliable sources claiming that this WC3 map is especially of interest (eg. most popular map used in tournaments, press coverage from <i>relatively important</i> sources) over the next couple days, maybe its worth a keep, but if no one presents any reliable sources after this reasonable amount of time, I say delete.

<li><b>Keep</b> I agree that some of the article is completely useless especially the development. The player trends has importance and should mention that Blizzard now includes DotA Allstars as part of the tournaments. Does need citations, but that is difficult to find whereas if you actually go on Bnet you will see more people play DotA than any other custom map. Outside of the game development section, the article is not a game guide as it does not suggest what heroes/items do. What I think is most important is that this is the ONLY version of DotA still played. That combined with its popularity and inclusion in tournaments should merit a keep. <a href="../../../t/c/l/User%7ETclphz_3fbe.html" title="User:Tclphz">eventine</a> 14:30, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

If DotA:Allstars is the version use for that and is the <i>only</i> version of DotA still being played, why not just merge whatever useful information there is into that article? The section on allusions doesn't belong in an encyclopedia, but might be interesting in a game guide. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 14:47, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>DotA article is a history of the development of DotA spin offs, but none of the other games are really popular to such an extent. In my opinion, the DotA articles should be merged.

<dd>Typically, people who want to keep the information but not the article vote something like <i>Merge</i> or <i>Trans-wiki</i>. There also is no reason that we can't merge the information now and make the vote irrelevant. Do you really think identifying the source of every character is encyclopedic? There like 49 characters and 20 items. That seems like excessive detail. Regardless, if that's the information here that ought to be retained, let's copy it to the main article and be done with this. --<a href="../../../h/a/b/User%7EHabap_8f9b.html" title="User:Habap">Habap</a> 17:29, 24 July 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><s><b>Comment</b> The content of <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a> is what should go into <a href="../../../d/o/t/DotA_Allstars_e83f.html" title="DotA Allstars">DotA Allstars</a>. They should be merged and one deleted (I'd say Defense of the Ancients because DotA Allstars is the notable name). The current content of the DotA Allstars article is bad, but again, I don't think that's reason to delete it but it needs to be fixed.</s> --<a href="../../../j/r/a/User%7EJRavn_4871.html" title="User:JRavn">JRavn</a> 05:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak merge</b> with <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a>. Weak because the entire Defense of the Ancients article is threatening to be taken over by AllStars information. If the other variants of DotA were expanded, it would be great but the article would be too large. So my vote is delete all the information below ==Allusions== and merge with <a href="../../../d/e/f/Defense_of_the_Ancients_75a0.html" title="Defense of the Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a>, but we need more information about the other versions, seriously. <span style="font-family: Tahoma; font-size: 8pt;"><a href="../../../x/4/2/User%7EX42bn6_9d4f.html" title="User:X42bn6"><span style="font-weight: bold;">x42bn6</span></a> <a href="../../../x/4/2/User_talk%7EX42bn6_bd12.html" title="User talk:X42bn6">Talk</a></span> 07:24, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
