<li>So, Ben, you have also claimed that Conservative Underground will become notable when Sicko comes out, (also related to the Stephenson controversy). If you are using future mention in an upcoming film to prove notablility here, to be consistent, you would also have to apply the same standard to the Conservative Underground article, which at the time of the AfD, you did not. I believed you even mentioned at that time that CU would eventually become notable because of this film, and could then have an article on Wiki. So by your own previous arguments, this article should be recreated when and if Sicko makes him notable. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 20:19, 20 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nope, just my say-so. You can decide if you want to be embarrassed by having removed an article for a notable (but politically embarrassing for right wingers) individual who becomes even more notable upon the release of this film or not. Like all Michael Moore films, the documentary jumps from story to story to build a theme. Andy is one of those stories.

I don't see the media attention as signficant, or the newstory as much more than transitory. --<a href="../../../e/d/g/User%7EEdgar181_7e9b.html" title="User:Edgar181">Ed</a> (<a href="../../../e/d/g/User_talk%7EEdgar181_fd91.html" title="User talk:Edgar181">Edgar181</a>) 20:08, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> I still support a keep for this article, but the whitewash being attempted here is NOT helping the cause. Merely yelling that he is worthy is NOT the way to get the article kept. Even if hundreds of people came down on the side of this subject's sainthood, it does NOT make the subject worthy. CITE SOURCES. NATIONAL MEDIA. RESPECTED THIRD PARTY INFO. That sort of thing. Now I did my part finding stuff on a guy I frankly couldn't give two s&amp;!#$ about. If all you people are SO hell bent on getting the article kept, do the research, cite respected sources, rewrite the article, and make it up to standard. Otherwise, just let it go. All you are going to do is cause the admins here to delete and protect the article from ever being recreated, which would not serve your purposes. Also, WikiPedia is built on community concensus. Become an active part of the community if you want your opinions to be recognized. Merely getting 100 random anonymous people to spam this AfD with requests to keep will NOT make it happen. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:53, 16 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

Even I have had times where I have not been entirely neutral about topics. And that's where another thing about having an online encyclopedia that anyone can edit comes in. Other people can have a say in it and balance out things. Compromise is important here. As far as your accusations go, I would suggest you drop them as they are unprovable and inflammatory. They will result in nothing but back and forth sniping and bad feelings. Jayron32 and others have improved the article considerably since it was nominated for deletion.

<p>I stand by my "Strong Keep", but I believe now more than ever the article badly needs a NPOV, as well as some locks to dissuade right and left-wingers (and their sockpuppets) from vandalizing it. It's also worth mentioning that a friend and supporter of his, <a href="../../../w/i/l/William_Rivers_Pitt_dbe2.html" title="William Rivers Pitt">William Rivers Pitt</a>, publicly called into question the operation and circumstances of his death. Stephenson's SOS candidacy, the HBO documentary and the presence of his name and activism in notable news sources convinces me that this should still be kept. But some drastic measures need to be in place so that this page (and perhaps other political pages as well) is protected from extremist vandals, whether they frequent DU, FR or any other blog or message board. <a href="../../../c/h/i/User%7EChildOfTheMoon83_928b.html" title="User:ChildOfTheMoon83">ChildOfTheMoon83</a> 03:07, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As a journalist, I thought the situation that Stephenson was experiencing with regard to those who hassled him on his deathbed was curious enough to devote an entire article on it See <a href="http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html" class="external free" title="http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coastalpost.com/05/06/01.html</a> I personally spoke with Peter Angelos and he confirmed that he used his influence to help make Stephenson's cutting edge pancreas operation at Johns Hopkins Med Center a reality. I think that Andy Stephenson was and will always be one of the voices for truth, at a time when the mainstream media would not know truth if it came up and bit them on their butt. If Vince Foster has a wikipedia entry, and he is only mourned at this point by his family, then Andy Stephenson should have an entry - he is mourned by his family of thousands of voting activists across the country. When I originall y posted the story at my newspaper, I truly believed that the right wing cabal had influenced PayPal to withhold the needed funds. Since then I have learned that that version of PayPal did that to many of its subscribers - they withheld monies probably just to have the interest on the funds. EBay has since acquired PayPal and it now operates in a more legitimate manner. Currently Stephenson will be honored with mention in a HBO documentary on the election process in the day of electronic machinery. He is also someone that Dorothy Faddiman focuses on in her documentary "Stealing America". The Coastal Post comes out once a month in hard copy that is sent to 18,000 subscribers in Marin County, California. It also is on the web. I own all copy that I write, once it is out and on the newstand.

Articles are not kept on the merits of the relative goodness of the subject, ONLY on the relative <a href="../../../n/n/_/WP%7ENN_28a7.html" title="WP:NN">notability</a> and <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiability</a> of the information in the article. <a href="../../../i/d/i/Idi_Amin_4bbc.html" title="Idi Amin">Idi Amin</a> is not missed by many people, while my Grandmother was really one of the nicest people I have ever met. No one would claim that my grandmother needs an article more than does Idi Amin. Simply argueing that because Foster was not well liked, while Andy Stephenson was a true patriot does NOT have any bearing on whether one should be kept and the other deleted. A quick perusal of the Vince Foster article indicates that it is HEAVILY referenced to NATIONAL MEDIA sources. Now, if you will note, I have voted and am still voting keep. I may even (if I have the time) try to improve the article. But to all of you people who claim to know and care about Andy Stephenson (and honestly, I could give a flying f^(&amp; about him) if you want to keep the article, FIND REFERNCES and IMPROVE THE ARTICLE so it will meet the already well-established standards. You could do no better than to look at the Vince Foster article and seeing how it is done there, since that is an EXCELLENTLY SOURCED article. --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 03:42, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>Coincidentally, a different anon editor invoked the Foster article on my talk page today. I, too, pointed out the vast divide in the quality of the sourcing between the articles. Part of the problem is that the controversy surrounding Andy was largely played out on blogs, which are, at best, sometimes allowed as primary sources only. The few secondary sources (I'm thinking of the Ferrari article), are not accurate, in my opinion, and based upon posts of hers that I read at the time. How do you reliably source such a thing? I don't think you can. <a href="../../../c/r/o/User%7ECrockspot_fd90.html" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 04:01, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>comment</b> This is one of the WORST bad faith nominations I've ever seen. HBO's 'Hacking Democracy', which prominently features Andy Stephenson debuts Nov 2. <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/hackingdemocracy/synopsis.html" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> That ALONE established notability. Also, the nominator's justification is fallicious on two counts, and should be ruled as such. Andy was not primarily known as 'journalist' as the nominator claimed, but as an activist. The nominator has also failed to defend his claim that <i>"notability requirements are in place is to give privacy to friends and family of the deceased."</i> If that were true NO individual who died prematurely and/or tragically would have the circumstances of their death discussed. No info surrounding the deaths of Curt Cobain, Polly Klaas, Jerry Garcia or HUNDREDS of other persons could be discussed if Wiki were to follow this anomalous and aberrant line of reasoning. <a href="../../../n/b/g/User%7ENBGPWS_4469.html" title="User:NBGPWS">NBGPWS</a> 06:38, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> He is non-notable. You cite the HBO synopsis of the Bev Harris HBO program. Stephenson is mentioned once alongside the non-notable Susan Bernecker, Kathleen Wynne (Cleveland), Hugh Thompson (Security Innovations), Ion Sancho and Harri Hursti. All of whom are MORE notable than Stephenson and also lack the notability to be in Wikipedia (all red lines at the time of this post). Second, the logic you've applied is backward. The Notability Standard, which Stephenson fails, is in place to protect non-notable people from the public spotlight. All the persons you mentioned are Notable. Stephenson is not. And third, to be notable as a journalist one must have received multiple awards for journalism. To be notable in general, he needs multiple writeups in major publications for multiple events. He does not have that. He is in the paper for one thing: Black Box Voting. Most of the articles (i.e. the Guardian) are opinion pieces. The hard news items are almost exclusively local writeups about the single topic of black box voting. His obit seems excusively local. That does not make him notable enough for Wikipedia inclusion. <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_Voting_5359.html" title="Black Box Voting">Black Box Voting</a> has an article in Wikipedia and anything relevant about Stephenson can be included there.

<dd>I've never claimed any such thing nor is your false choice ever been supported. I said <i>One of the reasons that notability requirements are in place is to give privacy to friends and family of the deceased.</i> That's it. It's a simple truth. Stephenson is non-notable. Being a non-notable person affords him and his family a level of privacy from scurilous charges about fraud and fake deaths being repeated on Wikipedia. Further, the notability requirements of Wikipedia should keep him completely anonymous except for perhaps a passing reference in <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Box_Voting_5359.html" title="Black Box Voting">Black Box Voting</a>.--<a href="../../../t/b/e/User%7ETbeatty_05ec.html" title="User:Tbeatty">Tbeatty</a> 09:40, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> This is an AfD. This is about whether this article is encyclopedic and notable by Wikipedia's standards. There is no standard by which we can judge whether this is a "good faith" or "bad faith" nomination, nor <i>should</i> we, because Wikipedia requests that we <a href="../../../a/g/f/WP%7EAGF_612a.html" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> and <a href="../../../n/p/a/WP%7ENPA_4a4b.html" title="WP:NPA">avoid personal attacks</a>. I'm noticing a distinct lack of <a href="../../../c/i/v/WP%7ECIVIL_42ad.html" title="WP:CIVIL">civility</a> in this discussion, and the closing admin will likely note that as well. This is not about Tbeatty, Crockspot, or anyone else and their political affiliations. That is irrelevant to the discussion at hand, and if you feel they are conducting a purge of articles based off of their PoV, this is not the place to address that. Those involved have repeatedly been admonished to take their dispute through the <a href="../../../d/r/_/WP%7EDR_4e9d.html" title="WP:DR">standard resolution process</a> and have persisted in carrying on said dispute on this AfD's page.

<li><b>Second</b> I would like to reiterate Rosicrusians point. The notability of the subject is INDEPENDANT of the political activism, political positions, rudeness, bad faith, or any other fact about any editor here or anywhere else. Either he is notable or he is not. Provide evidence to support your view, and leave it at that. Opinion or evidence of perceived wrongdoing by another editor does NOT have ANY bearing on the article at hand or this AfD and should be left to other venues at WikiPedia, such as talk pages or RfCs.

<li><b>Delete</b>, the article doesn't demonstrate a level of notability. The material the person has written <i>may</i> be relevant in some articles, and the person <i>may</i> be worth mentioning <i>in short</i> somewhere, but I don't believe the subject warrants an article of its own.<br />
First of all, this deletion debate's journey started with the wrong foot - every time someone posts "hey, everybody, vote for/against deletion" in some forum, the whole debate gets rickety. Consider this from my point of view: I'm uncaffeinated enough to not be able to read the above discussions; AfD is supposed to be a simple place to follow. A pre-emptive hug of consolation to whoever admin has to close this mess!<br />
That said, I need to evaluate the current state of the article: Okay, so here we have a journalist... who has done some mudslinging at voting machines... and failed to get elected to an office... and died. In my opinion, that doesn't yet pass the "more important than average professor" gut feeling, <i>even</i> if you have media mentions and like. There's lots of journalists in this world, there's lots of prominent electronic voting critics. There's a whole bunch of also-ran election candidates, who have consistently been deemed nonnotable (for that merit alone, barring other claims of fame) in Wikipedia. Lacking these, this is more of a merge material or something completely forgettable. --<i><a href="../../../w/w/w/User%7EWwwwolf_e5a0.html" title="User:Wwwwolf">wwwwolf</a></i> (<a href="../../../w/w/w/User_talk%7EWwwwolf_87c6.html" title="User talk:Wwwwolf">barks</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Wwwwolf_f672.html" title="Special:Contributions/Wwwwolf">growls</a>) 15:53, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

Look, if you'll check my history you'll find that I've started more than my share of AfDs, and though you <i>won't</i> see it in my history I've been responsible for quite a few <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">speedy deletions</a> and <a href="../../../p/r/o/WP%7EPROD_dadf.html" title="WP:PROD">successful prods</a>. I don't like seeing garbage cluttering the encyclopedia. I'm all for uncontroversial deletions. But when there's any doubt, as there certainly is here, I have a very strong bias in favor of <b>keep</b>; it doesn't really hurt anything to leave the article in place and I am <i>certain</i> that a number of people, learning about Stephenson from other sources, have visited Wikipedia to get more information on him. The activities of Stephenson during his life and the major Internet controversy surrounding his last days are more than sufficient to make him notable. Yeah, his politics were kind of silly and his "research" into voting methods highly questionable, but politics does not belong here. I reiterate my opinion that this article should clearly be <b>kept</b>. <a href="../../../v/o/i/User%7EVoiceOfReason_c913.html" title="User:VoiceOfReason">VoiceOfReason</a> 18:06, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>I actually agree with you about the politics, that's why I put this up for deletion. There is no reason to bring the internet controversy to wikipedia and that is what was happening. Black Box Voting is notable and he certainly is a part of that. But a human interest writeup in Seattle Weekly is hardly noteworthy as meeting the inclusion criteria for WP and that's my problem with this entry. As you have seen from the multiple SPA writeups, this article has become a memorial to an otherwise non-notable person. I listed the six or so other people on the upcoming HBO show that are also non-notable (as is the show) but the topic IS notable and that is where they deserve mention.

<li><b>Comment</b> He spent years travelling around the country as an activist and specialist or expert on security flaws of black box voting. He was written up and quoted in numerous newspaper of international circulation. He testified at numerous hearings on machine certification. The campaign against him by right-wing blogs was documented in newspapers. This is all besides many thousands of internet mentions in sites concerned with verified voting.<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 18:32, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> The "campaign against him by right-wing blogs" that "was documented in newspapers" is the part I have a problem with. Ferrari's claims in a newspaper are completely different than Ferrari's claims on blogs. She was documenting what was going on in real time on the blogs, but months later, she suddenly is telling newspapers completely contradictory information. The info in the newspaper article cannot be independently verified, but it can be debunked by Ferrari's own statements on blogs. Of course, blogs are not reliable sources, though her statements on them <i>might</i> be usable as primary sources. The article as it looks right now is not too bad, and I am ALMOST inclined to switch to a keep, but I cannot be assured that the smear campaign that existed when this article was first nominated will not return, therefore, I am holding firm on my delete vote. If you want to look at a pretty good archive of all the blog activity during the event, check out the <a href="http://www.scamdy.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.scamdy.com/" rel="nofollow">www.scamdy.com</a> forums.

These sources establish the notability of the "Black Box Voting" organization, and clearly establish both Andy Stephenson and Bev Harris as co-equally notable in the topic as well. The fact that Ms. Harris does not have an article yet does not mean she is not notable; indeed I am certain it will be remedied soon. What more burden of verifiability do you place on this subject? These are not just Op-Ed pieces or articles by friends of the subject. RELIABLE sources cite his work in the field, and The Guardian even uses the word "expert" specifically to refer to him... --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 18:55, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

He won't meet the "widely recognized contribution that is part of the <i>enduring historical record</i> in their specific field" test, because the contribution, which may or may not enter the enduring historical record was Black Box Voting's, not his, and he did not lead the organization. A failed candidacy is not a basis of notability by Wikipedia standards. He fails the "<i>primary subject</i> of multiple non-trivial published works whose source is independent of the person" test by not being a primary subject of anything in a <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">reliable source</a> except his obituary. (The result on this test could change in the future, but not by blog posts about him.) He doesn't meet the "achieving renown or notoriety for their involvement in newsworthy events" test because the reliable sources continued to need to explain who he is (mostly associate director of BBV) every time they mention him.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The fact the Bev was the director and he was the associate director in no way prevents him having an article in relation to his activities in the organization. Scott Palmer is Dennis Hastert's assistant and he has his own article. Stephenson has well established notability in his own right. If he is in the news, the fact that he was for a time part of the Black Box Voting organization does not somehow transfer all his notability to that organization and prevent an article about him. <a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:26, 17 October 2006 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> The term "smear campaign" is ambiguous in these discussions. To some it means that Freepers and others alleged that he was not sick, didn't have cancer, didn't need the money for an operation, and that he was just looking for money for personal use in general. Scamdy reports calls to the hospital and to the supposed surgeon, who could not legally release any info to outsiders in any event. The Scamdy website is self documenting with posts made blogs denying that he legitimately needed money for an operation and that he was gravely ill. It is also described in the Seattle paper articles. To others "smear campaign" means the claim made in 2005 that the aforementioned right-wing campaign caused his death by preventing the hospital getting the money in time for an operation to be done around March 10, which is not well documented. He had an operation toward the end of May and subsequently died. This was apparently disputed for some time. What part of that is POV?<a href="../../../e/d/i/User%7EEdison_ee2e.html" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> 19:41, 17 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Response to wwwolf's comments</b> I think wwwolf has made one of the best delete arguements here, but I would like to counter it with some points. 1) He seems to figure prominently in the upcoming HBO documentary "Hacking Democracy" He is not the sole subject; but its not a biopic, it is about the entire topic, and other sites attest to his recognized expertise in that topic. 2) Several sources have specifically cited him for his work, and quote him specifically with regards to his work, or even call him an expert (The Guardian reference, for one example). He meets primary notability criteria: He's referenced in several reputable sources in a non-trivial way. 3) His notability is not necessarily as a journalist <i>per se</i> but as an activist. As an activist, he is certainly significantly more notable than the average activist. His appearence in several reputable sources in a non-trivial manner attests to that --<a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayron32_634d.html" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a> 20:33, 18 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Correct, with obvious discussion and disagreement above, plus solitiations of outsiders to come here, this will stay open until a closing admin decides 1) which arguments from Wikipedia policy are stronger and 2) who they are going to choose to disenfranchise as not being an established editor. Plus, AFD runs for five days (plus however longer it takes the admins to get to it and decide the right answer - obvious closes generally close close to on time, things like this usually take longer). Then after that, somebody will decide the admin got the closure wrong, and it will go to deletion review.
