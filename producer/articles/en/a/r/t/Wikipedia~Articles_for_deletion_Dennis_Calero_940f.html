<p>Notability/importance in question. Subject's only assertion of notability is working for a comic book company.

<li><b>Comment</b> I'm sorry, but I have tried to, respectfully make clear, that Dennis Calero, aside of course from being one of my favorite artists, has worked on hundreds of comics, many of which are featured in wikipedia as significant, as well as having had his most recent title nominated for a Harvey award, which is arguably the second highest award in comics, second only to the eisner.<br />
<br />
My understanding is that he is working on several projects that would be commonly considered "notable."<br />
<br />
Thank you all. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by Ughmonster (<a href="../../../u/g/h/User_talk%7EUghmonster_ea23.html" title="User talk:Ughmonster">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Ughmonster_792f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Ughmonster">contribs</a>).</small>
<ul>
<li>The projects themselves my be notable, but that doesn't mean everyone who works on them is. What has this person done that is truly notable? What non-trival, widely-read and trusted publications has he personally been interviewed or been the subject of articles in? --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 05:00, 22 October 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think this is a bit premature. A good start is that he's the penciller of a recently Harvey-Award-nominated series (and penciller is the principle artistic role for a comic), and there should be mre info to find. - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:02, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

<li>I understand your concerns about this being premature. The fact is, the article has been deleted twice, and has been proposed for deletion a third time by more than one person. This seems like a good compromise, because it allows community consensus and stops the repeated deleting and reposting that's been occuring. --<a href="../../../n/m/c/User%7ENMChico24_74ee.html" title="User:NMChico24">NMChico24</a> 05:16, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not sure I understand the idea that the project may be notable and yet the person who actually draws it is not? Other than the writer, the penciller (or artist as he both pencilled and inked his own work) is the most significant person on the project. By the way, my apologies for my misunderstanding of Wiki ediquette. In the meantime, here's a link to the 2006 Harvey Award nominees: Thank you man in black. The only reference I have is a printed program from the Baltimore Convention in which the awards took place.

<li>Please accept my apologies if the above statement that I made seems a little strongly-worded. I am simply stating some questions that should be answered by the article.

<li>The notice stays up for a week, so that people can bring up any new information. (It doesn't seem likely that new information will make it more likely to be deleted, but it could turn out that Calero is someone's pen name or a hoax or something. Not likely, but possible.) In the meantime, we're going to add the information needed to keep it from being deleted speedily (that is, without a discussion). - <a href="../../../a/_/m/User%7EA_Man_In_Black_280b.html" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In <font color="black"><b>Bl♟ck</b></font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/_/m/User_talk%7EA_Man_In_Black_5bf7.html" title="User talk:A Man In Black">conspire</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_A_Man_In_Black_2a49.html" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)</small> 05:27, 22 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> If the article cannot be appropriately rewriten after three tries, it is time to give it a rest. You may be quite right that Dennis Calero will become notable any month now.

<li>Benjar, simply because the previous iterations of this article may have been prematurely deleted and the original authors didn't care to contest it, doesn't in and of itself, speak to THIS articles deletion. Dennis Calero has done more work and mroe significant work, award nomiated work, than many of the other comic artists listed currently in wiki. In fact, the fact that three seperate people (or at the very least two) have tried to put up articles concerning this artist should SPEAK to notability, not against it.

<dd>I would also ask Ughmonster, who created the page and is either a huge fan of the artist or the artist himself, to please stop interjecting whbat may be seen as self-serving or possibly biased comments, and let an unfettered dicussion take place. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 01:07, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your comments are unnecc. acerbic and frankly, presumptuous. No I did nto read the entire manual of style, but I have made an honest effort to read to every page and set of guidelines that I've been referred to, none of which suggested that commenting in a discussion page is ill-mannered. There is no "hype" in my listing, except perhaps for a link to the artist's website, which I did not add.
<dl>
<dd>I don't see how asking me to stop "interjecting" is going to add to the discussion. It's my first page, and if this is supposed to be a discussion, why wouldn't I be encoruaged to try and answer criticism and ask questions?</dd>
<dd>At the same time, I don't want to seem like I'm trying to hinder the process, but I frankly don;t understand, with every Wiki policy emphasizing being kind to first time users, why some obviously more experienced users insist on slamming me for not being as familiar with Wiki policies as they, and to the point of accusations of dsengeniousness, especially considering that in terms of "overt bias" and "advertising", just about every other current comic artist's listing on this site includes contact information and service descriptions. --Ughmonster 02:30, 23 October 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No one's "slamming" anyone by asking that those who contribute to Wikipedia read up on some of the basic rules and editorial policies. It's also hard for unbiased, disinterested contributors, with no personal stake in an issue, to have a substantive discussion on its merits when an interested party won't let them do so without it turning into an issue of personal emotion. --<a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 19:28, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> The author of the article has given a pretty good defense of notability, if it all turns out to be true. Unfortunately, the article as it currently stands does not reflect all the information Ughmonster has cited. The article needs major improvement, it needs to be written out with proper sources to verify everything said by Ughmonster. Starblind notes that the guy is up for a pretty serious award within the industry and working on several major, notable projects is good enough for me as far as notability is concerned. If the article is fixed by the end of the AfD cycle, it should be kept... if it only has a small amount of info, as it does now, then <b>delete</b> it. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 07:40, 23 October 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You're right that not all articles need to be really long, but they need to have at least some content; this one has a grand total of four sentences and they leave out vital information that ALL biographical articles need: birth date, hometown, education, etc. Four sentences isn't anything, it needs to be written out in a few paragraphs and in the proper form for living biographies. I agree that the guy seems notable enough, though so far there aren't really any sources cited in the article to back up these claims.

If you look through my <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_MidgleyDJ_3b73.html" title="Special:Contributions/MidgleyDJ">contributions</a> and those of the user you are suggesting is also "me" ie: <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_4.18GB_bfa2.html" title="Special:Contributions/4.18GB">User:4.18GB</a> you'll see we dont have the same edit history, interests or contributions. I've done nothing wrong: I've not deleted other peoples comments, I've not written comments under pseudonyms or sockpuppet/anon accounts. <a href="../../../m/i/d/User%7EMidgleyDJ_85d5.html" title="User:MidgleyDJ">MidgleyDJ</a> 04:41, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> To the people concerned about 'ballot-stuffing,' keep in mind that the AfD is NOT a vote and is NOT determined by which side has the most in support. Rather, whether or not to delete an article is determined by the arguments offered by each side. When someone says 'keep' or 'delete' without any argument, the administrator is supposed to totally ignore them. Theoretically, an AfD nomination could have 10 people voting for keeping something and only one or two voting for deletion and the article could still be deleted if those voting for deletion have the better argument. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 04:53, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Way, I will keep that in mind. And Midge, I have, but regardless, it's clear what you're up to and merits no further response. --Ughmonster 05:12, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> This arguing (between Ughmonster and Midgley) needs to stop; please quit being so petty and quit accusing each other of things. Stick to the topic: whether this article should or should not be kept. The admins are smart, if someone is playing games they'll notice; they're only going to look at the arguments so this doesn't matter. Can't we keep it a bit more professional? --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a> 06:20, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"He started it"?? I find that statement, combined with Ughmonster's sockpuppet accusations (without requesting formal verification) a troublesome drop in the standards we all voluntarily try to keep. I applaud <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThe_Way_bc82.html" title="User:The Way">The Way</a>'s attempts at keeping the discussion at an elevated level. Ughmonster has more than made his position clear and I can only ask, as a disinterested party, that he please just let the Admins make their decision. -- <a href="../../../t/e/n/User%7ETenebrae_e666.html" title="User:Tenebrae">Tenebrae</a> 15:02, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm all for letting admins make their decisions and I don't really care one way or the other, but it seems obvious to me that Ughmonster was making a joke. Unless I'm a suckpuppet. Or sockpuppet. Whatever. --ConeyIslandBoy 16:13, 25 October 2006 (UTC)</dd>
