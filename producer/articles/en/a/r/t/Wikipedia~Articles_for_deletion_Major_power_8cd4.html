<p>This article is Original Research. The users writing the page have been deciding according to their own debates what countries are and are not "major powers". Since "major power" is not a properly defined political science term (it's really only used colloquially), it's impossible to establish a clear criterion for inclusion or exclusion from this article. There is no criterion for what qualities and in what quantity are necessary to deem a country a "major power".

<dd>Just a couple of things. Firstly, it was nice of you to give no warning or notice to the editors that have worked on this article before nominating it. Secondly, is <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_power.html" title="Great power">Great power</a> the only term that can be used for a power that is not a Superpower yet is stronger than a Middle power or Regional power. If there is any other term that defines such powers then a simple move will do I think. The majority of the content should stay, in one location or the other. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 08:15, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: part of the idea, I think, was to reach a consensus on the need to jettison (delete) most of the content that's there (OR). Have you <i>seen</i> that article's talk page? Suggesting a merge would only lead to endless clamour and bickering from people wishing, against all good sense, to keep what's there. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 15:04, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>An Afd proposal is not the way to force changes to an article. If you object to the contents then as a matter of courtesy you ought to bring it up with editors on the article talk page (as a matter of fact, I might be wrong but don't believe that you have made any particular contribution to the article - 1 minor edit, that seems to be all). As for the article title, 'Major power', I will take your word for it that this does not have a basis in academic political science. If this is the case then it would have been nice for you and Thames to bring this up on the talk page; I don't think that you would have found any disagreement with moving/editing this article if you had calmly and reasonably explained the situation - simply slapping OR tags on the page isn't really a meaningful contribution towards its improvement.</dd>

<dd><a href="../../../x/d/a/User%7EXdamr_c318.html" title="User:Xdamr">Xdamr</a>, you, I think, are missing the point. We have before us a <i>purely</i> OR article; discussing "changes" or plastering its content on another page won't solve anything. It simply needs to go. Also, your talk of "forcing changes," I find, is disingenuous—"Major power" is not a scientific term and so cannot be "defined" in a manner that would not run contrary to Wikipedia principles. I think this AfD nomination is legitimate and its goal is simple and very clear: delete the current OR article and replace it with a redirect to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Power</a>, where the general concepts, provided they are encyclopaedic and verifiable, can be developed. I am glad you noticed that I never substantially contributed to what I have openly identified as OR; why would I add to the problem? I see no contradiction. In brief: do you dispute that the article is original research? If not, let's get this behind us and turn our discussions to something called <a href="../../../p/o/l/Political_science.html" title="Political science">Political science</a>. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 21:13, 8 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>You're going about this backwards (that's how this mess was started in the first place).

<dd>Obviously I can't vote in this matter, but I would like to defend the claimed OR in the article. GB, France, Germany, Japan, China, Russia, and India are widely talked about as Major Powers in the world. Other countries also deserve mention such as Italy, but because they are not "documented" as a major power are not included. Whats ironic about this is that Major Power is the older article of the two. Anyway, if this is merged, all content should be merged. Anyway, the content currently presented, is only there after a <b>LOT</b> of discussion. Slowly but surely, these articles are becoming NPOV, with the current group of dedicated editors, namely Xdamr, Guinnog and Noble Eagle but several others as well. 12.220.94.199 01:44, 9 May 2006 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Unfortunately, being "widely talked about" doesn't mark them down as legitimate. If these countries were <i>expressly classified</i> as "Major Powers" in <i>social science texts</i> and <i>peer reviewed journals</i>, you'd have grounds for an article. They aren't, and you don't. Like it or not, Xdamr, Guinnog and Noble Eagle, whatever their other qualities, <b>are not the arbiters of polisci taxonomy</b>, and their discussion, however much of it there was, is no justification for an encyclopaedia article. <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 02:11, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The term major power perhaps. But major power is simply a term describing the usage in the media. Take this link that took me five seconds to look up for example. <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_1998/yax-105.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_1998/yax-105.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> While the article is purely speculative, it does make the important point of the major powers in the world. It lists off China and the U.S.(obviously) as the main powers, with the spoilers being India and Russia and the signficant allies being Europe for the U.S.(speculative) and Japan for China(highly speculative). Nonetheless despite the large amounts of speculation, it does show who are the signficant powers in the modern world. 12.220.94.199 02:39, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I do think that there is scope for an article on major power/great power etc. Whether they should all be redirects to one article, or could even deserve their own, I'm not sure.

<dd>I know the article is largely unsourced. We were going to pursue that in time and already cut down on much OR in the UK and Russia sections. But firstly and most importantly, rather than going on about your 'no political term' talk can you just tell me what political science students would call powers such as the UK, Russia, China, India etc. that are NOT Superpowers. Just tell me that so that we can move the information to the related page. <b><a href="../../../n/o/b/User%7ENobleeagle_e018.html" title="User:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkblue">Noble</font><font color="darkorange">eagle</font></a></b> <a href="../../../n/o/b/User_talk%7ENobleeagle_accc.html" title="User talk:Nobleeagle"><font color="darkred"><font size="0.5">(Talk)</font></font></a> 08:16, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

There would be a need for a non-OR NPOV article on great powers listing some of the factors outlining some of the issues in these classifications, but this is not it and the gentle prod of the sourcing tag seems to have had no impact - I suspect (but cannot be sure) that this is exactly because it is OR/interesting intellectual speculation. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMartinp_7670.html" title="User:Martinp">Martinp</a> 19:40, 9 May 2006 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Let's not mince words: Since when is Wikipedia a repository of terms that are in "moderately common colloquial use?" Which guideline sanctions; whose authority supports, the creation of Wikipedia articles that are venues for personal opinions developed through the editors' own research? Our mandate here is not, I would think, to pick up scraps of what the media blurt out and to try to cobble articles out of them. Another expression used fairly commonly in the media, for instance, is "major player," i.e. "the Republic of Foo is now a <i>major player</i> in Southeast Fooian affairs." Should I then go ahead and create Major player (international relations) and define it arbitrarily? <a href="../../../a/l/b/User%7EAlbrecht_dcaf.html" title="User:Albrecht">Albrecht</a> 05:33, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>The specific country entries are highly problematic; they don't say anything I know to be false about the state of geopolitical analysis / publication, but it's very opinionated and many of them approach or pass OR on content summarization. A shorter list of nations which are labeled <i>Major power</i> in the literature would be far superior, without the problematic longer expansion. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:06, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>You just pulled up a bunch of sources that use the term frivolously and arbitrarily along with a handful of others ("major player," etc.) that ought not to have articles. Good effort, but not good enough. ("common usage," by the way, means that the <i>sense</i> (meaning) of the word shouldn't vary substantially. It does.) And if you think the term is "clearly enough defined that people don't argue about it all the time," then you ought to conduct that semi-competent library search you've been talking about and <b>find a definition.</b> The onus is on you. (Oh, and I recommend you take a look at the article's talk page, for instance the section titled "ITALY, WHY YOU DON'T YOU EVEN MENTION ITALY?" Not exactly encouraging.)</dd>

<dd>I've put those references into the article. The basic definition there, and its usage re: the validity of the term, should be established sufficiently by now.</dd>
<dd>The question of whether the individual nations listed, and the format or detail of their listings, are appropriate is a completely different question. Shrinking those to a much more compact list, and clarifying that there is no universally accepted list but that these nations have been labeled as such (and preferably, working to reference each nation's labeling) are good things. But that's article improvement work, not deletion justification. I will poke around and work on that, but I can't do it all today.

<dd>Good effort. The trouble is, as it stands, beyond the dicdef, the <b>entire article</b> consists of "the individual nations listed, and the format or detail of their listings". I don't think anybody doubts the possibility of a viable article with this title in the future, though it is harder to justify when there an adequate article exists on <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Powers</a>, a term with a much better academic pedigree which seems to include this article's subject. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 18:37, 10 May 2006 (UTC)

<dd>In terms of fixing this article; articles which need major repair are specifically listed as a reason <b>not</b> to AfD in the AfD criteria.

<dd>The only difference between "Great Power" and "Major Power" is the former is well-defined and solidly entrenched behind history while the latter remains redundant and unsubstantiated (look at the list of Great Powers and spot those without a "downfall" date—<b>they correspond <i>exactly</i> to your ad hoc list of "Major" powers!</b>). As "Great Power" falls out of fashion, other terms like "major power" (or "major geostrategic player," as per your links above) are popping up to express basically the same concept. Or am I missing some Earth-shattering difference between states "that have substantial influence on other states" and those "whose opinions must be taken into account by other nations before effecting initiatives"?
<dl>
<dd>Uh... the only difference between "Great Power" and "Major Power" is that a Great Power status is a historical recognition and that a Major Power is a current status designation. A country <i>was</i> a Great Power, or <i>is arguably</i> a Major Power. This is not just a minor semantics point... <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeorgewilliamherbert_8d08.html" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> 19:33, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>"Nuke it and recreate it later more appropriately" is a gross misrepresentation of the situation when we're talking about an unencyclopaedic term defined only by a smattering of OR: There's nothing to nuke, and very little to recreate that can't be added to <a href="../../../g/r/e/Great_Power_5570.html" title="Great Power">Great Power</a> or <a href="../../../p/o/w/Power_in_international_relations.html" title="Power in international relations">Power in international relations</a>.

<p>I would question though whether this one reference (interesting though it is) is notable enough to base an entire article on.</p>
<p>I would note too that their criteria (which are unreferenced) are subtly different from the ones in the article, and that the conclusions they draw are slightly different from those in the article. There remains the nagging doubt in my mind too about whether this article may be based on an earlier version of this Wiki article, leading to a circular situation! Best case scenario, we establish that this article is based on (plagiarised from?) the OR of one website, moderated and modified by the original research of several Wiki editors.</p>
<p>While it is an interesting debate, whether such-and-such a power is a "Major Power" or an "Emerging Superpower" etc, I don't think it belongs on an encyclopedia as it is too arbitrary. Really, who are we to decide whether Russia (say) is a Major Power?</p>
<p>If this article is allowed to stay on Wiki in anything like its present form, we could have next an article on Possible Superpowers of the 22nd century, or one on Countries which will probably never amount to much, or one on Countries which could have been Superpower contenders but blew it. Synthesise some OR criteria and make a list of countries, then let the arguments begin. Entertaining though this might be (up to a point), it doesn't seem apppropriate for an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>I appreciate the work you have put in to try and improve this article, and understand how galling it must be to see the work seemingly deprecated; be assured this is nothing personal (as I mentioned in your talk page), but just a recognition that there is no way to save this from being OR. <a href="../../../g/u/i/User%7EGuinnog_5d26.html" title="User:Guinnog">Guinnog</a> 12:40, 14 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>KEEP the page</b> The only thing that must be done is expanding the sources, which exist and include one or more countries that have this status but you don't mention them becuase you think there is proofs or documentation of their Major Power status, which is the case with Italy.

<dl>
<dd>From my reading of the Afd proposal there are two main points of contention: firstly, the concept of 'Major Power' is OR and secondly the listing of nations within the article is OR. To my mind only the first is a valid AfD criticism; debates over OR in the article content are properly dealt with on the article talk page - the fact that an article is poorly written is not a reason for its deletion, it is a reason to improve it. As Georgewilliamherbert says above, 'the "nuke it and recreate it later more appropriately" approach is against standard WP policy'.
<dl>
<dd>Either you have not thoroughly read the discussion or you are deliberately obstructing the issues involved. No one wants to delete the article because it's "poorly written." What we have here is an indefinable term built on foundations of bickering and sloppy OR. The grounds for deletion, as previously stated, are that the term is redundant, OR, and, not being a polisci term, <i>"cannot be 'defined' in a manner that would not run contrary to Wikipedia principles."</i></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The question of whether 'Major power' is a term of political science is one for political scientists to debate. Personally, I accept in good faith Albrecht's assertion that it is not. However I do not consider that this alone makes the article OR. We see above, and now in the article, that 'Major power' is a term in colloquial usage amongst those involved in the area; it can no longer be seriously asserted that this is 'OR/interesting intellectual speculation' (per Martinp above). Whether it is a strict term of political science is not the point; it has been shown to be a term of art, this makes it worthy of remaining.
<dl>
<dd>If colloquial usage warrants an article then I expect your full support when I create Major player (international relations), Geostrategic player, and Restless Power.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>The term is now sourced. The content of the article may remain open to debate, but the grounds for a legitimate Afd have surely now gone. Informed discussion as to content should now take place on the talk page.
<dl>
<dd>The term, as I said above, is sourced to a laughable assortment of blogs, news stories, dead links, and a <i>book cover.</i> Sorry, no game. The AfD, if anything, is <i>more valid</i> now than when it began since we now know that <i>none</i> of the article's main contributors have shown any serious interest in finding a legitimate basis for the term or demonstrating that it can stand on other foundations than OR (the poor job with sources confirms this). Why not channel our energies toward something productive?</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>I question whether the votes above can now legitimately stand; now that the term is sourced it is no longer OR. Those who voted above based their conclusions on a superceded version of the article. Either way it would have been much better to have thrashed this out on the talk page before bringing it to Afd. Albrecht said '[I] have never substantially contributed to [an article] I have openly identified as OR'. No-one expects you to contribute to such an article but I would ask whether this precluded you from raising your concerns on the talk page?</dd>

<p>I talked to people in wikipedia and they say that I could edit the page, according to the facts that I showed. Neverthless, I talked in the discussion page,because I want things to be done fairly. I'mnotasking to includ my country or other minor powers. Its Italy.I already showed more facts than all thefacts that areon that page for all the countries, and I showed only for one, because I know what I'm talking about. Even if GDP, military, industry know-how and self-knowledge to construct their own things besides geopolits aren't enough, look at Italy cultural and historical impirtance since Roman epoch untill nowadays. 50% of the worldpatrimony is there. I can provide facts and facts, people doesn't wan't to see them because they prefer a forgotten and more fragile Italy.But the reality is very different. I reed above someone saying that Japan is Major Power, while UK is also a Major Power, usefull to USA but a restless power. Its wrong. Besides UK GDP, financial markets strenghtit has the second most active personel on "peacekeeping" actions in the world, its a major EU member, member of Nato with nuclear power, has a UN Permanent Seat on Security Council besides being the chief country of the British Commonwealth. As you said,one must take into account the powerof the region itself and the power that the coutry has in the region to determinate its power in the world stage. Japan is a Major economical power, but can't influence all Asian continent byitself, altough itsan importantcountry in world stage, its more a regional power of East Asia, not even Asia at allits dimension. Japan cannot deploy its armed forces for war purposes, only in peacekeeping or if it where attacked.In that it's more a puppet of USA than UK. The fact the page has the same nations since the begging is a very poor argument.Everything evolves and develops. The Wikipedia project is always in development, look at the newarticles, pages, expanded articles it has compared with the beggining of that project. The english page is evolving every day. The fact that you don't want the page to be developed is that it was created according to your views or its you that have some prejudices against the thruth. Since you have a personal aproach to these geopolitics,you say that are the others that have this sentiment. Nobody its ownerof the thruth, people could only know more of this or moreof that and someone knows more of this and the other knows more of that. You are not owner of the thruth and not even of Wikipedia, you should listen, or reed what someone knows better than you. I've been studying Italian Geopolitics,culture, politics, military,...,for a very long time. What I want is that the Major Power page shows more fairness and the Great Power pages shows historical accuracy, things I don't see on them now. <a href="../../../a/c/a/User%7EACamposPinho_5414.html" title="User:ACamposPinho">ACamposPinho</a> 2:18, 13 May 2006</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I would invite all people here discussing this subject to extend this treatment to the Emerging superpowers (China, EU, and India and Russia...and blablabla). All sourced points there can be used in their appropriate articles (India..or China..etc). All of them contain original research and NPOV. I know that many fragments are sourced, but to draw a global conclusion based on several facts (very recent ones, still needed to be analized in an historic context) is a little complicated. Anybody here remembers about Japan in the 80's? When the Japanese Royal palace used to worth more than California??? Well, that's my point.

Fourthly, there are also a number of links used that directly link India's, China's, EU's power with a rise to Superpower status so that isn't OR.
