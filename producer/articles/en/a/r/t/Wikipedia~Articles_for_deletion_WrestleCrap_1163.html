<li><b>Delete</b> - I <i>really</i> don't like the new speedy keep guideline (note: guideline, not policy) and this AFD is a poster child for why it is bad. The purpose of it is to stop articles from being repeatedly brought up for deletion in a "forum shopping" situation or as an annoyance tactic. That, however, is not the case here. We're five months into the six month moratorium and this is obviously a good faith nomination. Anyway, enough of my rant ... as for the article itself ... the website never met <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, a guideline which has not changed in the last six months. It has an alexa ranking of 180,522. <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=wrestlecrap.com" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=wrestlecrap.com" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> Googling finds only self-generated and blog hits. The article has ZERO sources or links to anywhere other than the website itself, thus failing <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I can find little reason to keep the article. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 02:09, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - Highly notable among Internet wrestling fans as well as has published work.--<a href="../../../i/u/2/User%7EIU2002_8174.html" title="User:IU2002">IU2002</a> 03:59, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> - I fail to see how this qualifies for a speedy keep. I agree with the points brought up by BigDT. It comes off as advertising and saying something is "notable among internet wrestling fans" doesn't make it notable in general. I am a fan of their site, and I do listen to their radio show, but the site has a lack of content (due to bandwith costs), and a low alexa rating. It does come across as cruft, and should be removed. If it is not removed, it should be cleaned up extensively. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 09:28, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b>, up to an including their widely circulated books. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 11:25, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If the books are notable, that doesn't automatically make the website notable. I don't know, though, that it is definitely a given that the books are notable. There is one overriding concern about both - are there ANY independant resources? Media mentions? Book reviews? Anything? <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 13:51, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, we disagree about the books and website thing, I think they go hand in hand. Regardless, <a href="http://www.ecwpress.com/books/wrestlecrap.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.ecwpress.com/books/wrestlecrap.htm" rel="nofollow">ECW Press</a> isn't some vanity publisher, so that really should be taken into consideration. But since you're asking about sources, keeping in mind that third party wrestling commentary is a bit of a niche, we can start with the Canadian <a href="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/01/21/320002.html" class="external text" title="http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/01/21/320002.html" rel="nofollow">Canoe</a>, and I'll note a number of Wrestlecrap citations and mentions at Google News throughout the wrestling community, on and offline. That may not be enough for some people, but it's more than enough for me. --<a href="../../../b/a/d/User%7EBadlydrawnjeff_e669.html" title="User:Badlydrawnjeff">badlydrawnjeff</a> <small><a href="../../../b/a/d/User_talk%7EBadlydrawnjeff_7de4.html" title="User talk:Badlydrawnjeff">talk</a></small> 14:01, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The article you linked is a good start ... any non-trivial, non-self-generated third party references are good for showing notability and for having a good article. Right now, there's nothing on there. <a href="../../../b/i/g/User%7EBigDT_4d85.html" title="User:BigDT">BigDT</a> 14:08, 26 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. WrestleCrap is probably the most popular wrestling-comedy url and arguably the most well-written of any wrestling site out there. I would, however, like to see some work done by Wikipedia Crappers (the term for fans of the site) to make this article of a higher quality and do more to express the website's importance/notability. <a href="../../../y/o/u/User%7EYoungamerican_1b79.html" title="User:Youngamerican"><i><font color="blue">young</font></i><font color="#CFB53B">american</font></a> <small>(<a href="../../../y/o/u/User_talk%7EYoungamerican_2059.html" title="User talk:Youngamerican">ahoy-hoy</a>)</small> 22:41, 26 June 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The site has a fairly low amount of material, and it's simply just a cult website. I think the poor alexa rating really makes this grounds for deletion, and I'm stunned that more don't agree. I am a fan of the site, but you just can't include everything here. --<a href="../../../b/u/r/User%7EBurgwerworldz_a32c.html" title="User:Burgwerworldz">Burgwerworldz</a> 03:39, 27 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. WrestleCrap is a very popular site among wrestling fans and does deserve its own article because of that.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - it is very notable among the pw fan community, with its site maintainers having published a few notable works. Anyone who noms articles like these should be part of the community relevant to the topic so it puts weight into the matter. After all, it could be a person who is indifferent to (or has a considerable distaste of) the topic who is doing the nomination... <a href="../../../k/e/l/User%7EKelvSYC_688e.html" title="User:KelvSYC">kelvSYC</a> 23:09, 29 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, after researching this a fair bit, surprisingly it is notable. Hopefully it will not become a honeypot for vandalism as most other pro-wrestling articles do. <a href="../../../y/a/m/User%7EYamaguchi%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F_6995.html" title="User:Yamaguchi先生">Yamaguchi先生</a> 05:29, 30 June 2006 (UTC)</li>
