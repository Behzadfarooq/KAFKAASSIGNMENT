The result of the debate was delete as an admitted neologism.

<p>This word has a gender specific use. We do not use "male ejaculation" in speech, it is already understood. Our language is alive and adaptable and because it is, "shejaculation" should stay. I've googled the word and am finding hits for it. The importance of Wikipedia is its usefulness in identifying modern words and phrases.</p>

<li>In light of the comments "anything useful should be merged," I want to stress that the entry itself should be deleted, and that the acting sysop should note that almost everyone so far seems to agree about that. If there is material to merge, this means extra work for the sysop, because a merge-and-delete requires a laborious procedure to merge the history and remain GFDL-friendly, so "merge-and-delete" votes, <i>though valid,</i> are discouraged. (On reviewing this article and <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_ejaculation.html" title="Female ejaculation">Female ejaculation</a> <b>I</b> don't see anything useful to merge. In fact this article contains POV statements that are well discussed in an NPOV way in <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_ejaculation.html" title="Female ejaculation">Female ejaculation</a>, so my vote remains a simple delete). <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> (<a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Dpbsmith_96cf.html" title="Special:Contributions/Dpbsmith">contribs</a>) 10:18, 12 Jun 2005.</small></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. That sounds very odd to me. We're editors. Editing is what we do. To write off material simply because it's been misfiled strikes me as the height of laziness.

<p>There seems already to be a consensus and since I'm the author of the entry, I'll put my two cents in. Do what you will, it's of no real importance. I coined the word and felt pretty good about it. Granted, it is merely a new synonym for "Female ejaculation" but as a feminist, I wanted to give it its own name. It was concise and direct and I thought since the culture of this particular sexual act was still relatively unknown and misunderstood, this word would help draw attention and pique the curiosity of people who wished to learn.</p>
<p>When I googled the word 7 weeks ago, there were no returns. Now there are a few, mostly related to my original article, but oddly two porn sites have picked it up. Now what's more validating than that?</p>
<p>When I visited this site yesterday, I searched the word and no results were returned. However, there was a friendly invitation to create an entry for it. So, I read the rules and didn't seem to be violating any of them (I'm not making money, it wasn't gibberish) and made my entry.</p>
<p>Certainly my ego is involved in making this entry, but I don't think it's more than a healthy one. So, it's of no importance that it remains here.</p>
<p>Perhaps I will get lucky and someday the word will enter the common vernacular and it will be entered by someone else. Until then....</p>
<p>Cheers! gballsout</p>

<li>Thanks for being understanding about it. This is no big deal, I encourage you to continue to contribute, and when the word <i>does</i> enter the vernacular it will be very appropriate to have an entry about it. <a href="../../../d/p/b/User%7EDpbsmith_43f0.html" title="User:Dpbsmith">Dpbsmith</a> <a href="../../../d/p/b/User_talk%7EDpbsmith_07c6.html" title="User talk:Dpbsmith">(talk)</a> 22:21, 12 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
