<p><font color="black">Listen, you may think you're hot stuff here (judging by your claim to being important and etc. on your user page), but you can't get away with threatening to block another editor because he's following Wikipedia policy and you happen to disagree with what he's doing... Domain tasting, whether you like it or not, is the more common name, and <a href="../../../n/a/m/Wikipedia%7ENaming_convention_b251.html" title="Wikipedia:Naming convention">Wikipedia:Naming convention</a> policy makes it clear that articles HAVE to go by their most common name. Furthermore, I did NOT copy and paste that text of the page, the other article was already there, so the version you keep trying to use is a <a href="../../../f/o/r/Wikipedia%7EFork_6778.html" title="Wikipedia:Fork">Wikipedia:Fork</a> file, which also breaks policy. Your kind of aggressive threats and postuiring simply to try to prevail with what you want to do against policy is unacceptable behavior, and it's disgusting that an admin would take such ridiculous actions. I have again restored the redirect to <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_tasting.html" title="Domain tasting">domain tasting</a>, as even the article in question says ICANN and other registrars and groups use that term and that <a href="../../../d/o/m/Domain_kiting.html" title="Domain kiting">domain kiting</a> was just the term coined as a neologism by the CEO of GoDaddy. That's the way it needs to stay, and do not threaten me with an abuse of admin power, because that simply doesn't fly. I'm not impressed by egomaniacs trying to throw their self-perceived weight around, especially when it breaks a number of the rules for how Wikipedia is set up to work. <a href="../../../d/r/e/User%7EDreamGuy_80bf.html" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> 20:48, 14 March 2007 (UTC)</font></p>

<p><font color="black">I was hoping you could move Nephology (to be deleted) back to Nephology for me. Rebroad decided that this was too short and should be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nephology_%28to_be_deleted%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106136726" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nephology_%28to_be_deleted%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=106136726" rel="nofollow">merged with Cloud</a> and then moved Nephology to Nephology (to be deleted) so that he could move Cloud to Nephology. When he found out that he couldn't make that move (which ironically, he would have been able to if he'd had it speedy deleted or even Afded), he went to the talk page at Cloud (a first for him and moving) with this comment,</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="black">"Hi. Since this article is studying clouds, would it seem reasonable to rename this article to Nephology, with Cloud redirecting to it? Or perhaps rename the cloud disambiguation page to Cloud which would then include a link to Nephology"</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="black">And his logic is making me think that I need to assume even more good faith then I have been because I'm really now thinking that he wasn't trying to vandalize the person article and that all of his bizarre page moves have just been that--not vandalism. Anyway, he's right--the article's been a one-liner for forever, but it should be put on the stubs in urgent need of attention list, if I can ever find that page again, not move and double-redirected, and not instantly deleted. But I can't put it on the stub list or do anything until it's not called (to be deleted) so I was wondering if you could move for me.</font></p>

<p><font color="black">Hi. I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that the references accessible on Langan's website have again been removed, by user 151.151.21.103. As you know, these are published and legitimate secondary sources which happen to be made available on the website (excluding the CTMU Q&amp;A which I did not add back to the entry). There are no reasonable grounds for excluding these links. I would like to appeal to you to intervene on the Langan talk page, to indicate that no useful purpose is served by this disruptive behaviour. The same user is also arguing for the re-inclusion of the lawsuit material. I know that you and I have been in conflict over the editing of the entry, but I believe that an intervention by you may help to settle things down in relation to this entry. And it is my sincere belief that the hostility which Mr Langan attracts is out of all proportion to his importance. If the entry can achieve stability without much further ongoing conflict, I think it would be best for all parties. I hope you will look favourably on this request.

To act in advance of such changes, without evidence there is any intention to make them, is unjustified. And, honestly, why would he change them? These are the articles and interviews in which he features. He has posted them because he is happy to have them read by the public.

I know it's allowed to remove blatant attacks and vandalism from your own talk page, but DreamGuy seems to treat any questioning of his actions as a blatant personal attack. I'm a bit worried, as it seems that he has repeatedly been a magnet for criticism, but persons are left to sort through old versions of his talk page to find even mild criticism of his actions. At first glance, one is given the rather deceptive impression that nobody has ever become irritated with him.

If you're dealing with a content dispute, your best option is to engage the other editor in open dialogue, if that fails, or if it's a more general behavior problem, then a user RfC may be appropriate.

<ol>
<li><font color="black"><i><a href="../../../p/r/i/Prima_facie.html" title="Prima facie">Prima facie</a></i> evidence does not equal <i>conclusive</i> evidence, reasonably informed people can see things differently. Prior discussion helps clear that up. Direct discussion is what I had been requesting from square zero.</font></li>
<li style="list-style: none"></li>
<li><font color="black">I did 2 "Undo-style" reverts, both of which were preceeded by express (yet unmet) requests for input on the discussion page. I can respect that might not have been appreciated. Nevertheless, clearly defining "consensus" seems next to impossible if there is no direct discussion upon which to establish it, no?</font></li>
<li><font color="black">You seem to have applied an expansive definition of what constitutes a "revert" (as opposed to a "change" or an "integration" under <a href="../../../c/o/n/WP%7ECON_c65b.html" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a>). That's fine, but it seems that would warrant an even closer careful scrutiny and greater effort to first discuss and verify and determine good faith, and not initiating first-contact with warnings and threatened blocks.</font></li>
<li><font color="black">Your terms: "suggests <i>you</i> don't have consensus" (above) seem to conflate support for a <i>contributor</i> with support for the <i>contributions</i> themselves. This does not seem entirely appropriate in this instance.</font></li>
<li><font color="black">"8 changes reverted by 5 different editors" I'm not sure that's entirely correct. At least two of the contributions were uncontroversial mundane clarifications that (so far) remain uncontested:</font></li>

<li><font color="black">[2007-03-25T08:41:05] This one <i>was</i> potentially controversial, but I indicated it as a "propose rewoding of caption," (sic) directly requesting feedback, and not for the purpose of "warring", it was reverted by a user who has yet to address the issue in discussion.</font></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<ol>
<li><font color="black">Most ironically, the main point of contention was the content of one particular image caption. Prior to my recent contributions, the caption had no mention about doubts with the video, but now, in the current version of the article, it does. <i>Does that mean my efforts have led the way in a "change" of consensus?</i> To this day I do not know the precise answer to that question, because the discussion page is still parked with unmet requests for clarification on that precise issue.</font></li>

I don't understand ordinal numbers, but <a href="../../../o/r/d/Ordinal_arithmetic.html" title="Ordinal arithmetic">ordinal arithmetic</a> says that ordinal exponentiation and cardinal exponentiation should not be confused, and that in fact 2<sup>ω</sup> = ω. However, this sentence has been in the article for over a year, many people must have read it, and as I said, I don't understand ordinal numbers, so I'd like to check before changing it.

<dd><font color="black">I'm not speaking for Arthur here, but the issue is just that the notation 2<sup>ω</sup> can be used either to mean cardinal exponentiation or to mean ordinal exponentiation, and except in contexts where it clearly is supposed to be ordinal exponentiation it is read to mean cardinal exponentiation.
