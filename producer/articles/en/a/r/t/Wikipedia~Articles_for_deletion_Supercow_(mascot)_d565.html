<p>The result of the debate was <b>Delete</b>. There are a large number of new users, and welcome to all of you, we're glad you are here and hope you choose to stay and contribute to our encyclopedia. In fact it was just such a discussion that got me hooked on Wikipedia, believe it or not... and it's great fun. But most of the commentors did not address the issue with the article, that it does not establish notability for a general interest encyclopedia such as this one. The longer time users all have concurred with this, and even though numerically the Keeps (not DO NOT DELETE!) have it, we don't count noses, we operate on consensus weighing the arguments and inputs given. This article is a clear delete on that basis, in my judgement. I think that some small portion of this article could be merged ito the school article and would be happy to userify it if requested. <b>Delete</b> --<b><font color="green">+</font><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_Lar_3e70.html" title="Special:Emailuser/Lar">+</a></b><a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELar_121d.html" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="../../../l/a/r/User_talk%7ELar_64ff.html" title="User talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Lar_d92b.html" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 02:45, 19 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Although Supercow does pertain to one specific department at one specific school, it is a source of pride, entertainment, and humour at schools across North America (let alone Canada). The reason for this importance, isn't just in its entertainment value, but also in how well it symbolizes the school spirit that so many engineering schools attempt to foster. Much like the Red Suits at McMaster, the Cannon at U of T, and the Tool at Waterloo, Super Cow symbolizes not just the sprit of a single school, but also the enthusiasm many have for engineering as a whole. Furthermore, SuperCow is regularly used as an example within provincial levels of engineering student societies, and internationally. The similarities between UofG's Supercow and Wisconsin's cow at the US national engineering conference were also a topic of discussion. Merging this article into a parent article would be detrimental to the subject material, because the concepts of engineering spirit embodied by suprcow transcend the subject of a single school. Rather than suggesting deletion, I think we should be pushing the original author to update the article to reflect reality a little more. <a href="../../../j/b/f/User%7EJbfung_0d1c.html" title="User:Jbfung">Joseph Fung</a> 19:04, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Engineering in Canada has a long history of traditions and symbols. This is also applicable to the various student organizations across the country that help to promote engineering and serve engineering students. Supercow is quite possibly one of the most recognized symbols throughout student engineering, alongside many othe symbols listed above. In fact, supercow's visibility is not just constrained to Canada, but is also recognized in the United States (through the auspices of the National Association of Engineering Student Councils) and Europe (through the Board of European Students of Technology. Please do not delete, as it would be a great disservice to a large segment of the wiki community. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.36.152.3 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.36.152.3_7d78.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.36.152.3">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Supercow is an important player in the unity of the Canadian Engineering Schools. I have seen the above mentioned video at the 2006 Canadian Federation of Engineering Students Congress in Windsor Ontario in January 2006. I also have a picture of SuperCow taken from Congress '06. (seen here <a href="http://photos.tmod.ca/v/cfes2006/CIMG0224.JPG.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://photos.tmod.ca/v/cfes2006/CIMG0224.JPG.html" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>).

<li><b>DO NOT DELETE</b> Supercow is a symbol of the dedication/bull headedness needed to be an engineer. He is frequently abducted/imperiled and mus tovercome many troublesome situations. In other words, he represents the student experience to a T. While an iconoclast may point out that the grounding of ideas or attributes to a physical object inherently warps them, it also true that a totem such as Supercow allows students at U of C engg to identify with the aforementioned virtues in a tangible way, without getting lost in abstract discussions on philosophical underpinnings, as has been known to happen. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 142.56.86.20 (<a href="../../../1/4/2/User_talk%7E142.56.86.20.html" title="User talk:142.56.86.20">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_142.56.86.20_387a.html" title="Special:Contributions/142.56.86.20">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
<li><b>Do Not Delete</b> Originating from the University of Calgary, Supercow is constantly travelling amoung engineering schools across Canada. Last year she spent most of the year in Eastern Canada, touring a number of engineering schools and starring in her own video. Merging with a school page is inappropriate, though I agree the history, pictures, and video should be elaborated on this page. Supercow is notable amoung a vast number of engineers across Canada. <a href="../../../m/a/r/User%7EMark_Skovmose_da6e.html" title="User:Mark Skovmose">Mark Skovmose</a> 20:46, 14 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>DON'T DELETE</b> Being one of the co-founders of Supercow, I have a soft spot for this mascot. I was fortunate enough to have it accompany us on its first trip to a national conference, and we proudly displayed Supercow whenever we could. Somewhat surprised by the attention he was getting, students from across Canada began placing their school stickers on Supercow. He became an instant hit at the conference, with schools trying to claim him as their own (all in friendly fashion of course). It can be said with pride that I was among some of the first few to take Supercow on its first adventure, and it is amazing to see how far it has travelled and how much recognition it gets. I think it would truly be a shame to lose a piece of Engineering Pride across Canada by removing it from Wikipedia. More exposure to this mascot will only accompany more a sense of belonging as Canadian University student, and explain to those inquisitors exactly the signifance of Supercow. - Simmer <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by Simmer2 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Simmer2_22e7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Simmer2">contribs</a>) .</small></li>

<li><b>Expand</b> The article in its current form only mentions supercows existance which is not significant enough to be an article. However if its history once provided and expanded shows that supercow has been involved in events which are relavant to undergraduate enginneering students in general it becomes a notable mascot. As there are about 48000 engineering students at anyone time if this mascot has been involved significantly accross canada I would consider it notable.68.147.36.105 -Greg</li>
<li><b>Strong Do Not Delete</b> Many special interest articles exist on Wikipedia that would only appeal to a very specific audience. Just follow a few links under art, literature, or any specific branch of science to see what I mean. The idea of "non-notable" is purely subjective, and, as can be seen from this discussion, Supercow is not "non-notable" to a significant number of people. I would argue against merging this article with the school's article, because the two topics are quite separate from each other. If the concern is about the substance of the article, the best solution would be to close this discussion so that the many willing contributors can be expanding and refining the article as opposed to fighting to keep it from deletion. It would be against the spirit of Wikipedia to delete an article to which there is an interested audience and willing contributors. Zuluct 17:15, 17 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Don't Delete but Expand</b> This article is not about a mascot for any particular school, but a mascot for tens of thousands of engineering students across Canada. Surely it would be a misrepresentation of the subject matter to hide this away in a mostly unrelated article, aside from the fact that this happened to be the school that began a nationwide tradition. That being said, I believe more detail on the actual mascot is required in order for this article to convey useful information, but deleteing it will most certainly not accomplish this. Secondly, the number of previous edits a user has on wikipedia really has no bearing on the validity of their opinion. Many users view wikipedia articles but do not edit, and these people have equally valid opinions as to what sort of articles are useful and interesting to the users of wikipedia. <small>—The preceding comment was added by <a href="../../../t/r/i/User%7ETristanJ_f58d.html" title="User:TristanJ">TristanJ</a> (<a href="../../../t/r/i/User_talk%7ETristanJ_8762.html" title="User talk:TristanJ">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_TristanJ_b7f4.html" title="Special:Contributions/TristanJ">contribs</a>) .</small></li>
