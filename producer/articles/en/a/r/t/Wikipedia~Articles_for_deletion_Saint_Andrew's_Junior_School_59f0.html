<li>Well firstly because it's unnotable cruft, secondly because it needs to be demonstrated that attempts to subvert vfd and intimidate voters by organising votes to keep is wrong.

<li>That's because the so-called "St. Andrew's group of schools" merely describes a group of affiliated schools. It is not one educational institution, the same way <a href="../../../a/n/g/Anglo-Chinese_School_b6d5.html" title="Anglo-Chinese School">Anglo-Chinese School</a> actually dosent exist as one insitution either. There are many other similar groups of schools with affiliations, such as the schools in the Rafflesian umbrella (<a href="../../../r/a/f/Raffles_Institution_7ff0.html" title="Raffles Institution">Raffles Institution</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Raffles_Junior_College_2e31.html" title="Raffles Junior College">Raffles Junior College</a>, <a href="../../../r/a/f/Raffles_Girls%27_School_%28Secondary%29_49af.html" title="Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)">Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)</a> etc. Unless schools actually merge into one, like what happened with <a href="../../../h/w/a/Hwa_Chong_Institution_8603.html" title="Hwa Chong Institution">Hwa Chong Institution</a>, it makes little sense to be talking about a brand name instead of the various institutions represented.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 17:52, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmm....not really. SAJS's principal is Mrs Wai Yin Pryke. SASS's is Mrs Belinda Charles. SAJC's Mrs Lim Chye Tin. SAJC's new campus is still being constructed as we speak, and currently is located away from the other schools. We have other affiliated schools moving to neighbouring sites, but that dosent mean the school has merged into one. For clear definitions of the status of Singapore schools, it is far better to refer to the <a href="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/index.asp" class="external text" title="http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/index.asp" rel="nofollow">School information Service of Singapore's Ministry of Education</a> page instead, because so long that these schools are listed seperately there, they are still officially considered seperate institutions.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 19:01, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Okay, I goofed on using the term "principal" but the rest is true. Perhaps the head of SAS is still termed "warden"? Anyway, it's not necessary for the physical schools to be merged for the there to be an article on Saint Andrew's School. Furthermore, <a href="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=15" class="external text" title="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=15" rel="nofollow">Page 4</a> of the <a href="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=12" class="external text" title="http://www.saintandrewsschool.info/index.cfm?GPID=12" rel="nofollow">history of Saint Andrew's School</a> and others show these schools all developed from the same institution. We have verged from the focus of discussion of this page. My point is that SAS page would be the site of merger of SAJS, if necessary. <a href="../../../d/o/u/User%7EDoubleBlue_f889.html" title="User:DoubleBlue"><font color="darkblue"><b>Double</b></font><font color="blue">Blue</font></a> (<a href="../../../d/o/u/User_talk%7EDoubleBlue_3ebb.html" title="User talk:DoubleBlue">Talk)</a> 20:08, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)

<li>I understand your concerns, but this phenomena of schools sharing the same heritage, or having split off from the same institution, is still not unique enough to warrant special treatment, at least in the Singaporean context. We do have several schools with different school names, yet are closely affiliated, and it is not always practical to lump them together (for eg, my former sch, Montfort Secondary School, is affiliated to St. Gabriel's Secondary School and Assumption English school, along with the associated primary/junior schools. What shall we call this unified entity, then? In addition, all these schools are Catholic schools, which are in turn affiliated to all other Catholic schools in Singapore. Where do we draw the line?). I personally feel that each school should have its own entry, provided they have substaintial material which are encyclopedic.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 20:25, 11 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

Huaiwei, I understand what you are talking about there, but the 3 schools were originally one school ever since its founding (1862) until the 1970s or 80s when the 3 schools then split. So in essence, they are actually the one and the same school. This is not the same as brother/sister school affiliation (eg St. Andrew's and St. Margaret's) or affiliation by religious movement (Fairfield Methodist and Paya Lebar Methodist) or branch schools (Anglo Chinese School (Independent) and Anglo Chinese School (Barker Road)). I was from St. Andrew's, by the way. <a href="../../../s/a/n/User%7ESandstorm6299_d770.html" title="User:Sandstorm6299">Sandstorm6299</a> 14:21, 18 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>
