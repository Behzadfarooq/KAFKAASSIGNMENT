<li><b>Keep</b>: First of all this article is not copyrighted (if you could read the first sentence) and is rather promoted by a governmental institution to be published anywhere. If you think this article is biased, then it should also be illogical for the Wikipedia to have an article named "armenian genocide" online, since even the United Nations approve the fact that it cannot be named as "genocide" and therefore should be regarded as "allegations" only. Millions of people from tens of countries oppose the idea of so-called Armenian genocide by Ottomans. Also looking at the issue from a different point of view, half a million Muslim Ottoman citizens were also murdered by Armenians (not Russian, Italian, British or other forces in a war) and if there has been an Armenian genocide, then there surely is a Turkish Genocide by the Armenians. This article reflects the views of millions of Turks, including many Armenians of Turkish descent living freely and happily in Turkey. Its objectivity comes from the extensive proof and facts from the archives of tens of organizations and countries. <b>Therefore, deleting this article does not improve Wikipedia's credibility, but only diminishes its objective and neutral attitude. It is also a major offense for the memories of hundreds of thousands of Muslims, who have been murdered by Armenian terrorists 1914-1922, and their relatives. Having a debatable topic like "Armenian Genocide" but not allowing people to edit it is unbearable since some of that article is based on the fake documents and some doesn't even have a basis. Now, deleting this article for it opposes a debatable topic is neither a wiki-style nor a democratic/historical approach. I believe that people should read both articles and then freely decide on their points of view.</b> --<a href="../../../k/a/y/User%7EKayaakyuz_2adf.html" title="User:Kayaakyuz">Kayaakyuz</a> 13:23, 16 April 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Speedy Delete</b> and suggest final warning to users. I believe the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article is a good Wikipedia article as it stands. It links to the disputant sources in the Turkish Government already and has taken viewpoints of Turkish historians into account, so copying statements from the wholesale is unnecessary as well as being a major <i>faux pas</i>. One might consider renaming that article to <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Massacre_3a62.html" title="Armenian Massacre">Armenian Massacre</a> so as not to arouse a minority, but even the word 'massacre' is apparently disputed by one of the users involved in the edit war there, so it's best to draw a line in the sand to avoid editorial creep. Whatever the Armenians did to the Turks is covered elsewhere I'm sure, and does not detract from the reality of histoical events. Just because there are more Turks than Armenians doesn't mean they get to rewrite historiography! As a neutral European (with friends of Armenian and Turkish descent), I believe that nearly a century has passed, and these issues will be acknowledged by the Turks sooner or later. And even if that weren't such a huge inflammatory NPOV question, the article is also appallingly badly translated, has not been through the usual Wikipedia creation process, and the people who uploaded it don't seem to understand the GFDL. Are they in fact the copyright holders? Because if not, they cannot declare it GFDL, nor if it is public domain. You can hand out leaflets, but they have to understand that you cannot do this on Wikipedia. --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a> 16:42, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>I don't understand what is meant by "suggest final warning" above. I contest that the <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a> article is a good Wikipedia article as it stands. Confining myself to the issue at hand, the article is confused or confusing about the notion of "Turkish authorities", which are contrasted with "Turkish intellectuals". Are Turkish historians not Turkish intellectuals? Why are they lumped together with "authorities"? They may be authorities in their field of research, but that is not what you would normally understand "Turkish authorities" to mean. Why is Zeki Kuneralp quoted as an "authority", and quoted as if he spoke yesterday instead of more than 15 years ago, while the poor man, who has now been dead and buried for almost eight years, had then been retired for more than ten years? What is the subtext of the section heading "Political Arguments"? The excerpt or summary of the official position of the Republic of Turkey, although not entirely wrong, is quite incomplete. There are external links, but it is very difficult to navigate them to find reliable further details about the official position. Some people who have a strong point of view on the matter, from both sides, want to censor the presentation of some different points of view. I strongly believe that the viewpoints of <i>all</i> major players in this tragic, deep, and long-standing conflict should be reported accurately and comprehensively in Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 19:15, 16 April 2006 (UTC)

<li>They should be reflected in a neutral article, not in a series of POV forks.

<li>So if I understand you guys correctly, because <i>you</i> don't agree with the position of the Turkish government on the issue, the information about that position should be withheld from other readers of Wikipedia. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 02:44, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Information about the position is not being withheld from readers. The identical text is linked to from <a href="../../../a/r/m/Armenian_Genocide_187a.html#Websites_opposing_the_genocide_theses" title="Armenian Genocide">Armenian Genocide#Websites opposing the genocide theses</a> (third bullet point); there are 2000 words in section 4 alone describing the position of the Turkish authorities (that of national institutions of historians I think is hard to distinguish from that of the Government, since it is obvious that there is little academic freedom for historiographers, what with one person still on trial for this). The intention must be to produce one definitve article on the events, noting disagreements in the relevant places, in accordance with <a href="../../../n/p/o/WP%7ENPOV_1d4d.html" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. If section 4 doesn't represent the arguments in the link well, then a possible rewrite of it or new section 4.3 could be suggested at <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_Genocide_0a21.html" title="Talk:Armenian Genocide">Talk:Armenian Genocide</a>. By 'final warning to users' I meant that an admin should take this in hand and make it very clear to him that uploading 160KB of someone else's undeited inflammatory propaganda and making or repointing a dozen redirects to it (which I've now listed on RfD) is not part of editing an encyclopaedia. I don't think either holocaust denial or raising awareness of massacres should be a crime, but if the user concerned doesn't get it and continues to disrupt, should they be banned like the similar user who blanked <a href="../../../k/u/r/Kurdistan.html" title="Kurdistan">Kurdistan</a>? --<a href="../../../c/e/d/User%7ECedders_7ad5.html" title="User:Cedders">Cedders</a> 23:30, 17 April 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Both sides produce inflammatory propaganda, but if you call <i>this</i> inflammatory propaganda you haven't seen much. Personally I think we should not have the debate here, or on <a href="../../../a/r/m/Talk%7EArmenian_Genocide_0a21.html" title="Talk:Armenian Genocide">Talk:Armenian Genocide</a>, but leave it to historians and record what they report. Loaded terms like "genocide" are inherently POV, and in particular terms such as "denial", implying that one side is "wrong", should be avoided. But I must confess (blush) I had overlooked the fact that that third bullet gives access to this "inflammatory propaganda", and therefore I have changed my vote to "delete". I think, however, that it is not given sufficient prominence or representation. For the record, the remaining defendant in the trial is a journalist, not a historian, and the charge, based on his criticism of a court decision, is insulting the Turkish judiciary and attempting to illegally influence a court case (where the latter carries a much higher penalty than the former). That is not to deny that such cases have a chilling effect, but I think the reason behind bringing charges has nothing to do with Armenian issues, but is really aimed at undermining the EU policy of the Turkish government. <a href="../../../l/a/m/User%7ELambiam_e5bb.html" title="User:Lambiam">Lambiam</a><a href="../../../l/a/m/User_talk%7ELambiam_012a.html" title="User talk:Lambiam"><small><sup>Talk</sup></small></a> 17:26, 18 April 2006 (UTC)</li>
