<p>Non-notable individual/vanity. A cantor who also does art, and once had a tiny article printed about him in a minor weekly. Oh, and like a million other people, he met the Pope. Someone close to Kepecs has kept trying to insert this, and related material, into all sorts of articles. The Google test gets 4 hits for Lawrence Eliezer Kepecs, all from Wikipedia mirrors, and 4 more hits for "Lawrence Kepecs", 2 discussion board entries he apparently made in 1998, and two others apparently not related to his individual. <a href="../../../j/a/y/User%7EJayjg_c88f.html" title="User:Jayjg">Jayjg</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/a/y/User_talk%7EJayjg_2104.html" title="User talk:Jayjg"><font color="DarkGreen">(talk)</font></a></sup> 20:37, 4 May 2005 (UTC)</p>

I'm not opposed to the inclusion of his name in the caption of the pic of him giving the pope a mezuza, eventhough I think the gesture is unspeakably bizarre, but just because he's named in the Wikipedia doesn't mean he deserves a (badly written, incredibly POV) biographical article. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 09:06, May 5, 2005 (UTC)

I'm of the opinion now that perhaps this article can be fixed to be less of a vanity piece, although I'm not entirely convinced yet that the good Cantor is sufficiently noteworthy to warrant an article on him. That said, however, I don't think I need to be entirely convinced. OTOH, I'm still incredibly annoyed by the sock-puppet attack, and think Victor/Merlin/Merlinzor/etc.etc.etc. could use a good <a href="../../../s/p/a/Spanking.html" title="Spanking">spanking</a> out behind the woodshed. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 02:43, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Do not concur. Kepecs is a well known personality in the cantorial world. The fact that he was chosen by the Vatican to be one of thirteen cantors to sing for the Pope and presented him with one of his art works is an important point. This was the last group to meet Pope John Paul II (urged by the Pope himself I might add.) and made history. Kepecs' art I am told (currently doing research on it) has sold for as much as $65,000, and I believe he's got an album or two out on liturgical music. He is very interesting. Keep it for future reference.-User:Merlinzor May 5, 2005</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. Kepecs is a noteworthy Reverend Cantor - and the title is correct. He has an exceptional tenor voice quality, similar to Luciano Pavarotti. I heard him at a concert in Canada, and he wowed the audience with his spectacular delivery, and mastery of Cantorial music and italian opera. In my opinion, nobody even came close to his delivery. Mark my word. You will see great things from this guy, give the researchers a chance. The fact that Kepecs sang for and gave the Pope a mezuzah has appeared in numerous newspapers, including The Jewish Star, The Nassau Herald, and I think the front page of the New York Times had an article on it as it was happening in Rome in January. His concert in Rome was televised throughout Italy. If you wish I will dig up what I can find.-User:Rabbis May 5, 2005</li>

CANTOR KEPECS TRIP TO THE VATICAN TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER CANTORS AND RABBIS WAS THE FIRST ONE EVER IN HISTORY AND THE FIRST EVER GIVEN AUDIENCE BY A SITTING POPE TO JEWISH CLERGY.

<li>There is nothing whatsoever in this disjointed rambling diatribe that makes a coherent argument for the enclopedÃ¦icity of the article in question. The fact that the "Keep" votes all seem to be User:Merlinzor or sockpuppets is rather revealing that this entire thing is the result of possibly only a single user's unnoteworthy and eccentric POV. The pope and/or the pope's office distribute tens, even hundreds of letters every single day. Getting a letter from the pope does not make a person worthy of an article in wikipedia. The claim that this is the first ever audience given by a sitting pope to members of the "Jewish clergy" is patently false. That notwithstanding, even if it was a historical moment (which remains to be seen) and a lot was accomplished (which is doubtful) and that the event will be remembered forever (is that a prophecy?), that information is relevant to Jewish-Christian relations, and does <i>not</i> make any difference with respect to whether or not this guy is notable, nor whether or not this article is encyclopedia material or ever can be. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 15:42, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>You are supposed to be a source of information, not present biased viewpoints, as I have read some of your various unintelligent comments regarding Rabbis and Cantors. You should not render decisions of elimination based on assumptions as to who is commenting, or if the article doesn't "do it for you" and my rendering is that it is apparent to me that you don't know Rabbis nor Cantors. I am an ordained Rabbi. Wikipedia is free for all to share the information. I am a user of Wikipedia, as I've done much research with Wkipedia, and I find this article about Kepecs beneficial, as do my colleages. I care what happens to this article. The event with the Pope was an event that happened whether you like it or not and an important one at that. It wasn't just "members of the Jewish clergy". It was 141 Jewish clergymen - unprecedented in history, and the Pope's final meeting. What does it hurt you to keep the article? Why should it bother you sooo much? There are a lot of people who DO care about keeping it. -User:Rabbis May 5, 2005</li>

<li>Wikipedia's purpose is spelled out, as are its guidelines, elsewhere. This article violates a number of them, as do your comments against wikipedians. In cyberspace, your claim that you are a rabbi is unverifiable, but we are constrained as wikipedians to assume good faith. That constraint, however, has limitations. You are, it is true, free to share information. You are not, however, free to turn the Wikipedia project into a platform for promoting your personal views. I'm sure I care about what happens to this article just as much if not more than you do, so that statement on your part is something of a non-sequitur. As for the number of people who <i>do</i> care about keeping this article, the numbers just don't show it. Thus far, the only people who have registered that view, if they're really not all different personalities of the same anonymous user who's been trying to screw this "information" into every conceivably remotely related article, seem to be sharing a single computer. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 20:57, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>An emphatic<b>Keep</b>. My name is Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck, President of the Jewish Ministers Cantors Association of America. I led the delegation of cantors - one of the 13 cantors who were selected to sing for the Pope on 1/18/05. It was a monumental event unprecedented in Judeo-Christian history. Rev. Cantor Kepecs gave the Pope a mezuzah that he created for that purpose - to show that the Jewish people really want to have reconciliation with the Catholic church. The Pope very much wanted this meeting. Being the President of the oldest Cantorial organization (dating back to 1896)who had such illustrious members as Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt, Ben Zion Kapov Kagan, Chaskele Ritter, David Koussevitzky, Moshe Koussevitzky, Berele Chagy, Israel Alter, Mordechai Hershman, Adolf Katchko, Leib Glantz, Alter Yechiel Karniol, Zavel Kwartin, Samuel Malavsky, Shlomo Mendel, Yeshia Meissels Pierre Pinchik and many others, I feel in my expertise that Cantor Lawrence Eliezer Kepecs is more than a noteworthy cantor, he is an exceptional Cantor and artist, who deserves a page in your encyclopedia. I can only assume that those who wish to remove mention of Cantor Kepecs in this forum are either ill-informed or have other agendas which are not in keeping with the historical and informative nature of this forum.-Rev. Cantor Victor I Beck, President JMCA May 5, 2005</li>

My entire life and the lives of those with whom I associate, are dedicated to attending to the needs and aspirations of both the Jewish community, and the world community at large. Endemic to this work, is a constant striving to uphold the fundemental building blocks of a civilized society. In the Pirkei Avot (Ethics of the fathers) there is a statement that the world rests on 3 things, on study of Torah, prayer worship, and on acts of loving kindness. Endemic to those 3 principals is a constant striving for truth and accuracy. I invite you to join me in this endeavor. -Rev. Cantor Victor I. Beck, President JMCA 5/5/05</li>

<li>I would like to decreasingly humbly point out that "Reverend Cantor Beck"'s "contribution" here, quite clearly spells out that this article is, as has been pointed out previously, <i>nothing more than self-promotion</i>. I also think it's interesting that the Jewish Ministers Cantors Association of America website is hmmm...<a href="../../../m/i/s/Missing_in_action.html" title="Missing in action">Missing in action</a>. A google search for "Reverend Cantor" turns up exactly 5 distinct hits, only 4 of which are actually using "reverend cantor" as a title, two of which clarify that this is a title of sorts bestowed by the Cantorial Associaton of America, not the JMCAA. Another of them is a somewhat sideways joke about a blogger's grandfather, and the other is, Lo and behold, an almost verbatim copycat of the stuff that this anonymous editor keeps trying to inject into wikipedia. Wanna see? Check it out here: <a href="http://search.localcolorart.com/search/encyclopedia/Pope_John_Paul_II/" class="external autonumber" title="http://search.localcolorart.com/search/encyclopedia/Pope_John_Paul_II/" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>. How do you spell "AGENDA"? So then, I decided, why don't I go see what I can find on Victor I. Beck. So, I looked him up, and guess what I found? 13 relevant google hits. About half of which identify him as "Victor I. Beck" and the rest as "Cantor Victor I. Beck". That's right, to my utter lack of shock, there were no "Reverend Cantor Victor I. Beck"s. So then I said me, "How about just plain Victor Beck?" So I did that search. Predictably, this turned up a significantly greater number of hits. I paged through them, and found out that there are a number of people with the names Victor and Beck in various combinations with other names, but still no Reverend Cantors Beck. So, now I'm thinking perhaps what I should do is email Cantor Victor I. Beck, at cantorbeck@cantorbeck.com, an email address I feel comfortable publishing, since it appears here: <a href="http://www.tucsonfestival.org/EventPAGES/CulturalDiversityAnEndangeredSpecies.html" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.tucsonfestival.org/EventPAGES/CulturalDiversityAnEndangeredSpecies.html" rel="nofollow">[2]</a>...and ask him whether or not he's had free time lately to write disrespectful notes on Wikipedia talkpages. Now that I know he's a part-time resident of Phoenix, perhaps what I should do is head over to whitepages.com and see whether or not I can get his phone number. That might be quicker... <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:14, May 5, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>In the interest of developing a community consensus on this issue, the community should take any <i><b>evidence</b></i> presented by those outside the community under consideration but is not obligated to be swayed by <i>opinions</i> from outside the community. Very little evidence of Kepecs' notability has been forthcoming. I had voted to keep the article because I do not consider notability to be a very useful criterion by itself. Other criteria such as NPOV and self-promotion seem to be adequate for this case. Although I welcome any actual evidence, at this point it seems I have no choice but to change my vote. I vote to <b>merge</b> any useful information into other articles. The interesting life of a cantor can be detailed in a more generic article. If the presentation of the mazuzah is significant, other places can be found for that bit of information as well. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:49, 10 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I think everything I can say has been said already re: Cantor Kepecs. I've tried editing some of the articles myself at Wikipedia (where anyone can edit). However I have found that it is difficult to keep the edits in, as others who may know less about certain matters, take them out. I've always been from the school that an article is written by someone, and can be edited by others for punctuation, phrasing, and sentence structure, but what you are looking to do is completely remove others works, who have spent their time researching people, events, concepts, intellectual ideas etc. Morally, this is wrong. On another note, I feel that Wikipedia is an excellent source of information to the general public, and all of you have done quite well, but just because you have amassed a lot of knowledge editing in certain areas, nobody knows it all. Sometimes an expert in a field may "pop in" to see what you are doing. He may want to make corrections, or add to a listing, based on his expertise - so let him. -Victor 5/6/05</li>

<li>Hazzan Beck, the problem is that Wikipedia is not vandalism-proof; rather, it is vandalism-<b>resistant</b>, and as a result of this, we can be quite ardent in demanding proof of an article's validity. <i>"If this Hazzan Kepecs is so notable"</i>, we say to ourselves, <i>"should not his name have been mentioned by more people in more places? Could this not be a vanity article, such as children and the mad make to promote themselves, or a friendship article, like the well-meaning make to promote their friends?"</i> We look at the claims made in an article, and if they do not seem to match what we find in other places, we become wary of fraud - because fraud is sadly not absent from Wikipedia. Some do it out of malicious glee in their vandalism, others do it to further their argument that Wikipedia is inherently valueless... please do not assume that we have agendas other than trying to make this the best resource that we can. All are welcome to contribute <i><b>if they do so properly</b></i>. If someone contributes to one of these debates, and he has never contributed to Wikipedia before, then once more we become suspicious. <i>"Could this not,"</i>, we say to ourselves, <i>"be merely a friend or relative of the article's creator, arguing on his behalf not out of any inherent value in the article, but merely out of personal loyalty or friendship?"</i> After all, a ten-year-old can create an article claiming that he is the strongest and fastest boy in all his school and that he will surely be President one day, and when we recommend that his article be deleted immediately as nonsense, his six best friends can instantly protest that he IS the strongest and fastest boy in all his school, and that he WILL surely be President one day, and everyone deserves the chance to know about him. They can even claim that they do not know him, but that his article has convinced them. If such a statement in a deletion debate is someone's first and only contribution to Wikipedia, then we consider it as being of lesser merit than the same statement from someone who has participated for months. Even if someone signs their statements, we cannot know that they are who they claim to be - but if they register an account (and why not; it's free, after all), then their every contribution to Wikipedia is recorded and made available to all, and we can then judge their worth. If someone makes an account, and uses it to insert the word "poop" into the name of every member of Congress, then we know to discount their statements. If someone makes an account, and uses it to create many exquisitely detailed but false articles about wars that never happened between nations that never existed, then we know to discount their statements. If someone makes an account, and uses it to say that such-and-such an article must not be deleted - and does nothing else - then how are we to know whether they are trustworthy? The answer is that we cannot. I can claim to be a Jew, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Catholic, a man, a woman, an exceptionally bright child, a chemist, a rabbi, a surgeon, a pilot, a soldier, a tailor, a chef, a lawyer, black, white, or jaundiced from gradual liver failure, but these cannot be proven and are not relevant to the trustworthiness of my statements in these debates. What is relevant is that I am the Wikipedia contributor with the username DragonflySixtyseven, and every one of my contributions can be examined for value.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that I have made my point clear to Hazzan Beck and to the others who support this article but have not yet proven themselves.</p>

<p>My dear friends, one of my colleagues and Rabbinic students (I teach certain topics) made mention to me a few days ago that a listing about me appeared in Wikipedia. I was overwhelmed and honored to learn of this. Today, I was curious to see this listing first hand. I read everything that was discussed about me and was amazed and flattered by many of your remarks. Ladies and Gentlemen, I am just a simple Reverend Cantor - one who serves G-d, and the Jewish community. I try to do good, to sanctify G-d's name, such as when those who are less fortunate than I need help, I would help them in whatever ways I could. I feel this is a glorification of G-d's holy name. The trip to greet the Pope, I felt was also a sanctification of G-d. The fact that we were given the opportunity to offer blessings to him because of all the good that he did for the Jews, from the Holocaust era until his death, was so very important. Pope John Paul II was a righteous gentile, always looking to do good. He was an exceptional man of peace. We all wanted to recognize this. We were told by the Vatican, that we were the only "People" to ever say "thank you" to a Pope. I am an average person. I feel my voice is average, my art is average, my grades in school were only a "B". My life has not really been all that interesting. You all have done such a superb job on your works at Wikipedia, and you all are to be commended for your research efforts, "Yasher Koach." You did such great research on me, that you even discovered my old screenname that I used to use. My breath is taken away. I'm so flattered that I have such a following, I never knew it. I feel, however, that perhaps I am unworthy of the great honor bestowed upon me of having a page in your excellent encyclopedia. I am really not a "great" person. Perhaps my page should be reserved for someone of much greater worth than I, for someone of major importance. I applaud all your efforts. Thank you for thinking of me. May you all be successful in your quest for truth. May G-d bless you all. -Lawrence Eliezer Kepecs 9 May, 2005 12:55</p>

<li>To me this sounds like a communist trial - guilty until proven innocent. Does it not? -Victor 5/10/05</li>

<li>No, it doesn't. Incidentally, I think what you mean is "a <a href="../../../d/r/u/Drumhead.html" title="Drumhead">drumhead</a>", or perhaps even "a <a href="../../../c/a/r/Cardassian.html" title="Cardassian">Cardassian</a> trial", not a "communist trial"...your use of that phrase, followed by the "guilty until proven innocent" demonstrates ignorance and a political POV, and your oblique characterization of those who disagree with you as "communists" does nothing to improve your credibility. ... Nor, might I add, does the fact that the only two people (not "a couple of you") who have used the word "emminence" (sic) are you and another <a href="../../../a/n/o/Anonymous_coward.html" title="Anonymous coward">anonymous coward</a>, "Stephen May"...neither of whom appear to be able to spell particularly well. Interesting, however, that you should both happen misspell the same word exactly the same way. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 22:32, May 10, 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>How do you want me to fix it? Tell me how, and I will. It's a shame to lose the article.-Victor 5/10/05</p>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest first removing all unverifiable claims and opinion (aggrandizement, as it has been called here). Strive for accuracy and objectivity. Add references (books, news articles, etc) as much as possible. If that can be done, then most of the above discussion of notability is moot. The question of notability is up in the air and needs to be satisfied by matters of fact rather than testimonials. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 00:22, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<p>All right. Specifically which facts in the article are in question. Is it the Pope visit? There is a newspaper article in the discussion section. I'm sure there are more, if we really look. The wall that was built appeared in the Newtown Bee (in discussion section)- the arts newspaper that goes all around the world to every gallery and auction house. Very prestigious, and very difficult to get into. There's The Jewish Press article on him. We can call Yeshiva University to find out if he actually got degrees there. That he sings internationally, that has been proven from the Rome article. There may be more articles, I would have to research it. Tell me what else you need me to find. I'll do what I can. -Victor 5/10/05</p>

<li>Maybe all your friends can help you.

<li>That's not nice. I'm trying to be constructive here. There are articles that appear in hard copy which are not accessible through the internet. Example Newtown Bee.-Victor.</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b>. For those attempting to distill a consensus from all this blabbering, observe that, although an annoyance on this page, sockpuppetry should not reflect on the status of the article itself. I'm inclined to think that the Cantor does merit an article, at least as much as any minor James Bond character or American Idol finalist. It should be edited to remove matters of opinion and exaggeration and monitored for recurrences of vanity. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 20:13, 11 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>FWIW, I agree with you. Unfortunately, that would leave the article with less than 1/4 of its current content. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 21:16, May 11, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Further comment</b>. I've been trying to clean up the article and I think I just have to give up on this. Kepecs seems to be a promising tenor in the Cantorial community and was priveleged to have been invited with other cantors to a papal audience. His major artwork - a decorative fundraising wall at a Cantorial seminary - is made of carved and painted foam. The multiple newspaper clippings, improperly scanned and uploaded, establish nothing beyond his existence as a performer. I don't know if the article <i>can</i> be cleaned up enough to be neutral. <a href="../../../d/y/s/User%7EDystopos_300d.html" title="User:Dystopos">Dystopos</a> 21:18, 11 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: If the vote for this rambling VfD is ever tallied and the article deleted, I would like to request that, if the sock-puppet master who has fought so hard for its retention wants, that s/he be permitted to have the article as it stands prior to deletion. If s/he can turn it into a worthwhile article in the next couple months, as well as learn a bit more about the Wikipedia, like such fundamental concepts for example as <a href="../../../c/r/e/Wikipedia%7ECreate_an_account_8bc3.html" title="Wikipedia:Create an account">how to create an account</a>, then perhaps this kind of nonsense can be avoided, at least with this editor, in the future. <a href="../../../t/s/h/User%7ETShilo12_6761.html" title="User:TShilo12">Tomer</a> <sup><a href="../../../t/s/h/User_talk%7ETShilo12_9faf.html" title="User talk:TShilo12"><font color="#129DBC">TALK</font></a></sup> 02:27, May 13, 2005 (UTC)</li>
