<li>Of course. I never said the topic of the article was not notable; I'm putting it up for deletion because it's a <i>content fork</i>.

<li>We don't delete articles on subjects where there are copious sources discussing the subject. Nor do we delete duplicate articles. Please read our <a href="../../../d/e/l/Wikipedia%7EDeletion_policy_2a0d.html" title="Wikipedia:Deletion policy">Wikipedia:Deletion policy</a>, especially the section on problems that do not require deletion.

Moreover, I just pointed to sources that say that it isn't just the same topic by another name. That editors have edited it into a duplicate of an article on a different topic is a byproduct of their <i>not working from sources</i>. Always cite <i>and use</i> sources. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 16:27, 31 July 2006 (UTC)

<li>While all your sources use the term "constitutional republic", <b>none of them explains the difference between a <i>constitutional</i> republic and a plain republic</b>. They seem more interested in differentiating a <i>democracy</i> from a republic.</li>
<li>Furthermore, I challenge your assertion that the article can ever be expanded in any meaningful way. The only thing that can really be said about a constitutional republic is that it is a republic governed according to a constitution. Then the article would have to launch into a discussion of what "republic" means, which would make it a content fork of <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>. If you believe that it is possible to write even a stub about constitutional republics without duplicating material from the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> article, I invite you to <i>do it yourself</i> as a demonstration. -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 21:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)

<li>Variant phrases, such as "constitutional republic" or "republican democracy", do not necessarily imply the need for separate articles. You mention <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html#What_content.2FPOV_forking_is_not" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">Wikipedia:Content forking#What_content.2FPOV_forking_is_not</a>, but that specifically goes on to say the duplicate articles, while not POV forks, are to be merged. And this article is <i>not</i> a proper "main/subarticle" setup (see my Delete comment below). - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, as POV fork after checking for content present here and not present at <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>, and preserve any information accrued during its sojourn under separate editors.

<li>Unless the Constitution Society, the U.S. Constitution Online, the National Center for Constitutional Studies (all three of whose various articles on constitutional republics I hyperlinked to above), <a href="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2128.html" class="external text" title="https://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/fields/2128.html" rel="nofollow">the CIA</a>, <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/kids/6th12th/adventure/peru/perufacts.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.fbi.gov/kids/6th12th/adventure/peru/perufacts.htm" rel="nofollow">the FBI</a>, and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/liho/s09.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.nps.gov/liho/s09.htm" rel="nofollow">Abraham Lincoln</a> are all "POV warriors", the concept of a constitutional republic is <i>not</i> a POV fork of the concept of a republic.

<ul>
<li>The CIA and the FBI classify countries as various kinds of republics, but <b>neither of them explains what a "constitutional republic" actually means</b>. Lincoln used the term "constitutional republic", but, again, <b>did not explain how it differs from a simple "republic"</b>. Your links prove that the term "constitutional republic" is in use. They do not prove that it is used differently than "republic". -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 21:28, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> as creation of banned (not blocked) user. <a href="../../../r/j/i/User%7ERJII_a6a7.html" title="User:RJII">User:RJII</a> was <b>banned</b> as a group account; so any content created by that account should be considered vandalism. — <a href="../../../a/r/t/User%7EArthur_Rubin_34a7.html" title="User:Arthur Rubin">Arthur Rubin</a> | <a href="../../../a/r/t/User_talk%7EArthur_Rubin_1231.html" title="User talk:Arthur Rubin">(talk)</a> 22:45, 31 July 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And deletion is not the sole way to remedy vandalism, per <a href="../../../v/a/n/Wikipedia%7EVandalism_70f0.html" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>. The way to fix this article is to cite and to work from sources. Reading <a href="../../../r/e/q/Wikipedia%7ERequests_for_arbitration_RJII_v._Firebug_e8fe.html" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/RJII v. Firebug">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/RJII v. Firebug</a>, the problems relevant here are lack of cited sources and overemphasis of minority viewpoints. The notion of a constitutional republic is <i>far</i> from being a minority viewpoint, given that one can find reams of mainstream sources (only a very few of which I hyperlinked to above) explaining what one is, employing the concept, and explaining that it is not the same as a plain republic. The article didn't cite sources from the start, and so editors worked from memory and inference from the existing text and came up with a clone of another, different, concept. The solution to that is to <a href="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" class="external text" title="http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2006-July/050766.html" rel="nofollow">insist upon sources</a>. There are 12 sources hyperlinked to above, using which any non-neutral or unverifiable content in the article can be addressed. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 11:46, 1 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Again, the only difference between a constitutional republic and a plain "republic" is that a constitutional republic uses a constitution. How is it possible to write an entire article to explain that? -- <a href="../../../n/i/k/User%7ENikodemos_e75d.html" title="User:Nikodemos">Nikodemos</a> 21:23, 1 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Nikodemos is wrong to say that it is the identical definition to a liberal democracy. The United Kingdom is a liberal democracy but it is not a republic. It is a monarchy. A democratic monarchy or <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>. <a href="../../../b/i/l/User%7EBillyBoom_942e.html" title="User:BillyBoom">BillyBoom</a> 19:18, 2 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep and expand</b> There is a substantial difference between a <i>republic</i> and a <i>democracy</i>. And yes, this extends to their sub-groups - there is a difference between a "liberal democracy" and any kind of "republic". This article should be expanded to be on par with <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_monarchy.html" title="Constitutional monarchy">Constitutional monarchy</a> another "split" from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a>. Further, I do not see any sources in either article supporting the AfD's contention that they are the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>An example of a difference would be noted early on in the liberal democracy article - liberal democracies are pluralistic and consider rights to be "created" by the government. Constitutional republics (and this isn't in its article yet only b/c it hasn't been expanded properly) <i>avoid</i> pluralism - the tyranny of the majority - and consider rights to be <i>inherent</i> to the person, regardless of what the law may say. --<a href="../../../t/i/m/User%7ETim4christ17_a2d0.html" title="User:Tim4christ17">Tim4christ17</a> 19:34, 2 August 2006 (UTC)

<dd>
<ul>
<li>This would seem to be in disagreement with a number of existing Wikipedia articles. <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">Liberal democracy</a> itself says "<i>There is general agreement that the states of the European Union, Japan, the United States, Canada... are liberal democracies</i>". The Freedom House survey methodology states "<i>all Free countries qualify as both electoral and liberal democracies</i>", and my assumption is that political science textbooks would generally classify the United States (and other potential "constitutional republics") as liberal democracies. Therefore I can't see how this article could successfully be expanded in the direction you suggest. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - while Nikodemos may not be fully correct that this is fully equivalent to "liberal democracy", certainly it would appear to be subset of it. In any case, the point would seem to be that a "constitutional republic" whatever it might be, is certainly a subset of "republic", and needs to be covered there in the first instance. Currently it isn't, which lends credence to the "fork" or "duplicate article" arguments. If that coverage at some point justifies breaking it out in "main article/sub article" format, it can be done then, but right now that certainly isn't the case. I've made further points in response to the "Uncle G" and "Tim4christ17" comments above. Finally, I note the problematic <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_democracy.html" title="Republican democracy">republican democracy</a> article, which covers similar ground.- <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 18:07, 6 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Later Update: I further note the <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a> article, which again covers similar territory. These all seem to be attempts to exclusively define variant (or overlapping) ground. <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">Constitutional democracy</a> would seem to be inclusive of <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_republic.html" title="Constitutional republic">constitutional republic</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republican_democracy.html" title="Republican democracy">republican democracy</a>. I now believe the best thing would be to upgrade <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a>, making the other two terms redirects. It would link from and refer to <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> (and <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a>) as necessary. If the three terms are preferentially used in various cases for rhetorical or ideological effect, then this information can be included. Note that <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a> currently has flaws of its own, which include contrasting (and implicitly opposing) to <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parliamentary_democracy.html" title="Parliamentary democracy">Parliamentary democracy</a> in the intro, yet including countries (Germany, Greece, etc.) from that article its own list, but this can be fixed. Since there appears to be little or no content in <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_republic.html" title="Constitutional republic">constitutional republic</a> that can't be derived from <a href="../../../l/i/b/Liberal_democracy.html" title="Liberal democracy">liberal democracy</a> or <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> this is still effectively a Delete vote, but if necessary the closing admin can consider it "Merge and Redirect to <a href="../../../c/o/n/Constitutional_democracy.html" title="Constitutional democracy">constitutional democracy</a>. - <a href="../../../o/b/e/User%7EOberst_6a86.html" title="User:Oberst">David Oberst</a> 23:59, 8 August 2006 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep and expand - I don't see a constitution listed as a characteristic of a <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a></b>, therefore not every republic is a constitutional republic. Its the same distintion as liberal democracy and representative democracy being subtypes of democracy. <b>Constitutional republics are a subtype of republic</b> (which appear to come in non-constitutional and constitutional flavors as listed in the <a href="../../../r/e/p/Republic.html" title="Republic">republic</a> article). This article delves into some details on constitution and why its used as an addition to the 'standard' republic in order limit government power.</li>
