<p>I suggested that this should get pitched along with The Dissonants, but it didn't; so I'm renominating it now. Non-notable band; gets just 46 Google hits and nothing on allmusic. <strike>Nomination withdrawn.</strike> Withdrawal withdrawn, because the sockpuppet-to-legitimate-vote ratio has gotten too high for comfort. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 19:44, 20 August 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Unfortunately, I've heard of this band. They released an album last year, and the radio station that I work at received a promo copy (some idiot even called my show to request it). As much as I'd like to see this tossed for personal reasons, I'm going to have to vote <b>keep</b>. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:37, 19 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>CJ, I'm not sure that your reasons to keep are reasons that are acnowledged in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that your thinking is that since you've heard of them and they've released an album, then they are notable enough to be kept, which isn't the case. What's under contention as far as I can tell is whether they're non-notable or if having a member who was part of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dears_87df.html" title="The Dears">The Dears</a> is enough to merit an encyclopedia article. --<a href="../../../b/l/a/Blackcap.html" title="Blackcap">Blackcap</a> | <a href="../../../b/l/a/User_talk%7EBlackcap_5870.html" title="User talk:Blackcap">talk</a> 19:05, August 24, 2005 (UTC)

<li>The band is fairly well-known (or perhaps notorious) at the campus radio station where I work. In casting my vote, I extrapolated that other campus/community stations in Canada are probably familiar with this band as well. In any case, I'm reluctant to delete a band that has released a full-length CD recording, and has distributed it to stations outside of their hometown (the worthlessness of their music notwithstanding). The WP:Music guidelines only provide criteria for bands to be judged as <b>indisputably</b> notable; they don't cover all of the grey areas. <a href="../../../c/j/c/User%7ECJCurrie_7707.html" title="User:CJCurrie">CJCurrie</a> 19:08, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Important band on the Montreal indie scene.

<li>Okay, <strike>I withdraw the nomination.</strike> I overlooked the <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Dears_87df.html" title="The Dears">Dears</a> connection.

<li>When did The Dears become <i>extremely</i> notable? The Dears are notable, but not extremely so, therefore every single band each member has ever been with or will be with is not necessarily notable, especially if they don't meet any of the other guidelines. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheMidnighters_8ade.html" title="User:TheMidnighters">TheMidnighters</a> 09:41, 21 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Can you actually quantify the line where one can realistically mark a clear division between "notable" and "extremely notable"? I sure as hell can't...to me, the line is contextually relative to the genre in which the band operates, rather than an objective scale that ranks all bands by the same measure. They're no match for the notability of <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_Beatles_3737.html" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>, granted, but within the specific context of <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indie_rock.html" title="Indie rock">indie rock</a> in the <a href="../../../2/0/0/2000s.html" title="2000s">2000s</a>, The Dears can certainly be described as "extremely notable". <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:04, 22 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a band has widespread popularity like the Beatles, then a side project (like George Harrison's solo work) is worthy of an encyclopedia. If a band <b>doesn't</b> have that, (as in the case of the Dears, having put out a few albums but, as far as I can tell, not know very much outside of Quebec), then while they themselves may warrant an encyclopedia article, their side projects may not. Anyway, in the realm of, say, Star Trek fandom, obscure bits on machinery might be considered notable, but would never make its way into an encyclopedia because it's too irrelevant to most people. This seems like music's version of that. It just doesn't hit enough points in <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> to warrant staying. From going on their web site, they don't even seem to have a record label, saying only that you can get their music at <a href="http://www.lesubalterne.com/" class="external text" title="http://www.lesubalterne.com/" rel="nofollow">Le Subalterne</a>, a local record shop. They're a band who has one semi-notable person and nothing else.

<p>The Dears are considered "extremely notable" across Canada having had a near-cult following on many college campuses for years. There is no better guage for "notable" in indie-rock's transient and poor-student-driven world. Launie Anderssohn are genre groundbreakers misunderstood by the dull, and celebrated by intelligent witty townsfolk and hard to thrill musicians alike. As in, they have their own sound and message and media package. As in, they are influential. The fact that they play at smaller clubs should not make them less noteworthy for the history of musical progress. Wikipedia is a boon to music writers everywhere, let's keep it that way. The article should be expanded to contextualize them more distinctly """keep""" --24.80.81.229 06:50, 26 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
