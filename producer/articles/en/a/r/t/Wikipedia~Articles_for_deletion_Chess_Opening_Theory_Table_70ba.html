<li><b>Keep</b>, this is a standard way of showing moves in chess -- much like algebraic notation. This is certainly not original research. This type of table is common in all chess opening books. An example of this type of table in a copyrighted book is available on page 6 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0812930843/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-6162253-0536652#reader-page" class="external text" title="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0812930843/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-6162253-0536652#reader-page" rel="nofollow">Modern Chess Openings (MCO)</a> (viewable online) for the King's Gambit -- this should answer <a href="../../../m/a/c/User%7EMacGyverMagic_2726.html" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm's</a> request for a source. Furthermore, I'd like to link to this wikipedia entry to explain the notation I/we intend to use in <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Opening_Theory" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chess/Opening_Theory">Opening Theory</a>. While the description of the table notation is not complete, this is how opening lines are decomposed and explained in a small space. I would be happy to consider a different title though, as I have always heard these table referred to simply as "Theory Tables" -- which is a bit generic without the addition of "Chess Opening." Finally, I have added additional content to the article that I think provides a clearer idea of the concept. More to follow! <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a>

<li>COMMENT - My issue with this is that sure, tables have been used for chess opening theory... but tables have been used for everything. From car pollution, to long-distance rates, to lawnmower efficiency. There is nothing to indicate that a "Chess Opening Theory Table" is anything more than one of the many tables created in the world for an almost infinite amount of subjects; and, as such, is not deserving of its own article. (Please note that there is no consistent methodology for writing such tables, and the one's in the article and the references are all formatted differently.) <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 18:07, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Actually there is a consistent methodology -- the way that moves are presented and lines are expanded off of previous lines. This is quite similar to describing chess moves in other standard ways that are presented in articles on wikipedia -- like the <a href="../../../p/g/n/Pgn.html" title="Pgn">PGN standard</a> and the like. Pretty much every chess opening book dedicates a page or two to explaining this type of table, and for most part, the approach is the same. In fact, both the Nunn book and the MCO book use the same format. Any reader not familiar with the format will require an explanation and an article would be appropriate. In addition, there is some very interesting history on how these tables have evolved over the centuries. These facts and the "when in doubt, don't delete" philosophy should justify this article. For gosh sake, we have an articles on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_of_contents.html" title="Table of contents">tables of contents</a>, and on <a href="../../../t/a/b/Table_%28information%29.html" title="Table (information)">tables</a> themselves -- will you delete them too? They are certainly no more wiki-worthy... <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 18:32, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If any of this was true, there would be at least one hit for "Chess theory table" or "Chess opening theory table" on google. Unfortunately, aside from the one coincidental hit listed above, there are zero hits. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 19:37, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Explain to me why the number of hits on a search engine is a criterion for deletion? I am perfectly willing to entertain a name change to the article, but explaining how this notation works is directly analogous to, say, explaining how the notation in the <a href="../../../p/e/r/Periodic_table.html" title="Periodic table">periodic table</a> represents elements. The fact that it is a table is really not important. What is important is explaining to the lay-reader how these diagrams represent chess opening theory -- and more importantly how these diagrams evolve. Diagrams like this have been used by Grandmasters for centuries. I think the demonstrable benefits outweigh the chance that we have a topic "not deserving" of an article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 23:19, 13 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>But that's just the thing: the periodic table IS important because it's a table. That particular way of laying out the elements, in that chart, completely changed the way we think about atoms, and even helped predict the properties of atoms that had not yet been discovered. Did putting Chess Opening Theory into a table do that for Chess Opening Theory? If you can make a compelling argument for it, I will gladly change my vote. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 14:47, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>These tables are the basis of how chess opening theory is communicated. No doubt the periodic table is of greater significance -- chess is, after all, just a game. But the principle is the same. For many players, these tables represent a standard way of laying out the lines of play, and when chess players move from being a beginner to being an amateur, they discover this type of depiction. That discovery changes the way they think about the opening. Often, they make the mistake of thinking they have to memorize these tables -- and then they figure out that no one, not even a GM could do that. This leads to the idea of a plan in the opening -- the real discovery. Each opening has a set of properties -- themes if you will -- that these tables can lead you to. So I say yes, these tables do the same thing for chess that the periodic table does for, the much more important topic, of science.
<ul>
<li>If it was so important, why wouldn't there be even one hit on google? This is a misrepresentation of fact. These are just tables, like any other, of no significance, importance, or effect on the game of chess. If they did have any importance, there would be google hits. And to answer your earlier question, google hits are considered a measure of notability on wikipedia - especially when it concerns a subject that is popular on the internet (read: chess). <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThemindset_22b6.html" title="User:Themindset">Themindset</a> 18:24, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My last comment on the google issue -- this question has been asked and answered above. These tables are all over the internet, and are referred to as they are in the article: Opening Theory Tables. Links, found using google, are provided above. Furthermore, the number of google hits is one way to establish notability -- there are others. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 18:49, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We'd gone really, really far in this discussion without attacking one another, or accusing anyone of intentionally trying to misrepresent the facts. I would ask that you do not turn this into ad hominem sniping. Clearly there are people who are passionately in favor of keeping this. Here are the questions that still linger for me:
<ul>
<li>Is there a reason why the "Chess Opening Theory Table" (COTT) should not simply be a part of "Chess Opening Theory" (COT)?
<ul>
<li>It would make the already long <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening.html" title="Chess opening">COT</a> page too long. It seems wise to me to separate the theory from the way the theory is recorded. I do not, however, have a problem with this. I suspect the COT article authors would however. It would be simpler to put the opening tables on the COT page and link to COTT page for interpretation instructions. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do COTTs have a developmental history to them, separate from COT?
<ul>
<li>Yes. Before COTTs, games were studied one by one. COTTs came along as COT matured. COTTs are now generated on the fly by huge chess databases that are updated weekly. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have COTTs changed the way we think about COT?
<ul>
<li>Yes. GMs use COTT and other tools to find and research novelties -- sometimes right before and even between games at tournaments. I'm not saying COTTs are the only tool, but it is how the huge amount of data in these chess databases are distilled for the human brain to work with. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I'm not laying these out as definitive criteria, I'm just personally curious about them. Again, obviously people are passionate about this; I'm just struggling to understand why, exactly. <a href="../../../j/d/o/User%7EJDoorjam_89c6.html" title="User:JDoorjam">JDoorjam</a> 22:34, 14 August 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>My passion (scary as it may be) is that I would love for there to be a wiki version of the opening books (like Nunn's book). This would allow kibitzing to go on for each point in the opening tree. Some sites exist out there to do this for games (like <a href="http://www.chessgames.com" class="external text" title="http://www.chessgames.com" rel="nofollow">chessgames</a>), but none allow this for the opening. <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess/Opening_Theory" class="extiw" title="wikibooks:Chess/Opening_Theory">Chess Opening Theory</a> would allow this, on an open platform, but it also needs to provide a description of the format -- which is more appropriately put on wikipedia. If this forum decides it is not "notable," I guess I'll just move it there. I wish someone would explain the passion people have for deleting what seems to be a reasonable article. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 22:59, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename</b>. The subject is encylopedic, and the thing described really exists and is a common convention, as others have noted above.

In summary, <b>Chess</b>: specifying the game, <b>Opening</b>: specifying the area of interest, <b>Theory</b>: what is being presented, and <b>Table</b>: because of the unique format that the article is, after all, describing. <a href="../../../t/h/r/User%7EThreeE_1e10.html" title="User:ThreeE">ThreeE</a> 12:25, 16 August 2005 (UTC)

<li>At the very least, if you want "Chess Opening Theory Table", the last three words should be uncapitalized, hence <a href="../../../c/h/e/Chess_opening_theory_table.html" title="Chess opening theory table">Chess opening theory table</a>. <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 12:28, 16 August 2005 (UTC)
