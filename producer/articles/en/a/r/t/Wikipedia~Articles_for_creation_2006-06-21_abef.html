On August 15, 2001, a user of Newgrounds.com called StrawberryClock submitted a horrible movie called "B" to the portal. Other users took pity on StrawberryClock, so they named themselves after a fruit clock. The folowers of StrawberryClock call themselves the Clock Crew. Every August 15, the Clock Crew celebrate that day as Clock Day.</p>

Titled for their vast riches, Luxocrats possess a net worth exceeding $100 million, often obtained from managing hedge funds. Luxocrats tend to be very private and in their mid 30âs, though some more public figures could include Jim Cramer, host of CNBCâs Mad Money. These fabulously wealthy individuals purchase islands on which to live, and have fabulously wealthy taste. One whom is rich enough to bump into a Luxocrat might find them holding a little known, black American Express card, entitled âCenturionâ, but youâll have to find the private elevator, present the proper identification, pass a security screening, and of course be wealthy enough to be noticed.</p>

<p>[[<b>Forgotten Chronicles</b>]] or <b>FC</b>, is a Digimon RPG site. It's one of the most popular Digimon RPG websites on the web, and is one of the few running today. It has close to 300 members, counting NPCs and is hosted on <a href="http://s11.invisionfree.com/" class="external text" title="http://s11.invisionfree.com/" rel="nofollow">Invisionfree</a>. The site was imfamous for being a rival of DC2, but currently, DC2 is out of action.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Basic Info</b></p>
<p>FC was created when June of 2005, and was created when the Forgotten Chronicles of <i>EzBoards</i> was targetted by a hacking attack. Since then, the site has grown steadily, although it has been met with many problems along the way.</p>
<p>One such problem, infact the most imfamous, was when DC2 attacked FC with a massive spam attack. This involved posting images of a chat, where someone was pretending to be, at that time, FC's head Admin. Heero a B-Mod that would later become an Admin, is credited with helping to clean up the site- Earning the title 'FC's Fallen Angel'.</p>
<p>Besides that, personal member conflicts- Like many boards- seem to arise from time to time, and the board often loses some of it's best members. Also, the board seems to have an inablitiy to finish any of the plots it starts, as something always happens half way to cause the plot to be thrown aside.</p>
<p><b>Admins:</b></p>
<p>FC has gone through a lot of leadership changes- The original Admins were Coti(Currently known as Wicked Peace), Tamer Gonzo, Yuri, Tamer Neo and Digital Kiwi. However, many different things have happened to the Admins, (Some disappearing, well others befell nasty personal issues) and currently, the Admins consist of- Wicked Peace, Perfect Drug, Tamer Sharod, and Heero. Vinnie (AKA- Voidmoon) was an Admin, but later took on the job as a Mod, due to personal issues.</p>

<p>WCMC signed on in 1990 as WFXQ, "99.9 The Fox", a country station operating with sister station WMEK (now WJYK) 980 AM in Chase City, Virginia. The station continued with this format for the next eleven years. When veteran Raleigh broadcaster Tom Joyner bought WFXQ and several other radio properties across southside Virginia in 2001, 99.9 FM's format switched to black gospel as "Rejoice Radio 99.9". Shortly thereafter, 99.9 FM went popular standards as "Stardust 99.9". In May of 2004, Joyner Radio won approval from the FCC to have 99.9 FM reallocated from Chase City, Virginia to Creedmoor, North Carolina, moving the rural Virginia station into the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill radio market. In February 2005, Joyner sold WFXQ to Raleigh's Capitol Broadcasting for $7.25 million. Lakes Media, which had recently purchased Joyner's other Southside Virginia properties, operated the station under a local marketing agreement, continuing the standards format until October 10th, 2005, when the format moved to the company's WSHV, 1370 AM, in South Hill, Virginia. Three days later on the afternoon of October 13th, WCMC "99.9 Genuine Country" hit the Triangle's airwaves from its new Creedmoor facilities with 22,000 watts of power. The station has applied to the FCC for a boost to 25,000 watts from a tower site near Falls Lake which better covers the market. WCMC's studios are co-located with sister station WRAL, 101.5 FM, at 711 Hillsborough Street in Raleigh.</p>

Welcome to the Short History of the NUS LGBT Campaign.</p>
<p>In writing this chapter, we have used all the materials we have in our archives, but inevitably over the years lots of information has been lost. You may notice that this history is more expansive in some areas and time periods than others. As a consequence, this chapter of the A-Z, more than any other, will be a âlivingâ document, meaning it will be continually updated. If you know anything about the campaign that weâve missed out, were involved in the early days, think weâve got something wrong, can talk about the move to âTâ or âBâ, then get in touch! Email nus@lgbt.org.uk to help us preserve the history of our campaign for future students.</p>
<p>The beginnings of the NUS LGBT Campaign The lesbian and gay movement (as it was then known) within NUS grew out of the wider gay liberation movement in the early 1970s. At this stage there was no formal national campaign, and only a few lesbian and gay societies in student unions. In 1976 NUS commissioned a research project on the discrimination faced by lesbians and gay men. The first explicit policy on lesbian and gay liberation was passed in 1971 and substantially debated in 1973.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, lesbian and gay societies, or 'gay socs' as they were known, were set up in many student unions, although very few had a continued existence. Individual societies worked with non-student bodies such as the GLF (Gay Liberation Front) and CHE (Campaign for Homosexual Equality). From the late 1970s there were a few national meetings on lesbian and gay liberation, the earliest ones being open to all.</p>
<p>The student movement campaign did not develop until the early 1980s with, for the first time, individuals on the NUS National Executive Committee having responsibility for lesbian and gay rights. In the mid-1980s, the campaign's current structure, with its twice-yearly conferences, was established.</p>
<p><br />
In December 1987, Clause 14, later known as Clause or Section 28, was introduced to the Local Government (Finance) Bill. The NUS Lesbian and Gay Campaign took a full part in the wider movement of people campaigning against the clause. Many lesbian and gay societies organised demonstrations in their towns. Thousands of students attended the two national demonstrations. In student unions, lesbians and gay men were passing positive policies, and lesbian and gay societies were being formed all over the UK. Unfortunately, when the clause became law, the campaigning activity returned to its previous level.</p>
<p>The Lesbian and Gay Campaign continued to monitor the effects of Section 28, including its use by Essex County Council to prevent further education colleges establishing lesbian and gay societies. A campaign organised by NUS and local area student organisations defeated the council. Successful campaigns also overturned the ban on setting up lesbian and gay societies at two Leeds colleges: the City College of Music and Kitson College.</p>
<p>The NUS Lesbian and Gay Campaign was also actively involved in work around access to donor insemination when the Embryology Bill was passing through Parliament in 1989/90. It also worked with a range of lesbian and gay organisations on the issues raised by Paragraph 16 of the guidelines to the 1990 Children's Act, and what was then Clause 25 of the Criminal Justice Bill.</p>
<p>The LGBT Campaign is based on the principles of self-organisation and autonomy. Initially the campaign was for lesbians and gay men only. In Summer 1991 this policy was changed, and the campaign was expanded to include bisexual students.</p>
<p>In Summer 1991, the NUS LGB Campaign (as it was by then known) supported the Leeds Lesbian and Gay Youth Group's successful protest against the Royal Bank of Scotland's decision to refuse them a bank account. We were also involved in the 1992 campaign that led to the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the Isle of Man.</p>
<p><br />
In the 1990s and in the first years of the 21st century, the LGB Campaign continued to develop and supported campaigning work in a number of different areas. Campaigns included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pride Not Prejudice: Disabled LGB Students in Education</li>
<li>Educate, Liberate, An End to Hate â What We Want From Education</li>
<li>LGB People in the Armed Forces</li>
<li>A Womanâs Place is in our Campaign</li>
<li>Policing the Bedroom: Sexual Offences Legislation</li>
<li>16 â No Compromise</li>
<li>Vote Against Bigotry</li>
<li>Fighting Homophobia in Student Sport</li>
<li>Lesbian and Bisexual Womenâs Sexual Health</li>
<li>Your Rights and The Police</li>
<li>Beat the Bigots (see poster below right)</li>
<li>Out at Work</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, students were involved in campaigns around the unequal age of consent, the Iraq War (see poster above), gay parenting and adoption, gay marriage, raising awareness around bisexuality, HIV and AIDS, and tuition fees.</p>
<p>The Pride Not Profit campaign ran as a priority for several years, in response to the decision to run a profit-making Mardi Gras in place of London Pride, after the collapse of the Pride Trust in 1997. NUS LGB Campaign felt that this discriminated against low income (including student) LGBT people, and also that it depoliticized the event. Student campaigners attended prides up and down the country, handing out stickers and pledge cards encouraging people to lobby their MPs on the issue. Students continue to campaign on this issue to this day, most recently at Lancaster Pride in December 2005.</p>
<p>In 1999, the NUS LGB Campaign organised a picket of the House of Lords to demonstrate opposition to new guidelines in the Learning and Skills Bill which would oblige schools to promote the importance of (heterosexual) marriage. In May of the same year, a second demonstration was held in Manchester against Section 28 with the slogan âNever Going Undergroundâ and students convened outside the House of Lords again to demand an equal age of consent.</p>
<p>February 2000 saw a picket of the Ministry for Women (or lack of it) as the first Womenâs Place LGB Officer took office; LB students also presented petitions (and had a kiss) at Downing Street demanding a properly funded, fully-resourced department working for LB women. In April, the NUS LGB Campaign joined with the Black Students Campaign to demonstrate against fascism, a year on from the Soho nail bombings. Approximately 200 students joined the NUS LGB Campaign National Demonstration â Equality Now! - in November demanding the repeal of Section 28, the abolition of unjust Gross Indecency laws, protection from discrimination in employment, an equal and accessible education system, Grants not Fees, the right to parent, the recognition of partnerships, and an end to hate crime. Vicki Austin (NUS Womenâs Place LGB Officer) was quoted in the Times Higher Education Supplement as saying:</p>
<p>âIt is disgusting that people in this country can be legally sacked from their jobs, arrested for consensual sex, and prevented from caring for children purely on the basis of their sexuality. Weâve had enough patronising pleasantries from Tony Blair and New Labour; itâs about time they took action!â</p>
<p>The âEducation: Free and Equalâ Campaign fought the introduction of tuition fees and called for a living grant. LGB students were particularly hard hit by attacks on student funding, and this is an area of concern for the LGB Campaign that continues to this day.</p>
<p>The March for Liberation was called in 2002 by the LGB Officers of the time, Carli Harper-Penman and Daniel Murphy, demanding the repeal of Section 28, employment discrimination legislation, partnership and parenting rights and a living grant for students. The march took place at a time when five separate bills for LGB equality were going through parliament.</p>
<p>In 2003, Section 28, the piece of legislation that had caused so much harm over the years to students in schools and further education, was finally repealed. At the time, the National LGB Officer (Open Place) Carli Harper-Penman said in The Guardian newspaper:</p>
<p>"Section 28 has proved to be a relatively useless piece of legislation and has stigmatised lesbian, gay and bisexual people throughout the education system.</p>
<p>"It has legitimised homophobic bullying and contributed to the discrimination that LGB people face throughout society. Its demise will mean that LGB students at school and beyond can get access to the information that they need, and teachers will finally be able to talk about LGB issues without fear of recrimination."</p>
<p>A major consequence of the repeal of Section 28 was the initiation of LGBT History Month in 2005 (see Chapter 7 for more information). LGBT Societies up and down the country have been part of the celebrations, ensuring that the month was a success and is being repeated this year. Another legacy of Section 28 has been a relentless rise in homophobic bullying in schools. Students have been involved in campaigning all over the country to urge the Government to act on this. Most recently Claire Anderson, a student from Birmingham, spearheaded a campaign to end homophobic bullying in schools. She worked with Schools Out to collect over a thousand footprints for a special petition that she handed to the DfES on December 7th 2005. The footprints represent the campaign aim - to stamp out homophobia in education.</p>
<p><br />
2004 saw the first nationally co-ordinated campaign on the National Blood Service ban on gay and bisexual male donors (as well as women that have slept with bisexual men). This is an issue which had been debated in the LGBT Campaign for several years. Under the slogan âGive Blood Because Gay and Bisexual Men Canâtâ, students up and down the country organised protests on campus outside blood donation sessions, collected signatures for petitions and lobbied MPs. This campaign continues, most recently responding to the Mail On Sundayâs claim that blood shortages are a result of studentsâ protests.</p>
<p><br />
The LGBT Campaign continues to fight for legislative equality. Over 60 LGBT students came together in March 2005 for a lobby of parliament over the issue of discrimination in goods and services and to present a petition of faces to the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street. This is a legal loophole which means that it is still legal to bar someone from a pub, refuse a hotel room or even insurance cover to someone simply because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans. NUS LGBT Campaign are part of the wider community effort which has finally resulted in this loophole being closed by the Equality Bill with protection due to be implemented in October 2006. Unfortunately trans people are still unprotected from this kind of discrimination and students continue to campaign for this change as part of the Access All Areas Campaign (see below).</p>
<p><br />
In 2005, the Campaign turned its attention to the funding of LGBT students in HE who have been forced to leave home because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, the low level of reporting of hate crime among LGBT students, and diversity within our campaign and community. For more information on the Priority Campaigns for 2005-6, have a look at Chapter 8 of the A-Z.</p>
<p>The Special Regions</p>
<p>There are eight NUS Regions within England (Each has its own LGBT Committee member or members allocated to it) and three special regions: NUS Wales, NUS Scotland and NUS-USI in Northern Ireland. Wales and Scotland have their own LGBT Officers (in Wales, this is still an LGB Officer). These positions are autonomous and elected by conferences held in Wales and Scotland.</p>
<p>NUS Scotland LGBT Campaign</p>
<p>The NUS Scotland Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Campaign is the autonomous representative voice for LGBT students in NUS-affiliated colleges and universities throughout Scotland. It works closely with local LGBT groups, individual studentsâ associations, NUS Scotland, and the NUS UK LGBT Campaign as well as local and national organisations to ensure that LGBT students are represented and their needs and concerns voiced both within the student movement and the wider world.</p>
<p>It is a democratic campaign specifically dealing with issues concerning lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in Scotland. It holds a conference each year at which the LGBT Committee and Officer are elected.</p>
<p>NUS-USI LGB Campaign</p>
<p>In 1972 NUS formed a bilateral agreement with the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) which meant that all Studentâs Unions in Northern Ireland affiliated to both national unions through one affiliation fee, rather than choosing one union over the other. This historic agreement lead to the creation of NUS-USI. Like NUS Scotland and NUS Wales, NUS-USI is autonomous and has itâs own executive committee but currently has no LGBT Officer.</p>
<p>Elected Officers The first national officers were elected in 2000, after NUS Annual Conference voted to change the constitution in order for the positions to be created, despite some opposition. The full list of elected officers up to the present day is as follows:</p>

Patricia Jordanâs dreams of uniting <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurses.html" title="Nurses">nurses</a> as contractors were dashed. The unsuccessful attempt was related to the previous Medicare reform that forced the larger surviving Home Health Agencies to become controlling and forcing smaller agencies out of business, or severely deterring a new business from starting in the Home Health Agency industry. For good reason the health care industry was and still is currently against nurses uniting in the Home Health industry and starting a new Florence night and Gayle trend. Nurses that are competitive or a competitor are not good employees of any Home Health Agency.</p>

And only the larger and older Home Heath Agencies were able to survive the Medicare reform in the 1990âs. Over 300 Home Health Agencies were forced to close its doors to its patients, because of the reform. Patricia had entered into an industry under reconstruction, and quickly learned the Florence night and Gayle days were gone. Large corporations now owned the industry, and were not willing for nurses to amalgamate, and pilfer the corporationâs patients, or the 60 billion dollar Home Health Medicare remuneration. D.H.S soon wanted a list of all the nurses listed inside of the union. Which the young willing C.E.O gave D.H.S.</p>

<p>D.H.S soon had meetings with the nurses training and teaching the nurses the Home <a href="../../../h/e/a/Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> industry D.H.S acknowledged the nurses as 1099 employees, which this concept had been stated through out the Home Health industry as taboo. D.H.S would now have a preferred list of 1099 employees to provide Home Health services at a less expensive and cost effective way of providing Medicare patients with Home Health services through its Individual <a href="../../../n/u/r/Nurse.html" title="Nurse">Nurse</a> Provider network, which had been quickly taken from the young C.E.O. In 2005 D.H.S started a controversial referral list for patients who were seeking to hire their own nurses, unsatisfied, not referred to, or attempting to take their nurses from a licensed Home Health Agency, In some cases through the D.H.S list the customers or patients were helping the nurses pilfer the Home Health Agencies patients with out incurring penalties from the Home Health Agency that employed the nurses. D.H.S list is not known in 2006 to be a Private Duty Nurses Agency P.D.N.A or Home Health Agency, but has the markings of a P.D.N.A.</p>

<p>The 30 year old Patricia had turned her thoughts and energy years before the dissolution of the union or network into becoming a licensed Home Health Agency, and building a construction Contractor Corporation. The construction contractor industry was welcoming of the start of a new business related to the demand of building. The C.E.O provided simple handymen services, with contracts with <a href="../../../p/r/o/Property_management.html" title="Property management">property management</a> firms. As of 2006 the 35 year old Patricia Jordan Weathington is the successful and proud owner of a construction cleaning corporation, and licensed construction contractor corporation, which specializes in the sales, <a href="../../../r/e/p/Repair.html" title="Repair">repair</a>, replacement, and maintenance of heating, ventilation, and <a href="../../../a/i/r/Air_conditioners.html" title="Air conditioners">air conditioners</a>. During this interview in March 2006 Patricia or as she likes to be called Pat, seemed hopeful of Tonyâs Handymen &amp; Construction and Abiathar design &amp; cleaning corporations success in construction. She even expressed interest in cleaning up and providing HVAC units to the <a href="../../../g/u/l/Gulf_Coast_3a68.html" title="Gulf Coast">Gulf Coast</a> after <a href="../../../h/u/r/Hurricane_Katrina_e7df.html" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. But she stated âThe corporation is on a list in 2006 with the US Army Corps of engineers and <a href="../../../f/2E/e/F.E.M.A_82bc.html" title="F.E.M.A">F.E.M.A</a> with other contractors more than willing to locate an office in the disaster areaâ. The elated Patricia Jordan Weathington C.E.O has left her abortive attempts in the past. She contributes success and failures as the life of a young <a href="../../../e/n/t/Entrepreneur.html" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a> attempting to get a niche in any industry. Her survival in business seems to be, because of the endeavors of the young entrepreneursâ ability to adapt and the ability to overcome obstacles placed in many industries to keep the fragile, insubstantial, and inadequate out. She clearly stated âIn 1993 I prepared myself for this rough road ahead of me by enlisting in the United States Army for 8 years, where as an <a href="../../../a/f/r/African_American_5c73.html" title="African American">African American</a> <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female.html" title="Female">female</a> I learned skills to overcome obstacles set before me, and keep a positive attitude while doing itâ.</p>

<p>Patricia Jordan Weathington envisions the corporation going public within the next 5 years. Where she feels she will be warmly welcomed, because investors love making money by the hard work and accelerated thoughts of the young entrepreneurs. I asked her did she feel Tonyâs Handymen &amp; Construction or Abiathar design &amp; cleaning will endure time in this industry. Pat looked at me and laughed, then stated âAre you serious, of course it will survive. Constructionâs a welcoming industry the licensed contractors are the industry rather itâs an individual thatâs licensed wanting to provide food on the table for one family, or a corporation giving jobs to many that provide food on the table to many families. As the contractor grow, develop, repair, design, and create the world. The contractor creates a strong enduring construction company. We are licensed contractors regardless if we make enough to only feed our family, or feed thousands of our employeesâ families, and make investors prosperous, we will survive in this industryâ. Pat feels if she receives enough federal, state, private contracts, and consumers using Tonyâs Handymen &amp; Constructionsâ many contractor services the corporation will remain stable.</p>

Often cited as the orgin of many modern pop bands such as Fall Out Boy, "Lack of working birth control" occurs when mommy and daddy engage in sexual intercourse. Only the cheap off-brand condom daddy buys becuase it's the only kind he can afford on his meager $5-per-hour job at Walmart breaks resulting in an unwanted child. These children often lack any intellect as they have none to inherit (they are the son of a Wal-mart worker after all!). This is why most popular bands suck</p>

It is a known fact to society that the power rangers were to som extent gay and or retarted. With new information however we are able to prove that they were in fact gay. The power rangers as we know them are all expected to die of A.I.D.S within the next decade. How did they get A.I.D.S.? Simply by having gay sex with eachother while away from fighting crime. It is also then fact that they were retarted as well for not asking thier partners if they had been checked or using a condom. I think they learned thier lesson and I hope you did as well.</p>

<p>Gary "Ranger Danger" Locatelli (aka Uncle Vito) 54 year old radio and TV personality from Albany, NY Catch Phrase: UHHH YAHHHHHH! &lt;Image: <a href="http://www.unclevito.net/images/06birthday.jpg" class="external free" title="http://www.unclevito.net/images/06birthday.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.unclevito.net/images/06birthday.jpg</a>&gt;</p>
<p><br />
Ranger Danger was a popular personality featured on WXXA Fox 23 (Albany) during the early 1990's. The Ranger was played by Gary Locatelli (also a popular Radio DJ). Classic segments involved Ranger Danger wrestling with WWF superstars, failing to maintain a job at a diner and the constant theme of falling down stairs. The Ranger would promote positive messages at public appearances at schools, local sporting events and parades. Rumours were sparked that Locatelli had taken the role of Ranger Danger to serve Community Service for DWI. This was not true and in 2005 the rumour was put to rest on Locatelli's web site. The Ranger has reached a somewhat cult status on the internet with classic segments available for download at Locatelli's website.</p>

Technology v Nature. The fight still continues without any clear winners. Natureâs fury occasionally reminds us of how easily it can overwhelm all that modern technology has to offer, but indomitable man just goes back to the drawing board to come up with an improved solution. The tremendous advances in data storage technology have been taken for granted by most users for whom the phenomenal growth in storage capacity can hardly keep pace with their appetite for more and more data. At the same time, the high-tech world of computers gives the users a false feeling of invincibility. While data storage devices have become more robust than in the past, the sheer numbers have made data disasters more common than ever before. There are many reasons why hard disk drives and other data storage devices can â and do â fail. When Mother Nature strikes, as with the recent tsunami that ravaged half the earth or the winter storms that gripped much of North America, it is big news. While loss of life is truly irreplaceable, these disasters affect many other aspects of life. At times like these, there is a heightened awareness about data loss and data recovery. âBut the single biggest culprit in data loss is human error,â claims Allison Beckley, VP (Customer Service) at Disk Doctor Labs, Inc., one of the pioneers of data recovery. âAnd a close second is the inherent limitations of the data storage technology itself,â adds Tariq Aslam, the CEO of Disk Doctors. It can happen anytime, anywhere, and to anybody. If you deal with data extensively, the odds are you will suffer data loss sooner or later. The important thing is being able to cope with it. And different types of users need to have different strategies for safeguarding their data. A high school student who uses his PC for gaming and the occasional term project cannot be expected to have UPS, tape back-ups and RAID systems. On the other hand, a bank cannot feel complacent that it has protected its database by installing the latest anti-virus software and anything else is overkill. The user profile, the data criticality, available budget and resources all impact the data protection strategy. However, these are some general tips Disk Doctors has for avoiding and surviving data loss: ï§ Make a regular back-up of all your important data (including laptop drives) ï§ Test your back-ups regularly (especially if it is a tape back-up) ï§ Carry laptops in padded cases ï§ If it is mission critical business data, store it on RAID systems ï§ Use power surge protectors, and UPS systems for critical data ï§ Use regularly updated anti-virus software ï§ Restrict unauthorized access ï§ If you experience problems with your drive, move the data to another drive; donât take any chances unless your data is worth less than the cost of a new drive ï§ If you still lose the data, do not panic; seek professional advice ï§ Data recovery is a specialized field, and not every computer technician can retrieve data ï§ If the data is critical, or if the drive makes unusual noises do not try DIY solutions ï§ When you shop around for a data recovery company, donât consider the recovery charges only ï§ Look at the company experience, expertise, locations, facilities, testimonials, etc. ï§ You should not have to pay an up-front diagnostic fee, or pay for any hidden extras over the quoted price, or pay for the âeffortâ if you did not get your data</p>

The Mutual Recognition Directive provides for a General System for Mutual Recognition of Professional Qualifications. The General System has been established with the purpose of enabling individuals to transfer their qualifications and skills between Member States of <a href="../../../e/u/r/European_Union_e368.html" title="European Union">European Union</a>.</p>
<p>The General System is founded on the premise that an individual qualified in one Member State to exercise a given profession should be treated, in principle, as qualified to exercise that same profession or occupation in another Member State, without having to re-qualify from the beginning. Where there are substantial differences between the education and training, the migrant is asked to compensate for these differences.</p>
<p>The principle behind the system is that of accredited prior learning - but with the important proviso that the applicant for recognition must be treated as a qualified professional with some gaps in his or her training, not as a student.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-21_abef.html" title="Edit section: Robin Miller's list of the 20 Worst Champ Car Drivers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Robin Miller's list of the 20 Worst Champ Car Drivers</span></h2>
<p>In the December 1999-January 2000 issue of Racer presents Champ Car Magazine (no longer in publication), racing journalist <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Kirby_4013.html" title="Gordon Kirby">Gordon Kirby</a>, SPEED News Sunday (now) analyst <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robin_Miller_0e0c.html" title="Robin Miller">Robin Miller</a>, and legendary racing media personality <a href="../../../c/h/r/Chris_Economaki_644a.html" title="Chris Economaki">Chris Economaki</a> compiled a list of the 20 best drivers in <a href="../../../c/a/r/CART_0ea7.html" title="CART">CART</a> competition. Within the article, Miller listed the drivers he ranked as the 20 Worst, based on his own evidence. All the drivers listed are shown below in ascending order:</p>
<p>20. Greg Weld: While being a good dirt racer in the sprint car leagues, this driver couldn't adapt to paved tracks-he crashed three cars at the <a href="../../../i/n/d/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway_deed.html" title="Indianapolis Motor Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> in the space of one afternoon.</p>
<p>19. Bruce Jacobi: One of several cases where, despite having a good car, the driver couldn't go fast enough.</p>
<p>18. <a href="../../../m/a/r/Marco_Greco_2057.html" title="Marco Greco">Marco Greco</a>: A noted <a href="../../../b/r/a/Brazilian.html" title="Brazilian">Brazilian</a> ride-buyer (someone who buys a seat on a racing team), whom, Miller acknowledges, should probably be watching the races instead of driving them.</p>
<p>17. Al Loquasto: A good-natured driver who used an optimistic attitude to help him live with the fact he didn't belong in the cockpit.</p>
<p>16. Jan Sneva: Despite having the touch for sprint cars, he probably wasn't all that great in the big leagues: He wrecked his car leaving the pits at Indy, and he reportedly told the driver of the ambulance to take him directly to the airport and not bother visiting the infield hospital.</p>
<p>15. <a href="../../../s/t/e/Steve_Saleen_bad3.html" title="Steve Saleen">Steve Saleen</a>: Saleen, who is more well known for his prowess in sports car racing and his famed tuned Ford Mustangs was a [Formula Atlantic]] champion who decided to try his hand in CART-with his own money and equipment. Needless to say, it didn't go well.</p>
<p>14. A group of drivers Miller nicknamed "The Interchangeable Italians", stating that while they had great racing names, the "Scuderia" never called. For a damned good reason.</p>
<p>13. Steve Barclay: It didn't take much for this driver to earn a spot on Miller's list. But odds are that things don't look to good for you when you filp your car over during your Indy 500 rookie test. As Miller states, "'Nuff said".</p>
<p>12. Ray Crawford: As with Marco Greco, this grocey chain owner only got on the grid because he could buy the ride.</p>
<p>11. Paul Jasper: Apparantly, when he made his only four starts in Champ Car competition, he had very little experience.</p>
<p>10. Jim Buick: Like Paul Jasper above him, he wasn't around in the sport very long, but long enough that he didn't have what it takes.</p>
<p>9. Ebb Rose: He was good friends with a few seasoned pros, who, Miller tells us, didn't have the heart to tell him he couldnt drive a race car.</p>
<p>8. Randy Lewis: His incredible resume didn't save him from being nicknamed by faster drivers as "The Moving Chicane".</p>
<p>7. <a href="../../../d/e/n/Dennis_Vitolo_a600.html" title="Dennis Vitolo">Dennis Vitolo</a>: Another good natured racer who didn't have what it takes to play on the top. Apparantly, he woould take himself out whenever it was possible, otherwise he was a ticking time bomb.</p>
<p>6. Joel Thorne: According to Miller, Thorne was the first person to buy a seat on the Indy 500 grid, and often left team owners regretting their decision.</p>
<p>5. Patrick Bedard: If anyone wants an example of being pathetic read the following: Bedard flipped his car at the Indy 500 (while running at 145 MPH on only three cylinders) According to Miller, he announced his retirement form Champ Car racing as he was being placed in the ambulance.</p>
<p>4. Lee Bryton: The father of the late <a href="../../../s/c/o/Scott_Brayton_a26b.html" title="Scott Brayton">Scott Brayton</a>, Miller tells us, is a living example of the statement "Nice Guys finish Last".</p>
<p>3. Salt Walther: This wealthy young man had some of the best cars available in the 1970s. But vainity and a horrid attitude kept him from ever reaching the podium.</p>
<p>2. <a href="../../../h/i/r/Hiro_Matsushita_de1f.html" title="Hiro Matsushita">Hiro Matsushita</a>: Like Steve Saleen, Matsushita was an Atlantic champion who thought he could run in the big leagues. All he got from it was being nicknamed "King Hiro" by one of the greats, Emerson Fittipaldi, and, according to Miller, the dubious honor of being the CART record holder for being flipped off by other competitors.</p>
<p>1. <a href="../../../d/r/2E/Dr._Jack_Miller_556f.html" title="Dr. Jack Miller">Dr. Jack Miller</a>: It would seem odd to any knowledgeable fan of American open-wheel racing as to why Miller placed an <a href="../../../i/r/l/IRL_9d17.html" title="IRL">IRL</a> driver on the list of CART's 20 worst drivers, let alone it's top spot. But the following horror stories were enough to earn Miller's contempt: At an IRL event in <a href="../../../p/h/o/Phoenix.html" title="Phoenix">Phoenix</a>, Dr. Miller pulled into the pits simply to allow the leading cars to get by, and, at the start of another race, Kepth flicking his engine kill switch, all while he was complaining to his crew that there were electrical problems with the car...</p>
<p>Miller also includes one Honorable Mention: <a href="../../../j/o/h/Johnny_Rutherford_924d.html" title="Johnny Rutherford">Johnny Rutherford</a>, who, depite claiming 27 Champ Car wins, three Indy 500 wins, and legendary status as a sprint car driver, can't drive an IRL pace car worht a damn (At the tme of publication, Rutherford had actually crashed several pace cars at IRL events).</p>

<p>Heirloom seeds are non-<a href="../../../h/y/b/Hybrid.html" title="Hybrid">hybrid</a> vegetable, flower, and herb seeds. They differ from hybrids in that they are more biologically fit for the environments that they have evolved in.

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-21_abef.html" title="Edit section: Ovingdean">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline"><a href="../../../o/v/i/Ovingdean.html" title="Ovingdean">Ovingdean</a></span></h2>
<p>Ovingdean is an eastern suburb of the city of Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, separated from Brighton by open downland on which are Brighton racecourse and a golf course. Its population is approximately 1000. Despite being so close to the sea, it was historically a landlocked farming village, but since its incorporation into the County Borough of Brighton in 1928 there has been housing development on its eastern and southern sides. Some of this early housing was rough-and-ready plotland development like that of adjacent Woodingdean, but modern Ovingdean is prosperous and almost all trace of this inter-war past has vanished. The extreme west of the historic parish was annexed by Brighton in the 1930s for part of its Whitehawk housing estate.</p>
<p>The historic centre of Ovingdean still retains a rural feel. At its heart is a small flint church dating from the latter part of the 11th century, which may be the very one mentioned in Domesday Book, and which has a rare dedication to St Wulfran, an eighth-century archbishop of Sens, one of only three in England (the others Grantham and Dorrington, both in Lincolnshire). Its churchyard contains the remains of Magnus Volk, the inventor, Charles Kempe, stained-glass artist, and Helena Normanton QC, one of the first female barristers. There is also a memorial to Sophia Jex-Blake, one of the first cohort of British female medical students.</p>
<p>Other significant buildings include the late eighteenth-century gentry farmhouse Ovingdean Hall, now a well-known school for hearing-impaired children, and Ovingdean Grange, a farmhouse with a 16th-century core which features in a local legend of a visit by Charles II before his escape to France in 1651. The legend in its best-known form is an invention of the novelist W. Harrison Ainsworth in _Ovingdean Grange_ (1857). There are other probably eighteenth-century flint buildings in the village, and the whole centre is a conservation area.</p>
<p>Ovingdean has one shop (a post office) and no pub or cafe. Near its historic southern boundary, but strictly speaking in historic Rottingdean, are (1) the rehabilitation centre for blind ex-servicemen, St Dunstan's, now (snce April 2006) home to Britain's oldest surving veteran of the Great War and oldest surving man, Henry Allingham (110), and (2) the famous girls' public school, Roedean.</p>

<p>We are an 11-18 comprehensive boys school formed in 1971 by the amalgamation of two well established schools: The Lancastrian Secondary School for Boys and the High School for Boys. Our successful sixth form is mixed and combined with Chichester High School for Girls.</p>
<p>Recently the school has benefited from a considerable building programme including: a purpose built specialist Science Block, a new Learning Resources Centre, a new administrative and reception area, the sixth form centre has been extended and the synthetic turf pitch has been refurbished.</p>
<p>Plans for a new sports hall are well under way. Considerable importance is placed on the school working in partnership with parents.</p>
<p>We draw from a very large number of primary schools and therefore particular care and emphasis is attached to the arrangements for successful transfer to secondary school.</p>

<p><b>Swami Satyeswarananda Giri</b> also known as Vidyaratna Babaji, was born in Bengal, India and is considered a Himalayan Master of Kriya Yoga. He received Kriya instruction and guidance, as well as, monastic training from Swami Satyananda Giri, whom he met whilst studying at the hermitage of <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramhansa_Yogananda_a01f.html" title="Paramhansa Yogananda">Paramhansa Yogananda</a> for eight years.</p>
<p>Swami Satyeswarananda Giri, in concordance with his 20 year service to Swami Satyananda Giri, completed his MA in Philosophy (specialising in <a href="../../../v/e/d/Vedanta.html" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a>) and a BA in Law from the University of Calcutta. Eventually practicing as an attorney and a Law proffessor.</p>
<p>Shortly before Swami Satyananda's passing, Swami Satyeswarananda Giri became part of the Swami Order in Puri. After the passing of his spiritual preceptor, he then would often go the Himalayas to meditate for years at a time - primarily to Dunagiri Hill, the place where he would go to practice Kriya Yoga every summer in the past.</p>
<p>It is during this period that Swami Satyeswarananda Giri came into contact with Mahamuni Babaji, also known as <a href="../../../m/a/h/Mahavatar_Babaji_e971.html" title="Mahavatar Babaji">Mahavatar Babaji</a>. Mahamuni Babaji lived and stayed with Swami Satyeswarananda Giri for periods of time in various caves and a small hut. Swami Satyeswarananda Giri was then initiated into the Purna Kriya ('Whole' or 'Complete' Kriya Yoga practice) by Mahamuni Babaji. He was then instructed by Mahamuni Babaji to re-establish the original Kriya Yoga, as brought to the world by <a href="../../../l/a/h/Lahiri_Mahasaya_2ce6.html" title="Lahiri Mahasaya">Lahiri Mahasaya</a>, throughout the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Swami Satyeswarananda Giri resides in San Diego teaching Kriya Yoga and writing books on sacred scriptures and Kriya Yoga.</p>
<p>Swami Satyeswarananda Giri has also authored many books mostly published by Sanskrit Classics on Kriya Yoga and the biographies of many of the luminarious within the Kriya Yoga tradition, as well as, being involved with the translations of commentaries and letters by these authorative figures within the Kriya tradition.</p>

<p>While traditionally music lessons take place face to face, the internet has opened up the concept of learning an instrument via multimedia lessons. These online lessons can include everything from images, audio files, guitar tablature, music notation, scales, chords, and music theory through to video content.</p>
<p>People from all over the world, even in remote areas, can learn guitar from some of the best guitarists around, via the web. Online guitar lessons can be found in a piecemeal fashion all across the internet, or are commercially available. The guitar lesson courses for sale online often include a complete range of lessons, and are about the cost of one or two face to face guitar lessons.</p>

<p>The site www.hackproviders.com is a forum dedicated to online cheating and cheat support. Hackproviders was called differently at the beginning but changed their name in early 2005 to hackproviders.com. Since then hackproviders has changed its look many times and has also overcome many problems. Such as an arguement concerning a moderator called X3, which modified cheats and released them as his own. This arguement ended up with him being banned from the site.</p>
<p>Hackproviders.com is a forum, where any registered member can post his thoughts/ideas or detection reports about any cheat. Members can also release cheats themselves which many other sites don't allow. The most cheats released on hackproviders are Steam games such as Counter-Strike or Counter-Strike Source but also other games such as Americas Army or GunBound are available. The majority of cheats released are so called VAC hacks which mean they are undetected by Valves Anti Cheat system VAC.</p>
<p>The team of Hackproviders consist of: Administrators: AKSCHU LightHazard UndertakerzZz</p>
<p>Moderators: Frate Gangsta 4 Life pro-hax ummbop x v0id x 2 X+|h2o.^</p>
<p>The team tries to release and change the status of cheats as soon as possible and also listens to their members. The forum is always friendly if no one has disrespected a member of staff or a normal member.</p>

<p>Fictionism is a word coined (or appropriated) by arstist Jakob S. Boeskov to describe at least two of his works - the most infamous of which is "<a href="http://www.backfire.dk/EMPIRENORTH/newsite/products_en001.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.backfire.dk/EMPIRENORTH/newsite/products_en001.htm" rel="nofollow">ID Sniper Rifle</a>".</p>
<p>Boeskov defines Fictionism as follows, "The goal of fictionism is to create fresh reality and to give people a taste of the future today."</p>
<p>"You make a fictionist art piece by: 1: Imagining a possible future 2: Imagining a possible product from this future 3: Creating this product 4: Presenting the product today 5: Reporting the reactions"</p>
<p>Boeskov created a fictional product, a sniper rifle that could be used to implant a tracking device in an unsuspecting person, and then presented it to government representatives at the 2002 China Police Technology Conference where it was enthusiasticaly received. He also created a website for "<a href="http://www.backfire.dk/EMPIRENORTH/newsite/products_en001.htm" class="external text" title="http://www.backfire.dk/EMPIRENORTH/newsite/products_en001.htm" rel="nofollow">Empire North</a>", the fictional corperation responsible for the ID Sniper Rifle.</p>

<p>Located in Ottawa, Ontario Canada.</p>
<p><br />
The Game Professional Miniature Golf is NOT golf in miniature. However, miniature golf does have a lot in common with regulation golf. To be interesting, the golf holes have the contour changes found on the regulation green which cause the ball to break and turn as it rolls toward the cup. Undulations and banking give the game an element of challenge and fun.</p>
<p>Unlike miniature golf of old, windmills and standing bears are not found at The Game. Miniature golf courses, however, do need unique elements to hold the players interest. Greens that bring water, sand traps and rough turf into play add this uniqueness to the course, while still maintaining an interesting and challenging game - in a unique, landscaped setting.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-21_abef.html" title="Edit section: Vril Disk (flying saucer)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Vril Disk (flying saucer)</span></h2>
<p>A VRIL Disk (or elecromaglev disk) is a term often used to describe a saucer-shaped aircraft with the ability of vertical take off and landing (VTOL) that has no visible means of coventional propulsion. This term was widely used since the WWII era and became more popular after the Billy Meier case, as described by Wendelle Stephens and Randolph Winters. The most widely used terms for this type of aircraft/spaceship today are flying disk, flying saucer or just UFO.</p>
<p>The nickname Vril derived from a science-fiction novel by Edward Bulwer-Lytton titled "Vril: The Power of the Coming Race", published in 1870. In the book, Vril is a form of energy possessed by an extremely powerful subterranean race.</p>
<p>Although this type of aircraft is supposed to be fictitious or of extra-terrestrial origin, there is strong indication that many countries during and after the WWII have developed various technologies in the field of electromagnetic propulsion or aircraft designs of round shape. There are also many designs, photos and film footage displaying demonstations of such crafts for millitary and commercial use.</p>
<p>Documents found on several websites and archives, indicate that Adolph Hitler himself had inspected prototypes of such aircrafts at facilities in Germany during WWII.</p>
<p>A rumor among conspiracy theorists and various UFO-related researchers is that such aircrafts did exist back then and are in use today for experemental reasons regarding Stealth Technology, with the ability to fly in or above the stratoshpere at speeds beyond Mach 10.</p>
<p>The basic principal behind such speculated technology, is that a VRIL Disk uses a reactor for power, to fire a set of triangulated capacitors under its hull to cancel or enhance the gravitational forces affecting the aircraft. Another intense field is also produced at the top of the craft, generating an accumulation of electrons that suck the disk in a vaccum, causing the bottom of the craft to chase its top. That field is supposedly responsible for the corona discharge seen by glowing UFOs at the night sky.</p>
<p>The field is assumed to be so powerful, that cancels mass inertia inside the craft, thus giving the pilot the ability to perform jerky moves and U -turns, or even come to a instant halt in mid air.</p>
<p>By manipulating the direction of the field, there is a way to move the craft around, provided that the craft doesnt touch the ground, because the planet itslef grounds the crafts elecromagnetic field, rendering the disk incapable of taking off. Because of this, the craft has to land on a apparatus that acts both as a electromagnetic insulator and a landing pod.</p>
<p>"VRIL force", supposedly a type of force penetrating all matter, (similar to "The Force" in Star Wars movies) which people having high mental and psycic powers are capable of tapping into. It is rummored that during the WWII, a team of NAZI scientists visited certain gurus in Asia to learn about this power in order to find a way to make their aircrafts invisible under enemy radars. Supprisingly, after various expirements instead of making the prototype VRIL flying disk invisible, it floated a few feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Plans for developing the VRIL project continiued for a period during the war, producing various crafts like the Haunebu, a larger version of the VRIL-1, but when the allied forces entered Germany, the project was forced to a stop. There is no indication wether the NAZI Germany scientists managed to continiue the project, destroyed it or the allies siezed this technology for future experimentation (as part of the infamous Montauk and Paperclip projects), although the opposite is widely speculated among the fanbase of UFO related conspiracy theorists. It is believed that the VRIL/Haunebu disks project was further developed at an isolated base in Antarctica called NEUSCHWABENLAND.</p>
<p>Although it might sound far fetched to the average person, round shaped aircraft designs is an old idea. In fact many scientists from various countries had ideas of disk-shaped aircrafts before, during and after the WWII, but almost all of them used variations of conventional propulsion methods like a jet engine.</p>
<p>The electromagnetic propulsion principal is not new either. It goes back to the late 1800's where Nikola Tesla performed many experiments regarding eletromagnetic fields. It is actually a matter of dispute, wether the Nazi Germany scientists developed this technology or stole early Tesla designs. Today, there are various trains that use this method to literaly fly above the ground, thus avoiding friction and achieving great speeds.</p>

<p>Two Aged Pioneers Peter McCain and his wife are among the oldest citizens of our county. Both were born in 1804, within forty days of each other, and each is now in his ninety-first year. Mr. McCain is the son of Peter McCain who was born in Maryland. He removed to Jefferson County in this state at an early day, where his son Peter was born. He removed later to Scioto County and died there about 1828. His remains were buried in Pike County.</p>
<p>Our subject was born July 1, 1804. he was about eleven years of age when his parents came from Jefferson County to Scioto. He spent a part of his early life hauling wood for the salt furnaces of Judge William Givens, whose well is still to be found in the corn field just above the Baler building.</p>
<p>He was married in 1824. His wife was born in the same county as he was, May 21, 1804. They were married by Justice Samuel McDowell, the first Justice of the Peace elected in this county after its organization, and after whom McDowell's run was named.</p>
<p>Fourteen children were born to them of whom ten still survive. James their oldest son who lived in Clark County was killed in Springfield about two years ago. Three daughters are dead, Rebecca, Nancy and Ivy. Ivy was the wife of G. W. Spriggs, and died in the west about six years ago. Rebecca was the wife of Rev. Charles Coon and died many years ago. After her death Mr. Coon married her sister Nancy who has died since. The youngest of the living children is Daniel who lives in Scioto County. He was 51 years old September 4, 1894. The others living are Ann wife of Isaac Ammons of Michigan, Sarah wife of William Crabtree of Pike County, Rachel wife of John Tope of this city, Susan wife of Charles Gray of Cass County, Missouri, and Deliah wife of John Pierce of Glen Roy, William who lives Mercer County, Ohio, Peter who fives in Seioto , Benjamin who lives with his parents on the home farm in this county, and Samuel who lives in Colorado. Four of the sons were in the army. Benjamin is now Trustee for his father.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCain milks three cows every day and is in fair health. The family has in its possession one of the old sixty gallon salt kettles used in Jackson in salt boiling times. Mr and Mrs. McCain have had 111 grand children but it is not known how many great grand children and great great grand children they have because the grand children have scattered all over the United States. The aged pair came to Jackson last Tuesday to spend a few days with their daughter Mrs. Tope. Mrs. McCain said in passing the furnace that Samuel McDowell first settled near the site of Huron Furnace. --From the Jackson Standard-Journal, dated Wednesday December 19, 1894</p>

CN-235-220M Dalam Persaingan Pesawat CN-235-220 Produksi PTDI pesanan Korea Selatan/Foto: Hendro Subroto</p>
<p>Dalam pasaran internasional, pesawat angkut taktis berukuran medium CN-235-220M produksi PT Dirgantara Indonesia (PTDI) mendapat saingan berat oleh C-235-300M ataupun C-295M produksi CASA, Spanyol, serta transporto tattico (angkut taktis) buatan Turin, Italia Alenia/Lockheed Martin C-27J Spartan. Dua jenis pesawat angkut taktis-strategis yang ikut mempersempit pasaran CN-235M, pertama Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules varian terakhir yang hanya memerlukan tiga awak pesawat terdiri dari pilot, co-pilot, dan loadmaster, sedangkan jenis pesawat yang kedua ialah generasi baru dengan empat mesin turboprops Airbus A400M.</p>
<p>C-295M merupakan pengembangan CN-235M dengan menambah dua segmen panjang badan pesawat dan mengganti mesin dengan yang bertenaga lebih besar. C-27J pada dasarnya adalah Aeritalia (FIAT) G.222 yang diganti mesin dengan Roll Royce AE.2100D3 bertenaga 4.640 shp, yaitu mesin sejenis yang digunakan oleh C-130J. CN-235-220/300M berdaya angkut lima ton atau satu ton lebih besar dibanding pendahulunya CN-235-110. Kapasitas angkut Pasukan Para CN-235-220/300M ialah 34 orang, C-27J 40 orang, C-295M 50 orang, dan C-130J 125 orang.</p>
<p>Bursa pesawat</p>
<p>Kebutuhan dunia akan pesawat angkut militer sampai tahun 2010 ialah 1.194 pesawat bersayap tetap, sedangkan 53 negara Eropa memerlukan 515 pesawat. Namun demikian, munculnya usaha patungan dalam program pesawat angkut strategis Airbus A400M yang berdaya angkut lebih besar akan mengurangi jumlah kebutuhan pesawat bersayap tetap untuk Eropa antara 288 sampai 180 pesawat. Demikian analisis Anthony Tucker-Jones yang ditulis dalam AirForce Monthly bulan Juni 2002.</p>
<p>Bersumber pada majalah itu, Taiwan memerlukan 12-18 pesawat dan Australia 18-22 pesawat. Baik Taiwan maupun Australia memiliki pilihan yang sama, yaitu antara CN-235-300M, C-295M, atau C-27J. Kroasia, negara di semenanjung Balkan telah memesan lima CN-235M dari Turki. Finlandia akan mengganti pesawat Fokker F27-400M Friendship dengan tiga C-295M atau ATR-72, sedangkan Swiss akan menambah armada angkut taktisnya dengan dua C-295M sampai tahun 2003. Republik Cheko memerlukan enam pesawat angkut taktis untuk mengganti Antonov An-24/26. Rusia menawarkan tiga pesawat An-70 sebagai pembayaran utangnya. AU Spanyol menjadi pemesan pertama C-295M. Sembilan pesawat secara bertahap akan diterima sampai akhir 2004.</p>
<p>AU Italia juga menjadi pemesan pertama pesawat C-27J. Sampai akhir tahun 2004, sebanyak 12 C-27J akan diserahkan di Turin. Spanyol berminat membeli 27 Airbus A400M, sedangkan Italia memilih menambah 12 C-130J dan enam KC-130J. Denmark memesan empat C-130J. Yunani menunjukkan minatnya untuk membeli enam C-27J ditambah lima pesawat angkut taktis jenis lain. An-32 juga menjadi salah satu pilihannya. Di Afrika, Nigeria memerlukan 20 CN-235M. Pembayaran akan dilakukan dengan barter minyak bumi.</p>
<p>PTDI saat ini baru bisa menyelesaikan produksi pesawat CN-235 yang ke 51/Foto: Hendro Subroto</p>
<p>Sementara itu, AU Zambia sedang melakukan negosiasi pembelian empat CN-235M untuk mengganti DHC-5D Buffalo yang telah memasuki masa pensiun. Afrika Selatan akan membeli 30 pesawat angkut taktis untuk mengganti Cessna Caravan dan C-47 Dakota. Diperkirakan C-212-400M Aviocar akan menjadi pilihannya. Di Amerika Latin, Brazil membutuhkan 20 pesawat angkut taktis untuk mengganti DHC-5D. Pilihan Brazil ialah C-130J atau C-295M. Chili merupakan pemakai pesawat produksi CASA, seperti C-212-100/300 dan CN-235-300M. CASA berharap Chili membeli C-295M. Di Timur Tengah, Arab Saudi dan Kuwait masing-masing ingin membeli 70 dan empat C-130J.</p>
<p>Dalam upaya meremajakan pesawat Hercules model lama, Israel ingin membeli 22 pesawat angkut baru. Lockheed Martin menawarkan 12 C-130J dan 10 C-27J dengan harga satu miliar dollar. Uni Emirat Arab pemakai enam CN-235M produksi PTDI telah membeli empat C-295 MPA/ASW seharga 140 juta dollar AS. Dalam bersaing dengan CASA C-295M, Alenia/Lockheed Martin menurunkan harga C-27J sebesar 30 persen. Enam dari delapan CN-235-220M pesanan AU Korea Selatan secara berturut-turut telah diserahkan PTDI, Desember 2001, Februari, dan April tahun ini. Dua CN-235-220M yang diubah menjadi CN-235-220 VVIP dan VIP sesuai perubahan kontrak pada Februari lalu, akan diserahkan pada November tahun ini. Empat CN-235-220M pesanan AU Pakistan kepada PTDI akan diserahkan tahun depan.</p>
<p>CASA-IPTN</p>
<p>CN-235 sebagai commuterliner berkapasitas 34-38 tempat duduk dan sebagai pesawat serbaguna, diluncurkan dalam Paris Air Show 1981. Pesawat ini dikembangkan dan diproduksi oleh CASA-IPTN (Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara, sekarang PTDI) atas dasar 50-50. CASA membuat kerangka depan dan sayap tengah, sedangkan IPTN membuat kerangka belakang, panil sayap luar, dan permukaan ekor. Berdasarkan hasil studi pasar CASA-IPTN, kebutuhan dunia akan pesawat komersial kategori CN-235 tahun 1984-1994 sebanyak 1.800 pesawat. CASA-IPTN berharap dapat memperoleh 20 persen dari jumlah itu, atau 360 pesawat.</p>
<p>Selain itu, kebutuhan dunia akan pesawat angkut militer dalam kategori CN-235 sebanyak 600 pesawat, sedangkan CASA-IPTN memperkirakan akan dapat menjual 240 pesawat versi militernya. Jadi, seluruh target penjualan CN-235 ialah 600 pesawat. Di pasaran internasional, CASA-IPTN paling sedikit harus bersaing dengan tujuh industri pesawat terkemuka yang memproduksi pesawat Short-360, EMB-120 Embraer, atau ATR-42.</p>
<p>Tampaknya target pemasaran itu tidak dapat dicapai. Pesawat CN-235-220 VIP dan VVIP produksi PTDI yang akan diserahkan kepada AU Korea Selatan November mendatang baru merupakan CN-235 produksi PTDI ke-50 dan ke-51. CASA juga tidak dapat mencapai target, sehingga mengembangkan CN-235 menjadi -295 untuk merebut pasaran. Ternyata C-295M laku keras di pasaran. Menurut Eddy Gunawan, Wakil Presiden CN-235 PTDI, sekarang CASA sudah tidak memproduksi CN-235 lagi. Hal itu dapat dilihat bahwa CASA sudah tidak memesan lagi kerangka belakang dan bagian lain yang menurut kesepakatan dibuat PTDI. Ia menambahkan, "Kemungkinan produksi CN-235 akan diserahkan sepenuhnya kepada PTDI." Jika demikian halnya, peluang pasar CN-235-220M yang masih feasible di pasaran internasional akan semakin terbuka bagi PTDI</p>

XMLNuke is a Content Management System designed for Internet web sites. It manages all web site information through the use of XML documents. These documents, stored in its native text format, are then changed by XSL instructions and presented to the user who will be able to view the information in any web browser. A single XML document can assume any presentation or design defined by a XSL document.</p>
<p>XMLNuke does not require the installation of a database application to work correctly. You only need the XMLNuke main engine and a HTTP service installed in order to run a fully functional service. This feature drastically reduces the resources necessary to install and setup your web server. XMLNuke also implements further functionality such as two cache levels that improve performance in document processing.</p>
<p>XMLNuke produces and use XML documents. A XML document is totally independent of technology or platform and design presentation.</p>
<p>XMLNuke is a Development Framework for developing WEB applications.</p>
<p>Besides the storing, processing and presentation of content for web sites, XMLNuke offers strong development support that process and generate XML documents, documents ready to use by the XMLNuke engine. Application developers basically process the information and return only XML documents. These documents are free of design constraints and can then be transformed by any XSL document defined in XMLNuke engine. Web site administrators are therefore free to change the web design without having to change one single line of code in the application developed by using the XMLNuke framework.</p>
<p>Developers do not formally create a XML document. They only need to use the set of XML abstraction classes buit into the XMLNuke framework. XMLNuke also implements a set of additional classes available for developers to use, over and above the functionality created for the main engine.</p>
<p>Using XMLNuke classes to develop a new application offers the programmer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cache for dynamic documents</li>
<li>Integrated single sign-on and security by role.</li>
<li>Internationalization support</li>
<li>Classes for storage and location of data in a XML document (AnyDataSet)</li>
<li>File system abstraction</li>
<li>XML document abstraction</li>
<li>Other functionalities.</li>
</ul>

<b>Buddi</b> is an <a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a> program, written by Wyatt Olson, which aids in the creation of a <a href="../../../p/e/r/Personal_budget.html" title="Personal budget">personal budget</a>. It allows users to set up accounts and budget categories, and record transactions. Users can also view reports and graphs, covering different time periods, showing how well the budget was kept, what sources money is coming from / going to, and how your net worth varies over time.</p>
<p>Buddi is written in Java, and thus can be run on most major operating systems; you must have Java 1.5 or above to run it. Buddi is currently translated into English and German, and there are plans for other languages in the near future.</p>

<p>Blackheath Common is an area of 250 acres of heathland in England, UK, near the village of Albury, in the Waverly borough. It is often confused with Blackheath Common, London. It is a designated <a href="../../../a/r/e/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty_32ed.html" title="Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty">Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> under British law, and is frequented by many walkers and cyclists. The common is currently being examined for use as a possible oil and gas field. A local campaign is in action against this.</p>

<p>An animation and special effects production company, located in San Francisco, CA, in business from 1976 to 1999. Founded by young Bay Area filmmakers Drew Takahashi and Gary Gutierrez, the studio developed a reputation for eclectic art direction and experimental production techniques. The latter includes some early 1980's computer-generated imagery (CGI) but Colossal directors never limited themselves to any one technology, often preferring to mix design and production methodologies in a style they called "Blendo." The company made a lot of animated TV commercials, as well as special effects for movies like "The Right Stuff" and "Top Gun," but was perhaps most widely known for a show called "Liquid Television." This aired in 1991 on MTV, and was a "short-attention span anthology" of odd-ball personal films and mini-series that premiered unusual animated characters like Aeon Flux and Beavis and Butt-head.</p>

<p>For Long RuneScape has been a leading MMORPG in the world of gaming. For the past year or so people have found a way to crack the runescape client (the program that connects to the game server). These versions of the game are not exactly like runescape but are identical in many ways. They share the exact same game engine and map. They also share the same NPCs (Non-Player Characters e.g. Goblins and Demons) and Objects. The only difference the server-side things such as what happens when you click a certain button. Some examples of this is that on a base private server you will not have quests and so forth. You will also not have registering accounts through the internet. To create an account on a private server you must type in the username and passwords in the appropriate boxes in the modified client. This client can be obtained at <a href="http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html" class="external free" title="http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.moparisthebest.com/moparscape.html</a>. Servers are connected to through ip addresses. The first person to discover servers and edited the client goes by the name WinterLove. The First public server ever was Blakescape. The best servers of all time are WhiteScape, Testscape, Hybridscape and Avatar. Those servers got the closest to being like RuneScape by making quests, full magic, full of all statistics. The owner of those servers were WhiteFang, Nvi ible, Miss Silabsoft and Phate. Whitescape 3.2 was one of the major revoloutions in private servers. Since it was the first server to have working shops. The server was coded by WhiteFang, Xerozcheez, Kevin and Tasty noob.</p>
<p>Hybridscape was one of the best releases to evolve private servers since it features never before seen uodates such as server console. However the server that took the people's hearts is called cheezscape made by xerozcheez. Cheezscape has had 4 releases: Cheezscape update 63, Cheezscape update 78, Cheezscape 80, and Cheezscape u12.</p>
<p>Phate also known as StAnger was the owner of Avatorium and RuneStatus. Phate has released Avatar one of the most powerfullest Private servers today.</p>
<p>KAITNEIKS:</p>
<p>Kaitneiks was one of the most dominate forums on Runescape Private Servers. The website was called after its owner Kaitneik. The forum also featured alot of runescape exploits and cheating. The forum has released its own language called SCAR by xx jut xx a admin on of Kaitneiks. Kaineiks had alot of expert coders. On February 2006 Kaineiks was shutdown by Jelsoft the owners of vBulletin for having a cracked satellite skin.</p>
<p>Moparisthebest:</p>
<p>This forum is not known much as a community it is merly known as a place where coders go to post their codes/tutorials for other people to benifit from. It is owned by Moparisthebest. Legendary coders such as Miss Silabsoft, Frank_, RegeX and Tasty noob are still there.</p>
<p>Rs-Server:</p>
<p>This forum was known for its wars against Avatarorim, RuneStatus and Rage-zone. This forum was nearly a rebirth of Kaitneiks. Many veteran coders came there people such as MrWicked, Miss Silabsoft, Xerozcheez, Wolf, Santa Clause, Tasty noob, Ramenryoko, Drunkenolma, Gander, rsrules, rat dawg, swift, kevina dn many more are from. In January 2007 rs-server got split up since Kevin got greedy and banned the Owner of rs-server (Gander) and screwed him over, all the veteran coders left since gander got banned and the site had been getting hacked by Gander and Xerozcheez ever since the. Rs-server went independent and re-named itself Rune-Server. And Gander made his own new site called RuneSoft these two sites have been rivals ever since.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-06-21_abef.html" title="Edit section: Freehold Theatre">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Freehold Theatre</span></h2>
<p>Freehold Theatre is major force in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, producing cutting edge drama, training future and current actors and providing studio space for up and coming productions.</p>
<p>Freehold works with the community and has gained much support from former and current students.</p>
<p><b>How Freehold Evolved</b></p>
<p>In the summer of 1991, the Pasqualini-Smith Studio (est. 1986) and the Mark Jenkins Actors' Workshop (est. 1985), combined to form Freehold, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) corporation. The founders, Robin Lynn Smith, Mark Jenkins and George Lewis, among others, are professional actors and trustees whose credentials include recognized work On and Off-Broadway, as well as in major films, television, and regional theatre. In its nearly 15 years, Freehold Studio/Theatre Lab has become an integral part of Seattle's thriving theatre community, having gained a reputation as the place for serious young artists to train and take the leap into performing and creating original work.</p>
<p>Located on Seattle's Capitol Hill, Freehold annually serves more than 10,000 students, artists, and audience members with its classes, performances, workshops, and guest artist programs.</p>
<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Freehold engages artists of all levels in training and experimentation so that they may become more innovative and heartfelt in generating theatre that has a lasting impact on the community we serve.</p>
<p><b>Our Vision</b></p>
<p>We at Freehold believe theatre should inspire people to embrace the full range of human experience and connect us all more deeply to ourselves and to each other. In order for theatre to accompish this, it must be truthful, illuminate the unseen, and articulate the unspoken.</p>
<p>To realize this potential, there must be a place dedicated to research and experimentation in training and performance for working artists, inspired novices, and willing audiences.</p>
<p><b>Our Philosophy on Teaching</b></p>
<p>The work we do here strives to integrate organic, truthful roots and an empathic connection to the life around you with extraordinary expression â physically, vocally, and imagistically. There has long been the conflict (supposedly) between inside out and outside in â as though one must choose one over the other. We believe that you must develop both. That work can originate from a clear, extreme form; but must then be rooted in organic truth, or filled. Or that work can originate in the organic, inner truth; but then it must weave out into specific, clear, extraordinary expression. Inner life does not mean vague, self-indulgent emotionality; nor does outer form mean empty technical execution. Form and content must both be developed for any given performance and then integrated â a tall order.</p>
<p>The training for such work is focused on developing in each artist an open heart, a sense of astonishment, an expanded imagination, a rigorous sense of truth, a resonant and expressive voice and body, compassion, and the intention to serve the community and the larger mission of the Theatre and the play, and not self-glorification. It is in the integration of these several aptitudes that one's contribution is realized. It takes dedication, determination, humor, insight, and guts to keep working toward an end that will never be all the way there â and to have faith that you are contributing to an Art where "Everything eternal triumphs here and all that is usual melts away."</p>
<p><b>What We Do</b></p>
<p>Freehold realizes its vision by integrating the following areas of programming within its Studio and Theatre Lab:</p>
<p>Individual Class Offerings provide training opportunities to artists of all levels â from working professionals to inspired novices. The Vocational Training Program prepares emerging theatre artists to work professionally.</p>
<p>Special Concentrations and Intensives offer students specially focused training opportunities with internationally renowned master artists.</p>
<p>Theatre Lab, the research and development arm at Freehold, provides a forum for both the development of new performance material and the rediscovery of classics.</p>
<p>Rehearsal and Performance Space at Freehold is made available to independent producers at below-market rates.</p>
<p>Freehold supports the development of artists of any race, gender, sexual orientation, or ethnic origin through its Studio and Theatre Lab.</p>
