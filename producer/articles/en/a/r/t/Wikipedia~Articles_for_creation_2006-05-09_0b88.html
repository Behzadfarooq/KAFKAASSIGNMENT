<p>Albert Konstantinovich Chernenko (a sort. In 1935) the Russian philosopher, Doctor of Philosophy, the professor, the known expert in the field of philosophy of history, legal philosophy and social philosophy. During the Soviet period of creativity Albert Chernenko has created the theory of " historical causality " in which on the basis of application of dialectic-materialistic methodology multilevel character of relationships of cause and effect proves in historical process that was at that time essential step in development of the Soviet methodology of history in a context of understanding of historical events [Causality in history, 1983]. Causality in history has three levels of "self-development" during knowledge: "general" (a way of manufacture of a concrete formation), "especial" (historical conditions), "individual" (actions of historic figures). Cand.. diss. " Features of causality in history and dialectics of its research " [, 1971], Doctoral. Diss.. " Socially-philosophical problems of the theory of historical causality " [, 1985] In first half 90th year ов it develops and proves the theory of " legal technology " in which the methodology of " social engineering " (K.Popper, etc.) is used For designing social processes and reforming of a social system. The purpose of legal technology creation of rational and effective legal system in view of the multilevel nature of causality and system-substantial understanding of the right. In this sense as the social phenomenon has the right not only external (the social environment), but also internal potential of inconsistent "self-development", that allows to consider the legal phenomena in a context sociocultural determinations (at a macrolevel) and self-determinations (microlevel). The basic works of this period: (Legal philosophy, 1997), (Alternatives of economic and legal development, 2002), (the Target component and axiological character of legal technology, 2003),(Theoretical and methodological problems of the legal system forming,2004)</p>

<p>Bhongir is famous for its fort.</p>
<p>Bhongir fort was built on an isolated rock by the western Chalukya ruler Tribhuvanamalla Vikramaditya VI and was thus named after him as Tribhuvanagiri. This name gradually became Bhuvanagiri and subsequently Bhongir. At the foot of the fortified rocks 609.6 meters above the sea level stands the town of Bhongir,it has a unique egg-shaped construction with two entry points protected by huge rocks, so the fort was considered practically impregnable by invading armies. The splendid historical fort with the awe-inspiring rock and the aesthetically fortified courts which have stood the ravages of time stir the imagination of the tourists.A moat that encircles the fort, a vast underground chamber, trap doors, an armoury, stables, ponds, wells etc., make for fascinating viewing. The view from top of the surrounding countryside is simply breathtaking. The Bala Hisar or citadel on the top of the hill gives a bird's eye view of the neighbouring area. The fort is associated with the herioc queen Rudramadevi and her grandson Prataparudra's rule. <a name="Sources_7" id="Sources_7"></a></p>

<p>Kritsa is one of the oldest and most beautiful villages in Crete, built amphitheatrically on a rock hill, named Kastellos, surrounded by olive groves, at an altitude of 375m. During the Middle Ages was thought to be the largest village in Crete. Kritsa has been destroyed many times during the last centuries because it participated in all of Crete's revolutions. It is located 10 km from Agios Nikolaos and has about 2200 inhabitants, which live in different neighborhoods named Palemilos, Koukistres, Christos and Pergiolikia. When Kritsa is lit up in the evening it has the form of a scorpion. In Kritsa people keep the old Cretan customs and the traditions and is considered one of the most important centers of weaving art. You can walk through the narrow streets and buy souvenirs from tourist shops.</p>

<p>Region rock is a subgenre of punk music originating from the southeast United States. It is generally melodic and energetic, often with more personal rather than political lyrics than other punk subgenres. Most, if not all, region rock bands, record labels, and music venues are diy and non-profit. Some prominent cities for this style include Miami, Pensacola, and Gainesville in Florida, Athens, GA, Chattanooga, TN, Cleveland, MS, and Asheville, NC. Most of the bands play mainly in their town or nearby towns in the region, mostly in houses, basements, and small bars or coffee shops, and therefore may not be well known outside of their own town despite being local favorites. Some bands that have received more widespread recognition include the Stun Guns, Sexy, Hickey, ADD/C, Jack Palance Band, Queer Wulf, and Allergic to Bullshit. Many of the region rock bands put out 7" records on Chattanooga's This here Records, which is now being joined by the more recently established Plan-It-X South record label and Onion Flavored Records.</p>

<p>'NO ORDINARY TIME' 'Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II' by DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, author of 'THE FITZGERALDS AND THE KENNEDYS'. In Goodwin's book, 'NO ORDINARY TIME', pg. 150 informs about the importance of the military mission of the American Legion ship.</p>
<p>It was a very secret mission arranged by President Roosevelt and the Department Of War. Pg.150 "These carefree days seemed far removed in August 1940, when Martha and her children joined eight hundred American refugees aboard the Army transport ship the AMERICAN LEGION for the perilous voyage to the United States. Troubled by rumors of a NAZI plan to kidnap the princess and her son, the ship was forced to take a circuitous route from the Arctic port of Petsamo, Finlan, down the Norweigan coast, through the mined waters of the North Atlantic into New York. When the ship landed safely, Martha spoke to the press, denouncing Hitler in "brave words" that impressed Eleanor. From the desk in New York, the princess journeyed to Hyde Park, accompanied by her children, her lady-in-waiting, the court chamberlain, and a retinue of servants."</p>
<p>pg. 150. "Martha's birth, in Stockholm, had occasioned a twenty-one gun salue in both Norway and Sweden to mark the arrivale of the granddaughter of OSCAR II, Kin of the combined union of Norway and Sweden. By the time Martha grew up, Norway and Sweden had ended their union, but the blood ties between the dynasties of the two countries remained strong. Martha's father was a Swedish prince, the younger br9other of the Swedish King Gustav V. Her mother was a Danish princess, the younger sister of the norwegian King Haakon VII. Martha was only a child when she met her first cousin and future husband, Prince Olva. As the only son of King Haakon, Olav was Norway's adored "little prince."</p>
<p>"The royal family's reign had been brought to an abrupt end when the Nazis invaded Norway in early April 1940. For two months, the king and the members of the Parliament had bravely resistedn German demands for surrender, moving deeper and deeper into the north woods to avoid capture. "I cannot accept the German demands,: Haakon told his nation as the infuriated Gemrans tried to kill him. "It would conflict with all that I have considered to be my duty as King of Norway....." When advancing German troops made it impossible for Haakon to hold out any longer, he and his son fled to London, to set-up a government in exilte, while Princess Martha concerned about the safety of her children, accepted an offer of asylum from President Roosevelt."</p>
<p>In my own on-line research, accessing information regarding the history of military ships, the American Legion ship was also apparently secretly transporting a prototype design of a gunmount designed in Sweden -- which prototype proved very instrumental in the Allies winning the war against the German U-boats.</p>
<p>Likely, if the American Legion had been sunk by German U-boats, America would have been drawn into the war much earlier; which was a looming war that President Roosevelt had been discussing as likely necessary, in his attempts to persuade Americans to end their "isolationism", as he called it.</p>
<p>With a ship christened the powerful name-imagery of 'American Legion', and carrying EIGHT HUNDRED American refugees, and members of the royal family or Norway, and if it had come under attack, and if it had been sunk by German U-boats, one would assume that that extremely emotional event would have proved pivotal in convincing Americans of the need to enter WW-II ....before Pearl Harbor?</p>
<p>It is still largely unknown that the American Legion had been under a dual mission, not only involving American lives and lives of several Norwegians of the royal family, but also was transporting a military asset designed in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Germans would likely have been very interested to know the whereabouts of the American Legion on the high-seas, since they were in hot pursuit of the royal family members of Norway. No doubt, the fact that the American Legion was also carrying a prototype machine implement for war uses would be considered most important by Germans.</p>
<p>Had anyone been given orders to provide/signal/Morse-code the American Legion's ship's coordinants/location while on the high-seas, is a question not yet resolved, though there were definite repercussions once the ship returned to New York. "Saving" the Queen", or rather saving the life of Princess Martha of Norway and her children, may not have been the most expedient pursuit of militarists; though no doubt the prototype machinery implement was considered equally classified in that very secret mission.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's speeches had become more alarming in his warnings of the need for America to consider joining the Allies in WW-II. The first Pearl Harbor attack convinced Americans of the need to begin preparing for war, and joining the Allies.</p>
<p>Pg. 295 PEARL HARBOR ATTACK AND PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: "Historians have focused substantial time and attention trying to determine who knew what and when bfore the Seventh of December, 1941, on the theory that ROOSEVELT WAS AWARE of the JAPANESE PLANS TO ATTACK PEARL HARBOR, but deliberatley concealed his knowledge from the commanders in Hawaii in order to BRIN THE UNITED STATES INTO HOSTILITIES through the back door. Unable to swing Congress and the public toward a declaration of war against Germany, critics contend, the president provoked Japan into firing the first shot and then watched with delight as the attack created a united America."</p>
<p>Commentary: Sometimes history is not as it may seem. If an imminent or possible or potential attack against the United States is or was not fully considered by the Department of War, of President Roosevelt and his staff, then there would be no need for concerns to set an entire fleet like sitting ducks inside a harbor.</p>
<p>Who could know to what extent might be "invited" or contrived to create a 'false flag' event or attack, as in a 'Northwoods' consideration by the military and or militarists, even within the Department of Defense? As long as no questions are asked, people are satisfied.</p>
<p>It was announced by Major Media and newscasters and political researchers following the 9/11 attacks in New York, that this was similar to Pearl Harbor, or that it was America's "second Pearl Harbor", though most Americans no very little about the first one! A "second Pearl Harbor" must beg questions about the first one.</p>
<p>Researchers may wish to Google 'Northwoods' and appreciate that such conjectures are not wild speculation here. Steven B. Ford207.200.116.72 17:05, 6 May 2006 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud (1956- ), President of Iran (2005- ). Ahmadinejad was born Mahmoud Saborjhian in the town of Aradan, to the south-east of Tehran. Soon after, his father moved the family to Tehran and set himself up as a blacksmith. He also changed the family name to Ahmadinejad. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad entered the University of Science and Technology in 1975, where he studied civil engineering. During his years at the university he became involved with the Islamist opposition to the regime of the Shah. After the Islamic Revolution of 1979 he was one of the founders of the Islamic Students’ Association at the university, and later was a leading figure in the Office for Strengthening Unity (OSU), a student organization established to create links between universities and seminaries, and close to Iran’s clerical leadership. Ahmadinejad was on the central council of the OSU when it was planning the takeover of the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979 (though he denies any personal involvement), and later helped to enforce the stringent Islamist policies of Ayatollah Khomeini in the universities.</p>
<p>Around 1980 Ahmadinejad joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, a militia loyal to Khomeini, and worked in its internal security department. During the Iran-Iraq War he served in the Special Brigade of the Revolutionary Guard in the province of Kermanshah (now Bākhtāran), in western Iran, and he is believed to have participated in secret operations in Iraq, and perhaps elsewhere. At the same time he continued his studies in Tehran, and received his doctorate in transport planning in 1987.</p>
<p>During the early 1990s Ahmadinejad served in a series of posts in regional government and as an adviser to the minister of Islamic culture and guidance, Ali Larijani, a close ally of the conservative supreme leader Ayatollah Khaman’i. In 1993, Ahmadinejad was appointed as governor of the newly created province of Ardabīl. With the election of the reform-minded Ali Khatami as president of Iran in 1997, Ahmadinejad returned to academic life as a teacher at the University of Science and Technology. He became associated with groups opposed to the liberalizing policies of Khatami’s government and linked to Ayatollah Khaman’i. These connections helped him to become mayor of Tehran, a job to which he was appointed in April 2003. As mayor, Ahmadinejad followed a conservative Islamist line with regard to such issues as the dress code and relations between the sexes, and also set about trying to sort out Tehran’s notorious traffic problems.</p>
<p>During the 2005 presidential election campaign, Ahmadinejad was not initially the leading conservative candidate—his former boss Ali Larijani was a more high-profile figure. However his support among the Revolutionary Guard and the associated Basij militia, his unostentatious campaign and modest demeanour, and the backing of Khaman’i propelled him into a second round run-off against the former president Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani. His promise to fight corruption and his nationalistic rhetoric, particularly with regard to Iran’s controversial nuclear programme, helped him to secure victory over Rafsanjani. Ahmadinejad took office at the beginning of August.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the submarine chaser remained in the <a href="../../../p/a/c/Pacific_Ocean_bdb7.html" title="Pacific Ocean">western Pacific</a> more than a year. For about a month following her arrival, she performed <a href="../../../p/a/t/Patrol.html" title="Patrol">patrol</a> and <a href="../../../e/s/c/Escort.html" title="Escort">escort</a> duty in the Marshalls and the <a href="../../../c/a/r/Caroline_Islands_7bfc.html" title="Caroline Islands">Carolines</a>.

She then returned to Midway and resumed duty as search and rescue vessel. On 15 November, <i>PCS-1399</i> relieved her at Midway; and <i>PC-1145</i> returned to Pearl Harbor for a restricted availability.</p>

<p>Doggie Adventure is the world's first video made to entertain the family dog. Shot in 1989 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the 24 minute VHS video was produced and directed by Harley Toberman. The movie was shot using the steadicam camera mount to give the movie a "dogs point of view" taken about 2 feet above the ground. It was reviewed in Tme, Newsweek, CNN and appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world. It has been recently released on DVD.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p>Joe Dunn is the State Senator from the 34th senate district. The district includes parts of Santa Ana, Anaheim, and Garden Grove. He was a trial lawyer who practiced product liability cases. He was first elected in 1998. He not only ran against an incumbent, but he ran against the Senate minority leader. But with a persistent campaign he was able to defeat his opponent. Four years later he was able to easily win reelection.</p>
<p>In the Senate Dunn has maintained an impeccable legislative record. He has earned a 100% voting record on choice, environment, LGBT and labor issues. He has won legislator of the year awards from veterans, firefighters, physicians, attorneys, and environmentalists. He has also introduced a bill to require that bullets made or sold in California be sold with identification so that they can be traced. This would allow law enforcement agencies to easily trace bullets used in crimes and discover who bought the bullets, thus solving crimes.</p>
<p>Dunn has also investigated the California National Guard for illegally spying on anti war protestors. This domestic spying is outside of the National Guards purview, as well as being illegal. Dunn has also found evidence that evidence has been destroyed in this investigation.</p>
<p>While in the Senate Dunn has investigated the energy manipulation which lead to the energy crisis in California a few years ago. The power crisis caused several rolling blackouts in California in 2001. Enron did this by withholding energy in order to drive up the demand, thus artificially increasing the prices. Experts believe that this may have resulted in Enron overcharging the state by as much as $25 billion to 30 billion. The crisis also cost the state a great deal of money, only a fraction of which the company will be able to pay back after filing for bankruptcy. Dunn has described Enron as being, "the biggest and most culpable in the entire energy crisis." This investigation led to the downfall of Enron as well as dozen of indictments against Enron’s former executives. Dunn’s investigation led to the discovery of the infamous, “death star memo,” which detailed some of the devious schemes used by Enron to manipulate the market and maximize profits. It is because of his investigation that California Lawyer Magazine has dubbed him, “The Man Who Cracked Enron.” Joe Dunn was also featured on the Academy Award nominated documentary, “The Smartest Guys in the Room.” Although only twenty two seconds of his four hour interview made into the film, he was able to explain the role that Enron played in California’s energy crisis and how the plan to deregulate the energy sector was faulty.</p>
<p>Now he is running for State Controller. The controller acts as the chief financial officer of the state. This includes the authority to have audits on state programs thus ensuring that they are being efficient. <a name="Sources_36" id="Sources_36"></a></p>

<p>Little is known of the history of Xandel Carivus, yet this man would become the temporary ruler of the Galactic Empire. With the death of Carnor Jax, the Imperial Interim Ruling Council took temporary control of the Empire, headed initially by Burr Nolyds, and consisting of mostly human warlords and even an unorthodox mix of alien leaders. Xandel Carivus was a lesser member of this council, never giving any political input on own. This changed when Carivus met a mysterious being known only as Nom Anor. Nom Anor's plots lead to the death of Burr Nolyds and other members of the Ruling Council. This caused the members of the council to choose a figurehead leader, and, just as Nom Anor planned, they choose the fat slob, Xandel Carivus. Thus began Carivus's disastrous rule of the Galactic Empire. His fall began with the assassination of one of his supporters, an assasination not planned by Nom Anor. When Nom Anor expressed no concern over the threat to Carivus's life, Carivus's response was to arrest all non-human members of the Council, and the biggest political threat to his rule, Feena D'asta. When even the humans on the Council began to turn against him, he began to lose his mind, leading to him disbanding the Ruling Council, and declaring himself the sole ruler and Emperor of the Empire. His reign is short lived, however. Baron D'asta, father of Feena D'asta and commander of a large fleet of Imperial ships, turns on Carivus for the imprisonment of his daughter. He refuses a deal with D'asta, and the Empire is is forced to fight on multiple fronts against countless enemies. Xandel Carivus's catastrophic rule came to an end when his palace was raided by Baron D'asta, New Republic agents, and Kir Kanos himself. Nom Anor has abandoned him, and the few guards left under his command did little to protect him. Kir Kanos, a rogue Imperial Guard who saw Carivus as partially responsible for the death of his master, Emperor Palpatine, dealt the final blow himself.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>: Yuuko Ichihara (壱原侑子 Ichihara Yūko), employer of the series' protagonist Watanuki Kimihiro (四月一日君尋 Watanuki Kimihiro) recieves an invitation to a mysterious auction at a reclusive countryside manor. She, Watanuki, and Watanuki's "rival" Dōmeki Shizuka find upon arriving that the other guests are fanatical collectors of odd objects. The mystery deepens as the mansions owner fails to appear despite the guests arrival, and the collectors begin to dissapear through odd events at night within the manor. As Watanuki recieves mysterious messages via paper slips and explores the depths of the manor, it becomes clear that there is something decidedly sinister afoot.</p>

<p>In the sport snooker, century break refers to scoring 100 points without missing a shot. The player does this by potting red balls and coloured balls alternately.</p>
<p>Scoring 100 points over the course of a whole frame is not a century. It must be done during one break (turn at the table). Points for a foul shot by the opponent do not count in the player's break.</p>
<p>The highest possible century in snooker is 147, composed of 15 reds, 15 blacks and the six remaining colours; yellow, green, brown, blue, pink and black.</p>
<p>Under exceptional circumstances, it is possible to score a break of 155. if a player comes to the table after a foul shot by the opponent and he is unable to hit both sides of any red ball, he may nominate one of the colours as a red. Under these circumstances, it is possible to pot 16 reds and blacks, plus 27 points for the six remaining colours, totalling 155 points.</p>
<p>To score a century, there must be at least ten reds on the table when the player comes to play. If there are nine red, then he can only score 99 (9x8 + 27 = 99)</p>
<p>The seven-time World Champion Stephen Hendry holds the record for century breaks in tournament play. He has made over 700 in tournament play.</p>
<p>The quickest recorded century break in tournament play was by Tony Drago. In the 1996 UK Championship, he took just 3 minutes 31 seconds (241 seconds) to score a hundred.</p>
<p>The youngest player to score a professional century break was Judd Trump at 14 years 206 days old.</p>

<p>The unique science of profiling how the voters will cast their votes in an election. It is believed to be used in an Asian country.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.deluxecoffeeclub.com" class="external text" title="http://www.deluxecoffeeclub.com" rel="nofollow">www.deluxecoffeeclub.com</a></p>
<p>While voting is secret in that country, it is possible to increase the chances of winning an election if Electorate Engineering tactics are used, especially by a ruling party that controls the Election Department. In Singapore, the Elections Department is probably the only one in the world that reports directly to the Prime Minister Office. It is well known that during several elections, the electoral boundaries kept changing to the advantage of the ruling party headed by the People's Action Party (or PAP in short).</p>
<p>There is no need to tamper with the votes if you are just armed with the data analyzed from the voting patterns over several elections, a pretty good profiling report can be achieved.</p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>When voters in this and previous elections voted, they were guided into specific lanes and tables where our names are listed on the electorate registry. This specific lane and table that they are in, will have to cast their votes into a specific box for that lane and table. From that box, the data could be used to determine how many votes go to ruling party and the Oppositions, less the spoilt votes.</p>
<p>With that statistics, they can compare it with the voters group whose ballot paper were in that box.</p>
<p>The category factors they have already from other sources may includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sex</li>
<li>Age group</li>
<li>Language</li>

<p>Be adjusting and redrawing the boundaries for each election, they can safely guessed or assured themselves of the percentage that the ruling party supporters, and of course, diminishing the Opposition supporters as well.</p>

<p>An impact player is a specialist role in team sports. Impact Players are typically players in a sport that have a certain skill (ie Speed, Power) but cannot maintain their game play for prolonged periods. In American Football, Verron Haynes is a good example of an impact player- he is typically bought on for 3rd down situations. An example of an impact player in Australian Rules Football is Peter Riccardi of the Geelong Football Club who is able to supply a physical presence in the forward line and return to the bench when needed.</p>

<p>The Moulin Rouge opened on May 24, 1955, and was the first integrated hotel/casino in <a href="../../../l/a/s/Las_Vegas_bf20.html" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> if not the nation. Until that time most all strip-casinos were totally <a href="../../../s/e/g/Segregated.html" title="Segregated">segregated</a>, off-limits to blacks unless they were the entertainment or low-paying labor. On top of this, discrimination helped to hem the black population into living on the "west side" of town:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the North by Washington Avenue;</li>
<li>In the South by Bonanza Avenue;</li>
<li>In the West by H Street;</li>
<li>In the East by A Street</li>
</ul>
<p>It was during this era that a caucasian man by the name of Will Max Schwartz saw the need for an integrated hotel. Will, along with other investors (including boxing-great <a href="../../../j/o/e/Joe_Lewis_282e.html" title="Joe Lewis">Joe Lewis</a>), built and opened the Moulin Rouge at <a href="http://maps.google.com/?ll=36.177791,-115.153896&amp;spn=0.002061,0.003659&amp;t=k&amp;om=0" class="external text" title="http://maps.google.com/?ll=36.177791,-115.153896&amp;spn=0.002061,0.003659&amp;t=k&amp;om=0" rel="nofollow">900 W. Bonanza Road.</a>. This placed it comfortably in a prime location between the predominately white area of the strip and the largely black west side. The complex itself was two stuccoed buildings that contained the hotel, casino, and a theater. The exterior had the hotel's name in stylized cursive writing, and murals depicting dancing and fancy cars.</p>
<p>When it opened, the Moulin Rouge was fully integrated top to bottom from employees to patrons to entertainers.</p>

<p>The popularity of the Moulin Rouge blew up almost overnight. The hotel made the <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/Life/covers/1955/cv062055.jpg" class="external text" title="http://img.timeinc.net/Life/covers/1955/cv062055.jpg" rel="nofollow">June 20th, 1955</a> cover of Life magazine, with a photo of two female <a href="../../../s/h/o/Showgirls.html" title="Showgirls">showgirls</a>. A veritable A-List of 50-60's era performers regularly showed to party until dawn. Great black singers and musicians such as <a href="../../../s/a/m/Sammy_Davis%2C_Jr._4834.html" title="Sammy Davis, Jr.">Sammy Davis, Jr.</a>, <a href="../../../n/a/t/Nat_King_Cole_7fef.html" title="Nat King Cole">Nat King Cole</a>, <a href="../../../p/e/a/Pearl_Bailey_40df.html" title="Pearl Bailey">Pearl Bailey</a>, and <a href="../../../l/o/u/Louis_Armstrong_a573.html" title="Louis Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a> would perform often. These men were banned from gambling or staying at the hotels on the strip. In addition, white performers including <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_Burns_7361.html" title="George Burns">George Burns</a>, <a href="../../../j/a/c/Jack_Benny_3ec2.html" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a>, and <a href="../../../f/r/a/Frank_Sinatra_d0f7.html" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> would drop in after their shows to gamble and perform.

<p>In November of 1955 the Moulin Rouge closed it's doors. Some say it was a victim of a casino oversaturation (the Moulin Rouge was one of 4 new hotels that ran into major financial issues that year). Some say it was poor management. The exact cause will probably never be known.</p>
<p>The short but brief life of the Moulin Rouge helped the civil-rights movement in Las Vegas. Many of those who enjoyed and were employed by the hotel became activists and supporters. The hotel was also the spark needed to bring an end to segregation on the strip.</p>
<p>Under threat of a protest down the Las Vegas Strip in March of 1960 against racial discrimination from Las Vegas casinos, a meeting was hurridly arranged by then-Govenor Grant Sawyer between hotel owners, city and state officials; local black leaders and then-NAACP president Dr. James McMillan. The meeting was held on March 26, 1960 at the closed Moulin Rouge, and lead to an agreement to desegregate all strip casinos.</p>
<p>The Moulin Rouge has been entered into the National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<p>Shuttered for decades, many plans had been hatched to rebuild and reopen the cultural landmark. However on May 29th, 2003 an fire ripped through the buildings, almost entirely gutting the complex. No witnesses have ever been found, no one has come forward with information leading to the cause of the fire, and to this day all that remains is the front visage with it's signature stylized name.</p>

Approached by a long wooded drive, Hedsor is forty minutes by car from London.</p>
<p>References to the Manor of <a href="../../../h/e/d/Hedsor.html" title="Hedsor">Hedsor</a> can be found from <a href="../../../1/1/6/1166.html" title="1166">1166</a> when the Estate was owned by the de Hedsor Family. In <a href="../../../1/5/8/1583.html" title="1583">1583</a> Rowland Hynd built a new Tudor Manor House at Hedsor which was badly damaged by fire in <a href="../../../1/7/9/1795.html" title="1795">1795</a> and eventually demolished in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1865.html" title="1865">1865</a>. At about this time the Architect James Knowles was commissioned by the fourth Lord Boston to design a new house at Hedsor. It was completed in <a href="../../../1/8/6/1868.html" title="1868">1868</a> and, unusually, modelled on the Italian Villa style but with a domed hallway rather than an open courtyard.</p>
<p>The parkland surrounding Hedsor House is described as a "nationally important Historic Park" in a Government Factfile.</p>

<p>Missee Lee</p>
<p>Missee Lee is the 10th book in Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of children's books. It was published in 1941.</p>
<p>This book is set on a trio on small islands close to the Chinese Mainland. This is one of the two more fantastic stories involving the Swallow and Amazons together with Captain Flint (the other is Peter Duck). It describes an exotic foreign adventure in the classic matter-of-fact Ransome style, and introduces one of the most unforgettable Ransome characters, Missee Lee, the young pirate queen with a hankering to return to her Classics studies at Cambridge.</p>
<p><br />
Spoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.</p>
<p>Plot Summary</p>
<p>The Swallows and Amazons are on a world cruise in the Wild Cat, and have just reached Shanghai. Leaving the port and sailing south down the coast of China, their ship is lost in a fire and they take to their dingies. The Amazons and Captain Flint are picked up by a Chinese pirate ship, while the Swallows land on the island base of the notorious Missee Lee, the daughter of the former pirate leader, who now rules the three pirate clans.</p>
<p>While the Amazons and Captain Flint are held for ransom, Missee Lee discovers that the Swallows know enough Latin for her to resume the studies she had to break off when her father died, and create a 'Cambridge University' in her own country. She purchases Flint and the Amazons, and sets up a Classics class. But the other clans are mutinous, and Missee Lee has broken her own rule of never holding British subjects (and especially not children of English naval officers, as the Swallows are).</p>
<p>Eventually, Missee Lee helps the Swallows and Amazons to escape, joining them to return to her beloved Cambridge. But in one of the most touching scenes in any of the Ransome books, on her realisation that war will break out amongst the clans on her departure, she returns to to the pirate island and her duty to her ancestors. The children and Captain Flint sail Missee Lee's junk back home to England.</p>

<p>MJ Rosenberg is the author of "IPF Friday," a weekly column on the Mideast distributed by e-mail to 25,000 subscribers. It is widely reprinted in the United States, Israel, and the Arab world, most notably in the Jerusalem Post, Beirut Daily Star, and Al Jazirah. It can be subscribed to (it's free) through www.israelpolicyforum.org.</p>
<p>IPF Friday is considered the most influential newsletter on Israeli-Palestinian issues. The line it takes is support for Israeli-Palestinian peace and the two-state solution. Rosenberg worked for AIPAC in the 1980's but after the Oslo agreement of 1993 broke with the AIPAC approach and became an active supporter of the two-state solution and of both Israeli and Palestinian rights. Previously he spent 17 years on Capitol Hill and five as as political appointee at the Clinton State Department.</p>
<p>In a recent column he wrote that "these days you cannot be pro-Israel without supporting the two-state solution i.e a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. Official pro-Israel spinners who engage in Palestinian bashing are working against Israel's long-term survival." Rosenberg also sends regular bulletins to Capitol Hill rebutting AIPAC's promotion of legislation designed to derail Israeli-Palestinian peace. MJ Rosenberg first came to the attention of the Jewish community when he authored "To Uncle Tom &amp; Other Such Jews" in the Village Voice 1969. A college junior, Rosenberg urged leftwing students not to "support every national lineration struggle but your own: Zionism." That article helped kick off the radical Zionist movement on US campuses. Rosenberg moved away from that position after Oslo. He continues to support Israel but believes, as he said in a recent article, that "if you are anti-Palestinian, you are also anti-Israel. The fates of these two peoples are linked together. The Jewish Right, which has no sympathy for Palestinians and would deny them their basic rights -- including a state -- are no friends of Israel. Fortunately those types tend to live in the United States rather than in Israel, although Israel has an extremist minority as dangerous to Israel's future as their colleagues in Brooklyn."</p>

Its first organized congregation is the Guthrie Memorial Adventist Chapel, located in Cumberland County, Virginia. The Hevener Adventist Church has believers internationally. It is a Christian denomination. Among its fundamental beliefs are: that one is saved through faith in Jesus Christ; that the the Ten Commandments are still binding (this belief includes the fourth commandment, which calls for the keeping of the seventh-day sabbath); that pastors should serve on a voluntary basis without salary, as did the early apostles; that the church should not accept tithe under the New Covenant, and that the believers' physical body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, and should, therefore, be kept pure and healthy-- consequently, a vegan lifestyle is encouraged. The Hevener Adventist Church is independent, not being affiliated with any other Christian denomination.</p>

<p>John W. Hetrick of Newport, PA was the original inventor of the airbag we have become accustomed to as a common safety device in our cars and trucks. The idea came to him after he and his wife were in a near accident with their young daughter. He promptly went to work remembered the billowing results of canvas he had seen during accidents onboard naval vehicles. He wanted to have that type of rapid inflation occur during emergency stops in a vehicle, to protect the lives of his own family, as well as make it available to others.</p>
<p>He patented his solution in 1953, a year after the accident which provided the final incentive to build the modern day airbag.</p>
<p>John was an inventor for most of his life and received other patents for solutions to everyday problems such as protecting aerial antennas during strong wind gusts and storms.</p>

<p>JESUS AMIGO</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Born in Bilbao (Spain) in 1962, he started studying music at the age of seven under the direction of his father, who at that time was the First Violinist of that city´s Symphony Orchestra. Later on he attended the Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga Conservatory in Bilbao, studying piano, composition and flute.</p>
<p>He graduated in Orchestral Conducting with maestro Octav Calleya and perfected his studies with maestros Enrique García Asensio, Antoni Ros Marbá and Sergiu Comissiona.</p>
<p>Amigo´s carrer as conductor started with the lead of the Madrid Real Conservatorio de Musica´s Symphony Orchestra ( 1995-1999 ) and that centre´s Grupo de Música Contemporánea. With these groups he worked extensively as a teacher and as a concert artist. His performances in the Auditorio Nacional de Música and the Musikfestpiele Saar ( 1999 ) received great compliments from the critics. In 2000 he was nominated Leading Director of the Extremadura Symphony Orchestra; in only four years they have swept the public and critics off their feet with their high-quality performances as well as their ambitious and attractive program.</p>
<p>His exceptional reputation secured by his musical integrity, his intensity and expressiveness have enabled him to present himself as guest conductor in Europe as well as in America and Asia. There he conducted orchestras of great repute, namely the Spanish Nacional Orchestra, the Reina Sofia Chamber Orchestra, the Bilbao Symphony Orchestra, the Madrid Community Orchestra, the Mexico State Symphony Orchestra ,the North Czech Philharmonic, Kammerorchester Berlin, Sinfonica di Roma, Beijing Symphony,etc. He collaborated with great artists such as Joaquín Achúcarro, Maria Joao Pires, Teresa Berganza, Radovan Vlatkovic,etc.</p>
<p>His repertoire includes all styles and periods, from Baroque to contemporary music, giving special attention to Spanish music.</p>
<p>Besides this, maestro Amigo is deeply involved in musical creation, an activity that has taken him to premiere and commission numerous works, and invest in the least played Twentieth Century repertoire , as is the case of his last Cd with works by portuguese composers Freitas Branco and Joly Braga Santos.</p>

<p>Falber appeared on the show on January 26, 2005. At that time he lived in Casper, Wyoming. Audience members were first introduced to his character antics when he impersonated Scooby Doo in the American Idol confessional. During his audition he sang "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" from Disney's animated film The Lion King. The judges were amused partly because of the absurdity of his song selection and partly because he was one of the better voices they had heard in Las Vegas. They decided he was not for the show and encouraged him to pursue musical theatre.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-09_0b88.html" title="Edit section: right to communicate">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">right to communicate</span></h2>
<p>A right to communicate was conceptualized by Jean d’Arcy, a French TV pioneer and founder of Eurovision. In 1969, while serving as Director of Radio and Visual Services in the United Nations Office of Public Information, he published an article on “Direct Broadcast Satellites and the Right to Communicate” in the EBU Review (Vol. 118:14-18, 1969). In the that article he made the bold assertion that “The time will come when the [UN] Universal Declaration of Human Rights will have to encompass a more extensive right than man’s right to information, first laid down twenty-one years ago in Article 19. This is the right to communicate.”</p>
<p>As envisioned by d’Arcy, a right to communicate is planetary in that it was conceived at a time when the global implications of satellite communication, combined with computing networking, were becoming apparent. He foresaw that information and communication technologies provided an alternative to the traditional vertical, top down, one-way communication dominated modern mass media. ICT made possible the personal, horizontal, global communication that would in time evolve into the Internet and World Wide Web. Both individuals and groups could directly participate in multi-way communication on the global network. Thus, a right to communicate is a right belonging not only to individuals but to groups as well. It is a strong positive right in that the state has the responsibility to insure its citizens have the resources to exercise the right. Finally, it is an extension or redefinition of earlier rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of opinion and expression. However, like other third generation rights the debate of what constitutes a right to communicate is yet to be resolved.</p>
<p>Jean d’Arcy himself never provided a concise definition of the right to communicate, however, his idea was taken up within the United Nations community. The 1970s was a period of intense debate within the United Nations about cultural diversity, media dominance, and the “free flow of information”. During this time the Non-Aligned nations were advancing the proposal of a New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). As well, Cold War politics established further fault lines. Nonetheless, efforts began within UNESCO in the 1970s to formulate a right to communicate. However, the right to communicate fell victim to international North-South and East West ideological and power politics in the 1980s. The United States and Great Britain withdrew from UNESCO, the idea of a NWICO collapsed, and UNESCO abandoned it efforts to formulate a right to communicate. While UNESCO dropped the effort to promote a right to communicate, various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) remained committed to and preserved d’Arcy’s vision.</p>
<p>With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, combined with the emergence of the Internet, there is renewed interest in communication rights. Efforts were made, unfortunately unsuccessfully, to promote a right to communicate during the United Nations World Summit on the Information Society. Nonetheless, scholars and communication rights activists continue to explore the concept and its implications in the context of rapidly expanding global communication. As citizens around the world increasingly take advantage of global electronic communications but see their privacy, intellectual freedom, right to information, and cultural autonomy threatened, they will recognize the need for a comprehensive right to communicate.</p>
<p>A right to communicate can be conceived as a human right that is the apex of a cluster and hierarchy of rights, freedoms, entitlements, and responsibilities. A right to communicate includes at a minimum, according to J. Richstad and M. H. Anderson, “the right to inform and be informed, the right to active participation in the communication process, the right of equitable access to information resources and information, and the right of cultural and individual privacy from communication”. A right to communicate encompasses interconnected freedoms such as the freedom of opinion, expression, and information. These freedoms in turn are exercised through such entitlements as freedom of the press, the lack of censorship, the rights of journalists, the right to access to information, and so forth.</p>
<p>A right to communicate also embodies the right of individuals and groups not to communicate, a right relevant to cultural rights and national and group identity. A right to communicate also embodies the concept of citizen participation and responsibility for the formulation of communication policy and rights. It provides a framework for addressing rights, freedoms and entitlements related to access including literacy, language, intellectual freedom, cultural diversity, language right, and intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>While its precise definition and application requires further research and debate, the pioneers promoting a right to communicate provided the basic framework for developing a strategy to advance democracy and electronic networking. That framework consists of participatory, interactive, horizontal, and multi-way communication. Further information and analysis of this framework and its implication for communication rights can be found at www.righttocommunicate.org. <a name="Sources_83" id="Sources_83"></a></p>

<p>Michael Adams was a 14 year old boy who was born in 1991. One day he was sitting in his living room playing GameCube and he burst into flames. There were 8 friends in the room because it was his birthday party. John E. Heymer hypothesizes that the reason Michael burst into flames was because he was so happy that he had just received a new video game entitled "Pokemon: Saga of Lugia". The burst of happiness triggered an electric current to run through his spine which in turn triggered a mitochondrial explosion.</p>
<p>Soon after bursting into flames, Michael got up and ran around the room on fire. He soon dropped to the floor. He was paralyzed. His friends attempted to drag him to the bathroom to douse the flames but could not.</p>
<p>"Like every time I tried to pick him up I was on fire", said his friend John Walther.</p>
<p>"He was like on fire we couldn't help him because it burned.", said his mother, Susan Adams.</p>
<p>Michael soon died thereafter. The doctors said he died of third degree burning. All that remained of Michael was his skull, his left leg and his GameCube controller.</p>
<p>One young boy commented on his dog, Bailey, attempted to save his flaming corpse. The dog apparently tried to drag Michael Adams to the pool, but could not due to hip displacea.</p>
<p>His friends said that nearly everything seemed normal with Michael beforehand, such as his minty breath. His best friend, Sanchez, commented that Michael Adams was on fire.</p>

<p>A plant creature in the 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game, the assassin vine is a semi-intelligent vine with leaves that bear a resemblance to hands. It grows both above and below ground and can strangle creatures that come close to it, which is where it gets its name. Assassin vines are usually mistaken for harmless vines until one's leaves close around its victim's neck. The subterranean version usually takes on the appearance of a mineral vein.</p>

<p><b>H.M.S. Cavalier</b> is one of the last surviving second world war royal navy destroyers. She is currently moored as a museum ship in the historic dockyard in Chatham, Kent, England.</p>
<p>In February 1943 J.S. White &amp; Co’s shipyard in the Isle of Wight began construction of H.M.S. Cavalier and she was completed in November 1944. Shortly after her completion Cavalier was sent to escort arctic convoys bound for Russia. In February 1945 she escorted Convoy RA64 which after being attacked by U-boats and aircraft scattered in a hurricane. Cavalier assisted in rounding up the convoy and earned her one and only battle honour. She later escorted the cruise liners Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary while they were being used as troopships. In December 1962 she served as a communications HQ Ship for a Royal Marine detachment sent to quell a rebellion in Brunei, Malaysia. In December 1971 after 27 years of service she was decommissioned. In 1977 Earl Mountbatten set up a trust to save the ship from the scrap yards. She changed hands several times and almost ended up in a Malaysian theme park before she became part of Chatham historic dockyard, berthed where H.M.S. Victory was built.</p>

<p>The equative case has been used in very few languages in history. It was used in the language of the ancient Sumerians. It is similar to the dative case in that in English, we replicate it by adding a word before it e.g. dative in Latin, puero is the same as in English, to/for the boy.</p>
<p>The equative case is formed like this: equative of "storm" would be as/like + storm</p>
<p>It is called the EQUATIVE case because it is expressing EQUIVALENCE.</p>

<p>Subatomicglue is an internet musical group formed in 1999, the brain child of Kevin Meinert. They are among the first bands to use creativecommons.org creative commons, and is a good example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_music" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_music" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_music</a> free music.</p>
<p>Over the years other collaborators have come and gone including Herb Sawyer, Lewis Hill, vavrek.com/ Vavrek (of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryad" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryad" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryad</a> Tryad), Christopher Westphall (of www.ceedubindustries.org ceedubindustries), Basilisk, and Tony Nagy. Subatomicglue is known for free, high quality, instrumental electronic music that crosses several genres: including electronic rock, trance, industrial, IDM. Of particular interest is the free availability of mp3s on the site, along with a frequently updated www.subatomicglue.com/download/music/experimental/ work in progress that anyone may listen to see what the band is up to.</p>
<p>Their front page states that subatomicglue is "groovy, dark, exotic, with elements of beauty and shadow. an exploration to the reality of your innerworld." In the spirit of www.opensource.org/ opensource and creativecommons.org/ creative commons, subatomicglue accepts requests for collaboration, submissions of song art, and cover art, and remixes of songs. subatomicglue has collaborated with many internet projects (see below for a few of these). Song source material is available for remixers and artists.</p>
<p>Subatomicglue's first successful album "globalenemy" debuted in 2001, with a limited supply of CDs for sale. Quite rare these days, the CD was a 4 page bookletted CD jewelcase with lots of full color art. These days CDs sold by subatomicglue are simpler and more of the promotional CD envelope style. While CDs can still be purchased, they can also be download in full from the band's website, or several mirrors or internet music mp3 websites.</p>
<p>in 2003, subatomicglue collaborated with Isotope244 to create music for www.isotope244.com/atomic_cannon.html atomic cannon, later in 2005, subatomicglue returned to create an all new soundtrack for Isotope244's www.isotope244.com/atomic-battle-dragons.html atomic battle dragons game that appeared on PC and pocket PC.

<p>FORMER JDL DIRECTORS LAUNCH B’NAI ELIM</p>
<p>B’nai Elim (literally “Sons of the Mighty” (from Psalm 29)) was organized by former Jewish Defense League members Matt Finberg, Robert Turk, Jim Nutting, Ian Sigel, and Bill Maniaci. The organizations mission includes providing Jewish educational and activist programs which will instill pride, self-esteem, and strength grounded in authentic Jewish concepts. Members are religious/nationalist Zionists in the spirit of the Hilltop Youth, and strongly support of the Land of Israel Movement. The leadership is inspired by the teachings of Rabbi Meir Kahane, ZT"L, HY"D, Reb Binyamin Kahane, ZT”L, HY”D, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem M. Schneerson, ZT”L. They also identify with Ze’ev Jabotinsky, ZT”L, his vision, and the Jewish leaders who sacrificed to implement it.</p>
<p>Bill Maniaci and Ian Sigel, the two Board Members with the most years of JDL service under their belts, want to point out that this is no pie in the sky start-up operation. Our members have been protecting Jewish communities since 1968. B'nai Elim members will routinely place themselves between Jews and those who would do them harm. They will initiate a wide variety of actions against the declared enemies of the Jewish People including gathering intelligence and assisting law enforcement officials by providing them with timely and accurate information related to anti-Semitism and anti-Israel activities. We will stand up to and combat anti-Semitism whenever, wherever, and by whatever means necessary.</p>

<p>The Subharchord</p>
<p>Unique Electronic Music Instrument Rediscovered!</p>
<p>1. The Birth of New Electronic Music in Divided Germany</p>
<p>In 1950s Germany, in the wake of musique concrète, the first fully electronic compositions were written. During this period many countries established electronic music studios to discover and explore these new worlds of sound. In Germany, new music was composed and experiments conducted on electronic equipment that often came originally from the physics lab or radio. However, development in the East and the West differed considerably. The political division of Germany after World War II led to the foundation of two politically independent states in 1949, geographically neighbours yet entirely separate: the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the east and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the west. In the years that followed, each state defined its own cultural policy. One result was that young artists and musicians, who saw themselves as the avant-garde, were valued and tolerated differently in the two states. In the West, from the outset it was easier for musicians to remain independent and to experiment relatively unhampered. For example, at the famous WDR (West German Broadcasting Corporation) studio of electronic music, many new works were written by composers such as Herbert Eimert, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Gottfried Michael König. The publications that came out of the WDR studio had an international audience. In other studios, such as Milan, Rome, Eindhoven, Brussels, Gravesano, and New York, experiments with musical structures and technical innovations were also ongoing.</p>
<p>2. An Invention by East German Engineers</p>
<p>This revolutionary development in music, together with the utilisation of new electronic sources of sound, was followed with great interest in East Berlin. Like the rest of the country, the city of Berlin was divided politically into East and West. In the competitive struggle between the two systems, the GDR did not merely want to be part of international developments, it wanted to take the lead. Thus, around 1960, technical experts at the “Labor für Akustisch-Musikalische Grenzprobleme” (laboratory for problems at the acoustics/music interface) began with the construction of a sound-generating device, which would be a compact sound lab and centrepiece of an electronic music studio; furthermore, it would be unrivalled and unsurpassed. The East German composers would have an instrument at their disposal that was superior to all comparable inventions in the studios of the Western world. This wonder-machine utilised microelectronics, which was new at the time. The machine’s concept was based on the mixing of so-called subharmonic sounds. In this respect its model was the trautonium, a German invention from the 1930s.</p>
<p>3. The West German “Mixturtrautonium”</p>
<p>Do you know Alfred Hitchcock’s film The Birds? If you have seen it, do you remember the rather menacing sounds of these usually harmless creatures? The bird noises were produced synthetically on an electronic instrument, a mixturtrautonium — a further development of the trautonium. The mixturtrautonium is a special case in the fascinating history of electronic music instruments for it uses the afore mentioned subharmonic mixtures to generate sound. The sounds produced by conventional instruments and in the natural world are a combination of notes each with a different pitch; each fundamental has various overtones, so-called harmonics, above it. Subharmonic sounds are produced by dividing the frequency of the fundamental “undertones” — subharmonics — are the result. Subharmonic sounds do not exist in nature and differ from the sounds produced conventionally by synthesizers and software programmes for electronic music. It appeared that the fascinating worlds of sound produced by mixing subharmonics would be forever dominated by the only existing instrument, the mixturtrautonium, and its constructor and player, Oskar Sala. Nobody else had ever mastered or played Sala’s instrument, and when he died some years ago, it seemed that the sound world of subharmonics was lost.</p>
<p>4. A (Re)Discovery in the Year 2000</p>
<p>In the course of extensive research on the history of electronic music instruments, in 2000 Manfred Miersch, a Berlin artist and musician, made a truly remarkable discovery: the trautonium is not the only instrument of its kind; another exists that produces subharmonic sounds — the “subharchord”. As described above, this instrument was invented in the GDR, under difficult technical conditions but using the latest technology available. However, the subharchord differs from the mixturtrautonium in key respects. The subharchord has a keyboard and is played like an organ whereas the mixturtrautonium’s manual is a resistor wire over a metal plate, which is pressed at various points to create sound (like a ribbon-controller), a rather difficult procedure. In addition, the subharchord possesses considerably more possibilities than the mixturtrautonium for generating and manipulating sounds. Miersch succeeded in tracking down and unearthing long-forgotten instruments, thus saving the subharchord from destruction. With his publication of a four-part series in the German magazine Keyboards in 2003 and construction of a website (www.subharchord.com) in 2002/2003, Miersch introduced the subharchord to a wide audience — an instrument that is not found in any encyclopaedia or lexicon. Fortunately, as a result of Miersch’s activities one of the surviving instruments has now been restored. Like its West German counterpart the trautonium, the East German subharchord was a favourite choice for film soundtracks. Karl-Ernst Sasse, former conductor of the DEFA (East German Film Company) Symphony Orchestra, worked with the subharchord in Dresden on the soundtracks of cult science fiction classics, such as Signale. The subharchord was also used for many of the DEFA’s cartoons.</p>
<p>5. Subharchord News</p>
<p>In the meantime, both historic and new recordings are now available on CD; the first appeared in 2003: Der Krautopia Sampler. At the end of 2004, an exceptional production was realised as a Special Edition: the vinyl single Subharmonische Mixturen mit dem Subharchord (EP — extended play, 33 rpm). It includes a historic recording, a tribute to Ernst Schreiber, inventor of the subharchord (1962), and two new recordings of pieces played by Manfred Miersch on the subharchord owned by the Berlin Academy of Arts (2003/2004). The subharchord has been saved from oblivion and efforts to preserve the last surviving instruments have been successful! However, much work remains to be done. Sections of the Subharchord Website will shortly be available in English. Research continues and there will surely be more surprises to come.</p>

<p>The Tournament of Champions, sometimes called the TOC, is the coordinating organization for national-circuit high school debate. The Tournament of Champions itself is held every May in Lexington, Kentucky and is hosted by the University of Kentucky.</p>
<p>Currently, the Tournament of Champions features four events: <a href="../../../p/o/l/Policy_Debate_9c43.html" title="Policy Debate">Policy Debate</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lincoln-Douglas_Debate_1efb.html" title="Lincoln-Douglas Debate">Lincoln-Douglas Debate</a>, <a href="../../../p/u/b/Public_Forum_Debate_1910.html" title="Public Forum Debate">Public Forum Debate</a>, and <a href="../../../s/t/u/Student_Congress_d686.html" title="Student Congress">Student Congress</a>. Although each of these events originated in the <a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Forensic_League_4c8c.html" title="National Forensic League">National Forensic League</a>, the TOC is considered more competitive than the NFL National Tournament. Indeed, qualifying to even attend the TOC is more difficult and more selective than qualifying for NFL Nationals. Further, the judging at the TOC is more consistent, if not better on the whole, than the judging at NFL District Qualifiers and Nationals. Finally, qualification to the TOC is based on multiple performances at nationally-designated invitationals which earn their "bid" status, while qualification to the NFL is based on a one-time performance at a local chapter's district qualifier. For these reasons, the Tournament of Champions is considered by some as the better-respected national tournament of the two.</p>

<p>Admission to the Tournament of Champions is a difficult task. In Policy and Lincoln-Douglas debate, certain tournaments are awarded "bid status" for different levels of advancement. The largest and most competititive tournaments (such as Greenhill, the Glenbrooks, and the like) award bids to those competitors who reach Octafinals. Other tournaments are authorized to give bids at other levels (Quarterfinals, Semifinals, and Finals). These tournaments earn their bid status by virtue of their size, the scope of their competition, the quality of the tournament, and the historical value of the tournament. To fully qualify to the Tournament of Champions, competitors must earn two such bids from two bid-designated tournaments.</p>
<p>In Student Congress, bids are earned according to the level of competition that the representative reaches (semifinals, finals, or placing in the top six). Unlike qualifying in Policy or LD, however, a congressperson who places in the top six at their state forensic associaton's tournament of who wins their NFL district qualifier can count either of these achievements as one of their two required bids.</p>
<p>In Public Forum, there is not yet a bid system. The event is still in its formative stages and not as many higher-level national invitationals offer a full-fledged Public Forum division as they do for Policy or Lincoln-Douglas. Accordingly, the Public Forum division of the Tournament of Champions is structured as a round robin. The TOC Public Forum Round Robin is only in its second year. To qualify for this competitition, prospective two-person Public Forum teams must apply on an individual basis.</p>

<p>The term "TIPS" actually stands for <b>T</b>o <b>I</b>nsure <b>P</b>rompt <b>S</b>ervice, which has been derived from old British hotels. A small plate is placed on the dinning table, with the message "To Insure Promt Service", which means that if you give the waiter/waitress some "TIPS" (money) then you will receive promt service or in another words, better and faster service.</p>
<p>However as time went by, people slowly began shifting the "TIPS" traditional till the end of the Bill instead of paying them the money upfront as I guess people just can't justify paying someone not knowing how well their service quality level is.</p>

<p>The Native Americans lived in isolation for many years. Thier dense population made it hard for microganisms to survive. They were blessed and cursed at the same time. They lived disease free for many many years. Their children did not expierence the diseases many european youths did. They lived free of influenza, chicken pox, small pox, and many other diseases. Also they lacked the domesticated anmials that the europeans had. These animals shared many of the same diseases of the humans, and made it much easier to spread disease throughout europe. This was not the case in the Americas since they lacked the domestacated animals. This was a curse to them, however, because when the europeans dicovered the Americas they brought thier diseases with them. It was the european diseases that they brought to the Americas that killed most of these peoples. These diseases would have made it impossible for the Native Americans and the Europeans to live side by side even if they wanted to. Since the europeans had lived with these diseases for so many years thier bodies had grown immune to many of them. Where as most of them were deadly for the indians.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-09_0b88.html" title="Edit section: Nausher Banaji fine art nude unnude photography + nouveau-noir photo art">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Nausher Banaji fine art nude unnude photography + nouveau-noir photo art</span></h2>
<p>Photographic artist Nausher Banji sees a direct connection between buildings, statues and people that comes down simply to skin. “My muse is brick and flesh,” says Nausher. “The skin of buildings and bodies. The symmetry of an arch and the geometry of a leg. I mingle male and female forms. I deal with humans as beings wearing their skin like armor.” This perspective is keenly reflected in his work. It may be a model posing expertly along the architecture of a city wall or a statue, creating the illusion that the nude body is stone. In one photograph, the limbs of one model are seemingly fused with the limbs of another, forming a striking and carnal semblance. Nausher’s models are often shot in public places, adorned with masks or heavy make-up; their faces are often hidden or shot at angles to underplay gender. This effect, combined with a skillful manipulation of space, shadow, and vibrant color evokes a sense of the sublime and the mysterious.</p>
<p>“I am comfortable with mystery. When I don’t have the answers, I am intrigued” says Nausher, who feels that each viewer of his art should come up with their own interpretation. “I don’t want to give them a story,” he says. “I want them to create their own story.” Yet despite his fondness for the unknown, there is an impressively high level of precision and calculation to Nausher’s craft; it is a part of the process that goes much deeper than “skin.” He explains that prior to going on a shoot, he has already envisioned the whole scene as he would like it to appear. The challenge is to bring to life what can only be seen in his inspired mind and to transfer the essence of such a world onto the canvas through his photography. The final step in the process is to “tweak” the image by way of shadow and coloring. It is this last step that involves the manipulation of reality since the photograph then begins to take on a surreal and ambivalent, a fresh and powerful, quality. “I feel the shadows in my images talk of passion and the passages of time,” says Nausher.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the profound mystery and power of Nausher’s images, it somehow really does come down to “skin.” While his work has been well-received by the public, Nausher explains that it has also been met with some resistance. He has been asked why his models don’t have clothes on to which he has responded, “I’m not shooting fashion, so why should they?” Some are quick to dismiss his art as being too revealing or inappropriate, yet Nausher rightfully maintains that we live in a society that “cannot distinguish between the naked image and the pornographic image.” He added that while nudity has always caused controversy, we currently live in a particularly strange and dangerous time, one where “bloody bodies don’t morally repulse us but nude bodies do.” Art galleries and publications have told him that his photography is “beautiful” but that their clients would have a problem with it. Nausher disagrees. “It’s the self-appointed gate-keepers of our society that have a problem with it, that are defining what is acceptable and what is not, what is moral and immoral. And if we don’t want our books burnt, if we don’t want to go back to 1984 we better push back.” For centuries artists have gained recognition and admiration by capturing the beauty of the true human form through mediums such as plaster and paint, yet for some reason when someone’s bare body is photographed, it is often labeled and dismissed as being something less than art. Nausher points out that “a statue is immortalized because it is captured in stone; the human being is immortalized because he or she is captured in film.”</p>
<p>Nausher has a team of five models that he uses on a regular basis. He described them as a team of intelligent and beautiful men and women and added that if someone wants to be photographed by him, they need to be “approved” by the team who meet up prior to a shoot to discuss what will be expected of them. It is during such meetings that Nausher shares his vision with the models and inspires a mindset within them to prepare them for the event. Critics of Nausher’s photography might be surprised by how professional of a process it really is. “Within two minutes of the shoot beginning, you don’t even realize that people are nude. Nobody notices that clothes are not being worn. It is much more about the art.”</p>
<p>Nausher has been creating his art for 15 years and describes himself as being largely self-taught. He commented that his mother is also an artist and emphasized that the support of his family and friends has been vital to his success. “They are my biggest fans” he says graciously while noting that Vancouver, where he resides, is not a place hip to nudity, and many of the people who are into nudity find his “pictures too arty.” He said that other than Lit magazine, all of the magazines that have carried his work this year have been out of London, Germany, and Italy, and most of the e-mail he receives is also from Europe. Hopefully, more continents will soon join the ranks of Europe in their appreciation for types of fine art such as Nausher’s. Meanwhile, Nausher has made clear that he creates his art first and foremost for himself. “At the end of the day,” he says, “this is the vehicle where I do precisely what is in my soul.” Nausher’s photo-canvases are being shown at Stacey Malyshi’s Gallery 83 and at John Ince’s Art of Loving Gallery, both located in Vancouver, Canada.

<p>The Passionflower Massacre is a book by Nicola Morgan, for young adults. The main character is a girl called Matilda, who longs for freedom from her over-protective and very Christian parents, who, like her, have not yet come to terms with the death of her brother from cancer. She runs away with a few friends to work on a fruit farm after leaving school. The people who run the farm are a little odd, but Matilda doesn't want to worry anymore, just to belong. As she becomes closer to these serene and beautiful people, she fails to realise that she is putting herself and others in danger by associating with a dangerous religious cult. Even if she doesn't know it, her only hope now is an ordinary-seeming boy named George, who works on the fruit farm and suspects there are more the those in charge of the farm than it seems.</p>
<p>The book is interspersed with snippets twenty or 30 years into the future, when her mother is dealing with the aftermath of her daughter's involvement.</p>
<p>A disturbing and evocative book that will have you wondering where theline is drawn between religion and madness.</p>

<p>The GTF Pegasus is a Terran stealth Fighter from the game Freespace 2</p>
<p>The Pegasus is used almost exclusively for reconnaissance missions. It's the fastest, most maneuverable ship in the Terran arsenal. The craft's contours and hull materials were carefully designed to minimize its profile to detection sensors. It is woefully armored and packs only minimal weaponry, making it a death box in a firefight. Pegasus pilots are a special breed of daredevils who pride themselves on getting into and out of situations that would be the death of other pilots, all without firing a shot.</p>

<p>Dole Comics is a comic created by two high school students in order to challenge politics. This political cartoon is about, primarily, Bob Dole (Thus the name 'Dole Comics'). He is the Ultimate Super Hero and uses power quite similar to those in multiple anime. Basiclly, this comic is a major rip-off of many others making the dream of publishment almost implausable, but the real purpose is to have fun with and enjoy the cheap imitations. In all it is highly enjoyable to read and is recommended to all those who need some 'Dole' in their life!</p>

<p><b>The Kosovo Property Agency (KPA)</b> was established on 4 March 2006 under www.unmikonline.org/regulations/unmikgazette/02english/E2006regs/RE2006_10.pdf/ UNMIK Regulation 2006/10, as an administrative agency functioning independently pursuant to www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm#11/ Chapter 11.2 of the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo. It is mandated to facilitate the resolution of claims resulting from the armed conflict that occurred between 27 February 1998 and 20 June 1999 in respect of private immovable property, including agricultural and commercial property - and has three main functions; (a) receive, register and assist the courts in resolving specific claims on private immovable property; (b) enforcement of legally final decisions; and (c) administration of abandoned properties.</p>
<p>Under the Regulation, the staff and assets of the www.hpdkosovo.org/ Housing and Property Directorate is subsumed into the KPA.

<p><b>The Kosovo Property Agency (KPA)</b> was established on 4 March 2006 under www.unmikonline.org/regulations/unmikgazette/02english/E2006regs/RE2006_10.pdf/ UNMIK Regulation 2006/10, as an administrative agency functioning independently pursuant to www.unmikonline.org/constframework.htm#11/ Chapter 11.2 of the Constitutional Framework of Kosovo. It is mandated to facilitate the resolution of claims resulting from the armed conflict that occurred between 27 February 1998 and 20 June 1999 in respect of private immovable property, including agricultural and commercial property - and has three main functions; (a) receive, register and assist the courts in resolving specific claims on private immovable property; (b) enforcement of legally final decisions; and (c) administration of abandoned properties.</p>
<p>Under the Regulation, the staff and assets of the www.hpdkosovo.org/ Housing and Property Directorate is subsumed into the KPA. The KPA therefore assumes responsibility for the implementation of all residential property claims that were pending with the HPD on 4 March 2006 and it will ensure their resolution in an effective and expeditious manner. Further, the Housing and Property Claims Commission (HPCC) will continue to decide the limited number of remaining residential claims that are currently pending before it.</p>

<p>Carson Morales was born on December 17th, 1989 in Northern California. He went to school in Wisconsin but dropped out at the age of 16 as it became more and more clear that he was a prodigy on the jazz trombone. Mimicking the style made famous by Miles Davis in his early years while also adding his own unique flair to the trombone stylings, Morales brings an unusal sound to the table. He was not offered any record deals, but has played with several well known groups, such as the Gordon Goodwin Big Phat Band and various other big band settings. However, he has recently disappeared from the jazz scene and is only known to a handful of jazz enthusiasts. Rumors have surfaced that he decided to finish his education in a quite suburb somewhere and is hoping to rejoin the jazz scene once he finishes college. He was first recognized and appreciated by lead trombone player Andy Martin of the Gordon Goodwin Big Phat Band, where he once gave a clinic at the school that young Morales was attending.</p>

<p>You've been around for a while here, and you're comfortable. You have read the guideline page stating <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">please don't bite the newcomers</a> -- perhaps you've been politely referred to it -- but you don't think you are guilty of that kind of behaviour. Still, you might feel up to a <a href="../../../w/i/k/Wikipedia%7EWikivacation_76f7.html" title="Wikipedia:Wikivacation">wikivacation</a>. But gosh, you still want to participate in your favourite hobby (which is Wikipedia, of course). If this is so, then you might consider participating in, shall we say, an altered state: you're going to take a <b>Walkabout</b>.</p>
<p><a name="Oh_yeah.2C_I_seen__that_on_TV.2C_that.27s_that_Aussie_thingie.2C_eh.3F" id="Oh_yeah.2C_I_seen__that_on_TV.2C_that.27s_that_Aussie_thingie.2C_eh.3F"></a></p>

<p>Well, sure, a <a href="../../../w/a/l/Walkabout.html" title="Walkabout">walkabout</a> is that. You can think of it as leaving your vitrual community and entering the vast wilderness of anonymity to walk among the wandering unregistered users and the wind-blown help pages. Although another analogy might be the practice of certain rulers who, to be sure that the people were being treated fairly, sometimes left to walk about in disguise among their subjects.</p>

<p>The idea isn't hard. Go away, try to forget everything you know about this place, then come back and walk about. Here are some suggested steps to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>You'll want to write yourself a wikivacation note and finish up some of your wikiwork. Well, if you must. But for full effect, don't.</li>
<li>Log out.</li>
<li>Go to the <a href="../../../m/a/i/Main_page.html" title="Main page">Main page</a>.</li>
<li>Don't to <b>anything</b> unless you've been told that you can do it, and how, in some sort of help page, or the like, or on a talk page by another user, or stumbling across it some other way, <i>not</i> just because you already know how.
<ol>
<li>If you do read a help page, or the like, try to read without preconception, and not read into it what you already know. If you see an unintended but reasonable interpretation, try to take it.</li>
<li>And did you really read all help pages when you were new? Most important things are stated multiple times. Some are stated only once, and not prominently. You might try to miss those things. For instance, <i>you didn't know that Wikipedia was editable by anyone</i> except that, just now, you saw it on the main page. Or maybe you didn't see it: you missed it, so you won't think about editing Wikipedia till you find it later.</li>
<li><b>No cheating.</b></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Do not refer to the fact that you've been around a while. Let people treat you as a newcomer.</li>
<li>Don't even <i>think</i> about your usual account for at least a few days.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />
You might also consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logging in, but without making a user page.</li>
<li>Not logging in at all.</li>
<li>Contribute to an area you don't normally contribute to.</li>
<li>Contribute to an area you do normally contribute to, but without disclosing your identity. (You can give your usual account credit for your contributions when you're done your walkabout, and not before.)</li>
<li>All of the above at once. Why not?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>To see if help pages, and the like, accurately reflect the current state of affairs. This can uncover problems in the "user interface" of Wikipedia, and this is good practice for any user interface, really.</li>
<li>To see how newcomers are actually treated. This can uncover problems in the community.</li>
<li>To be reminded about what it's like to be new. This can uncover problems in yourself.</li>
<li>To actually watch and participate without guilt as Wikipedia functions without you executing any special role as RC patroller, administrator, resident expert, mediator, wikiproject leader, or the like, preferably even having dropped these roles unannounced. This can uncover something you knew on a rational level already.</li>

<p><a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">The sockpuppet rules</a> do explicitly allow this sort of thing, and since your usual account is now dormant, there is little to worry about. Still, one possible exception is if you weighed in on an active discussion just before your walkabout, and then wandered back into it during your walkabout while it was still active. Use common sense.</p>

<p>Of course anyone can do this right now anyway, so the above text can stand on its own, as a suggestion, in the project space. However, further action is actually required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amend <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> to explicity allow this! As it stands, this is frowned upon. There is a one-line out for prominent users buried in there, but the overall tone is really quite negative towards this sort of thing. There would need be a more emphatic exception, referring to this page, and <i>prominence should not be a precondition</i>.</li>
<li>Amend <a href="../../../b/i/t/WP%7EBITE_9c7e.html" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITE</a> to suggest this, as an addendum to admonitions to remember that you were new once.</li>
<li>Give the project page -- and this is important -- a <i>good</i> official little acronym thingie. I can't think of a good one.</li>

<p>Ron Nagorcka, Australian composer, didjeridu artist, and keyboardist. Important figure in the last 35 years of Australian experimental music, particularly with regard to the musical movements of the late 1970s and 1980s in Melbourne. Moved to Tasmania in the 1990s, and since then has created a large and extraordinary body of work involving his own recordings of birds and Tasmanian animals, retuned to complex just intonation systems, combined with complex virtousic works for conventional instruments (often involving himself as a keyboard or didjeridu player).</p>
<p>Nagorcka's scores are published by Frog Peak Music, and his recordings are on Move Records (from Australia). In collaboration with naturalist Sarah Lloyd, he has produced a recording/book project entitled Rhythms of the Tarkine, which integrates natural sound recordings from the Tarkine region of Tasmania with his own pieces based upon some of those sounds.</p>

<p>Rotrud (775-810) was the eldest daughter of Charlemagne and Hildegard, a Swabian princess.</p>
<p>Rotrud's life comes down to us pieced together from a patchwork of sources. We know that she was educated in the Palace School by Alcuin of York, who affectionately calls her Columba in his letters to her.</p>
<p>When she was six, her father betrothed her to Constantine IV of Byzantium, whose mother Irene was ruling as regent. The Greeks called her Erythro, and sent a scholar monk called Elisaeus to educate her in Greek language and manners. However, the alliance fell apart by 786 when she was eleven. (See Runciman 106, 110) Although she never married, she did bear an illegitimate son, Louis, with her lover Count Rorico of Maine; their son went on to become Abbot of St. Denis.</p>
<p>We do know, however, that Rotrud also eventually took the veil and joined her aunt Gisela, abbess of Chelles. The two women authored a letter to the aging Alcuin, who was at Tours at the time, requesting that he write a commentary explaining the Gospel of John. The two women writers seem to have been erudite and versed especially in the conventions of religious women writing to churchmen (as in the case of St. Jerome and his lady correspondents, Eustochium in particular). As a result, Alcuin eventually produced his seven-book Commentaria in Johannem Evangelistam, a more accessible companion to the gospel than St. Augustine's massive and challenging Tractates on St. John, whose depths the two women had been trying to plumb in the first place. Commentators have dated the letter to the spring of 800, four years before Alcuin's death and ten before Rotrud's. (See Gaskoin 119, who disagrees with Dümmler, MGH 196 on the sequence of Alcuin's letters.)</p>
<p>Strangely enough, these two aspects of Rotrud are seldom considered together. Political histories of Charlemagne her father discuss her as a princess who was potentially a pawn and a woman of questionable morals (see, for instance, the German Wikipedia entry: de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotrud); religious histories discuss her as the second nun in the letter from Chelles (monasticmatrix.usc.edu/commentaria/article.php?textId=65). These small contradictions show us a portrait of a woman who was perhaps more fascinating than what little we have left behind.</p>

<p>Talonbooks is the leading publisher of drama in Canada and has been publishing works by influential Canadian authors for over four decades. As one of Canada’s premier independent publishers, its dynamic repertoire features authors of international stature, writing in the literary genres of poetry, fiction and drama, as well as non-fiction books in the fields of ethnography, environmental and social issues, cultural studies, and literary criticism.</p>
<p>The company started out as a magazine called Talon in 1963. It was run by David Robinson and some of his high school friends, and it later incorporated Jim Brown, who acted as both a writer and editor for the publication. Talon later joined with a small local press called Very Stone House and published its first string of poetry books in 1967. The association with Very Stone House ended a year later, and the Talonbooks imprint started appearing by itself. In 1969, Talonbooks published its first drama title, Colours in the Dark by James Reaney. Its editorial focus began shifting gradually more toward drama until it became the company’s area of specialization. Karl Siegler became the business manager for Talonbooks in 1974 and is now the publisher.</p>
<p>Talon’s authors have been the recipients of numerous prestigious national and international awards. Their works continue to make a difference in furthering a sense of cultural and social awareness in the world, challenging conventional thinking and pushing the boundaries of language and creativity. Prominent Talon authors include Michel Tremblay, George Ryga, bpNichol, George Bowering, bill bissett and Mary Meigs.</p>

<p>Greek Mythology is a collection of artistic works that tell the stories of many gods, goddesses, heroes, and heroines. The word myth is derived from the Greek word “mythos,” which means word, speech, fiction, and stories. Mythology was used by the Greeks to explain unanswered questions, such as how the earth was created, point the way to acceptable behavior, and as a religion. Throughout mythology a wide range of creatures and beings are introduced; among these are monsters, daemons, nymphs, satyrs, and centaurs. The information that composes mythology comes from many different sources. These sources include the epics (such as Homer’s The Iliad), other poetry (Roman and Hellenistic), and the works of historians, who recorded the stories that they heard in various cities. Mount Olympus serves as the background for many important events in mythology, and it symbolizes the separation between the gods and mere mortals. The word “Mount Olympus” can assume many different meanings. For one it can simply describe a mountain in Northern Greece. However the far more important meaning is the more commonly known Olympus of literature. Much confusion has arisen as to what the writers of mythology where referring to when they wrote “Mount Olympus.” Some think that Olympus described a heavenly location where the gods lived. Others think that the authors were implying that the gods actually dwelt on the earthly mountain in Greece. The real Mount Olympus stands on its own two feet in culture as an important location in European geography. The mountain is located in Northern Greece on the border of Thessaly and Macedonia. The peak soars to a frightening 9,550 feet high. The summit overlooks every other mountain in Greece. Contrasting with the snowy, stormy, treacherous mountain of mythology, the real Mount Olympus is known for its rich plant life and indigenous species. Mount Olympus serves several important purposes for the gods in mythology. It serves as a home to the Olympians, a group of eight gods and goddesses who dwell on the mountain’s surface. The eight Olympians are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Ares, Hermes, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, and Athena. It also houses seven other variable gods who stay for varying periods of time but not permanently. These variable gods included Hebe, Helios, Hestia, Demeter, Dionysus, Hades, and Persephone. There are several things that make Mount Olympus important to mythology. Zeus, the god of weather, rules the mountain. Hephaestus, the god of metalwork, built the gods’ palaces on the mountain’s summit. When residing on the heavenly location the gods and goddesses eat ambrosia in the palace of Zeus. By eating ambrosia, the gods are able to obtain immortality. Hebe serves nectar, a delicious drink to the gods. By the throne of Zeus sit the nine muses, who sing the great history of gods and heroes while the gods dine. Several features characterize Mount Olympus in the minds of those familiar with mythology. For one the mountain is covered with snow and mysteriously covered in clouds. A common subject for many paintings is the image of Zeus unleashing his wrath in the form of thunderbolts thrown down from Mount Olympus. Also associated with Mount Olympus is the easy, pleasurable life, which the gods enjoy. Their pleasures include wonderful nectar and ambrosia and the beautiful music sung to them by the muses. Mount Olympus is featured in many works of mythological literature. Hesiod described the part Olympus played in the creation of earth, when he wrote the Theogony. When Homer writes The Odyssey and The Iliad, there are several instances where he mentions Olympus. For example in “Book I” of The Iliad Homer writes, “ He [Apollo] came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and quiver upon his shoulders, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him.” This passage describes an instance in which Apollo descends the mountain and unleashes his rage on a Greek general who had captured the daughter of one of Apollo’s priests. The goal of Mount Olympus in mythology has always been to provide a setting that would distance the gods from mere mortals. At first it was enough for the Greeks to simply make that location their highest peak, but as people began to climb the mountain the Greeks decided it was unfit for the gods to reside at such an earthly location. Greeks began to believe that the gods resided in a heaven, called Olympus, in the sky. The poets of the day supported this belief. When Homer wrote the Iliad, he described Olympus as a distant heavenly place. When gods go to Mount Olympus, they are not only treated to music and fine food but also eternal separation from mortals.</p>

<p>The Balkan wars (1912-1913) were two short wars which prepared the way for World War I. The First Balkan War was fought by four Balkan states against Turkey for the redistribution of the European territories of the Ottoman Empire. Serbia and Bulgaria accordingly concluded a treaty of alliance, to be joined latter on by Greece and Montenegro. The alliance became known as the Balkan League. After the conclusion of. the hostilities of the first war, the Conferences of the Ambassadors of the Great Powers followed, in order to settle the newly created status quo. Dissatisfied with the resulting agreements, Serbia allied with Greece and demanded a greater share of Macedonia from Bulgaria. Infuriated Bulgaria attacked Serbia. Consequently Greece, Romania and Turkey joined in on Serbia's side. In this Second Balkan War Bulgaria was defeated and lost territory to all her enemies. This focuses on the circumstances in which the Balkan League was created and the events that led to its destruction.</p>

<p><b>Johann Michael Ferdinand Heinrich Hofmann</b> (March 19, 1824 in <a href="../../../d/a/r/Darmstadt%2C_Germany_7c6d.html" title="Darmstadt, Germany">Darmstadt, Germany</a>–June 23, 1911 in <a href="../../../d/r/e/Dresden%2C_Germany_c894.html" title="Dresden, Germany">Dresden, Germany</a>) was a German painter and the uncle of the German painter <a href="../../../l/u/d/Ludwig_von_Hofmann_ba8f.html" title="Ludwig von Hofmann">Ludwig von Hofmann</a>.</p>

<p>Heinrich Hofmann grew up in a family that harbored a deep interest in art. His father, advocate Heinrich Karl Hofmann (1795-1845) painted in water colors, his mother Sophie Hofmann, née Volhard (1798-1854) gave lessons in art before she married, and his four brothers all showed artistic talent. Heinrich, however, was the only one for whom art was not only a profession but the center of his life.</p>
<p>Hofmann received his first lessons in art from the copper engraver Ernst Rauch in Darmstadt. Then, in 1842, he entered the Academy of Art in Düsseldorf and attended the classes given in painting by Theodor Hildebrandt. Later he was accepted into the studio of Wilhelm von Schadow and there he created his first large painting: A scene from the life of Alboin, King of the Langobards.</p>
<p>Thereafter he traveled to the Netherlands and France to intensify his studies of art. In 1846 Hofmann visited the Academy of Art in Antwerp. After passing a longer period of time in Munich he returned to Darmstadt in 1848 and at that time he began an intensive phase of painting portraits. The young artist found that the political activities of his family opened many doors to influential persons of the time. This afforded him the opportunity to create two portraits of <a href="../../../h/e/i/Heinrich_von_Gagern_adb3.html" title="Heinrich von Gagern">Heinrich von Gagern</a> and one of <a href="../../../j/u/s/Justus_von_Liebig_4087.html" title="Justus von Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a> (this portrait is now in the possession of the <a href="../../../q/u/e/Queen_of_England_c589.html" title="Queen of England">Queen of England</a>). In 1851 Hofmann went to Dresden to visit the art gallery there. In 1853 he traveled to Prague to paint the portrait of Dr. Beer, Great Grand Master of the Brotherhood of the Knights of the Cross.</p>
<p>In 1853 Hofmann returned to Darmstadt and in the beginning of 1854 his beloved mother died. He was deeply moved by her death and it inspired him to paint his first large religious work: Burial of Christ.</p>
<p>In fall of 1854 he started on a journey to Italy. His first longer stop was in Venice and he used the time there to study <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giorgione.html" title="Giorgione">Giorgione</a>, <a href="../../../b/e/l/Bellini.html" title="Bellini">Bellini</a> and <a href="../../../g/i/o/Giotto.html" title="Giotto">Giotto</a> (in nearby Padua). After having proceeded to Florence – where Hofmann stayed for two months – he then went to Rome in January 1855. The comprehensive correspondence with his family and his detailed diary reports convey an impression of his way of painting at that time. He was deeply impressed by artwork of Antiquity, Christianity and the <a href="../../../r/e/n/Renaissance.html" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.</p>
<p>Not long after his arrival in Rome he was introduced to <a href="../../../p/e/t/Peter_von_Cornelius_430c.html" title="Peter von Cornelius">Peter von Cornelius</a> (1783-1867) and frequently paid him a visit. When he began his masterpiece The Arrest of Jesus in 1854, this work awakened the interest of Cornelius and for 4 years he accompanied Hofmann with his counsel and his constructive criticism. In 1858 the painting was finished and acquired by the Grand Duchy Art Gallery in Darmstadt. (It is still there – not on exhibition but in the archives of the Hessisches Landesmuseum.)</p>
<p>In 1858 Hofmann returned to Darmstadt and in the following year he married Elisabeth Werner. The couple had no children.</p>
<p>Now another period of painting portraits began. In addition Hofmann created a large altarpiece for the church in Obermörlen (Hesse): “Madonna with Christ Child and apostles Paul and Peter”. Some time later an altarpiece for the church in Vaeggerlose (Denmark) was painted: “The Resurrected Christ”.</p>
<p>In 1862 Hofmann and his wife moved to Dresden. More and more he devoted himself to the genre of religious paintings. In 1870 Heinrich Hofmann was appointed successor of Professor Johann Carl Baehr of the Academy of Art in Dresden whose honorable member he already was. In 1872 King Johann bestowed on him the Great Golden Medal and later he received the Albrecht-Medal from King Albert. In 1891 Hofmann’s wife passed away and soon after that he withdrew from the Academy of Art in Dresden. Even though he stopped working for the Academy it is obvious from his letters that in private life he continued to create many works of art until his death on June 23, 1911.</p>
<p>Four of the most famous works of Hofmann are in the possession of the <a href="../../../r/i/v/Riverside_Church_6467.html" title="Riverside Church">Riverside Church</a> in New York: Christ and the Rich Young Ruler, Christ in Gethsemane, Christ in the Temple and Picture of Christ. According to information of the Riverside Church the painting Christ in Gethsemane is without much doubt one of the most copied paintings in the world.</p>
<p>The religious body of Hofmann’s work has gained in importance in the past years. One of the reasons for the increasing popularity of his artwork is the publication of his paintings and pencil drawings depicting the life of Jesus Christ in The Second Coming of Christ, the unequaled interpretation of the Bible by <a href="../../../p/a/r/Paramahansa_Yogananda_25ad.html" title="Paramahansa Yogananda">Paramahansa Yogananda</a>, the world-renowned Indian philosopher and teacher of Yoga.</p>
<p>Heinrich Hofmann was one of the pre-eminent painters of his time. The Sunday Strand – at that time a very popular British magazine– describes him as the most influential contemporary German painter. Hofmann’s style of painting was unique in its own way but at the same time he based his work on the traditional art of old German, Dutch and Italian masters. While in Rome he also came in touch with the Nazarenes – especially through the influence of Cornelius – but throughout his life he remained faithful to the great examples of the Renaissance. Religious paintings take the center stage in Hofmann’s work; but he also created numerous portraits and pictures that depict mythological and historical topics.</p>

<p>Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla was born around 148 AD as the second daughter to Marcus Aurelius and Faustina the Younger. Her younger brother was Commodus. In 164 AD, she married Marcus' adoptive brother and co-emperor Lucius Veras. In 169 AD, she was widowed when Lucius Veras died. Annia Lucilla did not remain a widow, but married to the older Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus of Antioch, who had been consul twice.</p>
<p>Having once been Augusta, wife of an Augustus, she was not satisfied with a lower station. In 182 AD, she was involved in a plot with her cousin, the former consul Marcus Ummidius Quadratus, to assassinate Commodus and raise her husband up as Emperor. The assassin was Pompeianus' nephew. The attempt was thwarted and the conspiracy unraveled. Commodus exiled Annia Lucilla to the island of Capri, but soon quietly ordered her execution.</p>

<p>Slammed!takes place on the wildly popular “back bar” circuit of pro-wrestling. Derek (played by Justin Whalin, the kid from that horrible Dungeons &amp; Dragons movie ) is a wannabe wrestler, while his best friend Jeff (played by Zachary Ty Bryan of Home Improvement fame) wants to be Derek's manager. Apparently back bar wrestling is supposed to be “shoot wrestling,” even though the guys are doing moonsaults and piledrivers. Yep, just like you'd see in a REAL FIGHT.</p>

<p>The only notable person in recent times who is perhaps only famous for his 15 minutes of public exposure, is Eric Moussambane <i><b>(Please check the spelling here</b></i>) or "Eric The Eel" as he was to become known throughout the world.</p>
<p>Eric lives in Malabo and is best known for finishing last in an Olympic swimming event. Although he was so slow, and struggled for most of the course length, he refused to give up until he had reached the finish line, with the help of the audience, who clapped and cheered him home. For this show of determination, the people of the western world seemed to take him into their hearts, and he was later feted on multiple TV shows etc., even presenting an award at the Oscars I believe, although it may have been some other award ceremony, where they dressed him up in tuxedo and all the trimmings.</p>
<p>This must have been a time to remember for Eric who came from a very poor family in Malabo and who was, and still is more used to walking around in a T-Shirt, shorts and an old pair of trainers.</p>
<p>At the time of the Olympic draw, Eric used to just paddle up and down a very small swimming pool at the Europa Hotel in Malabo, where he was basically still learning to swim. It was here that he was spotted by some members of the Equatorial Guinea Olympic Committee. He was approached by one of these committee members and more or less forced to represent his country at the next Olympics.</p>
<p>Although he had never before managed to swim even 200 metres without resting at that time, he suddenly found himself entered to compete in a 500 metre race in an Olympic size swimming pool with the world watching. The result of this was all too obvious for everyone to see during the actual qualifiying heats.</p>
<p>On his return to Malabo he was totally ignored at the airport, as very few people at that time realised how the rest of the world had taken him to their hearts. The government and the general population of Equatorial Guinea basically shunned him for "making the country look foolish" on worldwide television, although the ex-pat community, predominantly oilfield related, treated him like a star everytime they saw him in public. Gradually, with all the attention he was being shown around Malabo, the general population eventually got the message that, instead of shaming his country, he had actually had the opposite effect and had managed to put a good face on the people of Malabo and the country of Equatorial Guinea.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although he had been given track suits, trainers, swimsuits etc., from some of the major sportswear manufacturers in order to help advertise their products, plus various other leisure wear etc., due in most part to the then poor public opinion of his efforts, when he arrived in Malabo he was asked to pay duty on all these items. Being from a poor family, he could not raise anywhere near the amount of money required and therefore most, if not all of these items were confiscated on the spot.</p>
<p>Eric is still to be seen walking around Malabo with a smile on his face, wearing the same clothes he wore before his 15 minutes of world fame. He still swims at the same small pool and his life has just continued exactly where it was before the Olympics began.</p>
<p>His was simply a case of fame but no fortune.</p>

<p>Concerned is a <a href="../../../w/e/b/Webcomic.html" title="Webcomic">webcomic</a> by Christopher C.

<p>The story of Concerned centers on the charater Gordob Frohman, a spinoff and reference of <a href="../../../g/o/r/Gordon_Freeman_b9f0.html" title="Gordon Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a>, the main character of Half-life and Half-life 2 (which the series is based off of). Unlike the silent and cool-mannered Freeman, Frohman is incompetent, ignorant, happy-go-lucky, and down right stupid. Frohman's story follows Freeman's juorney in Half-life 2, traveling the same places (at differect time) and undergoing similiar events. The Events of Concernd, however, start aproxamitly a week before Half-life 2. The titles of the chapters of Concerned are plays off of the titles of the chapters of Half-life 2. Each co-responding chapter of Concerned and Half-life 2 share a basic plot; I.E. during chapter "We Don't Go to Ravenholm" of HL2 and "We still go to Ravenholm" of Concerned, both Freeman and Frohman use the tunnel from <a href="../../../b/l/a/Black_Mesa_East_9612.html" title="Black Mesa East">Black Mesa East</a> to travel to the city of Ravenholm and meet the HL2 character Father Grigori, encounter masses of the HL2 monsters "Headcrabs", and escape through a graveyard.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-09_0b88.html" title="Edit section: Humor">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Humor</span></h3>
<p>COncerned involves many reoccuring jokes and humor styles. One of the main humor themes is the extremely similiar yet completely different storylines. For example, the protaganist of HL2, Gordon Freeman, and the protagonist of Concerend, Gordon Frohman, share similiar names and follow a similiar string of events, yet the personalities seem completely different. Freeman is portrayed in HL@ and the original Half-life as a quiet, intelligent (<a href="../../../m/2E/i/M.I.T._bc02.html" title="M.I.T.">M.I.T.</a> graduate), and self-controlled man while Frohman is a bumbling, violent, and egotistic person. An example of this style of humor in events is portrayed in the chapter where the protagonist goes to Ravenholm. In HL2, Freeman goes there to escape a Combine invasion of Black Mesa East and enters a dark, run-down, monster infested town rigged completely with deadly traps, which the only inhabitant Father Grigori claims to have set in the game. In Concerned, Frohman is kicked out of Black Mesa East and finds the city of Ravenholm in the complete opposite state; the setting is sunny, the buildings are fully-functional and intact, the citizens are extremely happy and bright, and the city is not trap or monster infested.</p>
<p>Another Humor style Christopher uses is his use of Concerned to reveal comical actions of Frohman to explain certain events of HL2. Examples are such as when Frohman is working for the combine in an office and causes a shipping error, which causes an extreme overstock of explosive barrels. This explains the inexplicable and seemeingly endless amount of explosives barrels Gordon Freeman encounters during the stoy of Half-life 2. During the series, this running-gag explains the ridiculously large amounts of supply crates and saw blades (Ravenholm). Concerned also explains the HL2 appearance of the characters Sandy and Laszloe, who Freeman encounters while Sandy is sitting of a rock and Laszloe is wounded on the sand shortly before Laszloe is killed by antlions. In Concerned, Frohman meets the pair in Ravenholm, who then leave once Frohman sets traps all over Ravenholm (explaining the traps in the city during Hl2) in order to catch Father Grigori. He later meets the pair again by the lighthouse and is assigned by a rebel to guide them to the next rebel base. The two and Frohman are separated and the last that is seen of the pair in the comic are the two sitting on the same rock Freeman finds them in HL2 and the pair deciding to build a sand castle out of boredum.</p>

<p>Sdlimage is a technology that allows for visual enhancement for 3D PC, console and mobile games. This technology has "silently" boosted many titles during those last 11 years. One of the interest is that it treats textures offline - no code is embedded in the game itself.</p>

<p>KILLER INSTINKT COMICS, were first published in fall of 1995 by Dark House comics. The comics were based on the popular Neentendo video game Killer Instinkt which was first released in arcades in 1994.</p>
<p>STORY The comic book series was based on the followings of Cindar and how he came about being involved in the Killer Instinkt tournament. The game was pulled from shelves after issue 24 as there were graphic scenes of Cindar having hard butt sex with Black Orckid. in which they spent the night in a hotel and Cindar blew so hard that Black Orckid threw up his cum.</p>
<p>The comic became a flop and cost Dark House comics millions of dollars after their expensive advertising campaign.</p>
<p>The comics are now considered to be collectors items and are barely ever seen in circulation anymore.</p>

<p>Trent Felter was a famous painter born in Australia 1874 at Ballarat, Victoria. his most well known painting was titled 'The Sitting Rock.'</p>
<p>He became known as a impressionist painter when he was arrested for stealing a 'artistically beuatiful gold chip' that he wanted to paint a portrait of. Many people believe he just needed some money to buy more paint and brushes. he excused his crime as he was going to return it once he had painted it..</p>
<p>The Sitting Rock sold for 1200 pounds and this was the peak of his career. he mostly painted postcards and traded them for food and sometimes even gold.</p>
<p>Eventually, he started mining without a licence and was injured while soldiers raided the camps to arrest miners without licenses. sent to Melbourne to recover, he became very depressed from 'being away from home.'</p>
<p>He returned to Ballarat and started a little painting shop and he struggled to make a living. Eventually he was forced to sell and he moved back to Melbourne.</p>
<p>Not much is known about Trents life but some of his paintings can still be seen in the Melbourne Museum.</p>
<p>The Green Leaves and The Sitting Rock are still in the archives, unfortunately a lot of his works were lost during a small fire in the museum in 1972.</p>

<p>NoPass is a way of running homebrew NintendoDS software, much like PassMe. The difference here is that instead of 'tricking' the Nintendo DS into running code from the GBA slot of the unit, a NoPass is exactly like a regular game - The Nintendo DS can boot it as a normal game and thus it works on any hardware revision of the Nintendo DS. One example is a product called "Max Media Launcher" put out by the company Datel, the same company that sells the Action Replay cheat device and other such products.</p>

<p>Geoff "The Trescott" Prout was born in 1944 in Dartford. Geoff initially became famous because of his outrageous catchphrases while teaching at Dartford Grammar School, eg. "I'm G. T. Prout not W.H. Smith!" and more famously, "I'd avoid it like you would a barge pole!" As a result of his "never say die" attitude, Geoffro has achieved almost iconic status in his home town. As a young man, Geoff was often assualted by children from his school. There was one occasion where the attack went too far and it resulted in the young Prout having a severely disfigured finger. His finger has been runoured to be magic. This finger has caused him to be ridiculed wherever he goes. At this time, Mr Prout is trying to earn the respect of his people through his amazing work on Dartford council. By being the head of both year 11 and Politics, at Dartford Grammar School, he has already earned the respect of many.</p>

<p>A Band with Epic Morales and Short Standards From Bensalem.</p>
<p><br />
Since Early 2001 the two founding members, Anthony Masington(Vocals/Lead Guitar) and Dan Pizzoferrato(Bass) have been playing together in various bands. It wasn't until 2003 when Anthony started a band called TRW. They played shows and just messed around most of the time, like a jam band. When they decided to get serious they moved on to finding a bass player, which comes in Dan.

<p>A Band with Epic Morales and Short Standards From Bensalem.</p>
<p><br />
Since Early 2001 the two founding members, Anthony Masington(Vocals/Lead Guitar) and Dan Pizzoferrato(Bass) have been playing together in various bands. It wasn't until 2003 when Anthony started a band called TRW. They played shows and just messed around most of the time, like a jam band. When they decided to get serious they moved on to finding a bass player, which comes in Dan. They went through guitar players until they were out of choices, and also went through drummers, but Dan and Anthony stayed constant. Anthony decided to ask a drummer he knew, named Chris Shade(Drums) to play with them. It turned out that Chris wanted to be in the band and they gladly accepted.</p>
<p>When Anthony decided to come up with a name with some meaning, instead of just TRW, he thought about it and he chose the one thing he could relate to. Time. At that period in his life he was having difficulties with friends, family, and himself, but it was all right before he knew it. When he thought back on those times that were too harsh to bare, he knew he had a band name. Time Refuses to Wait. It was plain, simple and to the point.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_creation_2006-05-09_0b88.html" title="Edit section: Eroscillator">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Eroscillator</span></h2>
<p>The Eroscillator is a <a href="../../../f/e/m/Female_genital.html" title="Female genital">female genital</a> stimulation device intended for theraputic and recreational purposes. It was invented by Dr Woog at LPA, Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Eroscillator comprises a sealed bronze/brown cylindrical plastic body, similar to but larger than an electric toothbrush, onto which interchangeable heads are clipped to provide different stimulation experiences. The unit has three speeds and is powered by a supplied, colour co-ordinated, combined plug/transformer unit that either is perminantly wired to the unit or, in later models, connects by a small plug and socket on the unit's end. Power selection is achieved by the user sliding a selector on the body of the unit.</p>
<p>The Eroscillator is endorsed by Dr <a href="../../../r/u/t/Ruth_Westheimer_9bb1.html" title="Ruth Westheimer">Ruth Westheimer</a> the world famous <a href="../../../s/e/x/Sex_therapist.html" title="Sex therapist">sex therapist</a>.</p>
<p>The original Eroscillator (Classic) was manufactured in France and was supplied with 4 interchangeable heads. This model was discontinued when manufacturing switched to China and the Eroscillator 2 was introduced. The Eroscillator 2 has been supplied in several variants, including the original Eroscillator 2, the Eroscillator 2 Plus (with increased power) and the Eroscillator 2 Top Deluxe with more heads and the higher power motor. The Eroscillator has also been sold as the Passionette (identical but black coloured plastic) most noteably by Dr <a href="../../../b/e/t/Betty_Dodson_b2bb.html" title="Betty Dodson">Betty Dodson</a>. An uprated system in a chrome case is also sold with different attachements for prostate stimulation and is branded as the Ooh-la-la!™ .</p>
<p>Though classed as a <a href="../../../v/i/b/Vibrator.html" title="Vibrator">vibrator</a> by many the Eroscillator does not vibrate. The clip on heads are instead swung rapidly from side to side at around 3600 cycles per minute by the oscillating motion of the driveshaft. The three power levels of the unit do not equate to speeds but rather angle of swing and intensity.</p>
<p>Users state the benefits of the Eroscillator over other vabrators/genital massagers as being quieter operation, no numbing effect on sensitive tissues, comfortable to hold, variety of sensations, safe to use as unit operates on low voltage, never runs out of power, does not heat up significantly in use.</p>
