<dd>A ghost bus terminal is not notable if it is merely a ghost bus terminal as you think it is. Bus terminals do have a history and do have an impact on local demography and social life too. As a geographer, I should be more than aware of this. We have had academic thesis written just on an otherwise seemingly non-notable bus interchange, and I wrote one of my academic papers analysing the history and geography of another bus interchange as well.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 12:03, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Well, then let's have wikipedia articles on the bus terminals <i>that there have been academic theses written on</i> and then we'll link to those theses, and then that explains their notability.

<dd>uh. yes, I can. Though they can be the same thing. To be precise, then, how long before a pole sticking out of the ground next to the road with a little London Transport or MUNI logo and a number gets its own article? <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 05:38, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Erm, then you obviously cannot tell the difference between a bus stop and a bus terminal in Singapore, because the two are never the same here. A bus stop numbers by the hundreds here, with each one merely a transition stop along roadsides and such and are sometimes as small as a single post from the ground. A bus terminal/interchange, however, is a large structure where at least one bus route terminates, along with the provision of adminstrative offices, berths, and large parking bays for buses. There are about 40 of these structures here. If you think we are calling for an article on a pole in the ground, then your concern is obviously unfounded.--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 16:31, 7 September 2005 (UTC)

<dd>I meant a bus station is a stop in a conventional sense, it is a stop on the route (even if it is the last one). In the sense you mean of course I can tell the two apart. I have spent more of my life than I like in bus terminals, and while I laud public transport I find myself unconvinced that a bus terminal deserves an article. This has nothing to do with Singapore, which has a good public trasnport system. It's a general concern. If this was about the bus terminal in <a href="../../../s/a/l/Salisbury.html" title="Salisbury">Salisbury</a> I'd feel the same way. But seems like I'm, well, maybe not a minority, but it seems that plenty of people disagree with me. But I will vote against poles in the ground. <a href="../../../s/a/b/User%7ESabine%27s_Sunbird_6181.html" title="User:Sabine's Sunbird">Sabine's Sunbird</a> 01:46, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Then let us take a look at just how big this "pole in the ground" is from space. I illustrate in the two images on the right <a href="../../../j/u/r/Jurong_East_Bus_Interchange_2687.html" title="Jurong East Bus Interchange">Jurong East Bus Interchange</a>, one of the articles also on the VFD. The first one shows the extent of the interchange compared to the typical sizes of your normal bus stop, and with an MRT station beside it. You can see the individual buses parked there, so that should give you an idea of its relative scale. Compare with the sizes of nearby buildings as well. Now, look at the second image, which shows its relative size to the entirety of the <a href="../../../n/e/w/New_town.html" title="New town">New town</a> it directly serves (which btw is a relatively small town compared to others in Singapore.) You can still see the terminal's shape clearly even at this scale.</dd>

<dd>I think it is plain clear from this illustration, that you are not talking about a stick in the ground, not just simply a "large bus stop", but a HUGE one. To say it is not worthy of being on wikipedia is like saying an airport is merely a bigger airstrip, a city a bigger village, a mountain a bigger lump of sand, and so on. Clearly, size is a relative factor which cannot be used as a determining factor alone. What I would like to know, however, is why this seemingly widespread discrimination against bus transport, as thou it and its related articles have less notability than their more facied cousins in aviation and rail transport etc. Again, why do we keep articles on airports (and airstrips), railway stations (and the smallest metro stations), and such, but not bus terminals (and no, I am not refering to bus stops)? Is this again an issue of physical scale? Or do people think somehow that bus transport do not have as much an impact on human civilisation than airplanes, ships, and trains do?--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 10:08, 12 September 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Your reaction in the wake of having someone else pointing out to you matter-of-factly that you are unable to support your nomination in a cohesive, factual, and verifiable manner is perhaps understandable. That you are an admin is probably not. I find it extremely odd, that the same person who thinks it appriopriate to pass condescending remarks on others, on their people, their city, and all that they represent should think he has the moral authority to tell others not to engage in personal attacks (which there was none as far as the church discussion was concerned).--<a href="../../../h/u/a/User%7EHuaiwei_49ed.html" title="User:Huaiwei">Huaiwei</a> 21:09, 8 September 2005 (UTC)</li>
