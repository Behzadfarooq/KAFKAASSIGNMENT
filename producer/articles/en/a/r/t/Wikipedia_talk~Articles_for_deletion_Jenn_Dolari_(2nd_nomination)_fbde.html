<p>I decided to open this page to discussion of this, as I think that everyone has a right to sound off, even if they don't want to vote. The issue here is that Jenn Dolari has personally asked to have her content removed, as it has been up for deletion six or seven times now. She no longer wants to play this game of cat and mouse. She would rather have her article deleted than have to keep dealing with it constantly. I firmly believe that the webcomics section of Wikipedia is too fiercely maintained and is being subjected to arbitrary popularity standards that do not actually indicate the relative popularity of a person or entity. There also seem to be Wiki Trolls that are going around and trying to systematically eradicate the webcomics section. These standards <i>need</i> to be changed so that, in the future, Wikipedia will be about inclusion, rather than exclusion. The whole concept of having an online encyclopedia is to include as much information as possible, not as little information as possible. This clique structure has pervaded Wikipedia so absolutely that it has become a mere popularity contest, not unlike YouTube, digg, and similar "web 2.0" platforms. This kind of kindergartenry has no business in society, and has no place on the Internet. Grow up. --JBladen 18:30, 25 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just to be fair, its not THIS article's sixth nomination. It's its second. But my comics have had two nominations (AWFW is gearing up for another one) and now this one has two. My reasoning is that there an anti-webcomics cabal that will so what they can to delete these things. And since I no longer want to have anything to do with WP, wouldn't it be nice to take over the VFD and kill it myself while proving my notability by having people come here based on just a red alert box on my comics page and LJ? If it stays, I win. If it gets deleted, I win. can't afford to pass up those odds. <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenn_Dolari_b236.html" title="User:Jenn Dolari">Jenn Dolari</a> 19:11, 25 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>This is literally the worst reasoning I have ever come across. Getting a bunch of fans to vote delete really doesn't prove your notability at all. This is like a guy telling his mates in a pub to vote delete on his article, it makes no actual difference to the outcome but obfuscates any possible keep votes they might have had. It means you're less notable than <a href="../../../d/a/n/Daniel_Brandt_7979.html" title="Daniel Brandt">Daniel Brandt</a>, who keeps on trying to get his entry deleted, but fails. Wow, you go girl! The anti-webcomics cabal are just applying uniform standards across the website spectrum, and aren't stooping down for webcomics, because of how inherently cool they are. 82.19.127.212 01:05, 4 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thank goodness that's over. Let me know when one of my comics gets deleted. I'll be happy to come back on again, and vote that one out of existence as well.&#160;:) <a href="../../../j/e/n/User%7EJenn_Dolari_b236.html" title="User:Jenn Dolari">Jenn Dolari</a> 05:27, 26 January 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Delete</b> Apparently there are people that feel the real person isn't an authoritative reference. That would make it seem they don't know themselves and that others know them better. Very pretentious if you ask me. Jenn wants this deleted, there fore it should be deleted. Why is that so hard to understand? - TheGreenLady 20:50 28 January 2007 (CST)</li>
<li>'"Delete'" I think Jenn Dolari is an outstanding person. For no pay (that I know of) she is showing the plight of m2f transsexuals, probably helping millions including the Tgirls and their friends and family. I have no idea what the politics of inclusion or exclusion are on Wikipedia. If Jenn wants a page (article,?) on her or her web comics deleted then the Wikipedia should delete it.70.162.21.208 22:23, 4 February 2007 (UTC)Renee M./ Biber '92 15:20 MST 2/4/07</li>
