<p>I get the feeling this might be an unpopular one, but I don't see anything notable about a particular given eclipse, that can't be summarised in the <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse.html" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> article itself.

<dd>I understand that just because it happened in 2006, more people want to read and write about it, but I think if we could write about all the eclipses that ever happened it would be a powerful resource.

<li><b>Merge</b> into List of solar eclipses article. The eclipse is now a historical eclipse and its only claim to noteworthiness is that it is the most recent total eclipse. Apart from being an eclipse, it is not particularly noteworthy from an astronomical point of view because it was not particularly long or short nor had particular historical events associated with it. By comparison, the longest total solar eclipse of the 20th century, 1991 July 11, does not have a separate article. This eclipse was well studied because the path of totality passed over major observatories in Hawaii, USA. The same criteria should be applied to other eclipse articles that are not significant from an astronomical perspective. The article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_1999_August_11_8d05.html" title="Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11">Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11</a> is only noteworthy because the line of totality passed over Europe, but in eclipse terms and from a global perspective the 1999 eclipse itself is not particularly noteworthy. Therefore the article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_1999_August_11_8d05.html" title="Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11">Solar eclipse on 1999 August 11</a> should also be considered for deletion or merging for the same reasons as the article <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_2006_March_29_a587.html" title="Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29">Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29</a>.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Events like these are rare and scientists pay a lot of attention to them. They may set up just another hypothesis based on observatories of a particular eclipse and that particular eclipse might be a milestone.

<li><b>Merge</b>, reiterating my own vote which wasn't clear when I opened the discussion.

<li><b>Keep</b>. The pics are amazing, and documenting solar eclipse is good, and I'm fine with this article. I think it is like saying that we shouldn't care about a random war.

<li><b>Keep</b>. Each Total Solar Eclipse is unique in its event. Conditions on the Sun and areas seen on Earth have a major effect on visibility of corona, photosphere and wisps etc. The occulation by the moon shows different effects as well. They rarely (not in a lifetime) happen in the same path of totality (let alone a same duration). Expand the report to cover path and duration spots. Secondary, as a memebr of the ASV <a href="http://www.asv.org.au" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.asv.org.au" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>] the recording of these events only serves to enrich our understanding of the events, for those located out of east travel range (not counting rich eclipse chasers).

<li><b>Questions</b> and <b>Comments</b>: For the good Wikipedians who are planning to vote for <i>Keep</i> or <i>Merge</i>, I have a few questions to aid you in your decision. Consider the criteria to use to determine whether particular total solar eclipses merit a separate article. If the vote is for <i>Keep</i>, there may be a case for creating more articles for individual eclipses. Should we create articles for other recent total solar eclipses? If so, which ones? When creating articles for individual eclipses, what selection criteria distinguishes a notable eclipse from a non-notable eclipse? Does the eclipse have to pass over a large populated area, or any populated area, or are all total solar eclipses notable regardless of the remoteness of the location? I feel that a vote for <i>keep</i> really means <i>keep -- and create more articles for particular eclipses</i>. Examples: There is no article for Solar eclipse on 11 July 1991 even though that eclipse was notable for being over 7 minutes long and by being particularly well observed by the astronomical community. A friend of mine saw the Solar eclipse on 4 December 2002 but that eclipse lacks an article. I experienced the Solar eclipse on 23 October 1976 from <a href="../../../m/e/l/Melbourne.html" title="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> but that eclipse also lacks an article. --<a href="../../../b/2E/d/User%7EB.d.mills_9f02.html" title="User:B.d.mills">B.d.mills</a> 07:03, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> or <b>Keep</b> (pending paradigm shift) because, whether it's supposed to be or not, enyclopedic information is based upon its impact on humanity (culturally, economically, scientifically, etc.). For example, take the 2005 hurricane season, you have the storms that affected the socio-economic status of some areas (Katrina) and those that didn't. You'll notice that those which did have seperate articles and those that didn't have smaller entries in the main 2005 Atlantic Hurricane Season article. Another example, the Olympics. Though its cultural impact lasts only for a short while, it still greatly impacts society for that short while, nonetheless. Eclipses should only have seperate entries if they make a noticeable, strong impact on humanity, unless you guys want an encyclopedic paradigm shift or something (which I kind of doubt by reading other comments). Other than that, all pertinent infirmation should go to either the list of solar eclipses or the main article. Sauvastika 20:39, 30 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> Whilst the moon passing in front of the sun is the same for every total eclipse, the path the eclipse follows, and which countries it visits, is unique. This, plus recording of the reactions of different cultures to the eclipse, is worth keeping.</li>
<li><b>Keep,</b> for all of the reasons thus far presented. Some have noted that other prior eclipse do not have a dedicated article - therefore, neither should should this one [of 2006 March 29]. However, the problem with this argument is that Wikipedia is ever expanding. In fact, nothing is stopping anyone from creating a new article for the 11 July 1991 eclipse right now. And I think it would be a good idea to have a page charting all known eclipses - to which this one can be linked. Stephenw77 01:41, 31 March 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> I think every solar eclipse deserves a separate article. Someone called it recentism, but I think even after 10 years it will be interesting to find some more information and pictures of an eclipse, than just list of countries, in random order, from which it was derectly observed. We should just make some kind of template for eclipses, which would include useful encyclopedic information, using, for example, <a href="../../../s/o/l/Solar_eclipse_on_2006_March_29_a587.html" title="Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29">Solar eclipse on 2006 March 29</a> as reference.

<li><b>Keep</b>. A whole different chunk of the world's population gets to see each eclipse and that's one reason why each one is an event.

<li><b>Keep</b>. All total eclipses are rare and significant enough to be notable.
