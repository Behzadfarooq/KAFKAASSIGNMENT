<li><b>Keep</b> I think an article just about string manipulation is warranted as it is a varied and complex topic. An article that covers the basics of string manipulation as well as the type of tools that exists and specific issues that are applicable to various programming languages can be a resourceful addition. This is a notable enough topic to have its own article. I don't think it should be included in the existing article on strings because of article size limits and because there is precedence for this kind of sub-topic to have it's own article. Maybe a rename with (computers) is in order though. The only explanation given for a redirect is that another article about strings exist, none of the issues I have raised have been addressed. I'd like the other voters to describe their computer programming language experience before their vote is considered. The article that people want to redirect to doesn't cover string <i>manipulation</i>. Perhaps we should also redirect <a href="../../../r/e/g/Regular_expressions.html" title="Regular expressions">regular expressions</a> too then yes? Also the article in question is a stub and should have a stub tag. (<a href="../../../b/t/i/User%7EBtipling_4d9e.html" title="User:Btipling">Bjorn Tipling</a> 20:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC))
<ul>
<li>I respectfully disagree. String manipulation falls into two broad categories. First you have the high-level approaches: these are already discussed in their own articles, and <i>those</i> are linked from the "String algorithms" section of <a href="../../../s/t/r/String_%28computer_science%29.html" title="String (computer science)">String (computer science)</a>. Second, you have the very low-level approaches. And those are very language-specific, or even implementation-specific. What middle ground can you identify that can actually support an entire article?
<p>Even if there is an encyclopedic article to be written on the subject, this isn't it. Anyone who can write one is welcome to - and will remain welcome to, and trivially able to, even if it is redirected. So nothing is lost by redirecting, while nothing is gained by keeping. — <a href="../../../h/a/e/User%7EHaeleth_3c01.html" title="User:Haeleth">Haeleth</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Redirecting an article because it's not up to a standard of quality is not warranted. What is warranted is that the article be improved. Ironically, in your argument to redirect you have given an example of the complexity of string manipulation. Had the information you have just provided been in the article from the beginning I doubt it would have ever been nominated for deletion. Perhaps instead of voting to delete or redirect you should vote to keep and improve the article.

<li><b>Keep</b> Please don't be so quick to dismiss this as spam, as just like The Wikipedia, the aim of RogueSci is the free spread of information, it is not the aim of this article's creator, myself, or any other RogueSci member to generate traffic for us or further any commercial gain, we seek merely to regain contact with people who beleive that RogueSci no longer exists due to censorship of the site by some ISPs, governments, e.t.c. Ezeu, if you'd actually took some time to read the article you'd have learned that the site itself is being blocked by several major ISPs, and that's why this article was started, it is by no means finished... I ask all of you to allow this article to remain for now, so that RogueSci can get in touch with its missing members and begin to do some serious work on this Wiki entry. We have a lot of good information to contribute, and are not seeking to simply spam this site or generate traffic for RogueSci. Sorry for not making an account (but no, I'm not the same person as 80.229.21.128), I'll get to that later, but it does say that anyone can contribute to an AfD discussion. I would also like to note as an afterthought that other such sites discussing similar information such as TOTSE.com are allowed Wiki entries, even when their content is of a lower level of intellect and more focused around the uses of such information for crime and vandalism, rather than being focused around scientific discussion and the spread of information. -Xyz, RogueSci.org 202.72.172.136 09:13, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Spam. This is an encyclopedia, not a link list for bomb makers. Opening the actual site doesn't give much confidence in the accuracy of this statement from their spokesman "around the uses of such information for crime and vandalism, rather than being focused around scientific discussion and the spread of information" Xyz.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quick check of the site brings up quite the opposite, I quote:</p>
<p>"The device is constructed out of (preferably) non-metallic materials, with a mechanical or chemical delay, inserted in the appropriate orifice (and it's non-gender-specific, so we're being equal-opportunity!), and locked into place. The device is such that, when locked, it expands to such a diameter as to be unremovable without surgery (assuming you're not using it on a fisting fetishist), and begins the timer or chemical reaction that will result, if not removed, in someones ass being seperated from their body in a spectaculary lethal manner." Nbk</p>
<p>"Hey, the hostages are expendable, so why does it have to be removable?" Xyz</p>
<p>I dont trust that legitamacy of this wiki entry, and its promotion of illegal, immoral activities.(waspt 22:27, 11 December 2005 (UTC)).</p>
<ul>
<li>The thread you have quoted above was an attempt to see things from the perspective of terrorists, to get inside their minds so to speak, and through that gain a deeper understanding of methods they may use. As such, it is totally out of context in the way you have used it. Think about it, if we really had terrorist intentions, would we post them on the internet for the whole world to see? I don't know about you Waspt, but I wouldn't. We don't promote illegal or immoral activity, we merely seek to discuss it and draw attention to it. Call it investigative journalism turned up a notch. Information should be free for everyone to know, because an informed population is one less susceptible to terror. RogueSci is also hardly a site "for bomb makers" as you put it, in fact, I challenge you to go and start a thread at RogueSci even so much as hinting at intentions of really making a bomb, just see how long it takes for your account to be banned and the thread closed. I am also by no means RogueSci's spokesperson, so please do not label me as such - I'm just someone who chooses to stand up for what I beleive is a worthy cause. -Xyz 202.72.172.136 07:07, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>If your not the "spokesman" then I'm not sure why you care. This entry seems to have ulterier motives as evidenced by the very thread generated in that forum to discuss creating a wiki entry. I pull a quote from the thread, which discusses the wiki:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>"It'd be great for keeping track of 'recipes' as, try as I might, it's damn near impossible to do so here. How many variations on the AP process alone? Christ...dozens, if not a hundred. Then sources for the process, testing for purity, VoD and expansion values, videos and pictures, etc., etc. All this is scattered over dozens of threads over the years. If it was all consolidated into just one Wiki entry, it'd be huge! Instead of telling a newbie to UTFSE (which isn't always helpful), you point them to a Wiki entry and let them learn on their own. If they follow the 'recipes' without killing themselves (which they shouldn't because our info is CORRECT), they'll be flush with success and want to tell someone about it. Where would they then go to?" Nbk</p>
<p>Its said within that very forum that this wiki entry is to be used to post "recipes" for people to follow, which I can only assume to be bomb recipes. I mean REALLY if you are going to abuse wiki to post bomb making recipes, you dont discuss it openly then link into it from here. Thats just dumb.waspt 10:12, 12 December 2005 (UTC)).</p>

<p>"Has anyone any thoughts about hosting an E&amp;W wikipedia site alongside the forum"</p>
<p>The key words here are 'hosting' and 'alongside'. The thread is suggesting that someone use software downloaded from the internet to host their own wikipedia and discussing what that should contain. Not that they should dump information onto wikipedia.org. There is even discussion as to where the site should be hosted! Noone there has suggested that the wikipedia.org entry should contain any methods of anykind at all. --<a href="../../../a/m/b/User%7EAmbix_7373.html" title="User:Ambix">Ambix</a> 10:30, 12 December 2005 (GMT)</p>

<li>Waspt, I already explained why I care, if you'd taken the time to read what I'd said. I don't have to be a spokesperson for something to support it. Ever heard of the phrase "When you assume you make an ass out of u and me"? For the last time, WE ARE NOT A SITE FOR BOMB RECIPES, even though TOTSE.com is, and yet you allow them a Wiki entry. As I said, I challenge you to go to RogueSci and ask about "bombmaking" without getting your account deleted and your IP range banned for good. Likewise, feel free to delete any "bombmaking recipes", whatever that means, that appear in our Wiki entry. If any do appear then they certainly won't have been added by any member of RogueSci. If this is about censorship, you will find larger quantities of far more detailed information about the manufacture and deployment of conventional explosives, nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, e.t.c. at the US Patent Office website than anywhere else on the web. Go censor them. -Xyz 07:14, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> Censoring RogueSci would be stupid, and the opposite of what Wikipedia stands for. Let the article develop. As for the complaints that bomb recipes might be posted, well, search for any common term for pretty much any explosive on wikipedia, and you get a result. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Explosive_chemicals" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Explosive_chemicals" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Explosive_chemicals</a> ) Try "nitroglycerin", and skip down to the "Preperation" section ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerine#Preparation" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerine#Preparation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerine#Preparation</a> ) If someone posts a recipe here, it should be moved to the right place, rather than causing this rather interesting thread to be killed.

We have edited the page. We do not feel as if this is advertising simply because we are attempting to build a history on the achievements that we have made and the contributions we've made to the industry. We have plenty of advertising so we did not intend this to be advertising. We have been a corner stone in the automotive performance and racing industry from it's inception in 1990. Many years PRIOR to the creatation of the store. We have a heavy back ground in RECORD BREAKING race cars and SHOW WINNING vehicles. It was not our intention to make this about advertising, rather to inform other enthusiasts of who we are and where we came from.

<p>dear UTC: is greatness the only way to be recognized?... how to verify "greatness"? is this the poin?... what if "great" was just applied as a generic qualifier for these four people?... fine! let's take "great" off... let's leave it there so that people may offer their comments on the subject! as a matter of fact, this is one of the points in having a wiki entry - to facilitate discussion on entries so that it may become a well established truth (or not) ...</p>
<p>on another level, what amazes me is that a fellow national (João Ricardo), who should know about ABATEJ by this time just comes in from out of the blue sentencing ABATEJ to the discredit of havis its entry DELETED! this man should be one of the many who is daily editing the entry on our president Lula da Silva, just for the fun of it...

<li>I think you mean me, CarbonCopy, not "dear UTC" - UTC is the timezone for Wikipedia times! While "greatness" is inherently subjective, one CAN provide evidence that someone is <i>regarded</i> as "great". Awards, reviews, published articles about an artist, academic works, even sales figures (although those are probably better evidence of popularity than greatness). Brazilian sources or international sources are fine by me - just some kind of third-party evidence. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> 20:09, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

They were Pogues-influenced and two of the Pogues even toured with them at one point, so their article will provide a link there anyway. <a href="../../../b/e/a/User%7EBearcat_ee37.html" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> 18:46, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>This is an important subject that is not often discussed. It is directly related to India's long tradition of permitting diversity of religious thought, and India's modern secularism.</p>
<p>The article needs to be expanded. I will add details and references. Rajput inscriptions and copperplates are the main source of direct information on this subject.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'm sorry. I was under the impression that the purpose of Wikipedia was to archive information, but I guess I was wrong. I did not realize that it was a large popularity contest, meant only for people who show up in Google. I mean, of course! Anything that doesn't show up in Google must not be information, eh? Well, I guess that <a href="../../../t/e/c/User%7ETechnostalgia_f69c.html" title="User:Technostalgia">Technostalgia</a> shoulden't have any info on him/herself in Wikipedia, seeing as it doesnt come up in Google.

<li>It's a legit term, but I agree that it's sure hard to tell. &#160;:) There may in fact already be an article on the subject somewhere around here. Might wind up making it a <b>redirect</b> if there is. - Lucky 6.9 06:33, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I think such a redirect would be confusing. To me, "Tuner (auto)" would mean a) A person who tunes the engine of an automobile; or b) The broadcast radio receiver fitted in an automobile. Create a disambig page if necessary. jmd</li>

<li>Good point. Looks like there's already a disambig at <a href="../../../t/u/n/Tuner.html" title="Tuner">tuner</a> and it covers the existing article. I'm going to look at this article to see if anything can be merged. - Lucky 6.9 07:05, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

I merged it there and, not entirely surprisingly, I was reverted. Apparently, merging with that article is only clutter there, and after reviewing it I tend to agree: Merging with the Union Jack article is inferior to keeping outright or deleting. Personally, I think the article's subject is too restricted, it is about part of a campaign of a fairly small organization so I recommend <b>delete</b>. If merged it will need to be more of a "smerge" (abbreviated merge). <a href="../../../s/j/a/User%7ESjakkalle_011f.html" title="User:Sjakkalle">Sjakkalle</a> <a href="../../../s/j/a/User_talk%7ESjakkalle_6e15.html" title="User talk:Sjakkalle"><small>(Check!)</small></a> 08:26, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>I dispute that they are <i>important</i>, they are not "proper" fan fiction (as per the post-Asimov Robot and Foundation-based books), they are small pamphlets of not many pages with no real story. That's my experience of others in the same series, anyway. There are plenty of significant crap books (I hate the Brontës as well but would vote keep on them without hesitation), and probably lots of excellent but insignificant ones. - <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 19:07, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hard to see how a trademark infringment occurs here; trademark protection is very much different from copyright protection. Trademark protection is intended to prevent someone from passsing off one product as another, and in no way prevents mention or use of the trademark in an encyclopedia article (unless Wikipedia was trying to pass itself of as another enclopedia...) Trademarks even frequently appear in advertising by competitors! I really wish "copyright violation" "trademark infrigement" "privacy violation" were not bandied around so much to justify deletes or as disguised objections to content. <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarbonCopy_758c.html" title="User:CarbonCopy">CarbonCopy</a> 21:39, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. For our purposes here, there's no difference between it being already released and yet-to-come. People are always making that distinction, but it's wrong. We're talking about providing information here. Information exists regardless of whether the album is released yet or not, so we provide it. The "crystal ball" argument is completely wrong, because we should only be dealing in verifiable information—predictions other people have made, and information that has been officially confirmed. So the only question is notability. Well, I think this is a notable subject. Christina is very famous and popular and there's plenty of talk about her next album. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:55, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I can see that point, but then theoretically the album could generate a huge buzz and yet not get an official title until a week or two before release; I think in this case we'd still want to provide the information. The issue of the title becomes irrelevant; the question is just the notability of the topic. I would think if an upcoming album is getting a lot of attention, we'd give it an article regardless of whether it's been officially given a title. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 11:13, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

If the only justification that the only supporter of the article is one solelly based on possible speculation, then it is obvious that there is no reason to keep the article.

<li><b>Comment</b> I believe that there is, in fact, a very strong difference. Wikipedia aims to be an <a href="../../../e/n/c/Encyclopedia.html" title="Encyclopedia">encyclopedia</a>. According to the definition, it's articles should bear important and relevant information on some subject. The article listed for deletion is purely speculation and rumors and I don't see how speculation and rumors can be considered important or relevant on any subject, let alone an encyclopedic article. Besides, I don't see how that article can ammount to something other than that: a source of rumors and speculation. When the album is released I don't see why it shouldn't be covered by a wikipedia article. Until then, I believe that it would be wise to leave the rumor-spreading and speculation-creation to webforums, blogs, IM chats and other related media of communication. --<a href="../../../m/e/c/User%7EMecanismo_bcb8.html" title="User:Mecanismo">Mecanismo</a> 11:26, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Wikipedia is about verifiable facts not verifiable rumours. If people want advance information on an album in production they should look at other mediums, such as blogs. An article entitled Christina Aguilera's third full-length English album does not belong in Wikipedia. When a release date is announced and the album is titled an article could be created. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 11:48, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

But we have an article on it...why? <i>Because it's a notable topic and information can be verifiable whether reporting past events or reporting what other people have said about future events, and past events relating to those future events.</i> I really get tired of the "crystal ball" stuff. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:41, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We know that there will be a U.S. Presidential Election because it is madated in the constitution. <s>But since you bring it up, notice that there is not an article entitled <a href="../../../2/0/0/2008_Presidential_Election_c75b.html" title="2008 Presidential Election">2008 Presidential Election</a>. That is because we don't know anything beyond the fact that it will take place.</s> We can speculate that certain political figures will run, but not in Wikipedia as encyclopaedias are no the place for speculation. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 00:40, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>We report other people's speculation. Like, duh! And my first point was a philosophical one—you don't really <i>know</i> any future events will take place. And here's another point—<i>even if Christina doesn't release a third album, the topic itself is still notable</i>—she's been recording, people have been talking about it, it's acquired a significant degree of fame, and a significant amount could already be written about it. So really it has nothing to do with the album being released or not. You need to base it on the subject's <i>notability</i>, that is to say, on the importance attached to it by people. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 05:30, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think we will have to agree to disagree. You think that because someone that is notable says they will do something it should be immediately placed into Wikipedia (I hope that I am not misintrepeting your position, if I am I apologise). I think we should wait until it has happened. <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 06:35, 11 December 2005 (UTC)

<dd>No, not necessarily. It depends on whether what is said amounts to notable information. (Also, I naturally regard <i>saying something</i> as an action, therefore that—the act of communicating—has already happened—it is in the past, and thus can't be speculation.) And to have an independent article you need a collection of notable info that would not fit properly into another article. It makes sense to me to have this as an independent article...I think any question about this should arise from whether to merge verifiable info, or keep it here as its own article (and we know it will eventually get one anyway, of course). I see no reason not to do the latter—I feel people are making arbitrary cut-off points, such as it having an official title, or being released. To me, what matters is that you have a collection of notable, verifiable info that works as an independent subject. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 10:27, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I see where you are coming from and I better understand your position, however I disagree that requiring an album to have a title is an arbitrary cut-off point. I think having a proper title is a key element to having an article. If a member of a royal family gets pregnant should we make an article called (using the <a href="../../../h/o/u/House_of_Orange-Nassau_d8f9.html" title="House of Orange-Nassau">House of Orange-Nassau</a> as an example) Prince Willem-Alexander and Princess Maxima New Baby or should we wait until it has a name? <a href="../../../m/o/v/User%7EMovementarian_d2cf.html" title="User:Movementarian">Movementarian</a> 18:24, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Article is promotional in nature, rather than encyclopedic. Band tours primarily the western US and seems to have a following west of the Rocky Mountains. Their albums are on independent labels (or home grown) and sold through their web site. Unless there's more to them, they seem to just miss the notability threshold, but the right piece of verifiable information can convince me to change my vote (after all, the <a href="../../../g/r/a/Grateful_Dead_1b8b.html" title="Grateful Dead">Grateful Dead</a> were notable before they sold records).

<li><b>Keep</b>. The subject had a career as a national journalist, wrote an autobiography regarding her life with Hemingway and was maried to Hemingway.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Sorry to rant, but I expect anyone voting keep or delete to provide a decent *reason* for their vote. Quoting from <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>'s list of arguments isn't good enough. AfD is a debate, not a vote. That's why it was renamed. Quoting from both sides of the arguments subpage in <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a> does not constitute a debate. <a href="../../../j/o/h/User%7EJohnleemk_41e5.html" title="User:Johnleemk">Johnleemk</a> | <a href="../../../j/o/h/User_talk%7EJohnleemk_fb71.html" title="User talk:Johnleemk">Talk</a> 10:25, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Weak delete</b>, no references or verifiability. They can recreate it once these are covered. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStifle_6acd.html" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> 23:55, 11 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Keep</b> or <b>Merge</b> into school district or town if article is both below three sentances and lacks any sort of illustration, boxed info-template or picture when AFD is closed. This school, like all others, is an important public institution and should be written about somewhere, even if it cannot sustain an article on it's own. Presently people do create school articles containing neutral, verifiable information and it is impossible to delete them, even though many have a desire to do so. Rather than striving for an impossible consensus to delete any given school article, I feel it is always preferable and takes much less energy to merge the text of the article into an article about a suitable habitation or administrative unit: a city, county or state, or a school district of local education authority of other school system, while taking care not to delete the information contained in the article. If the article is merged, the current location should be replaced by a redirect, and the edit history maintained for future use. This is the baseline consensus that I feel was reached at <a href="../../../s/c/h/WP%7ESCH_9ed8.html" title="WP:SCH">WP:SCH</a>. <a href="../../../h/i/p/User%7EHipocrite_bee6.html" title="User:Hipocrite">Hipocrite</a> - <a href="../../../h/i/p/User_talk%7EHipocrite_6b44.html" title="User talk:Hipocrite">«<small>Talk</small>»</a> 04:17, 12 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is an unusual nomination. I am the original creator of this page, but I am not (repeat, not) saying it should be deleted. Nor am I saying it should be kept. I am <b>abstaining</b> from voting on this page. I am submitting it to AfD because it is the only page I have created where I feel a slight twinge of guilt for having done so. Some days I think it's a perfectly valid article that needs a little cleanup. Other days I suspect it probably should be deleted altogether.

<p>This page is very close to being a CSD, but I've decided to go the slow route. At first it looks like a NN-bio (collector of pop music and culture), but the last sentence seems to indicate that he's a writer. If that's the case though, I can't find a work he's published or a periodical that employs him. This page is going to either need a serious rewrite (starting with some context in which to place this person), or be deleted. <a href="../../../b/a/c/User%7EBachrach44_302c.html" title="User:Bachrach44">Bachrach44</a> 14:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Reason why the page should be deleted The word "concept" can be applied to any invention in history. All music has an underriding concept, even if the concept is to please the audience.

<dd><b>Disagree</b>. The reason it's the first hit is because Wikipedia has made-up the concept of a concept album.

<dd><b>Comment</b>: The idea of a concept album exists outside of Wikipedia. Any album that does not have a story running from one song to the next across the entire album is not a concept album.

<dd><b>Comment</b> The first paragraph pretty much explains that a concept album is an album in which the songs are tied together with an overall concept. It also says rightly that there isn't a precise definition. There are a lot of albums that aren't concept albums, because although the artist may have 'conceived' of the album and the individual songs, the songs deal with unrelated concepts. Asking for a list of non-concept albums is like asking for a list of all non-christmas oriented albums. This specific term has been around since at least the 1970's. It's a great article and a <b>real</b> category of music/albums. -Cranialhotfudge 23:01, 8 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> It goes without saying that every album has some type of underlying theme, even if it is that the songs happen to be on the same album together. This is simply common sense. The idea of a concept album has been widely used since Sgt. Pepper's, and although I think some albums on the list are somewhat of a stretch to qualify as a true concept album, that does not mean that it should be deleted.</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep.</b> I'm trying to avoid an <i>ad hominem</i> attack by finding <i>any</i> reason why the deletion idea has merit. I can't.

<p>This article appears to be completely unverifiable. "Catchbasin" or "Catch Basin" is not to be found in any online directory of Californian cities and towns, including the <a href="http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp" class="external text" title="http://nationalatlas.gov/natlas/Natlasstart.asp" rel="nofollow">National Atlas</a>. There is a Catch Basin well in Arizona and a Catch Basin dam in Pennsylvania, but no town. Googling for the name plus "1898", the supposed year of founding, yields nothing (that is, plenty of catch basins, but no towns). The assertion that this small town is a "sister city" of <a href="../../../p/e/n/Pensacola%2C_Florida_d556.html" title="Pensacola, Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a> seems to be plainly false, if the information at <a href="http://www.pensacolasistercities.org/" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.pensacolasistercities.org/" rel="nofollow">[36]</a> is correct. This is either an article about a very small and hard to find town, or a <a href="../../../n/i/h/Nihilartikel.html" title="Nihilartikel">Nihilartikel</a>. I'd like to find out the former is the case, but I wouldn't want this article to stick around indefinitely while we wait. <a href="../../../j/r/m/User%7EJRM_b3bc.html" title="User:JRM">JRM</a> · <a href="../../../j/r/m/User_talk%7EJRM_8782.html" title="User talk:JRM">Talk</a> 16:33, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>That works for me; I think that was the recommendation of the <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_September_11%2C_researchers_0575.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/September 11, researchers">Previous AfD</a>.

That never happened, and the articles developed for a while as different versions of the same topic. I found it a few weeks ago and finished the merge, but there is a question now whether <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> should be kept, since it has developed independently since the last AfD.

</li>
<li><b>Delete</b>, because the merge recommended by the previous deletion has been completed. I think I need to make some things clear as well, since Durin and Tom are obviously unaware of some things that I did:
<ul>
<li>In response to the consensus favouring a merge after the last discussion, I tagged <a href="../../../s/e/p/September_11_researchers.html" title="September 11 researchers">September 11 researchers</a> for a merge with <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a>.</li>
<li>When nothing happened, I moved the article to <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_September_11_researchers_9e36.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers">9/11 conspiracy theories/September 11 researchers</a>, to make it clear that it was there only temporarily and could be deleted once the merge was complete.</li>

<li><b>Merge</b> - Yeah the <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> bit at least recognises the <a href="../../../s/a/d/Saddam_Hussein_75a3.html" title="Saddam Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> theory. I said it was Saddam Hussein from the moment the planes flew in, and I don't get why people think its so hard to believe. The 9/11 one mentions it, whilst this other one doesn't. That theory should be expanded a fair bit though. Oh, also, I saw no mention of anti-globalisation terrorist group S11 being a theory. They were widely blamed, and the group was totally destroyed as a result. Oh and don't forget China. China had a motive to do it, so as to destroy the American economy to precipitate an invasion at a later date. After all, China was very annoyed at America then after they had shot down one of China's spy planes, and China is America's biggest challenge to world dominance, and the most likely country to take over control. These 2 theories do need to be mentioned.

The <a href="../../../9/2F/1/9_11_conspiracy_theories_6f05.html" title="9/11 conspiracy theories">9/11 conspiracy theories</a> article is way too long at 76 KB, so there's no good reason for the list not to be split off as a separate article (not a section or a subpage).

<p><b>Closer's notes</b><br />
Some editors said both delete and redirect; ultimately the consensus was that the content already existed in the relevant article (<a href="../../../c/r/e/Creation-evolution_controversy.html" title="Creation-evolution controversy">creation-evolution controversy</a>), and that the poll did not warrant its own article. Thus no merge or redirect was performed, and these comments tended to be counted as deletes.<br />

<li>What gives you that idea? How do you describe yourself as -- what was it, "Wikipedia's foremost expert on NPOV"? -- and not realize that proportion plays a role?

<li><b>Deletion is best</b>. A redirect is OK by me also, if it helps build consensus.

<li><b>Comment</b>. Not sure why we need a running tally, but it sure seems misleading to me to count the redirect voters as a keep. By saying redirect, some editors are saying that this article should not exist on its own. Interpreting that as "keep" is extremely questionable in my opinion. I'm clarifying my comments for the benefit of whoever closes this Afd. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:04, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I agree. There is still no consensus but the "score" is 1 keep, 2 redirect, 2 delete. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 19:15, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If policy has changed from "redirects count as keep", then I owe someone an apology. Last time I read the deletion guidelines, the only choices were Keep or Delete. (When did it change?) <a href="../../../e/d/_/User%7EEd_Poor_ed4e.html" title="User:Ed Poor">Uncle Ed</a> 19:20, 9 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Lately, those who are good at closing Afds have been using actual human judgement and common sense, not simple vote counting, to interpret the results. <a href="../../../f/r/i/User%7EFriday_fd29.html" title="User:Friday">Friday</a> <a href="../../../f/r/i/User_talk%7EFriday_be56.html" title="User talk:Friday">(talk)</a> 19:21, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ed, saying "redirect" cannot be read as "keep" although it is clearly not "delete". Make sense? Otherwise, you would read my "neutral" as "keep" merely because it isn't "delete", right? Of course not. The result as of now is no consensus to delete (this is "for deletion", after all and not "AfK"). You could always rework it as: "Delete: 2, Not for Deletion: 3" or some such to be accurate but I don't think adding a tally is appropriate to any AfD. - <a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">Tεx</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User_talk%7ETexture_2199.html" title="User talk:Texture"><font color="blue">τ</font></a><a href="../../../t/e/x/User%7ETexture_fd4f.html" title="User:Texture"><font color="red">urε</font></a> 19:29, 9 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I hope the people who do close this take into consideration the nature of my vote. Gallup is a respected polling organization and its findings are usually meaningful.

<li><b>Keep</b> only if majorly rewritten: this is actual a fairly famous poll, in that it has been given over the course of many years (starting in 1982 I think). I'm not sure why this article only focuses on the 2001 version, because there was a more recent one given (with the same questions) in August of 2005. I even updated one of the articles here on WP (that Uncle Ed was involved in) that was using these 2001 numbers with the more recent version. It might be nice to have a page that shows this poll in historical context as well, which is much more valuable than a single snapshot point in time. A page discussing creationism polls in general might be even more useful. for example, <a href="http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=118" class="external text" title="http://people-press.org/commentary/display.php3?AnalysisID=118" rel="nofollow">this page</a> is nicely done, and adds some nice context to the Gallup poll. <a href="../../../t/u/r/User%7ETurnstep_b3bf.html" title="User:Turnstep">Turnstep</a> 15:28, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I look up "incremantlism" it says "do you wish to edit", I think maybe it would be a good idea to have an entry, I see get a first line out, then ten bikers jump on me - out of the darkness! If you don't want people to contribute then why invite them to join you? You'd thought people would want to help develop good articles rather than abort them at birth ---- The point I'm making is that whether or not "incrementalism" is a worthwhile entry, if this is the way you treat newcomers, then I am horrified. I personally don't like putting myself up as a tin-can to be shot at - it may not seem like that to you - but it does to me - and I presume to 100s of other people who could make worthwhile contributions.

<li>I don't know what that means? I was going to put my entry in context. I heard on radio4 today, about Wiki, I'd come across it quite a few times, but I think the comments on radio 4 that "every page ought to have a 'under construction'" badge gave me the impression that I might be able to in some contributions. One under "Bliar", I in retrospect was inappropriate - but I still hadn't a clue why someone kept wiping it! I would have thought that new articles would be categorised as "under construction" - then "for review" then finally "for publication". I've found it very difficult to find my way around this site - and the tutorials weren't much help (but I never read instruction manuals so its probably me). As for "incrementalism", it is years since I was last involved in this type of work &amp; perhaps I'm taking on too much trying to put together an entry that will satisfy the critics!

<li><b>Delete</b> per nom, with regret, unless fixed. Although the nominator is correct, in theory I think this could be fixed if the author could supply good source citations to show that the distinctions he's making are <i>not</i> original. I think it is possible that one could tell almost the same story essentially in the form of linked quotations from recognized authorities. The current debate on evolution is my worst nightmare because it is characterized by dogma and lack of clear thinking and intellectual honesty on both sides.

<li><b>Keep</b>: The site generates no money, and therefore, cannot be considered a giant advertisement! It is an information site. The site's focus is on cataloging television shows from the birth of television to now. It's database is fast and growing. It is what many consider the best alternative to Tv.com's highly inaccurate guide. Tv.com I might add, is filled with flash ads. Tv.com is the site that should be deleted from wikipedia, for being one giant ad site with bad information. There is no reason for TVRage to be deleted. The only reason it's even up for consideration is because people from CNET probably complained until someone finally gave in and said yes.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: There is nothing wrong with it.</li>

This IP removed the AfD tag, and the article went without it for 30 hours. Your disrespectful behaviour is not welcome here. Please go away. You guys asked, "<i>If <a href="../../../t/v/2E/Tv.com.html" title="Tv.com">tv.com</a> can stay at wiki, why cant tvrage.</i>" Answer: TV.com has 726 Alexa rank, 89 million Google hits, and has mention in various reliable sources and over 500 wikipedia articles. TVrage? What's that? I ask: "<i>Is the article a <u>contribution</u>? Will Wikipedia</i> gain <i>from an article from the site, or the other way around</i>?" Answer this before saying "keep" again. --&#160;<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 01:35, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: I say keep. I don't represent either site, I'm justa former editor for TvTome who is retired. To reply to the above, the only reason TV.com has the hits it gets is because for months, it was the ONLY television site on the net, coped with the fact that it started off with TvTome's share of frequent visitors. And if you were to break down those hits, most of them are from people who are clicking the old TvTome links. PLUS, it's membership system is linked to the rest of Cnet's sites, generating 1/3rd of it's usership by force alone. If that site were to have started cold, it would be low in numbers as well. Plus, TVrage is not the only small televison website you've allowed to remain here. Sites like EPGuides and TV IV get just as low of visitorship, and you keep them around. TVrage is in the exact same place TvTome was 3 years ago. In time, it will be competing with TV.com on a major level. As far as benefits go, in full honesty, I don't see how Wikipedia benefits from ANY of the info on its site. Nor do I see how TV.com's listing benefits you. I'd really like to see if you're getting 89 million hits through your listing of them here. You don't charge, there are little to no ads... this place is one giant reference library for the world. To deny information based on Google hits and how it benefits you in the longrun is just plain biast. If TVrage were a porno site, I'd agree with you. But it's not. It's a television library and archive that is growing twice as fast in info as TV.com is daily. Yeah, they have a large library to catch up on, but TV.com's submission process and constant problems isn't helping them stay on top either. Give it three months and watch the site grow. If it doesn't do anything for you, put it back up for deletion and see how that goes. If it keeps growing, leave it be. I really don't see what the problem here is. --GenuineMind--</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: We are not at tv rage to seek salvation nor are we their to mock tv.com, even though it should be... TV Rage is a user friendly site, and for wiki to just delete it off of this site, well it's just demeaning. -Batman Beyonder.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>: Why should this be deleted? It's a real site with real information!</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- When are you guys deciding to keep or deleting this, or are you waiting for more "Deletes". (Perfecto probably works at Tv.com)</li>
<li>Well, Epguides has no article here. <a href="../../../t/v/_/TV_IV_0015.html" title="TV IV">TV IV</a> barely survived deletion last month. (It had <i>one</i> major media coverage.) Your other points get no argument from me, though. But now that I've put time to examine the site for merit, I'll put my vote. <b>Delete</b> — fails <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>: no national or international media attention; zero verifiable impact outside its user community; Alexa rank 1,560,223; "link:tvrage.com" give nn results; finally, article itself does not assert any notability. --&#160;<a href="../../../p/e/r/User%7EPerfecto_bf9a.html" title="User:Perfecto">Perfecto</a> 02:54, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>- The site is one month old and is establishing itself. How do you expect international attention when they've barely had time to establish national attention? But it does catalog international shows, which will bring in international appeal. Impact, again, needs time. And the article is notable from a legal standpoint. Tv.com announced they owned all the rights to information posted on its site. AND, that they would seek legal action against any further websites who tried to start up. In other words, they wanted to cover the market. However, the site is an information site and is posting OTHER people's copyrighted material. TVrage is the first site to defy them and point out that they have no legal ground to stand on. If they hadn't stood up for themselves and other sites existing, they'd be dead by now. Again, give them three months and let them grow. See where they stand after that time. --GenuineMind--

<dd>Hi there! Wikipedia is not to be used to ESTABLISH notoriety, as your post seems to suggest.

<li><b>Comment</b>- On the contrary, several articles on your site have been used to establish notoriety. Tv.com in itself is a perfect example. Only up for 6 months, popularity only driven by it's predicessor, and it's staying? Don't tell me that site came under review and stayed. Pretend Wikipedia was back in 1994, and Nirvana just ended. Would you have posted an artticle on the Foo Fighters 6 months after Cobain's death? I think not. I've reviewed the WP:WEB three times now. And every time a new argument is presented, I counter act it. Then a new set of them come up, as if you're reaching for straws hoping to find the right one. It just feels as if this page was singeled out for deletion, and nothing we say can prevent it. Despite the 3-1 ratio of "Keep" votes from people not working for Wikipedia. Despite the fact that you agreed with me on many of my points. And despite the fact that no matter what what we say, you're not giving the website a chance to grow for a while and come under review. I know someone brought this site to your attention and demanded it be deleted. Even I can't believe you would just happen to trip over it and decide this rock needs to go. It just feels a little too suspicious, especially after Tv.com's director declaired they were raging war on TVrage. --GenuineMind--

<dd>Hi there! We love conspiracy theories here at Wikipedia, so if you could provide more details, we'd appreciate it! Your post suggests that you're not familiar with <a href="../../../t/i/n/WP%7ETINC_0d39.html" title="WP:TINC">WP:TINC</a>, I hope you find value! As a note, anonymous votes from users who have not created accounts or have few edits are usually disregarded, so the 3:1 ratio you mentioned isn't going to be as helpful as you think. I hope you can come out the other side of this matter intact and continue to contribute to Wikipedia! Your passion can be focused, and I look forward to seeing your future articles on subjects that meet notability requirements. - <a href="../../../c/h/a/User%7EChairboy_157e.html" title="User:Chairboy">C<small>HAIRBOY</small></a> (<a href="../../../c/h/a/User_talk%7EChairboy_882d.html" title="User talk:Chairboy">☎</a>) 03:56, 13 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b>- I really wish I could, but my heart lies with my real job and other projects I'm more passionate about. If you paid me, I'd join in a heartbeat, but I doubt you pay. And even if you did, at this point I'm really disheartened by this. I'm hard working and very accurate, but I can't put my energy behind a site that seems biast. I mean, why not examine every TV related site? In essence, aren't all of them using you as a promotion site to gain notoriety? Especially when TV.com is one giant ad, and has done nothing to help you back. I'm not accusing anyone of being bribed, more along the lines of someone being harrassed or persuaded by someone over there. Plus, you haven't really given an indication that the site would be allowed back, or given any options to them on how they can come back or stay. Further supporting the idea that this site was picked to be removed for good. It's just wrong. And if this is how your website is going to be, I don't see a point in supporting it or adding to it. And the real shame of that is, no one will see this poor example of management. This conversation will be deleted right along with it and no one will see why it was removed or how this conversation went. So not only will it be deleted, but there will be no record of why it was deleted, and how it went down. Again, it's just wrong. --GenuineMind--</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't know why this would be deleted. It exists therefore can be included in Wikipedia. As a member of both tv.com and tvrage.com , I can attest to the fact everything mentioned by the author of the Wikipedia entry is accurate.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>- I know this is impossible to ask, but could we get one single comment from someone who isn't involved with either of the feuding websites, and just give an honest opinion of the page and the site posted? And again, how does the site qualify as Spam? We make no money, we don't advertise, we don't sell products, no pop-ups, and no email scams. It's a media library, without the media.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: TVRage is getting more and more known by the day and in time will surpass TV.com TV.com isn't a very valuable tool if you are looking for guides on TV series, but TVRage is. It isn't fair to keep TV.com and remove TVRage. If you want to remove Rage, they both should go.</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>: TVRage is one of the most informative television sites around these days, and while the forum moderators are lenient, that doesn't mean they allow spam. They just have a better way of going about it by locking the spam threads, rather than deleting them and taking them into Area 51 like they never happened. Some, of course, are deleted if a spammer makes threads that cover the whole first page, but other than that, they confront spam, not ignore it. TV.com could learn from TVRage.</li>

<p>"This is a very poorly written stub. The original author used a lot of passive voice, and therefore cited no sources. The only links were to the different pages on the commercial website (I went ahead and deleted those).

<p>Here's a sentence that should not be in any encyclopedia anywhere:</p>
<p>It is not known how much their products cost, but their products are only available to companies. The price range for a basic forum is said to be anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000, with 1,000 pages views being said to range anywhere from $1000 to $2000.</p>
<p>The first part "It is not known how much their products cost..." is nonsensical and false. The customers know how much they spend. The sales force in the company knows how much they sell.</p>
<p>Following that with "but their products are only available to companies." is just amazingly bad grammar. Perhaps the author meant to say, "The forums aren't available to the general public, and according to "So and So, a representative of the company, the forums may cost a company between x and y dollars", or something like that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the original author could have sent an email to the company, stating that they were doing research for an article on Wikipedia and wished to know a basic price range. I'm sure that someone in the company could have given them some information, but maybe that counts as original research.</p>
<p>Then they continue the nonsense with "price range for a basic forum is said to be...", who said it, and if someone said it, why aren't they mentioned and the source provided?</p>
<p>And the next "...with 1000 page views being said...", which begs the question who said it? And is it1000 page views per day, per month, per hour? I argue that these two sentences do not belong, as they are written, in any Encyclopedia anywhere. And no editor has felt compelled to either delete them or rewrite them (and I'm not volunteering, except to delete them). Take those two sentences away and you're left with nothing. Plus, it's just my personal opinion, the number of google hits a phrase gets is a terrible metric for determining whether or not an article belongs. Simply because, more and more, Wikipedia is used as a source for a hit. So why not delete, and if someone is so bothered by that, let them recreate it and write a better article. <a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7ETheRingess_7faf.html" title="User:TheRingess">TheRingess</a> 01:49, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Re: the above comments:</b>I think the individuals above are expressing non-rational reasons with a fair degree of emotional opinion for deleting this page. I hardly think "a bunch of non-notable luvvies" is a considered and reasonable reason to remove an item from the site. Including jokes within the comment (e.g. "consigned to the prop store") shows a lack of reasonable and considered argument. If these comments were more considered I would be more inclined to take on board their criticisms and possibly remove the text myself. But in light of the nature of the comments posted, I am both offended by their ignorance and blatant predjudice and also rather dismayed that this supposedly "open" resource is seemingly rather less open than perhaps it would seem. Incidentally, I also contributed an article about David Tristram, the playwright. Do you want to delete that too?? --Hackjo 09:00, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Ecuadorean woman, 116, is world's oldest person Fri Dec 9, 2005 2:10 PM GMT Printer Friendly | Email Article | RSS</p>
<p>By Tim Castle</p>
<p>LONDON (Reuters) - A 116-year-old Ecuadorean woman was declared the oldest person in the world on Friday, lifting the title from a U.S. woman previously thought to be the oldest person alive, Guinness World Records said.</p>
<p>Maria Esther Capovilla was confirmed as the oldest living person after her family sent details of her birth and marriage certificates to Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>"We only told her yesterday she was the new Guinness world record holder," Kate White, brand manager at the records publisher told Reuters. "We hadn't heard of her before."</p>
<p>"She's in very good health, she's got good sight, is able to read the papers and watch television, and doesn't walk with a stick," White added.</p>
<p>Capovilla was born in Guayaqull in western Ecuador on September 14, 1889, and lives there today with her daughter-in-law and son.</p>
<p>She had five children, and has four grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and two great-great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Her husband died in 1949.</p>
<p>White said Capovilla had been asked what she thought about the changes she had seen over her life.</p>
<p>"She said she disliked the fact that presently it's acceptable for women to pursue men. And she said that every day she thanks God that she's alive," White said.</p>
<p>As a girl at the turn of the century one of Capovilla's favourite pastimes was going to parties, where she never drank alcohol.</p>
<p>At the time it was the custom for women just to touch the rim of the glass with their lips without drinking, as a sign of accepting hospitality, her family told Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Bolden, from Memphis, Tennessee, born August 15, 1890, had previously been regarded as the oldest living person.</p>
<p>Edith "Judy" Ingamell, 111 years old, from Enfield north of London, became the oldest woman in Britain after the death on Wednesday of the previous title holder Lucy d'Abreu, Guinness World Records said.</p>
<p>D'Abreu, who lived to 113, attributed her longevity to a daily dose of brandy and dry ginger ale.</p>
<p>Emiliano Mercado Del Toro, from Puerto Rico, born August 21, 1891, is the world's oldest living man, aged 114, says Guinness World Records.</p>

<p>Lengthy article about some "online comic made with the Half-Life 2 engine". The only people apparently interested in writing the article haven't touched it in 5+ months, and in that time, the site hosting the comic, as well as the apparent fansite and archive, seem to have shut down permanently. I can't find anywhere else where this thing is hosted. So basically, this is an abandoned article about an abandoned webcomic. <a href="../../../w/2E/m/User%7EW.marsh_88b4.html" title="User:W.marsh">W.marsh</a> 21:23, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>This is a recurring character in a popular fictional universe.

<p>I've thought long and hard about this. There are, for me, at least four fundamental problems with this list. First, the historical context of anti-semitism changed fundamentally after 1945, and it is not possible to compare pre-war and post-war anti-semitism. Second, the degree of anti-semitism expressed is subjective. Some have been removed as not provably anti-semitic, but that leaves everyone else who has ever made a disparaging comment about the Jewish people lumped to gether with Hitler in a sort of listcruft-meets-<a href="../../../g/o/d/Godwin%27s_Law_5a9a.html" title="Godwin's Law">Godwin</a>. Third, this is precisely the kind of thing categories are for. Editors on an article will notice and revert an inappropriate category; they may well not see addition to a list. Fourth, it seems to me arbitrary to pick anti-semitism. Many of those listed were equal-opportunities bigots, equally vile in their attitude to black people, ethnic Slavs or whatever. So I think this is a flawed concept, not least becaiuse I fail to see how this might have any positive purpose in the context of an encyclopaedia. Other than pursuing a witch hunt, what reason could there be for this list? Surely a few well-chosen articles are quite sufficient to demonstrate the phenomenon of anti-semitism. <a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__a7ee.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?">Just zis <span style="border: 1px; border-style:solid">&#160;Guy,</span> you know?</a> <sup><a href="../../../j/u/s/User_talk%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__2906.html" title="User talk:Just zis Guy, you know?">[T]</a></sup>/<sub><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Just_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__6a7d.html" title="Special:Contributions/Just zis Guy, you know?">[C]</a></sub> <a href="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" class="external text" title="http://www.chapmancentral.co.uk" rel="nofollow">(W)</a> <i><a href="../../../j/u/s/User%7EJust_zis_Guy%2C_you_know__AfD_f1be.html" title="User:Just zis Guy, you know?/AfD">AfD?</a></i> 23:35, 9 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Responding to the criticism above: The context of anti-semitism has changed, but so has the concept of sexuality, nationality, and race but we have lists of famous gays, Belgians (including those who lived before Belgium was a nation), etc., etc. The degree does not seem to matter in any other list (we don't ask how 'gay' was someone to be listed, or how 'Belgian'). This is an interesting category in that anti-Semitism has been a force that transcends time, place, and other boundaries that bring a really interesting mix of names to the list...like the list of left handed people would do...And yes, some on the list would fit into many other categories but that is not the issue: we don't delete famous left handed gay Belgians from 2 lists and arbitrarily leave them on one that we choose? <a href="../../../c/a/r/User%7ECarlossuarez46_547f.html" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> 00:09, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Slur-fest. It is impossible to list people as anti-Semites without associating them with Hitler. Coverage of this subject needs <i>a lot</i> of context.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Not an easy vote but a firm one. Some subjects just aren't suitable for list format and this is one of them. An article tracing the history of antisemitism would be useful. A category could be appropriate. I find it irresponsible - bordering on disturbing - to see <a href="../../../b/o/b/Bobby_Fischer_d4b3.html" title="Bobby Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a> classed alongside <a href="../../../a/d/o/Adolf_Hitler_fdc0.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 00:35, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> The information isn't relevant enough. List of Anti-Semetic authors, or List of Anti-Semetic works is something that could provide a jumping off point into content that would allow for the development of an understanding of something specific by an interested reader. But, just a list of anti-semites doesn't have any significant information or benefit that I can see. It's too general and vague. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexbrennen_4a5e.html" title="User:Alexbrennen">V. Alex Brennen</a> 03:27, 10 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>. I don't see how proper context and citation can be added to (and maintained) this article while it is in list form.
