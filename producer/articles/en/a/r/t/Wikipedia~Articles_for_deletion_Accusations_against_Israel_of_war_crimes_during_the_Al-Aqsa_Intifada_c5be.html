<li><b>Keep or merge</b>. This should be merged to or already exists at <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>? That article doesn't even <i>mention</i> these allegations - actually, now that I think about it, I think <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> <i>itself</i> is violating NPOV (I note that it's been tagged as such). Have a look for yourself. Do a search in that article for the phrases "war crime" and "allegation" and see what you get (excluding the link to this AfD'd article):</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"war crime"&#160;: Not a single mention.</dd>
<dd>"allegation"&#160;: Mentioned a few times, but all in relation to allegations of <i>Palestinian</i> misconduct. We've got:
<ul>
<li>A link to "EU investigation into Allegations of Incitement to Violence in Palestinian Authority textbooks".</li>
<li>Some "false allegations of a massacre of thousands of Palestinians" that were later disproved</li>
<li>Photo caption: the shooting of a 12-year old Palestinian that was "surrounded by allegations of staging."</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The subject matter - documented allegations - is worthy of inclusion in an encyclopedia, we just need to make sure those allegations are <i>addressed</i> in a NPOV manner. The one concern I have about merging this into the main article is size - the main page is 69 KB already. If it's decided to combine all the offshoot articles back into the main one, and turn it into one massive NPOV article, I suppose that'd be fine, as long as other offshoots like <a href="../../../c/h/i/Child_suicide_bombers_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict_4449.html" title="Child suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict">Child suicide bombers in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</a>, <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_5614.html" title="List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada">List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</a>, and <a href="../../../t/h/e/The_lynching_in_Ramallah_0098.html" title="The lynching in Ramallah">The lynching in Ramallah</a> are similarly merged back in. If it's decided that that'd make the main article too large, all the offshoots should be kept separate. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 11:33, 9 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> The subject matter may be encyclopaedic, but a page that singles out one side is almost the definition of an NPOV violation. I would like to see allegations of both sides given their own section on the main page, and only if they become too large should there be a subpage, but one in which they appear together. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 19:18, 9 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I'd be perfectly happy with a combined allegations page for both sides - mention all the allegations on the <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> main page, then link off to the allegations page for more description. As long as both sides' allegations are treated the same way. While on the subject of allegations, I think it's a bit POV for <a href="../../../a/l/-/Al-Aqsa_Intifada_8589.html" title="Al-Aqsa Intifada">Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> to have only two photos - one of a confirmed Palestinian suicide bombing, and one of an Israeli shooting that was alleged to be staged. Aren't there any photos around of verified Palestinian casualties to use instead?

<li><b>Comment</b> This is the <b>IP's third edit</b> on its month-long history. In any event, you would have a point if Israel committed suicide attacks or had child suicide bombers which were then kept out of WP. The point is even clearer in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_massacres_committed_during_the_Al-Aqsa_Intifada_5614.html" title="List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada">List of massacres committed during the Al-Aqsa Intifada</a> - it is not titled List of massacres committed by Palestinian during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, just because no events were committed by Israel during that period which are widely considered "massacres" does not make the entry POV. On the other hand, both List of massacres commited by Israeli forces (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_List_of_massacres_commited_by_Israeli_forces_08d6.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of massacres commited by Israeli forces">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/List of massacres commited by Israeli forces</a>) and Terrorism against Israel (<a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Terrorism_against_Israel_%282nd_nomination%29_095d.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Terrorism against Israel (2nd nomination)">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Terrorism against Israel (2nd nomination)</a>) were deleted for being one-sided. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 15:26, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>Hey Tewfik - me again. My point is still valid. But I do think that these lists can be combined. The number of civilian Palestinians killed far outnumber civilian Israels -- in these various lists that fact tends to get lost. Also I find that one problem with your perspective is that you feel that military deaths are just collatoral damage, and thus not questionable, thus giving the side with a formal military a general pass. It comes across as convenient reasoning around your blindspot. --70.48.240.99 04:31, 14 January 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I never said anything about <a href="../../../c/o/l/Collateral_damage.html" title="Collateral damage">collateral damage</a>, only that the existence of lists of <a href="../../../s/u/i/Suicide_bombing.html" title="Suicide bombing">suicide bombings</a> has no relevance here since this isn't a list or discussion of either Israeli suicide bombings or events that are recognised as "massacres," just allegations (and OR) about possible human rights abuse on only one side which do not even discuss the concept of "war crimes". <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 04:59, 14 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>But that's <i>exactly</i> my point. If this article is renamed to Allegations of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, then Israeli allegations of Palestinian war crimes could be added. Are there any such published allegations?

<dd>That would be fine except that very little of the information in the entry is actually about "Allegations of war crimes..." - most of it is simply unrelated data being used to present a novel argument (OR style). There would be no "List of massacres..." if there was only one or two massacres, and I don't see this page as needing to exist if only one or two claims exist which could be dealt with on the main article. If however there is enough content to warrant a separate entry, then I would wholeheartedly agree. <font style="color:#22AA00;"><b><a href="../../../t/e/w/User%7ETewfik_396b.html" title="User:Tewfik">Tewfik</a></b></font><font style="color:#888888;"><sup><a href="../../../t/e/w/User_talk%7ETewfik_b384.html" title="User talk:Tewfik">Talk</a></sup></font> 01:52, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. Fair call on the OR. The article needs to find citations for its arguments, not just its facts. (i.e. if the article says, "Israel did X, and X is considered a war crime", it needs to find sources for both "Israel did X" and "X is considered a war crime".) That's still not a reason to delete the entire thing, though. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 04:00, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Hang on - I think this article's content should be kept in some form, but there's no way it can be renamed like that.

It describes the hypothesis, but it doesn't say "this is what happened". Just to be clear, I'm not trying to compare these war crime allegations to a conspiracy theory. My point is that there's enough published material out there for us to outline the <b>allegations</b> of war crimes (by either side) in an NPOV manner. But it's <b>not</b> Wikipedia's place to say whether or not they <b>were</b> war crimes. The title "Israeli war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada" implies exactly that. <a href="../../../q/u/a/User%7EQuack_688_7471.html" title="User:Quack 688">Quack 688</a> 03:51, 11 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

This is just a case where <i>both</i> articles need to be edited to be brought into line with policy. Tewfik is quite correct when he says that this article shouldn't be allowed to just present a list of facts regarding (blank), then make the argument that (blank) was a war crime. It needs to find sources which explicitly say that. However, judging by the number of Google hits that the phrase <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=israeli+%22war+crimes%22" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=israeli+%22war+crimes%22" rel="nofollow">israeli "war crimes"</a> gets, I feel confident that we can find several sources which not only list facts, but make explicit allegations about Israeli war crimes. Actually, the very first page that shows up on Google, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4580139.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4580139.stm" rel="nofollow">BBC NEWS | Middle East | Amnesty slams Israel 'war crimes'</a>, is as good a place as any to start.

Another possible source is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1568001,00.html" class="external text" title="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,2763,1568001,00.html" rel="nofollow">Israeli evades arrest at Heathrow over army war crime allegations</a>, although that just deals with the actions of one Israeli general.

<dd>You seem to confuse NPOV, which is policy, with balance, which is not. It is entirely possible to have an NPOV article dealing with allegations against only one party in a conflict.

<li><b>Comment</b> Would it be proper to have an Accusations of Palestinian genocidal intent article? I would argue that if this article should be kept, then people should have no problems if I later create that article. Another nice article to have from the pro-Palestinian point of view would be Accusations of Israeli participation in the alleged global Jewish conspiracy. I think the question we face is "Is Wikipedia the place to comment on every argument (whether it be mainstream or extremest) for every issue under the sun, or is that <a href="../../../e/n/c/WP%7EENC_e8ee.html" title="WP:ENC">not within its mission</a>?".

<ul>
<li>Let me clarify. This article is meant to cover pro-Palestine arguments. If we keep this, in order to be balanced, we should also allow articles covering pro-Israel arguments (such as Accusations of Palestinian genocidal intent). In addition, we should cover other pro-Palestine articles, such as Accusations of Israeli participation in the alleged global Jewish conspiracy, as we should not selectively cover extremist anti-Israel arguments. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 13:41, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>I see what you mean. What I mean is that every article should carry its own weight. I mustn't be created merely on the premise that a POV article exists, therefore a counterPOV one must exist. If one deems an article to be POV, then one should edit it to remove POV, not create a new one with ones own POV.

<li>I would agree in principle, but as of now there is no content accusing Israel on this article, and I imagine that any allegations regarding the Palestinians could fit in the main article. I would be equally concerned with creating a separate article not dictated by space etc. which would in practice only deal with the Palestinians.

<dd>That is apparently a misunderstanding by an inexperienced editor. Anyway I don't see any problem there since it has been listed there for less than 7 hours (insignificant).

<li><b>Rename</b> to Accusations of war crimes during the Al-Aqsa Intifada so it can be NPOV and cover alleged war crimes on the part of both the Isaelis and the Palestinians. Examples of an alleged war crimes on the part of the Palestinians would be some militant/terrorist groups' alleged use of human shields or alleged use of civilian clothing while engaging in hostilities. -- <a href="../../../w/h/e/User%7EWhere_0f76.html" title="User:Where"><b><font color="blue">Where</font></b></a> 23:39, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> Per <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_US_Democratic_Party-Iranian_fundraising_controversy_a8f1.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/US Democratic Party-Iranian fundraising controversy">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/US Democratic Party-Iranian fundraising controversy</a>, it appears that there is a double-standard here - if articles like that can be deleted (in my opinion wrongly), then this article can be deleted for the <i>very same reasons</i> as that one. Where is the "reliable sources" here? Who is the judge of what accusation and allegation is "reliable" or "unreliable"? If we ask most people, they will say that <i>any</i> accusation or allegation is "unreliable"! If this article is kept, then this system is a nepotism where people gang up and vote delete on articles they hate and vote keep on articles they like making this completely pointless. If there are rules and regulations in place, then they should hold true for <i>all</i> articles, not just because of the preferences and prejudices of people. Whats worse is when they attack a person (making personally-motivated, hateful attacks, not calling someone a "liberal" or "right-winger" or "neocon" or something!), and that is what happened to me. This is an appalling behavior and that it is used in these processes is not right. At least with the article I wrote I <i>attempted</i> to invite others to provide counter sources, but instead they attack and ridicule me and vote <i>keep</i> on this types of articles. You can see their votes here, same people. <a href="../../../k/h/o/User%7EKhodavand_fbc2.html" title="User:Khodavand">Khodavand</a> 05:54, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

<li>My experience is that useless articles are sometimes kept (by popular demand), but that the same articles (unless they improve substantially) eventually get deleted anyway – especially articles about contentious subjects (such as this one). The axe may well fall on this one, but if not, there is no need for doomsaying. --<a href="../../../e/z/e/User%7EEzeu_f517.html" title="User:Ezeu">Ezeu</a> 06:37, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
