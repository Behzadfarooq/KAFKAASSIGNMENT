<li><b>Keep</b> – Veltcardio 20:51, 16 January 2007 (UTC) – This guy runs four different podcasts, the most successfull one named Extralife Radio is probably one of the best for the geek/pop culture. His blog is also a site full with geek information posts from around the internet, he updates everyday. Not to mention that he has a base of 25.000 readers a day for the blog, a three times a week comic for geeks, and more or less the same amount listens to the weekly extralife radio show (also co hosted by brian dunaway from amissiondeep.com and Obsidian from commissionedcomic.com). He also has appear in radio shows and invited to geeks conventions, and also for the portable media convention for all his work over the intenet.</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> - His presence on the internet goes further than just the Extra Life comic, so, unlike most webcomic artists, it makes sense to give him his own page, even if it's main purpose would just be to provide links to his various projects.

<li><b>Keep</b> - In that case: if you have a book that sold 25.000 copies why cant you make an entry about the author of the book in question? This is the same, is like making an entry about the host of an important radio or tv show only that his medium is the internet. The guy is famous enough and has enought merit to have a wiki entry. Yes he is popular, but so it is any other creator/host of a tv program for example. The way to establish notability in the internet is by links to his site, readers of his web page, establishing for how long he has been doing so, his reputation on the net and work he has done for the medium in question. He has been in press articles (he and his podcast ELR), links from other web comic artists (today a web comic artist should have the same reputation as a comic artist), his job like one of the first webcomic artists since 2001 and even one of the first people to start making podcasts (since 2001 too), <a href="http://www.myextralife.com/?page_id=6" class="external text" title="http://www.myextralife.com/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This is Wikipedia, the whole point is to list things that people know about that others may find interesting or have questions on.

<li>The extralife article also does not cite any outside sources lending to its notability and will need to have sources added to it to establish notability as well. - <a href="../../../o/c/a/User%7EOcatecir_b47d.html" title="User:Ocatecir">Ocatecir</a> 18:43, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b>, I hope the&#160;!vote stacking is ignored by the closing admin, and arguments are judged on their merits. This article has no independent sources, so keeping it (as it is at the moment) shouldn't even be up for negotiation. <a href="../../../t/r/e/User%7ETrebor_Rowntree_bcd1.html" title="User:Trebor Rowntree">Trebor</a> 22:36, 17 January 2007 (UTC)</li>
