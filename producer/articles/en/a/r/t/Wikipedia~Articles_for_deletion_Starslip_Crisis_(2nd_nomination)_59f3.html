<p>The page fails to follow some Wikipedian guidelines, such as <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOT_5cb5.html#IINFO" title="WP:NOT">this one</a> (#5: where is the significance? Nothing of merit is listed), and <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">this one</a> (no significant coverage, no awards of merit, etc.). As well, even admins have been quoted as saying that the previous AfD nomination was valid in its criticisms, even if the person starting it did so for improper reasons.

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> - the first guideline listed by the nominator doesn't really apply, technically: the article is not about the website [starslipcisis.com], it is about the webcomic <i>Starslip Crisis</i>. Also, it does, in fact, meet the second guideline mentioned by the nominator - check the awards section in the article.</li>
</ul>

<dd>In addition, this nomination seems to have been requested by Straub himself <a href="http://www.halfpixel.com/2007/02/15/delete-wikipedia/#comment-2054" class="external text" title="http://www.halfpixel.com/2007/02/15/delete-wikipedia/#comment-2054" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he said that he doesn't wish the article to remain on Wikipedia because he "wouldn’t want anyone to think the people running Wikipedia’s webcomics project knew anything about the strip". In addition, another commentor posted the following:
<dl>
<dd>"Here’s hoping <i>Starslip</i> gets well and truly deleted, it’s not like they actually know about your comic anyway, they just want to reinstate it to save face and pretend they aren’t as close minded as you proved them to be".</dd>

</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I remember hearing of Starslip Crisis on at least two separate Internet contexts at least six months ago. I've never read it, but after reading the article, it sounds like an interesting comic. By the way, many notable AND non-notable webcomics (indeed, many print comics and print comic strips) have <a href="../../../t/r/a/Trade_paperback.html" title="Trade paperback">trade paperback</a> collections; both <a href="../../../g/a/r/Garfield.html" title="Garfield">Garfield</a> and <a href="../../../e/l/_/El_Goonish_Shive_89a5.html" title="El Goonish Shive">El Goonish Shive</a> have collections available. One point I've not heard yet in this discussion: notability is based on context. For the larger world audience, any <a href="../../../p/a/r/Parkour.html" title="Parkour">Parkour</a> enthusiasts or <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_running.html" title="Free running">Free running</a> clubs outside of the originators are largely irrelevant; the same is likely true of past <a href="../../../t/o/a/Toastmasters.html" title="Toastmasters">Toastmasters</a> World Champions of Public Speaking, but as a Toastmasters AC-B myself, I would recognize the names of at least the past three if I heard them in passing. Webcomics are largely more notable within their intended audience, as is everything else. There are people who don't know anything about Brian Peppers, and people who don't know anything about Bahrain; if those people are called on to decide the notability of such articles, they're not as likely to find it notable as people who know more about the subject. On whose context does Wikipedia depend? --<a href="../../../b/l/u/User%7EBlueNight_546f.html" title="User:BlueNight">BlueNight</a> 06:22, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li>Forgive me if you're familiar with it already, but reading <a href="../../../n/o/t/WP%7ENOTE_ec28.html#Notability_is_not_subjective" title="WP:NOTE">WP:NOTE#Notability_is_not_subjective</a> might answer some of your questions. -- <a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Looks like that may be wrong though, as we seem to be having arguments over what constitutes reliable published works as detailed in this part of the guidance: "The inclusion of topics on Wikipedia is a reflection of whether those topics have been included in reliable published works. Other authors, scholars, or journalists have decided whether to give attention to a topic, and in their expertise have researched and checked the information about it." I'd suggest it is subjective, the arguments support that and that that section be stricken. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 11:02, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak merge</b> to <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristofer_Straub_f1de.html" title="Kristofer Straub">Kristofer Straub</a>. As much as the WCCAs are going to get an article, I've voted in them. So I have no faith in its capacity to confer magical notability dust upon <i>other</i> articles. As sources go, it is also <a href="http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004920" class="external text" title="http://www.comicon.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=36;t=004920" rel="nofollow">profiled</a> at the ComicCon Pulse. After that, I poked through all the links Google will let me see on both "Starslip Crisis" and "Starshift Crisis" but don't see anything not already mentioned that would be especially useful in writing a decent article (<a href="../../../w/a/f/WP%7EWAF_117e.html" title="WP:WAF">WP:WAF</a>). Therefore, I would rather merge it and the not-very-well-sourced-either <a href="../../../c/h/e/Checkerboard_Nightmare_aedb.html" title="Checkerboard Nightmare">Checkerboard Nightmare</a> into their creator's article (which now has a section on this whole brouhaha.

<li>You do know that series Pulse "Intro to Webcomics" items were written and submitted by the webcomic's authors? I think there was a pretty open-door policy on them, with none of them rejected. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li><b>Weak keep</b>. This is a special case, and I feel the circumstances of what happened compel us to allow this article to live for at least a while as a matter of fairness. In recognition of our error, let's give those interested in the subject a few months to work on this without interference. <a href="../../../e/v/e/User%7EEveryking_5c9e.html" title="User:Everyking">Everyking</a> 06:43, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Not sure why that would be -- whether they were sock puppets (seemed obvious to me) or just goofy new users, their sillier arguments (Alexa rankings, convention appearances, etc.) were pushed aside to focus on actual content standards, which the article didn't meet then or now. I think the idea was that the puppeteer was going to nominate the article based on a bad Alexa search and back it up with things like "hasn't even been invited as a guest to conventions." Then when it would get deleted for those reasons, the puppeteer would say it was all a joke and that the Alexa search was bad and he really was a convention guest and we would all be really embarrassed and keep his article. Instead, we ruined the joke and said "Alexa rankings, convention appearances, etc. aren't particularly useful for writing encyclopedia articles," and deleted it based on our actual policies rather than somebody goofing around with puppets. In other words, clumsiest attempt ever at <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> with <a href="../../../s/o/c/WP%7ESOCK_b3fc.html" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> backfired on the little <a href="../../../d/i/c/WP%7EDICK_0b34.html" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICK</a>. --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 07:37, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

<li><i>"sock puppets (seemed obvious to me) or just goofy new users"</i> Whatever happened to "Do not bite the newbies"?

WCCA is notable within the industry in question - most people don't know about advertising industry awards either, but that doesn't make them unnotable.

<li>I'm not twisting your words, and please don't accuse me of doing such. You wrote "The awards themselves are on a shaky ground for inclusion. Only trivial sources have been provided." I took that to mean the whole of your words were talking about the awards. And I am well aware of the difference between policy and guidelines. However, if you believe I need to familiarise myself with them, perhaps you should stop relying on them, since I wrote the guidance and had a hand in the policy, and I would hate to think I wasn't familiar with something I wrote or that people were relying on something that was written by someone not conversant with policy and guidelines. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 10:13, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I must apologise for the previous statement, I did not intend to assert myself on you. In my opinion, these awards are neither notable enough to be included on Wikipedia nor should they be used to assert and substantiate the notability of a webcomic, purely based on them. I hope I make myself clear here. I believe if you are rooting for the article because they have been mentioned in the New York times, the argument is not valid. As there is only a <i>trvial mention</i> of the WCCA in the article, which is not enough to make it notable for inclusion. — <a href="../../../s/i/r/User_talk%7ESir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_ae26.html" title="User talk:Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black">Nearly Headless Nick</font></a> <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Sir_Nicholas_de_Mimsy-Porpington_0b0f.html" title="Special:Contributions/Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington"><font color="black" title="Contributions"><sup><b>{C}</b></sup></font></a> 10:36, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Apology accepted. I'm still unclear as to what we are discussing. Are we discussing Starslip Crisis, which has not been mentioned in the NYT; or the WCCA, which has, and which you assert is a trivial mention and which I assert is not, and which you further assert should not merit inclusion since it fails a guideline, and which I further assert should merit inclusion since it meets policies. If we are discussing the latter article's deletion debate, I suggest we don't do it here. If you want to make the case that the WCCA aren't of enough value to ascribe notions of notability outlined at <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a>, go ahead. I'd merely point out that the important points are the policies, and that what needs to be examined is whether the article meets <a href="../../../v/e/r/Wikipedia%7EVerifiability_f922.html" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>.

<li>The grounds for meeting <a href="../../../n/_/_/WP%7EN_48f1.html" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> for an article are in general stricter than the grounds for something being <i>well known.</i> The fact that the WCCA clearly meet those grounds, of course, means that the frequent attempts to conflate "notable" and "well known" on webcomic AFDs in relation to the WCCA are inappropriate. If we conflate "notable" and "well known," then clearly this is a notable comic because it is well-known.

<li>"Well known"? No one outside of a very small fraction of certain online subcultures seems to even be aware of those awards. They certainly don't seem to garner much media attention. One of their administrators says that "Problems with the WCCAs [include] making people aware of them, getting people to care about them ... People didn't know when the WCCAs were happening, despite [his] repeatedly pointing out that we needed to take serious steps to get the word out about them."<a href="http://www.waxintellectual.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=58" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.waxintellectual.com/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=58" rel="nofollow">[5]</a> --<a href="../../../d/r/a/User%7EDragonfiend_980a.html" title="User:Dragonfiend">Dragonfiend</a> 09:48, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>I would say that a very significant fraction of those regularly reading webcomics that have won WCCAs are aware of the WCCAs... which in itself constitutes a rather large number of people if you start adding up readership figures. They do not garner much media attention off the internet, but do garner a fair amount of attention <i>on</i> the internet. Just not as much as they'd like; call webcomic artists demanding attention whores as a community if you like. See search engine results, a prime indicator of net attention, which show the WCCAs coming up higher on a number of interrelated searches than the mammoth Eisners and Reubens (e.g., the basic comics+awards search), sometimes even outranking the perennial Usenet-favored Squiddies. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 10:07, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Pointing to search engines is a moot point. We are not dealing with blogs, fan-cruft and the silly things users do online and then create forums and galleries on them.

<li>Again, you conflate notability with being well-known. Pointing to search engines is (mostly) a moot point in establishing <i>notability.</i> It is, however, a very direct way of establishing how <i>well known</i> something is. Google is in general a very good indicator of how prominently something features on the internet.

<li>Since the WCCAs are clearly well-known, and independent by the standards of awards commitees everywhere, then <a href="../../../w/e/b/WP%7EWEB_6e91.html" title="WP:WEB">WP:WEB</a> applies to give clear notability to <a href="../../../s/t/a/Starslip_Crisis_f4b4.html" title="Starslip Crisis">Starslip Crisis</a> on the "awards" clause. <a href="../../../b/a/l/User%7EBalancer_daea.html" title="User:Balancer">Balancer</a> 10:23, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Yes, that's what I'm getting at. What we've got that can be verified independently is the first two sentences. Is that enough to build an article on. All the rest, I hope you will agree, can be fleshed out from primary source material. But is that first two sentences enough? If we had a stub with just those two sentences, sourced from a reliable source, is that enough? Would that be a stub worth having? Would that make us a better encyclopedia or a worse one? That's what I think the argument is, that's what I think we should be discussing. What better serves our readers? What are we here for? Let's forget the point/counter over well-known and triviality, this is basically what it is all about, isn't it?

The other two are Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.

I think that's what policy dictates me to do, but if I have it otherwise feel free to enlighten me. <a href="../../../s/t/e/User%7ESteve_block_7275.html" title="User:Steve block">Steve block</a> <small><a href="../../../s/t/e/User_talk%7ESteve_block_ff46.html" title="User talk:Steve block">Talk</a></small> 20:49, 17 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Okay, so what are we saying? Stubs are no good? Surplus to requirements? What do we do with them, merge them to where the information may be useful? Delete them? What are we doing here, what's the goal? An encyclopedia of the stuff we consensually agree we like? Where's the line? It's not a black and white issue we have here, is it, it's light and shade, and we dapple our canvas with care. What do we need? What is enough. Because it changes daily. We know this comic strip exists, but that's not enough. We can verify it exists, easily, but that's not enough. We can verify a point of note, that it was one of the first Blank Label Comics. But that's not enough. How do we decide what is enough? How do we explain to people who don't get it that that's not enough? Is it enough to say, look, go read that page over there, that's why? Does that work when that page doesn't really get specific? Or do we need to take the time to work out what isn't enough? What do we do when there is some merit for the information somewhere? I mean, we agree there's merit in a mention of the strip being made somewhere on Wikipedia, right? So should we explain that sometimes, until there's enough material to work with which allows us to write from a full neutral perspective, when there's enough sourcing to allow us to balance different point of views, when there's enough to seed an article and allow primary source material in, then the time is right? Do we allow primary source to build an article? And should we explain that sometimes we do allow articles to rely more heavily on primary source? And try and work out what the difference is? It's not easy working these ideas out, and we should never pretend it is. We shouldn't pass people off on poorly written guidance. We shouldn't even parrot it. We should take the time to consider the best thing for the article. We should listen to the article. Where does this article want to be? What do the independent sources tell us about this article? They tell us it is by <a href="../../../k/r/i/Kristofer_Straub_f1de.html" title="Kristofer Straub">Kristofer Straub</a> and it was one of the strips with which <a href="../../../b/l/a/Blank_Label_Comics_d9bb.html" title="Blank Label Comics">Blank Label Comics</a> launched. So it makes sense to include the information there. And if a stub isn't enough here, to allow people to digest that snippet and decide where they want to go first, either to Blank Label Comics or to Straub, then we've got to work out where to redirect it. We've got to take the time to work these issues out. Or we are just a headless bureaucracy. And I don't believe in that Wikipedia. I don't believe in a Wikipedia where we try and score points, where we just battle our position, where we fight and call each other names. I believe in a Wikipedia where we at least try and understand each other, and work towards a consensus, an outcome where we can all point to something conceded and something gained. Where we can share war stories and laugh. Where we build an encyclopedia.

<li><b>Keep</b>, and restore the excised content... Wikipedia's core content policies (not the vague and subjective and even contradictory bureaucratic bloat that has evolved around them) do not equate using primary sources with performing original research (which it isn't)... that is using multiple sources (primary or otherwise) to synthesize something new. Even if the only source for some information is the author's own output, it should not matter, so long as it's not a matter of grandiose/self-aggrandizing claims. Therefore even the excising of information that cannot be verified except by using the comic's own website is unnecessary. The question of whether or not the comic is notable is a separate one from whether or not the information presented is verifiable.... but following the policy failure that is the web notability guidelines does -not- make Wikipedia better, or improve its credibility. Short term solution: ignore the guidelines. Long term solution: jettison them. Clinging to them like a protective talisman will only alienate the largest group outside of die-hard-wikipedians who find any relevance in Wikipedia: the internet-savvy folks.

<li>Your interpretation of the core content policies are at odds with both their spirit and the letter. There is nothing ambiguous about needing multiple reliable third party references.

<li>Mine results in no degradation of information quality. Yours results in an "encyclopedia" that will only be paid attention to by the people who choose to spend their time catering to the increasingly complex, irrelevant, and bizarre rituals that have evolved to support its existence. Multiple third party sources do establish (tautologically) that a subject is notable enough to be mentioned in third party sources, and thus "deserves" an article... but once such notability has been established for the topic of the article, there's nothing gained by using those sources exclusively for the body, as some are saying. "Okay, so this subject comes up in multiple third party sources. Clearly it's worth mentioning. But there's not enough information in these sources for the article to say anything useful. Delete!" It's a pointless, double-layered notability test that would only make sense if Wikipedia was under severe space constraints. The fact is that accepting a third-party source's information about something non-contentious, like say, the characters in a fictional work does 'nothing' to improve the quality or reliability of information as opoposed to going straight to the primary. Their ultimate source is the first-party source. Reliable third-party sources have fact checkers, you say? They go back to the first-party source, too. The core content policies are unambiguous that simply accepting first-party information is not original research in and of itself, and while a lot of rather dense shrubbery has sprung up surrounding the relatively simple and workable ideas in the core content policies, "Ignore All Rules" trumps everything if the rules aren't making wikipedia better. This silly game of "Well, even if you and I and anybody with a mind to do so can go check out the page and verify that the information is accurate, that doesn't make the information verifiable." is just that... a silly game. Whether ones cites a primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, or googolnary source... the citation still comes down to nothing more than editor saying, "Well, I read this stuff right here, in this source that anybody can go check out if somebody wanted to contest it." On the other hand, if somebody wanted to put in their take on the Jungian symbolism behind Starslip Crisis and said "Just look at the strip... it's all there!", THAT would unambiguously be original research... saning (yes, I said "saning"... imagine a verb, "to sane.") down the content policies needn't open the much-feared flood gates to reams of unverifiable speculation as some people need to fear, any more than acknowledging that in the Brave New World that has such online fricking encylopedias in it web-based notoriety really IS notability will turn Wikipedia into a directory of crappy Geocities pages. <a href="../../../a/l/e/User%7EAlexandra_Erin_1ed2.html" title="User:Alexandra Erin">Alexandra Erin</a> 01:01, 21 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nope, <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> is more than sufficient in this case. In my bolder, more active days I would have killed this nomination the moment I saw it, process wonks be damned. There's been way too much grandstanding over webcomics lately, and going for an AfD so soon after the last one is just continuing that trend. It's disruptive, and that trumps the comparatively trivial squabbling over inclusionist and deletionist ideals. This could have been dealt with by continued discussion on the related talk pages. A redirect could have even been hammered out there without the need for an AfD. But instead we get this. It's disappointing. –<a href="../../../a/d/a/User%7EAdashiel_6d8c.html" title="User:Adashiel">Abe Dashiell</a> <sup><b>(<a href="../../../a/d/a/User_talk%7EAdashiel_664f.html" title="User talk:Adashiel">t</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Adashiel_fbb5.html" title="Special:Contributions/Adashiel">c</a>)</b></sup> 16:53, 20 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. This is a reasonably well-known webcomic and there is no substantial dispute that the content is true and accurate. Lines must be drawn as to notability but this comic reasonably surpasses them per several of the sources that have been added to the article since last week's events.

<dd>that would be the only valid reason for denying the use of the comic itself as a source. It does not violate WP:RS, WP:V, or WP:OR unless you argue that an author isn't an expert on his own work, because we have a single, reliable source, so long as we do not draw any interpretations from it. It would make a small article, but not any smaller than the less well-known fictional books or movies we have on the site.</dd>
<dd>Under Wikipolicy, an article CAN be written from the comic. It is incorrect to say that it can't. The question is whether one SHOULD be written - ie, notability. Or, if you'd like to make a sweeping statement, whether we should have articles that are little more than book summaries. Both of those are perfectly legitimate debates to have, but one that I have no interest engaging in myself. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 29.138.2.170 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_29.138.2.170_d79f.html" title="Special:Contributions/29.138.2.170">contribs</a>).</small></dd>

<li>Well, there is that (which I had, admittedly, missed, and means that I have a number of books to flag for AfD under WP:NOT), but I was mostly arguing against the belief that primary sources couldn't be used at all, which is what some in this AfD seemed to be suggesting. Any fictional work that passed WP:N would, properly written, be capable of passing WP:NOT, however, as there would be verifiable awards/interviews/references that would need to be included as well. <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_129.138.2.170_44c3.html" title="Special:Contributions/129.138.2.170">129.138.2.170</a> (talk) 03:43, 21 February 2007 (UTC).</small></li>

<li>Well, there are three arguments against that, two of which follow the letter, and the third of which is follows the spirit. This is to the point of spectacularly splitting hairs, but such is what happens when an argument gets this ridiculous.

<dl>
<dd>Argument one: The use of the word "Should" instead of "Must". By splitting this hair finely, we can determine that so long as something is verifiable, reliable third-party sources are, while desired, unneccessary.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Argument two: An overly legalistic inteperpretation of what constitutes a reliable, third-party source - for that, we have a source which alleges that it won an award, and a second (drawn from just about anywhere) that alleges that the author is, in fact, Dan Shive as the strip claims. There, we have reliable, third-party sources that are spectacullarly irrelevant, as they only adress two sentences out of the entire article, but which fit what is required.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Argument three: That something freely available is a good enough source to use about itself, and that as this particular sentence stems from the Verifiability policy, it is primarily concerned about Verifiability. As there is no concern about something you can read yourself being Verifiable, and as we have directly under said sentence guidelines for using self-published material and self-referential material, this sentence is not relevent. Whether it shouldn't be written for lack of sources on concerns other than verifiability is the concern of other policies and guidelines.</dd>

<dd>If you like, I can pull out other bizzarro-world justifications akin to numbers one and two out of my hat. I think that would benefit no one, other than myself, and be rightfully percieved as being disruptive. How about we stick to the intent of the rules, instead, with arguments about why the policies exist, and whether this would be in line with them? Sorry if this sounds a tad sarcastic or sassy, but I'm a bit fed up with the webcomic AfD's in general (on both sides, as I've said), and I'm a bit tired of every argument degenerating into the minutae of policy and guideline, and going into the hyperbolic. How much of a mention is trivial? How independent does something need to be? How notable is notable? Is a given person "expert" enough to listen to? Is it justified to send ten sockpuppets out to illustrate a problem? So on and so forth. Argue against number three if you'd like, as it's the only argument there that I actually care about, and maybe you'll convince me, but I doubt it.</dd>
