<li><b>Keep</b><del>, trim to stub if necessary</del>. There seem to be some third party sources. More importantly, I’d like to remind everybody that opining on AFD carries the responsibility of actually checking your facts. The article has been deleted exactly once, by the A7 criterion. It has been undeleted, not reposted. Regardless of that, it does not qualify for speedy deletion under G4, since that is only for items deleted by an XFD process and the first nomination of this article was closed not by consensus but because the article had been deleted in a different way. So, will the ‘speedy delete’ people please refresh their memory of <a href="../../../c/s/d/WP%7ECSD_a4a4.html" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and reconsider? —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 12:59, 9 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The article has changed completely since I nominated for AfD. My problem is still that there are no published sources... although the article is better than where we started (by a long shot), it's still essentially unverifiable by anything other than the blogosphere/interweb.

<dd>The sources aren’t very good. Ideally, we would replace some. However, I think most of them actually pass the reliability test, even if only at its lowest setting. Since the article is about pop culture and not not astrophysics, the sources, weighted by their reliability, do, in my opinion, substantiate the article well enough to have it kept. (It goes without saying that the Websnark search page should be replaced by something more tangible and everything else should be cited properly, but that’s a style issue.) —<a href="../../../x/y/z/User%7EXyzzy_n_12cc.html" title="User:Xyzzy n">xyzzy</a><sub><a href="../../../x/y/z/User_talk%7EXyzzy_n_2d1b.html" title="User talk:Xyzzy n">n</a></sub> 20:39, 9 February 2007 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>I think you're confusing <i>primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> sources. Every source under the references section is a self-published webpage/blog/comicfansite (be it comixpedia, etc.). The strip itself may have been published in print, but this doesn't mean that these are sources discussing the strip (a <i>secondary</i> source). I'm not saying they don't exist, but right now the article is lacking anything but online citations (generally a no-no). See <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. /<a href="../../../b/l/a/User%7EBlaxthos_9d7e.html" title="User:Blaxthos">Blaxthos</a> 23:22, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Aren’t Campbell’s Comixpedia article and the review in <i>Comics Buyer’s Guide</i> reliable? Also, I can’t find anything in <a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> about having only online citations being a ‘no-no’.

<td valign="top" style="padding:4px 10px;">Anyone can create a website or pay to have a book published, then claim to be an expert in a certain field. For that reason, self-published books, personal websites, and blogs are largely not acceptable as sources.
<p>Self-published material may be acceptable when produced by a well-known, professional researcher in a relevant field or a well-known professional journalist. These may be acceptable so long as their work has been previously published by reliable third-party publications.

<li><b>Weak Delete</b> While I am no fan of webcomics and their lack of notability and worth in general, this one may need to be kept, and I will be fair in that regard. If this is to stay, then those familiar with it really should help better establish notability, and expand the article in that regard. The article mentions that it was the first series in a rater large website featuring webcomics - did the site expand rapidly because of this series's popularity? It is mentioned that this webcomic existed in print form - how many copies were printed, by whom, and how widely were they distributed? This may be one of the few notable webcomics, and thus, I am hesitant to condemn it without allowing a chance for certain ambiguities to be first cleared up. Should the needed facts fail to appear, my opinion will be that of a <b>solid delete</b>. <a href="../../../n/e/t/User%7ENetOracle_6091.html" title="User:NetOracle">NetOracle</a> 02:19, 10 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
