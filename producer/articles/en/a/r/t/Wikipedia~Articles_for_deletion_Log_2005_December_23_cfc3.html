<li><b>Comment.</b> Wikipedia has lots of webpages for porn actors and actresses. How do we decide which ones are notable and which are not? Note that I am not objecting to delete in this case - only wondering which criteria for notability are being used for porn stars. --<a href="../../../p/i/e/User%7EPierremenard_b03f.html" title="User:Pierremenard">Pierremenard</a>
<ul>
<li>WP doesn't have any specific guidelines on porn people. Based on observation of previous AfDs, porn persons who appear in the IMDB and have credited apparances on videos/DVDs tend to be kept, while those whose pornography is mostly internet based do not. In my opinion this probably isn't quite strict enough, as it has led to quite a few articles with virtually no encyclopedic information, which are really mostly just a place to put a pornographic picture or two. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - <b><font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></b> 16:27, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This was an important event in the UK and was a major catalyst for a campaign against gun crime as well as reform of the British Social Services.

<li>Individual articles of murdered family members (including this one, a 7-year-old girl) are a bit much... and the the parents' names are in red here. If the drug-related mass killing triggers a notable reform of the Birmingham Social Services, it might be best to move relevant information to that article and <b>Redirect</b> to Joel Smith (UK murderer), the person who started the sequence of events, once he has been convicted of the crimes. In addition, the information about the DNA test is irrelevant to the subject's notability (which hinges on her murder, not who is her biological father) and should be removed from the article. <a href="../../../b/2E/w/User%7EB.Wind_2a93.html" title="User:B.Wind">B.Wind</a> 18:04, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b>, if no director has been attached, the release date isn't verifiable or certain even to the studio.

<dd>I've tried to expand but there's no real information I can find to expaand it with. Even if I go through and mine out her proportions, all the awards she's won, and the porn flicks she's been in, there's not enough out there, today, to make more than a stub -- I tried, though maybe my methods were flawed. That said, there isn't even enough information on the awards she's done to have so much as a stub page for them, so they'd stay red links for a fair time. Look at the original revision of the article and the similar fanboyish pages thrown up by the original author. Non-wikified, which I can forgive, but not exactly content-rich or encyclopedic. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlata_90d6.html" title="User:Flata">Flata</a> 10:58, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I can get a friend to give me some titles ending in "Universe", if you like, doesn't mean it merits anything. I can't find much about the Miss Nude Universe pageant. It's run by someone called "Rio Rivers", the one that our Jada Deville won was in a strip club in St. Robert, Missouri. It depends how you define notable. Is the stripping circuit itself notable? This is an award made up of people on the stripping circuit, that is, people who tour as strippers. Most of them also do porn and might be notable for that, but I'd never even <b>heard</b> of this stripping circuit stuff, which surprises me a fair bit. There are 133 Google results for "Miss Nude Universe" "Rio Rivers", what with trying to find out information about the specifics and the organizers and so much. There's no information to be had, but the same news bites and people mentioning it casually. I'm interested in consensus as to whether the stripping circuit is per se notable. It does not seem to foster enough reading material to throw together articles on Miss Nude Universe, which as you point out, sure sounds like a non-minor title. --<a href="../../../f/l/a/User%7EFlata_90d6.html" title="User:Flata">Flata</a> 10:55, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> &amp; <b>Set Guideline</b>. There are (guess) 300 pages on big-bust stars (all with their own money making web page). But they are in movies. This person is not. This will lead to perhaps 900 stripper pages (surprisingly all with their own money making sites). I'm sure they all win such awards. I judge this a mistake. 900 barely notable high schools is perhaps silly but no big deal. 900 barely notable strippers = 900 barely notable small business with free advertising.

<p>It doesn't meet criteria of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a>, but come on. Should something be deleted because it is less than well-known? The advantage that Wikipedia has over other informational sources is the fact that it can be made to include more or less anything that exists. I think that the entire policy of <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> concerning how well-known artists are is nit-picking pettiness.

<p>Here is what I'll say as my final defense: Wikipedia is a site that supposedly prides itself as a source for information and as a truly democratic medium of sharing information. What is presented on the SFY page is wholly true, wholly unbiased, and presented in an intelligent (if I do say so myself) manner, which is more than can be said for plenty of other sites. If you people are going to spend your entire lives searching for pages on this site to delete and edit, why not delete or edit the poorly-written and misleading pages that exist in abundance here. As some people on this site are fond of saying, "Wiki is not paper." There is no size limit to this site, nor should there be. Anything true (as the page in question is) should be welcome here.

<dd>Have you ever been involved in something that you really enjoy, a book, a movie, a warm bath. etc. And some rude idiot comes along and ruins it. I was smack dab in the middle of creating this article, minding my own business when <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> came along and ruined my "warm bath". I was going along, enjoying myself in a certain train of thought, and then all the sudden I get interupted, I get pulled out of the bath, thrown outside, and beat by some stranger. That may be historonics, but that is how I feel. I got to the point, I just wanted to throw up my hands and delete the damn article. I started a new article, and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> and <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a>'s friends (maybe sockpuppers of Petral) all put that article up for deletion too.Travb 04:13, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>The CEO of a publically-traded company being accused of child molestation by his own daughter is a matter public concern that extends far beyond that of the narrow concerns of the company's shareholders and potential investors. Considering that Min Zhu is a Chinese national who has now fled back to China and that WebEx has a large <a href="../../../u/n/i/United_States_Department_of_Defense_b846.html" title="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> contract to carry classified data accross its network which has servers in China, and it's hardly a tempest in a teapot.

<li>The distinction is irrelevant. The fact that it is sworn testimony made in a court is sufficient to establish that the allegation was made by Erin, which is the only issue here.

<p>Some of you familiar with me may think you're catching me in a contradiction here, since I've stated many times that "Criticism of X" articles are not necessarily POV forks. Well, no contradiction at all; such articles, I still say, are not <i>necessarily</i> POV forks. However, this one is one paragraph of text, three quotes, and <i>twenty-three</i> external links, and none of it actually originated in <a href="../../../m/e/g/Megachurch.html" title="Megachurch">Megachurch</a>, so it doesn't represent any sort of consensus process. (Late note: The creator of the page has just put a note on the talk page explaining that the material was moved out of <a href="../../../w/i/l/Willow_Creek_Community_Church_b6f0.html" title="Willow Creek Community Church">Willow Creek Community Church</a>. It still seems to me that it should be treated as a POV fork: the useful parts of it, but <i>only</i> the useful parts, should be merged to the main article.) -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 02:00, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> Unfortunately, all those other channels seem to assume that the most they will have to deal with is the merging of an accidentally created duplicate article, created in good faith and about as NPOV as any other newly-created article. The kinds of people who deliberately create content forks regard this and exploit this as a loophole: Faced with the knowledge that the editors watching <a href="../../../f/o/o/Foobar.html" title="Foobar">Foobar</a> won't accept the partisan arguments they want the article to contain, they create an article with a title like Unanswered questions about Foobar or What critics say about Foobar or the like. They figure they can't lose: if it slips under everybody's radar, that's a great outcome for them (and bad for Wikipedia); if someone spots it and tags it for merging, they put a big smile on their face and say "Merge? Sure, I can do that!" and they edit their POV fork material directly into the main article. If anyone protests that none of that material was accepted by consensus, they go on the attack. "How can you defy the will of the community? The will of the community was clearly 'Merge' and I merged it! You're acting in bad faith, by resisting that!" What we really need is a definitive policy statement that when an article is determined to be a POV fork, the burden of proof must be to prove that any of the material actually <i>deserves</i> to be merged. Until then, there's endless incentive for POV-pushers to create as many POV forks as they can. -- <a href="../../../a/n/t/User%7EAntaeus_Feldspar_9a66.html" title="User:Antaeus Feldspar">Antaeus Feldspar</a> 17:14, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Merge very selectively and redirect</b> I agree, I created the article, however, none of the content is mine.

<li><b>Keep</b> On 00:39, 23 December 2005 I started a new article: Promises of troop withdraw by American presidents I was hoping to draw parallels between the Iraq, Philippine, and Vietnam wars. In all three wars Americans have been promised by their political leaders before an election of troop reductions. On 01:07, 23 December 2005,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents&amp;oldid=32426780" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents&amp;oldid=32426780" rel="nofollow">[11]</a> while I was still beginning to flesh out the article, Petral added on a {{POV}} tag.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents&amp;diff=32429423&amp;oldid=32429328" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents&amp;diff=32429423&amp;oldid=32429328" rel="nofollow">[12]</a> The POV tag explains this:</li>

<p>Since there was no "discussion on the talk page."

On 01:34, 23 December 2005 Petral responded by adding my article for deletion.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents_throughout_history&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32431816" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Promises_of_troop_withdraw_by_American_presidents_throughout_history&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=32431816" rel="nofollow">[15]</a></p>
<p>I then began to edit the page again, adding content, and trying to ignore <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a>'s heavy handed tactics against my brand new article, I then changed the name of the article to Campaign promises of troop withdraw by American presidents, and I added a link at the top of the deletion page, stating that I changed the name, with a link, which <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> deleted, and then reported me to Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress/RU Moderate. <a href="../../../p/e/t/User%7EPetral_adf6.html" title="User:Petral">Petral</a> then retracted his statement, stating: <i>"nevermind, user is showing some restraint and is now cooperating with the AfD process."</i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress/RU_Moderate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32441990" class="external autonumber" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress/RU_Moderate&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=32441990" rel="nofollow">[16]</a> He then began to revert the redirect to Campaign promises of troop withdraw by American presidents back to the original article, 4 times, and I reported him for 3RR.

<li><b>Keep</b> - I don't think web statistics accurately represent audio podcasts, especially because most of the traffic is strictly client-server (i.e. downloading the episodes). As podcasts go this one is fairly notable and as sf podcasts go this is extremely notable. Podcasts are an emerging field and your comment of "nn podcast (though that's usually redundant)" strikes me as indicating you are a deletionist with an anti-podcast bent. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 03:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Sorry, what I meant to say was podcasts tend to work outside of the world wide web where they can't be tracked so easily. Here's a hypothetical: someone finds Slice of SciFi through iTunes. They subscribe. They like it. They continue listening to it over the course of many weeks. None of this has any effect whatsoever on the podcast's Google or Alexa ranking. In fact, I am subscribed to about two dozen podcasts that I listen to regularly and I have never visited the websites of the majority of them; I just find them through iTunes. There are probably hundreds of thousands of podcast listeners just like me who aren't going to get picked up on a Google or Alexa ranking, hence why I don't think those are applicable metrics for measuring podcasts.

<ul>
<li>That's a rather unreasonable attitude, just delete everything until we can sort it out? In the mean time work which has been done on pages like this one will be lost. I don't understand why your default stance is "delete until we're absolutely sure". And just exactly how long do you propose it will take to "figure out" podcasts? Another year? Should Wikipedia really have a blanket policy of deleting all podcasts for many months? Come now, that's unreasonable. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 04:05, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>I have a rule of thumb: if it won't be important in ten years, it's not important now. Right now, as I see it, there are no podcasts of sufficient notability that they can be considered <i>encyclopedic</i>. No reason someone can't write about them in their blog, or that a magazine can't do an article on podcasts, but this topic is clearly not <i>encyclopedic</i> when it comes to individual 'casts. I think, by the way, there is a major difference between "delet(ing) podcasts" and "dele(ing) everything". I also find it interesting that you pose a series of questions, seem to answer them yourself, and then call the responses unreasonable. Do you often have this conflict with yourself? <a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">D</a><a href="../../../e/s/p/Wikipedia%7EEsperanza_b39d.html" title="Wikipedia:Esperanza"><font style="color:green"><i><b>e</b></i></font></a><a href="../../../d/e/n/User%7EDenni_4cca.html" title="User:Denni">nni</a> <a href="../../../d/e/n/User_talk%7EDenni_2025.html" title="User talk:Denni"><font style="color:green">☯</font></a> 19:16, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>You can't even think of a single podcast that you consider notable? You're way out of the mainstream on this one, both in terms of mainstream Wikipedia thought and knowledge of mainstream culture. Podcasts are an emerging phenomenon and there are many that <i>are</i> eminently notable. And I wasn't posing questions myself, I was posing your thoughts as questions and responding to them. --<b><a href="../../../c/y/d/User%7ECyde_34b6.html" title="User:Cyde">Cyde Weys</a></b> <sub><a href="../../../t/w/o/Wikipedia%7ETwo-millionth_topic_pool_6995.html" title="Wikipedia:Two-millionth topic pool">vote</a></sub><sup><span style="position: relative; left: -16px; margin-right: -16px;"><a href="../../../c/y/d/User_talk%7ECyde_0e22.html" title="User talk:Cyde">talk</a></span></sup> 20:27, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> It would seem to me that Wikipedia (the cutting edge standard) should be on the cutting edge of defining new technologies such as podcasting, and though it may be new, it will not be going away anytime soon. It, along with videopods are the emerging online technologies that will lead the way for all future audio and video downloading. In the forefront of this technology are such podcasting innovators as Evo Terra, Michael Mennenga, Tee Morris and Mur Lafferty. I believe it would be remiss on the part of Wikipedia to ignore this and simply try to catch-up once its tailights are off in the distance. Slice of SciFi, for those who have kept abreast of this emerging technology, is one of the most recognized innovating podcast programs on the Web, so much so that XM-Satellite (another new and ever-growing technology) has picked up the program to be part of its satellite channel lineup. I guess it confuses me why someone wouldn't want Wikipedia to chronicle this, in the unbiased way that it currently has, in its databse. I would still be saying all of this even if I wasn't so closely connected to the project. -- SK Sloan 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>It is one of the biggest forums on the internet, and a bona fide cultural phenomenon in itself. What sort of prejudice causes you to list it for deletion, "Master" Jay? If Wikipedia's supremacy over stuff like Britannica is its coverage of more current and popular topics (as well as the more obscure) then why SHOULDN'T descriptions of major internet communities be included? And why do inane blog sites like FARK (which don't even surround a discipline, like Bodybuilding) remain on Wikipedia, undeleted? . If anything the article needs to be cleaned up, but deletion? Stop being a damned Wiki snob, snobs like you are going to kill Wikipedia. -Mantis <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.92.166.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.92.166.251_9a9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.92.166.251">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<li>Also, deletion motion is a complete fallacy. There is no advertisement for products, and no spamming included, or intended for the future. Page may be rapidly edited due to the actions of a few people who do not understand wikipedia protocol, but this is not the fault of the site itself, nor the owners of the site, and the case for a permanent page is as strong as the case for any other internet site. I make a countermotion that the ridiculous deletion tag be REMOVED. FWIW vandals have been warned to respect Wikipedia protocol. If they can't oblige, then ban them, but don't take it out on this page. -Mantis <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 66.92.166.251 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_66.92.166.251_9a9e.html" title="Special:Contributions/66.92.166.251">contribs</a>).</small></li>

<p>Hold on a second please - having the article listed here does not mean that it will necessarily be deleted. As it currently stands, there is no consensus to delete, and by default, the article will remain on Wikipedia. For the duration of this deletion debate, please focus on improving the article so that it meets basic encyclopedic standards. The article will be deleted or kept based on its merits, so it is advisable to improve on article content first - the article content should speak for itself, and the closing administrator will take this into account. You do not need to worry about this article being deleted if it contains content that is of quality and substantiated. --<a href="../../../h/a/p/User%7EHappyCamper_93e2.html" title="User:HappyCamper">HappyCamper</a> 04:07, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>the whole band is hoax</b> at least according to Google. I tried "Markus Grennich" and "Roman DiMarius" -&gt; 0 google.

Then I try "dante evil" + band -&gt; 38 unrelated googles. In short, what ever I put in google - no result or no relevant results.

<p>Gentlemen, it's my article, I'm newly registered, and you are correct in noting that "Darwin Central" is most definitely a spoof.</p>
<p>However, for the past <b>four years</b> Darwin Central has played a definite role in the creationism-evolution arena of the culture wars on <b><a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a></b>, which is a very high-visibility website. Thousands of posters and "lurkers" are exposed to Darwin Central's "existence" and views each day in threads where evolution is debated. So it's not <i>just</i> a joke that came up one day. Darwin Central has become a fictional, but functional label for the numerous defenders of science literacy (evolution specifically) in a key sector of conservative internet chat. It's become a feature of the culture war.</p>
<p>Also, Darwin Central isn't just one person's plaything (although I am the Grand Master's spokesman). Dozens of science-literate posters on <b><a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a></b> all participate in maintaining its existence, and it's been occasionally mentioned on other websites where the evolution-creationism issue gets discussed. As spoofs go, this one is "real."</p>
<p>It's true that Darwin Central hasn't achieved the notariety of other spoofs, such as <b><a href="../../../f/l/y/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism_4df0.html" title="Flying Spaghetti Monsterism">Flying Spaghetti Monsterism</a></b>," which certainly deserves its place in Wikipedia. So you could delete "Darwin Central" because it's not a <i>major</i> phenomenon. Or you can let Darwin Central remain, because <i>it does play an important and visible role in a serious issue of our times</i>.</p>
<p>It's a judgment call. I understand that you don't want too much of this kind of thing in Wikipedia. On the other hand, you already have some, so where do you draw the line? I'm hoping you'll let "Darwin Central" in before you shut the door. It's well done (he modestly said), it's been around since 2002, and it really has enjoyed high visibility.</p>
<p>If you leave the article on Wikipedia, I strongly suggest that you invoke the <b>protection</b> feature to lock the article, because experience shows that it will probably attract some vandalism, and you folks have enough work to do.</p>

<dd>The issue here is not the nature of the article. We can have articles on parodies, spoofs, conspiration theories, hoaxes etc, as long as they are notable.

You are now the sole contributor, but that can change, and it gives you no added voice to the AfD. -<a href="../../../a/k/m/User%7EAKMask_da48.html" title="User:AKMask">AKMask</a> 21:34, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Author's reply to AKMask</b>: Understood. Upon posting, the work is no longer mine. I see that the article has recently been edited so that only the first paragraph remains, and the editor also changed even that a bit. There's really not much left of the original submission for me to talk about. This has been a very educational experience. PatrickHenry-FR 01:31, 24 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>PatrickHenry, I hope you stay here even if this article gets deleted. You are a good writer and a polite person. <a href="../../../j/o/a/User%7EJoaoRicardo_efd9.html" title="User:JoaoRicardo">JoaoRicardo</a><sup><a href="../../../j/o/a/User_talk%7EJoaoRicardo_5049.html" title="User talk:JoaoRicardo">talk</a></sup> 04:04, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Author's reply to JoaoRicardo</b>: Thanks. Your comments have been most helpful. I've had several things professionally published, both fiction and non-fiction, so I'm quite familiar with the editorial process, and also (alas) with rejection. I don't take this stuff personally; and I always play by the rules. From the viewpoint of a writer, however, the Wiki-world is <i>different</i>. Very different.

<p>There is an apparent consensus to delete the item. It's been edited down to virtually nothing, and there's really not much left to merge. If I were to add something about this topic to the article on <a href="../../../f/r/e/Free_Republic_0fa6.html" title="Free Republic">Free Republic</a> it would be entirely different. There seems to be no reason to continue debating. I agree that the article should be deleted; and I appreciate everyone's input. PatrickHenry-FR 15:37, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>This article seems to be a hoax. Searching for it on Google with the words 'hanashi' and 'vitamins' only brings up the Wikipedia entry.

<p>I realize that chocolate pudding is notable enough to warrant mention on Wikipedia, but this article is so brief as to be almost empty. Plus the author makes a claim and provides no reference for the claim. The statement "Currently, the top-selling brand of chocolate pudding is manufactured under the Jell-O® brand by the Kraft Foods Corporation." the author needs to date that statement, and provide a reference.

<li><b>Keep</b> and expand. There is a lot to be said about chocolate pudding rather than pudding in general. As for the claim that Jell-O brand is the top selling pudding, I don't know, but according to Kraft's website Jello-O brand gelatin is the "world's most popular prepared dessert." Kraft says that the pudding "has been an American family favorite for 63 years" and that 64% of mothers they surveyed said that the pudding is their child's favorite snack.

<li>Ditto. I dont know if google hits should be a standard of importance here, but thats a decision beyond my control. The fact that Professor Presas started his art by having it taught in the Filipino School system made Dr. Barbers college program of special importance to him. I have head rumor that he used to mention that his art was taught at an American college with pride. That and the fact that he is well known amongst all the major players and set up and ran the Symposium (which was big news in the MA circles even with the controversy) earns him a place IMO. <b>KEEP</b> -- Renegade68 21:49, 20 December 2005 (UTC) <small>This is the article's author.</small></li>

<li>Other instructors in the same art were influenced or aided by Dr. Barber over the years (for example, Dr Barber coordinated, ran, and acquired funding for camps with Professor Remy Presas in the 1980's and 1990's which were attended by currently in vogue instructors such as Tim Hartman). Professor Remy Presas (inventor of the art in question) considered him a notable if not exceptional student before his death. In terms of the history of Modern Arnis in the United States over the past 20 years he has been a significant instructor of the art and the entry should remain as is.TriVR 04:11, 20 December 2005 (UTC) <small><i><b>User's <u>only</u> contribution</b></i></small></li>

<li>Dr. Barber's "for credit" Modern Arnis program is the only one of it's kind in the USA and was approved in writing by the late Grandmaster Remy Presas (founder of the system). I have personally witnessed the approval documents to this effect. In addition Dr. Barber was inducted into the World Martial Arts Hall Of Fame in the second year of it's existence, becoming one of the first six Modern Arnis practitioners to receive such an honor! He is also held in high regard by other members of the Modern Arnis/Martial Arts community being a techincal advisor for the International Modern Arnis Federation of the Philippines (USA) and the World Martial Arts Society (a testament to his notability).

<li>Modern Arnis is a small fish in the larger martialarts pool. It doesn't have the name recognitiojn of karate, kung fu or ninjutsu, so it doesn't surprise me that Dr. Barbers program is the only one in the US. I'm unaware of any martial arts programs taught for credit in US collages, so having an accredited program does strike me as notable. Modern Arnis is taught in the Phillipines schools though, and at least 1 other practitioner, Lisa McManas (with IMAF under Jeff Delany) also teaches a program in a collage, though I am not certain of the specifics there. <b>Keep</b> --Bob Hubbard 15:01, 20 December 2005 (UTC) <small><i><b>User has been registered less than one week; seventh distinct edit</b></i></small></li>

<li>Dr. B's program brings Modern Arnis to people that might otherwise not step into a martial arts school because of cost, self esteem, or other issues. As a college course and a self defense club that is accessible to non students through the adult education program, Jerome has made Modern Arnis available to those that really need it instead of just those that can afford it. Since enrollment is generally between 12-25 students per semester. Factor the number of semesters that the program has been running (at two campuses for a number of those years) not to mention the number of Modern Arnis Seminars as well as for other arts he has hosted over the years, Dr. B has been very influencial IMO <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESignatures_bcf8.html" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment was added by 168.169.28.179 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_168.169.28.179_d666.html" title="Special:Contributions/168.169.28.179">contribs</a>).</small> <small><i><b>User's <u>only</u> contribution</b></i></small></li>

<p>Good Christ, this was a mess. First we get rampant sock-puppeteering, then the explosion of some acedemic and personal debate between Barber and someone named Jeff (JJL, not me).

I am also pre-emptively relisting the nomination to gather legit debate on the article's veracity. To the closing admin (I can't close this myself because I nominated it) still take into account the previous votes, but keep in mind the meat- and sock-puppetry. To new Wikipedians, please keep in mind that AfD guidlines state that "Your opinion will be given the most weight if you are logged in with an account that already existed when the nomination was made." Discussions of the article's content should be made on the article's talk page and longer discussions of the article's veracity on the AfDs subpage.

<p>Keep. There isn't any other person who has my credential in terms of approval in writin from the later founder and system GM Remy A. Presas, for a college credit course in Modern Arnis within the USA. His approval was given in 1989 and the program has been running continuously from 1987 through the Fall Semerster at Erie Community College in Orchard Park, NY. I have noticed that the most recent votes for deletion have been given sans any supporting reasons. Admitting that I am somewhat biased on the matter, I none the less have put my martial resume up for review and camparision to anyone who is willing to do the same. My position in terms of creating and teaching a college based, credit bearing courses in Modern Arnis, is singularly unique in the art, within the USA. My tie-in to the IMAFP as an Advisor is indicative of my continued interest in positively promoting the art.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> I don't understand why this article threatens to include 1/12 of Earth' population. According to this, we should have EVERY Christian in the <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a> and EVERY historical person in <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Pagans_d6d4.html" title="List of Pagans">List of Pagans</a>.

<li>perhaps because <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Christians_ec4d.html" title="List of Christians">List of Christians</a> is for practicing Christians who are known for being Christian and <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_pagans.html" title="List of pagans">List of pagans</a> is for practicing Pagans who are known for being Pagan. There is no such thing as a "practicing Sagittarian", so it would become a list of people known for being Sagittarian - i.e., everyone famous who has a birthday known to be between late December and mid January.

<p>Since so many -punk articles have come up for AfD all at once, this is your one-stop-shop to vote for those you think should be kept and those you think should go.</p>
<ul>
<li>I think most of these articles are valid descriptions of genres, but they're titled under recently made up neologisms.

<li><b>very weak delete</b> - it's a vanity review, but that isn't a reason to delete, but to clean up and de-POV. We could simply make this into a valid stub. Amazon verifies that the book exists, so, in the end, this is a question of whether this book is notable enough to justify an article. An Amazon rating of 600,000 isn't good - but isn't pathetic either for a technical book (my own is at 2.7 million). What pushes it towards delete for me is that google gives it nothing beyond Amazon - which means university libraries aren't listing it (my book scores several dozen on this front). However, this book was only published in August 2005 - so perhaps there is time yet. We really could do with working out a <a href="../../../b/o/o/WP%7EBOOKS_edbc.html" title="WP:BOOKS">WP:BOOKS</a> policy. --<a href="../../../d/o/c/User%7EDoc_glasgow_0eb4.html" title="User:Doc glasgow">Doc</a> <a href="../../../d/o/c/User_talk%7EDoc_glasgow_5336.html" title="User talk:Doc glasgow"><sup>ask?</sup></a> 14:31, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>In google there are only to references to this word - both references to the wikipedia-article, and the phenomena hasn't made it into the diagnostic manuals or anything like that (the kind of books I work with as a psychologist). It is questionable, if you would put the mentioned symptoms in a new category, because they are fitting into some other well documented (so called) disorders. But as we psychiatrists and psychologists love to give new names to old things, this is no real argument against the existence of this thing. The word as such sounds strage to me, but we also like strange words, therefore ...</p>
<p>Anyway, I am not (N O T) objecting to include articles on "disorders" that affect only a small group of people (who knows, it might become a fashionable diagnosis next year allready), but I thing, we need a source, like some psychiatric journal ... as long, as there is no source, I think, this article is violating wikipedias verification-policy Enfiladissa 08:18, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<p>Dear Mikkalai. Several homepages refer to the Bozaloshtsh. What is your problem? Dr. Anthony E. Smith is behind this interpreation of the Bozaloshtsh. Remember it is Wendish - not Russian mythology in this case. See: <a href="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/b/bozaloshtsh.html" class="external free" title="http://www.pantheon.org/articles/b/bozaloshtsh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantheon.org/articles/b/bozaloshtsh.html</a></p>
<p>But on the other hand. I may have been fooled by this Wicca, I'm must admit. see: <a href="http://www.heathenfolk.net/forums/view_topic.php?id=599&amp;forum_id=&amp;jump_to=2750" class="external free" title="http://www.heathenfolk.net/forums/view_topic.php?id=599&amp;forum_id=&amp;jump_to=2750" rel="nofollow">http://www.heathenfolk.net/forums/view_topic.php?id=599&amp;forum_id=&amp;jump_to=2750</a> "Now this guy, Dr. Anthony E.

<li><b>Comment</b> - this article has been on AfD for 13 days now, which seems to be stretching the process beyond what it's meant to be. Clearly there is no consensus to delete, so the article (as ridiculous as it may be) should be unburdened of the AfD notice.

<li><b>Emphatic Delete</b>. There's no consensus to delete because it's such an incredibly obscure topic. As one of the few people who actually know anything of pre-Christian Slavic mythology, I have to say this is complete bollocks. The people had no writing. We're not even sure of the functions and relationships between their chief deities. I have never heard of Biren Bonnerjea or his 1921 book before, but in the past few decades made up Slavic mythology has been used to support a huge number of hoaxes in wiccan literature. I'd need to see more modern sources, with detailed explanation on where they found this deity, to change my mind. A single obscure 1921 book isn't nearly good enough. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 23:23, 23 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hey, what's going on, Zordrac? I'm not sure I agree with the criteria you have laid out for <b>Art Webb 1986</b>. If he isn't listed on IMDB for the bit he's supposed to play, he's a very background character. Also, being someone's sibling is not grounds for notability, so we should really only be looking at the <a href="../../../c/k/y/CKY_%28videos%29_b708.html" title="CKY (videos)">CKY</a> thing. <a href="../../../j/h/m/User%7EJHMM13_dfcf.html" title="User:JHMM13">JHMM13</a> (<a href="../../../j/h/m/User_talk%7EJHMM13_2dd8.html" title="User talk:JHMM13">T</a> | <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_JHMM13_5487.html" title="Special:Contributions/JHMM13">C</a>) 00:38, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

<li>Hmm. Well I am swinging on this one. All of the forums say that he *WAS* a notable character. I think that we just need to find out what his other name was.

<p><b>Delete</b> AW1986 is a very minor cast member in the CKY / VLB dynasty - in fact, to call him a cast member is itself laughable. I seriously doubt that he deserves a separate entry, all that needs to be known about him (which is that he's Rake's brother) is on the <a href="../../../c/k/y/CKY_%28videos%29_b708.html" title="CKY (videos)">CKY (videos)</a> page. No diss at all to Art, I've seen - and love - everything these guys have put out, and edit the CKY video page. I can just confirm that whatever forums and google say, he is only very vaguely important to CKY and seriously not worth an entry. If all of Bam's friends who make occasional 2 second appearances in the CKY films and spin-offs were given pages there would be a hell of a lot of them. The whole of West Chester for a start... Other minor cast / crew members who have managed to get entries should also be looked at.</p>
<p>Also, as far as I know it isn't a psudonym, his surname is certainly Webb - "Rake Yohn", as his brother is known, is a psudonym, real name Ted Webb.</p>

<li>The Seibertron.com website is actually one of the most well known in internet Transformers fandom for various reasons (some of them quite controversial), and virtually anyone active in that fandom will know (and if they're not a member of said site thoroughly dislike) Seibertron.com.--Gunbuster 08:02, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>It's all right, I've expanded on it quite a bit EnerJolt 11:50, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li>Now it looks like vanity and <a href="../../../f/a/n/Wikipedia%7EFancruft_fe73.html" title="Wikipedia:Fancruft">fancruft</a>. Trolls are a dime a dozen, and shouldn't even be noted; ignoring the obvious <a href="../../../n/p/o/NPOV_05ab.html" title="NPOV">NPOV</a> violations. There's more NPOV problems in other sections, as well. --<a href="../../../a/p/o/User%7EApostrophe_4563.html" title="User:Apostrophe">Apostrophe</a> 01:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apostrophe, I've expanded further to include other features of the site, to make it seem less like fancruft. I've read the NPOV page, and I don't see what the problem is (if you could elaborate on the problem, instead of simply telling me there is a problem, it would be greatly appreciated). Moreover, the section on the trollers is a part of seibertron.com's coloured history, and as Gunbuster has pointed out, seibertron.com is well-noted in the Transformers internet fanbase, for better or worse. There are many other fansites concerning celebrated television shows i.e. <a href="../../../a/l/t/Alt.tv.simpsons.html" title="Alt.tv.simpsons">alt.tv.simpsons</a> and <a href="../../../n/e/w/Newgrounds.html" title="Newgrounds">newgrounds</a>, so I really don't see what the problem is, unless you have no great affection for Optimus and Megatron</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I would like to note that I am the creator of the article, and a member of Seibertron.com, and it is true that Seibertron is among the best known Transformer sites on the net, and in the way of the VSD, not so much unlike Wikipedia itself. If you look at our page, it's grown since I first started it, and with time it will grow more. We only wish to bring our collective knowledge forth so those interested Transformers will be able to learn about it's past. Please give the page a second thought.
<ul>
<li>The article lacks even basic information on the majority of things that make it noteworthy. Heavy Metal War deserves it's inclusion, but where is the site's history? Seibertron.com has become (in?)famous throughout the fandom for the controversy it's either courted or created, not because of it's forum set-up, moderators or trolls.--Gunbuster 12:31, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b> there's a different between an article for a major thourougfare and streetcruft like this. There were a bunch of AfDs a copule of months back about various streets in <a href="../../../t/o/r/Toronto.html" title="Toronto">Toronto</a>. The net result was that only the major arterial roads (and not all of these), as well as "important" shopping and cultural steets were kept. And even after that purge, Toronto seems to have a loweb bar for street notability that most other cities on Wikipedia. According to the article, ths little street runs 4 blocks, and was the article was likely created only because someone found it as a redlink on List of streets in Taylor, Michigan (which is also on AfD). I would suggest that a good guidline for streets might be that if there is nothing more to say about them than can be learned from a map, then they don't deserve an article. But perhaps we should have a <a href="../../../c/e/n/Wikipedia%7ECentralized_discussion_915c.html" title="Wikipedia:Centralized discussion">Wikipedia:Centralized discussion</a> on notability for steets? <a href="../../../s/e/g/User%7ESegv11_a1bc.html" title="User:Segv11">Jamie</a> <sup>(<a href="../../../s/e/g/User_talk%7ESegv11_8bc4.html" title="User talk:Segv11">talk</a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_segv11_640f.html" title="Special:Contributions/segv11">contribs</a>)</sup> 02:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I will explain, but not now. Please make sure you are looking at the most current version of the article. I removed the bio immediately after posting it. I reported the problem to #wikimedia-tech that the article kept reverting itself. My father thinks that some intermediate caching server is at fault. The current Wikipedia article on this topic does not contain the bio. I wholeheartedly agree that a bio of that sort violates Wikipedia's policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>But unbenowkst to whoever nominated this article for deletion, I invited discussion in my edits to bipolar disorder repeatedly (these invitations and due process provisions were deleted).. and tried to give the community adequate <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a> (according to my perception of Wikipedia's <a href="../../../c/u/s/Customs.html" title="Customs">customs</a> and courtesies (that all changes that may offend someone or aren't self-explanatory (the exception that I thought I was falling into), however when the requests for <a href="../../../d/u/e/Due_process.html" title="Due process">due process</a> were deleted from the article with nary a notice on my talk page, or on the article's talk page, which is where I first saw Anome, and got to know Anome a little bit, I decided to simply put a link inside the cleanup tag. I created the Health Wikispace because someone complained on the Bipolar disorder talk page that they were reading about bipolar disorder for the first time, or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Modifying the cleanup tag is not vandalism -- it is providing remedial sources in response to feedback left on the talk page; it is merely responding to the needs of a sub-community within Wikipedia (the sub-community the talk page represents), in a way that does no permenant damage to the page. When the cleanup tag is removed, the links to alternative sources will be removed with it, because those links are inside the cleanup tag. This is not <a href="../../../v/a/n/Vanity.html" title="Vanity">vanity</a> or publicity of an external site for the purposes of <a href="../../../m/u/c/Muckracking.html" title="Muckracking">muckracking</a>. It was responding to the needs of the mentally ill, who may have trouble finding the appropriate resources in crisis. I would prefer that the cleanup tag contain a link to Answers.com, or medicinenet.com -- but the Answers.com link [also inside the cleanup tag] was removed. Wikipedia already has discussed Answers.com before, and decided Answers.com could include Wikipedia on their site, so I think it is an appropriate link to include <b>inside the cleanup tag</b> Wikipedia is not intended to do <a href="../../../h/a/r/Harm.html" title="Harm">harm</a> to someone indirectly by way of not giving them the best information first when they are in a really bad state and may be about to do things which for triggering reasons I will not list. I do not want somebody to read about bipolar disorder, and feel that marijuna is the best choice of treatment (<a href="../../../i/l/l/Illicit_drug_use.html" title="Illicit drug use">illicit drug use</a> will delay treatment),for example. (The <a href="../../../t/l/c/TLC_e12a.html" title="TLC">TLC</a> reference is still being debated on the talk page). Given the <a href="../../../e/x/i/Exigent.html" title="Exigent">exigent</a> circumstances for someone who is mentally ill, I really feel that at least until the article is cleaned up, we should provide links to more credible sources in the cleanup tag. I will cease modifying the article itself. I look forward to a decision being made, however I would request that we wait until after I have sorted out any caching issues that may be affecting people from accessing the article, and until after Hanukah.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> It may have started as an advertisment, but by now it's become a separate cultural element (as was said, like "Where's the Beef"). The article isn't a promotion for the Virgin Mobile, it's a description of a satirical holiday used in the ad. Encyclopedic (but barely). --<a href="../../../w/i/n/User%7EWingsandsword_3b20.html" title="User:Wingsandsword">Wingsandsword</a> 02:40, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> This article exists to EXPLAIN a neologism and a clever use of political-correctness and religion in advertisement. Even if the term is probably irrelevant outside of the U.S. it's still interesting. Is <a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> an ad for the Christian religion? Asereje 05:50, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Altough the content may be somewhat advertising, it is still a word used in today's society. It serves as an alternative to "Happy Holidays!" and stating each holiday's name, as they each fall on almost the same day (<a href="../../../c/h/r/Christmas.html" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> was Dec 25, <a href="../../../h/a/n/Hanukkah.html" title="Hanukkah">Hanukkah</a> that same night, and <a href="../../../k/w/a/Kwanzaa.html" title="Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a> the following day). <a href="../../../j/s/m/User%7EJsm008us_891b.html" title="User:Jsm008us">Jerr</a> 02:13, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Makes me weary because of the fact they remove the "t" from the <i>Christmas</i> portion of the holiday name, this is the whole reason retailers replace the word Christmas with "holiday", to remove the term "Christ". If Virgin wants to be inclusive, it should be spelled Christmahanukwanzakah. (Note it includes the letters C-H-R-I-S-M, directly removing only the "t") <a href="../../../p/a/t/User%7EPatrickA_389d.html" title="User:PatrickA">PatrickA</a> 23:09, 30 December 2005 (UTC).</li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. Sutcliffe, Hindley and Brady are especially well known criminals who still (many years after their deads) evoke a strong reaction in the minds of the British public. Can this guy claim any noteability based on amount of newspaper coverage, for example?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I would really like to see the following approach to all borderline notable subjects like murderers, webcomic characters, races from the extended Star Wars universe, etc. Make the main "List of &lt;whatever&gt;" article; list all subjects with a very brief summary; and redirect all potential candidates to the main article. It's as much as they deserve. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 00:35, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>, Crawford is notable because he was a horriffic serial killer who was, at the time, mostly ignored. He's lately become the subject of a book and television documentary on the CBC. Needless to say, Canadian serial killers would get less attention in America, but that doesn't make somebody an unknown ... and you're only going to find killers being executed in the dark ages, in America, and in third world countries, so I can't see how that is the standard for worthiness as an entry. Or would you suggest that somebody like <a href="../../../p/a/u/Paul_Bernardo_21b6.html" title="Paul Bernardo">Paul Bernardo</a> should lose his entry too? Doooook 01:11, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. After looking up the info on Google, it seems he is somewhat noteable, ironically for his relative obscurity, given the scale and nature of his crimes. The book <i>Just Another Indian</i> goes into the dichotomy of his fame/obscurity. It does need a lot of <b>tidy</b>ing though. <a href="../../../j/a/n/User%7EJanesDaddy_efbe.html" title="User:JanesDaddy">JanesDaddy</a> 17:11, 27 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>It seems to me that j2 Global and Ed Casas should discuss this issue and agree to work together to craft a meaningful entry for this term. --71.105.109.113 04:56, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>There is already an article about j2 Global's eFax service (<a href="../../../e/f/a/EFax_fbf3.html" title="EFax">EFax</a>), and this article links there. Creating <a href="../../../c/o/n/Wikipedia%7EContent_forking_411e.html" title="Wikipedia:Content forking">multiple articles about the same subject</a> is not allowed. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 11:37, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<p>But you created that article and made the efax unix program first. j2's first trademark to eFax goes back to 1989 and it is very well known. Why shouldn't the description of j2's eFax go first? If not that, then the parties should draft something together that they can both live with. I believe j2 would work with you A.M. to do this.--207.213.246.3 17:47, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you mean "first"? The link to the <a href="../../../e/f/a/EFax_fbf3.html" title="EFax">eFax</a> article is above the main text of the <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax.html" title="Efax">efax</a> article. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 18:28, 28 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>What I mean is that j2 has a trademark to efax, whether with a capital F or not. When someone types "efax" or "EFAX" in wikipedia it goes to this efax site, which I thought you first created. In any event, efax has a proud history, both with respect to the unix software and the eFax.com and eFax service of j2 Global today. I would hope we could agree to work together to develop an article helpful to the public in understanding this entire story.--207.213.246.3 23:46, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It would be possible to move the article to something like <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax_%28software%29.html" title="Efax (software)">efax (software)</a> and put a disambiguation page at <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax.html" title="Efax">efax</a> which links to both <a href="../../../e/f/a/EFax_fbf3.html" title="EFax">eFax</a> and <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax_%28software%29.html" title="Efax (software)">efax (software)</a>. Would that be acceptable? However, the page shouldn't be moved until this AfD concludes. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 20:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>This idea makes a lot of sense. I think we'll be able to work this out. I don't know how the AfD process works, but I would imagine if we are the only two interested parties that our agreement would prevail. For now I suggest we include both of our respective entries in this location, and then j2's professional writers will come up with a draft for your review. How does that sound? --207.213.246.3 00:00, 30 December 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This AfD listing will probably conclude in a few days, although it might be relisted because there haven't been many votes yet. If the article is kept, I will move it to <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax_%28software%29.html" title="Efax (software)">efax (software)</a> and put a disambiguation page (similar to <a href="../../../a/-/_/A-.html" title="A-">this one</a>) at <a href="../../../e/f/a/Efax.html" title="Efax">efax</a>. — <a href="../../../a/2E/m/User%7EA.M._a73e.html" title="User:A.M.">A.M.</a> 07:09, 30 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>My point for being inactive is that someone went and said "Hey, a country list in chinese would be a cool addition to Wikipedia," then after completing the first letter turned around and said "On second thoughts, I don't think Wikipedia desperateny needs this. I'll stop."

<li><b>Strong keep</b>, clean-up and expand. The article represents a valid approach to forward looking statement, a business term that gets <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22forward+looking+statement%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22forward+looking+statement%22&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official" rel="nofollow">almost 1 million google hits</a>. We clearly need an article on the concept, which is comparable to numerous other articles here on financial and legal terms. I see no reference here to Joan of Arc or Medieval history or anyone named Joan. As the nominator seems to be involved in a dispute with the submitting editor over an unrelated article, I question whether this is not a bad faith nomination. -- <a href="../../../j/j/a/User%7EJJay_42ac.html" title="User:JJay">JJay</a> 19:29, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b>: Then I ask you to strike your accusation of bad faith. I tagged it as nonsense because it conflates a narrow piece of financial terminology with general statements about grammar, linguistics, and historiography. The phrase has no application to those fields. Style manuals don't teach students to end creative essays with "forward-looking statements." This is pure fantasy on the part of the article creator with jargon added to impress the unaware. If it gave the actual dictdef I would have tried to transwiki. <a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurova_1105.html" title="User:Durova">Durova</a> 21:33, 23 December 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b> It is more notable by its legal usage; however, the reader should know the basis for which such statements entail. Hence, one doesn't finally learn about such statements after one is employed by a business. The roots of it are in linguistics and social sciences. I want to address how businesses also organize their plans with a forward-looking statement on efficency at the start of the year and with a backward-looking statement that reflects how much they acheived at the end of the year. This would help expand the article a bit more when I find a good source. If there is anything close to original research, it would be how forward-looking statements affect the accreditation of an entity by its subject material, but the abundance of search-hits on disclaimer related context makes it harder to avoid the "shorter" temptation of an exploitation by common sense. With wikipedia's implementation of "approved" and "developmental" versions of articles, I 'm sure, scientifically, any <i>forward-looking statement</i> is a considerable qualifier or at least a questionable one, like how it works in law. Societies settled on "<a href="../../../o/p/e/Open_source.html" title="Open source">open source</a>" as not jargon, and, in a similar way, we have the common expression for a <i>forward-looking statement</i>. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 10:30, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> I'm surprised you stated "per nom." If you review Durova's nom related argument about <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a>, you'll notice the page is protected. As of Dec 16th, Durova and possibly another editor has tried to <a href="../../../j/o/a/Talk%7EJoan_of_Arc_980b.html#Reverts" title="Talk:Joan of Arc">revert</a> any further change. A review of the talk section reveals where Durova states the notes being <a href="../../../c/o/m/WP%7EComplete_Bollocks_6e1c.html" title="WP:Complete Bollocks">WP:Complete Bollocks</a> because of functionality, yet other editors and I have found the notes to functionally work correctly. I'm sure the nom is part of Durova's continuation to "edit war." The subject of a <i>forwarding-looking statement</i> does not have anything to do with a style guide, but it is about historical fact. Obviously, Durova feared this might be an issue for whatever reason. Consider, Durova put up the AfD tag the same day I created it. Durova and another editor has strived to make <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> a FA, but in essence has also tried to own the article. <a href="../../../j/o/a/Joan_of_Arc_9b78.html" title="Joan of Arc">Joan of Arc</a> may become a FA one day, but not by ownership, reverts, or in the chase of my activity on the <a href="../../../f/o/r/Forward-looking_statement.html" title="Forward-looking statement">forward-looking statement</a> article to put it a nonsense nom on AfD. Instead of the defensive side which I shouldn't have to do for an AfD, notice the content is still verifiable. Even if it is hard to wade through over a million search-hits. — <a href="../../../d/z/o/User%7EDzonatas_e6e2.html" title="User:Dzonatas"><b><font color="#0000FF">Dz</font><font color="#3F50FF">on</font><font color="#5F80FF">at</font><font color="#77B0FF">as</font></b></a> 15:38, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment:</b> With limited attention to the VfD process for this page, I'm left to make further comment in the hollow. I've noticed the related <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> subjects and concluded the nom was an experiment of Durova's. In contrast, I've also noticed other articles that haven't been so quickly put up on AfD, like <a href="../../../f/u/n/Functional_shift.html" title="Functional shift">Functional shift</a> which has barely any content. It receives only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Functional+shift%22&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22Functional+shift%22&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">13k hits</a> on google. While that is easier to wade through and find verifable content, there are many hits that express a different definition than given. There is also the <a href="../../../s/h/a/Shatt_language.html" title="Shatt language">Shatt language</a> that barely has any impression, which google reports only <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=shatt+&amp;btnG=Search" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=shatt+&amp;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow">160k hits</a> just for "shatt."

<p>Quoting from the article:</p>
<ul>
<li>"There are to date no readily available publications in English that explain BEV"</li>
<li>"It is nearly impossible to cross-check this information since much of it has not been published in the public domain. What follows is drawn from material that was presented in one of the proprietary training courses offered by the Occidental Institute Research Foundation in the early 1990's."</li>
</ul>
<p>This is very confusing, frankly, but the above statements make me think that this is <a href="../../../n/o/r/WP%7ENOR_e27a.html" title="WP:NOR">original research</a>. If no sources can be cited, we can't really verify the claims of this article.

<li>The principles of this have been around since 1948</li>

There is absolutely no doubt that humans function on electrical principals, unfortunately the term 'bio-electronic' does sound silly. I am growing heartily sick of the wikipedia's arrogant tone of writing and subtle censorship. If you didn't rely on donations then I wouldn't care at all how you edited your articles, and I do take it with a grain of salt, God help anyone who thinks wikipedia is authoritative. *update* <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4564812.stm" class="external text" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4564812.stm" rel="nofollow">here</a> seems there is a growing demand for such technology...</li>

<li>The website given is currently offline, and according to the article has been for several months. The site's only claim to fame is trying to act as a counterbalance to <a href="../../../s/t/o/Stormfront_%28online_site%29.html" title="Stormfront (online site)">Stormfront</a>. Google has 46,200 hits for <b>mootstormfront</b>, of which <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Mootstormfront&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=100&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Mootstormfront&amp;num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;start=100&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">113 are unique</a>, most dealing with forum posts and internet link-directory lists (We're the second hit, right after the defunct website itself).

<li><b>Delete</b>. I was the party responsible for the Speed-delete tag. Like Flyboy above (who is not related to me, really!), I think the site's aims may have been worthwhile, but that in and of itself doesn't qualify for encyclopedic entry. There are many, many, many (active) forums of all sorts on the Internet which have significantly more notability, and very few of which are being promoted through Wikipedia. This particular one has not been referenced by any verifiable source outside of other similar forums. It's defunct, and may never return. Wikipedia is not the place to be providing promotional space for just any organization/group/forum.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Mootstormfront is well known for being Stormfront's anti-racist counterpart. True, the site is currently down, but according to its members it should be back up.

<li><b>Keep</b> - This page, while perhaps not the most encyclopedic article on Wikipedia, is an example of the strength of the wiki concept at compiling and providing information. Netflix does not make this information available, so the information must be gleaned from many different users of their service in order to create a complete list. It is not advertising (any more than the Netflix article itself is) - if anything, the article will dissuade people from subscribing if they find out there's not a distribution facility near them. --<a href="../../../d/a/c/User%7EDachannien_f06e.html" title="User:Dachannien">Dachannien</a> 06:16, 26 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The word has been associated, for some unknown reasons, with freemasonry since more than 150 years at least (read the publication dates of the referenced books). Additionally it returns more than one thousand hits on google alone. This is enough to classify it as an "infusion into popular culture".

<dd>The ISTA link is Duncan's Royal Arch Monitor. Royal Arch is not part of mainstream Masonry, and in fact starts on the 4th degree. It's certainly not pop culture.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Melchidzedek is something that looks like Masonry, but isn't, and is clearly meant to imply Satanism by being located on a ministry site for, presumably, "ex-Masons". Also not pop culture.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The third link is "Necromantic Origins of Freemasonry", once again attempting to claim Satan worship, and citing Morgan, no less. It plays with semantics to make a point, and is also written by an anonymous author. Also not pop culture.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Bannerstrade has a list of a whole lot of thngs for sale, probably on auction sites. That is not popular culture, or else you need to claim the same for "rosicrucian". That's not pop culture, that's collectibles.</dd>

<p><b>Defence</b> I must question the reason for deleting this article. This is a viable and used term and has been so for a much longer period of time than podcasting. Deleting it in place of podcasting for the reasons stated are laughable; given Endomion's reasoning does this mean the term 'tube' should be deleted because the term 'subway' is more widely used? I believe democracy and the free and open exchange of ideas are truely being trampled on by deleting this article; everyone has the right to use alternative termenology. As for the argument that it is not the one people really use and know, a) people in different social contexts use differernt terms and b) podcasting and New Time Radio are NOT interchangable; New Time Radio refers to audio programs done in the style of Old Time Radio but that are broadcasted through the internet rather than radio. Podcasts can be speech, musical works, interviews and such, and c) Old Time Radio is an established term, as such New Time Radio is merely a derivative which arguably makes it more widely recognised to a greater audience than podcasting even to people not familiar with technology. <a href="../../../r/u/b/User%7ERubenerd_638f.html" title="User:Rubenerd">Rubenerd</a> 11:43, 25 December 2005 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Strong keep</b> most usenet flamewars are surely not notable (I've been involved in several and witnessed many more) but some are, particualrly when there are real world effects. Shutting down the mail-servers at Boston University alone is enough to make this notable IMO, and being the, er, catalyst for the adoption of digital signatures in usenet control msgs is an even stronger reason to regard this as notable. One may diappapprove of or dispise internet trolls and vandals, but when they have real-world effects, we should report on them. <a href="../../../d/e/s/User%7EDESiegel_4173.html" title="User:DESiegel">DES</a> <a href="../../../d/e/s/User_talk%7EDESiegel_7db5.html" title="User talk:DESiegel"><sup>(talk)</sup></a> 00:14, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak keep</b> - I remember these events and have heard reference to them since then. I'm not sure that the label of 'biggest flame war of all time' is accurate, but it was certainly a notable event which established a 'Meow Wars' meme which people might wish to look up. Keeping an article on one notable flame war is <i>not</i> synonymous with keeping articles on <i>all</i> flame wars. It might be better to cut down and merge this into the <a href="../../../f/l/a/Flaming.html" title="Flaming">Flaming</a> article. --<a href="../../../c/b/d/User%7ECBDunkerson_e7cf.html" title="User:CBDunkerson">CBD</a> <big><sub><a href="../../../c/b/d/User_talk%7ECBDunkerson_69fd.html" title="User talk:CBDunkerson">☎</a></sub></big> <sup><a href="../../../e/m/a/Special%7EEmailuser_CBDunkerson_9249.html" title="Special:Emailuser/CBDunkerson">✉</a></sup> 01:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> Now nearly ten years on, we can reasonably measure whether the "Meow Wars" have had any lasting impact. The answer is not really. The article doesn't mention any substantial aftereffects outside usenet besides vague references to the fact that Web forums tend to be more moderated (they are, but not directly because of the Meow Wars). The article has no mention of any mainstream coverage by the media, no books, newspaper citations, etc. Finally, I count <b><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Meow+Wars%22+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Meow+Wars%22+-wikipedia+-encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;start=180&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">151 unique Google hits</a></b> out of some 350 total.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Considering that the History section of the <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a> mentions none of this, the only Links To are from the "see also" sections in a handful of articles, and based on the miniscule google hits, I think it don't even deserve to be a redirect to <a href="../../../u/s/e/Usenet.html" title="Usenet">Usenet</a>. <a href="../../../f/l/y/User%7EFlyboy_Will_540f.html" title="User:Flyboy Will">Flyboy Will</a> 03:44, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong keep</b>. This isn't <i>just</i> another flamewar. This is <i>the</i> flamewar. It pretty much brought most of Usenet to a standstill, and was basically the beginning of the decrease in the signal to noise ratio for the social parts of Usenet. There wouldn't be much in the way of google hits or mainstream press, as this was during the time that the Internet was still in its infancy and most of the MSM had not heard of the Internet, and the documentation of what exactly happened isn't great--all we have is the content of the flame war, so there's not much on the Web about it, as this was still three years before the creation of the first web browser. --<a href="../../../t/h/e/User%7EThephotoman_1da2.html" title="User:Thephotoman">Thephotoman</a> 08:20, 24 December 2005 (UTC)</li>
