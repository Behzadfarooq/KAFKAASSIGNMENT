<p>Article is very poorly written and is more a nationalistic justification than historical facts.

<li><b>Delete</b>...reluctantly. I've been involved in cleaning up this contributor's articles in the past. This contributor is a spanish speaker translating Japanese text into bad english. That process, coupled with additional "translation" involved in the english cleanup calls into serious question the integrity of the information. Single-step translation is hard enough. I believe this person is contributing in good faith, but that the integrity of the final content is highly questionable. This contributor is highly prolific and we'll continue to see his articles here at <a href="../../../v/f/d/VfD_4d7f.html" title="VfD">VfD</a>, I fear. <a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> 05:46, 8 Jun 2005 (UTC)</li>

<p>Sir<a href="../../../t/o/b/User%7ETobycat_72d8.html" title="User:Tobycat">Tobycat</a> ,and some others i stay agreed much for understand my real intentions,still my some english grammar difficult.over present article,yours can to decided,if liked,deleted this...</p>
<p>for certain i no encounter why when your realizing the profounds cleanups at information why sended,this are non losses of the real escence of these dates,at contrary these escence if mantain intact,(i can to comparing with original sources) and i liked to read and understand perfect your reedition,and i appareing more interests and easy to understand.for me stay more well..</p>
<p>If certain i in my limits treated to send somes dates and first hand informations of previous wartimes about Japan for see in japanese position and you think manners in these moment,and additional somes dates of japanese side in pacific war.</p>
<p>Reiterally i no poses any imagination or great capacity to inventive for created all type of cyphers or social and military details,more less inside of japanese side or from these times.</p>
<p>i reconoited why if certain why poses more limits in english,but i observed why always in all parts,if one require obtain any really and very detail information,always stay in english, the Universal <a href="../../../l/i/n/Lingua_Franca_8f12.html" title="Lingua Franca">Lingua Franca</a>.these information stay more limited or never exist in any other languages always stay more detail in english. for other part the most important experts in any theme or topic,or the mosts important analisis of any topics...for suppose stayed in english,one situation no encountered in another languages,for this certain themes can t understand in other languages,all in english.</p>
<p>in personally i sende more hate for statisticts or numbers or any cyphers groups,or all great mass of dates,but in particulary respect at Japanese side before and ww2, i sense particulary more simpathy and over my personal hate,disagree or disdain respect at statistics or dates i having decide to sended these first hand and ancient dates of ancient japanese times,more oftheirs are forgetting or some remembered for persons why living in these times only.</p>
<p>other special interest stay in why i in past years one old parent sayed at my,over one acient parent why at final result no chinese,without one Japanese <a href="../../../n/i/k/Nikkei.html" title="Nikkei">Nikkei</a> why are little merchant,one thing why causing in me more prided,and remember somes japanese friends why stayed for work reasons in my land and poses some personal friendship.</p>
<p>other personal reason if i entered why between the Japanese Plans against Panama Canal(I-400 Mission), ones parents knowed ones suppose Japanese fishers, but results why theirs poses short wave radios and stay in comunication with Japanese Navy officer Jakuji Oshi and the submarine I-9 poses orders to patrol Panama Gulf waters for reconoited areas.</p>

<dd>Hi,200.46.215.181
<dl>
<dd>The grammar is not the main reason I posted this article on the votes for deletion. I appreciate that people from all around the world want, and should, continue to collaborate to wikipedia. I myself am french-speaking, and you are right, it is difficult to stay on the frech wikipedia when almost all articles are more complete in english.</dd>
<dd>However, the problem with this particular article is that it is a justification of japanese nationalism and not a neutral description of events. I do not think this is justified in an encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>For example, you say "this if motif for Russian-Japanese War of 1904-05,for why obtain some concessions socalled "Treated Rigths" in South Manchuria.in 1910,Korea having formally annexed,during first decades of century the territorial security are principal military motif." The way I read this, you imply that Japan had all rights to gain concessions in South Manchuria. This is a one-sided analysis.</dd>
<dd>If you want to try to re-write this article, you should at least cite sources, and put your sentences in the form "according to xxx, ...". But even then, it should be included in <a href="../../../j/a/p/Japanese_nationalism.html" title="Japanese nationalism">Japanese nationalism</a>, which is where it belongs. We do not need separate articles for different opinions on the same subject.</dd>
<dd>I hope I have the chance to read more of your work in the future,</dd>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>-if one interested and logic point,but in particular i treated</li>
</ul>
<p>to present the japanese point of seeing,for comparing and analized your think at respect,with historical pourposes.</p>
<p>respect at much reading of my work,i am readed the material analized and writing the importants parts,(exist much informations) and still my grammar deficiences i understand your english writing form with correct gramar in clear form.</p>
<p>respect at another sides of question,for all exist the respectives analizes why present your respective side.i am no treated to enter in conflict with any side,i only treated to present the japanese viewpoint for knowed the respective ideas in these times,more diffrent at present days.</p>
<p>reiterally if your desired deleted,i no poses any problem for this. if part of the sistem and understand more well.</p>
