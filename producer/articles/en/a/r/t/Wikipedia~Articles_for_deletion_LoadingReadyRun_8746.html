<p>The result of the debate was <b>delete</b>. Given that many editors supported deletion, then later arguments for keeping were presented, there is a question here - which I believe Drat is calling attention to below - over whether those arguments have been adequately addressed. I believe they have been. Most of Basscomm's arguments were well responded to by Drat. There are several awards won which are cited in the article, other than that linked to here, but they were already in the article when it was nominated and do not appear to have persuaded editors, which seems a reasonable conclusion to me. A lot, and I mean <i>a lot</i> of people make short films, very few are widely seen, but whenever a sufficient number of people do stuff, they will start giving each other prizes for it. An award has to be notable itself to confer notability.</p>
<p>Given that and the self-promotional nature of this article (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Korandder" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Korandder" rel="nofollow">Korandder</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Basscomm" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Basscomm" rel="nofollow">Basscomm</a>, the only two arguing for keep, have edited very little apart from this article and its AfD), I believe this discussion shows a consensus among editors that this group does not merit coverage in an encyclopaedia (AfD is not a vote, in case it wasn't clear already). Although not all editors have responded to the arguments presented directly, I believe it is more likely that they agreed with Drat's counter-arguments and did not feel the need to dogpile, rather than that they have simply been ignoring this discussion. --<a href="../../../s/a/m/User%7ESamuel_Blanning_ee68.html" title="User:Samuel Blanning">Sam Blanning</a><sup><a href="../../../s/a/m/User_talk%7ESamuel_Blanning_443b.html" title="User talk:Samuel Blanning">(talk)</a></sup> 18:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>comment</b> Websites do not require much traffic to have influence or be notable. In fact, if one were to accept the film industry as a metaphor, many people saw "Wedding Crashers" a year ago, but that movie is non-notable in comparison to something like "The Battleship Potemkin" which has been watched by relatively few people. Now LoadingReadyRun is no Sergei Eisenstein directed enterprise, but insofar as it has (or could be argued to have) a cult following, has won numerous awards, and has repeatedly caught the interests of several larger sites, it is notable. <a href="http://www.loadingreadyrun.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1666&amp;start=75#24618" class="external autonumber" title="http://www.loadingreadyrun.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1666&amp;start=75#24618" rel="nofollow">[8]</a><a href="../../../b/a/s/User%7EBasscomm_86d7.html" title="User:Basscomm">Basscomm</a> 16:55, 21 June 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Delete</b> Don’t get me wrong, I said delete, but any of you who think that it doesn’t meet the notability standards probably are just not familiar with LoadingReadyRun. That’s understandable, as many of you probably would reject an article on <a href="../../../r/o/b/Robert_Van_Winkle_b686.html" title="Robert Van Winkle">Robert Van Winkle</a> for the same reason. No offense to LoadingReadyRun, but my point with the Robert Van Winkle analogy is that probably the only thing that makes them noteworthy (via Wikipedia’s standards) is a single video hosted all over the net, that appears to be by “64K” and not LoadingReadyRun, who are lucky if they even get a link on the page. Of course, a Google search for 1337, which should probably be the basis for this article’s notability, and not LoadingReadyRun itself, obviously yields confounded results that include way more than the video in question. I don’t know if I can do this, but I move for deletions based solely on the website’s nonnotability to be stricken from the record. The video was linked to by some big sites (e.g. BBSpot) and can be found on tons of video hosting sites (e.g. Google Video, YouTube, etc.) if people want to go down this road, I say they should be forced to at least change their reasoning to the fact that the popularity is so difficult to verify. Either way, I still can’t say that this article should stay. It’s apparent that Wikipedia’s focus is shifting. Whatever Wikibastards are running it now clearly want to increase its reliability at the expense of its usefulness. Perhaps you can tell by the non-neutral POV that I liked it better when Wikipedia was actually good for something, but since I alone can’t change Wikipedia’s direction, it is obvious that due to these new standards, the LoadingReadyRun article cannot stay. I’m not good with the Wikispeak, but I guess this mouthful comes down to that there are few facts or other things that the said Wikibastards consider verifiable. Again, I’m not sure how to say that in a Wikipedia way, but I figured I’d at least attempt to supply an actual reason to delete this article. Even if I don’t like the rules, I still think that the AFDs should play by them.

<li><b>comment</b> 64k is LoadingReadyRun. Having a page about just them and not the other work LoadingReadyRun has done is a bit of a waste. I agree with the idea that it should be in wikipedia but I can also see how it does not agree with the letter of wikipedia's "law".
