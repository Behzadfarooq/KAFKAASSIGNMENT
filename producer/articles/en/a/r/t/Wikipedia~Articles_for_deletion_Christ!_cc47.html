<dd>Well I subscribe to the punk and indie mp3 newgroups and their album is requested periodically. I won't say I have seen it a lot, but I have seen it requested maybe four times in the past year, which is more than quite a few other request numbers - their song War To The Rhythm of W.H.Auden is the only one I have ever seen requested as a single song, so there may be SOME truth to the claim of popularity, I don't know<a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">loveandearth</a></dd>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I had already tagged two albums from this group with "speedy delete" but then was unsure if I should do that with the band itself, or whether I should tag it for an AfD discussion. The albums were Will We Always Be Blind Idiots? and...hmm, I can't find the 2nd album. Neither album gave any indication of "importance or significane", which seemed to merit a Speedy Delete. The article for the band, however, comes closer to asserting such importance, so I hestitated about how to tag it. It's an assertion that I don't happen to believe is consistent with <a href="../../../b/a/n/WP%7EBAND_d9b5.html" title="WP:BAND">WP:BAND</a>.

<dd>Since the band article did claim notability it's best to take the safe route and list for AfD. The albums themselves claimed no notability, so they were game for speedy.

<dd>This person's comment can't be possible - the Chicago band Christ! has only ever had one album, a live album that came out some months ago (can't be sure - maybe January or February). They have been playing for years but I think seemed adverse to releasing material until someone recorded a live concert for them [User: Loveandearth This person's comment can't be possible - the Chicago band Christ! has only ever had one album, a live album that came out some months ago (can't be sure - maybe January or February).

<dd>Well I agree with the earlier opinion. From a musical standpoint, Christ! is probably not a groundbreaking band, though as it turns up for almost every political demonstration in Chicago and hands out cool flyers with socialist messages written like poems it has certainly been a felt presence in Chicago culture. I think Christ! is better known for its unusual way of distributing music by handing out its CDs to people for free on the streets. Who in Chicago hasn't seen them handing out CDs in Wicker Park or at music festivals or outside the Chicago Metro when fans are lining up to see a punk band especially? So this band should not be listed if musical merit is a consideration, but for its influence alone upon the Chicago music scene it should surely merit some listing, no? Not sure I know the Wikipedia procedures enough on that matter to make a further opinion <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">loveandearth</a></dd>

<dd>Well I don't think a cursory viewing of their myspace is a good way to judge their popularity as it appears to be a brand-new site. So far they seem to have two very well-known musicians as friends, though, Crass and Patrik Fitzgerald! So they certainly seem to be starting on a good footing! The prior statement that their own website doesn't mention the song does not appear true. When I last visited the site their entire album was available for free, which is their policy. They are an official non-profit organization in Illinois, I believe, or used to be, though I did not verify that recently (but I did half a year ago when I first heard their CD). <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">User:loveandearth</a></dd>

<li><b>Comment</b> I tried a cursory view of the Wikipedia article first, and learned there that one of their songs had been a notably popular download. I went in search of hard evidence, since the article offered none. All I found was myspace. When I last visited the band website, this morning, I had to click through page after page of cartoon nonsense and found no songs before becoming too irritated to proceed. <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> is still the problem here, there's so little evidence to go on.

<p>Well I'll stay out of this debate. But I was sure happy to see Christ! mentioned in this encyclopedia when I visited it this morning and was sad to see it was going to be deleted! This band is so mysterious and tries so hard to maintain secrecy, that seeing it listed was a nice surprise. They turn up at political demonstrations wearing colorful and weird clothes and passing out hopeful messages to the public, as they do with their music. I think they do deserve at least a mention, especially as the CD is such a good one. It is probably one of the best punk CDs I have ever heard, easily as good as Crass or the Buzzcocks or the Clash. So visionary and catchy. It certainly deserves at least a mention in my view. But I'll leave the vote to the rest of you, as I simply wanted to leave my opinion. I am not an official voter, not sure how this wikipedia thing works... good luck!! <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">User:loveandearth</a></p>
<p>Just found this article on Christ! that said it might be deleted. That would be a shame, in light of the contributions Christ! has made to punk music on the southside of Chicago (e.g., the birth of Discorporate Records, other free releases by bands such as Tras De Nada, and their inspiring politics). dannybyrd</p>

<p>I am following this debate, but it seems sad that Christ! can't have its own entry, given its musically brilliant CD. I am wondering if the name is turning people off, given voters' possible religious orientations. I think this entry is getting short shrift (e.g., one voter claming he can't find the music when it is patently there on their website, or one person describing their opening cartoon on their website as "drivel" - his bias clearly, nothing to do with the merits of whether or not Christ! should have an entry in the encyclopedia!). This band is admittedly a band that only locals in Chicago or those downloading their anti-Iraq War song (or listening to it at anti-war demos) know about, but given the significant artistic merits of their album Will We Always Be Blind Idiots? why does that matter? They obviously exist, they obviously produce excellent music, so why shouldn't those listening to the songs online and wondering about them not have the opportunity to find out a little more about them and their tradition and politics in the encyclopedia? I have seen far lesser bands on Wikipedia (though I won't argue they shouldn't be there - if the entires inform the public about their music, that seems to me one valid purpose of a modern online encyclopedia).

<li><b>Comment</b> I went in search of verifiable evidence to back up the article's unreferenced claims. I found nothing on the song mentioned. The website was, in my opinion, very very poor. I found no songs. The article therefore, for me, failed <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>, and <a href="../../../m/u/s/WP%7EMUSIC_c21a.html" title="WP:MUSIC">WP:MUSIC</a> too. The only thing that caused my Delete vote was lack of any verifiable evidence. I do not have all day to look for evidence of one band's claimed notability I'm afraid. I certainly don't get rattled by a band's name.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>And there is no reason Christ! could not rise again. But it would have to be with <a href="../../../v/_/_/WP%7EV_f6c7.html" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> content. Then no one will have to dredge the net for reasons to keep the article. It will all be there, right on the page. I even suggested a starting-point - build something on the scene as a whole, and spin off individual band articles as they grow and gain their own identity. That's generally how things work round here, from what I've observed. I hope you choose to work on it, and I wish you good luck. --<a href="../../../d/a/v/User%7EDaveG12345_8974.html" title="User:DaveG12345">DaveG12345</a> 18:24, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</li>

<p>Just a quick note on finding no songs. Yes there is a long cartoon but after that, songs. To bypass the cartoon, just go to</p>

<p>and then click Back to Christ! on the bottom left. I suppose the band is not deemed notable, as you stated. Besides the local papers, some punk websites and punk station DJs reviewing the album very favorably, I cannot think of anything else that would make the band notable in light of their refusal to be signed or sold. Anyway, interesting following this discussion. I like the band but am not a follower, exactly. If I ever see them in the neighborhood, I'll let them know what transpired these last few days on this site! <a href="../../../l/o/v/User%7ELoveandearth_a0f8.html" title="User:Loveandearth">loveandearth</a> <small>—The preceding <a href="../../../s/i/g/Wikipedia%7ESign_your_posts_on_talk_pages_ee53.html" title="Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages">unsigned</a> comment was added by 68.249.202.72 (talk • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_68.249.202.72_92af.html" title="Special:Contributions/68.249.202.72">contribs</a>) 21:46, 23 June 2006 (UTC)</small></p>
