<li><b>Keep</b>, and to be developed suitably by persons who may be aware of such things. As regards the size of the article - several articles were stubs - <a href="../../../a/_/p/A_P_J_Abdul_Kalam_1002.html" title="A P J Abdul Kalam">A P J Abdul Kalam</a>, the present president of India was hardly 40 words, <a href="../../../d/h/i/Dhirubhai_Ambani_1ae8.html" title="Dhirubhai Ambani">Dhirubhai Ambani</a> who laid foundation for the largest industrial house in India (when he died 2 years before it was worth 12 bn US$) was less than 60 words, and the last week's <a href="../../../c/o/t/WP%7ECOTW_227d.html" title="WP:COTW">WP:COTW</a>, <a href="../../../c/u/l/Culture_of_Ancient_Rome_ca67.html" title="Culture of Ancient Rome">Culture of Ancient Rome</a> was less than 100 words. As such, size of <a href="../../../d/a/b/Dabur.html" title="Dabur">Dabur</a> in words should not determine one's vote to keep or delete. <s>As regards "not notable" and "advert" - after a level, a corporate house rises above these levels and sets its own standard, and is not dependent on wikepedia for notability and advertisement: do anyone feels that an article on Bill Gates and Microsoft would be vanity / advertisement and so on. Dabur is a corporate house, which does not require an article on wikepedia to promote itself - it is in existence for about 100 years and the medicines it produces and sells have been in India for several thousand years. Before any vote for deletion, one should please understand wikepedia's guideleins in this respect and not vote for deletion without any familiarity with the topic. We all are here to make wikepedia "sum total of human knowledge" and not to reduce it.</s> I am sorry for the lecture. --<a href="../../../b/h/a/User%7EBhadani_ade5.html" title="User:Bhadani">Bhadani</a> 03:18, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Please look, sometimes, my strong reactions to some issues upset the puople around, they upset me equally - today, I was feeling bad for a greater part of the day. I promise to be more careful in my comments and reactions. Now, coming to the present issue, yes, Dabur may be a good topic for an article, but the present contents do require modifications: actually, I am not able to plan on this topic otherwise I would have attempted to do this myself, as earlier, I had done with a few articles under VfD like <a href="../../../a/w/a/Awasthi.html" title="Awasthi">Awasthi</a>, RURAL MARKETS and <a href="../../../f/a/m/Family_traditions.html" title="Family traditions">Family traditions</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b>. Even if the article were expanded, the subject would still be non-notable. I'm sure you could write a very long article on Greenhaven Drive, but it wouldn't be notable either.

<li>Probably it *is* broad and shallow at this time of night, but the problem is it will sit as a stub for the rest of eternity.

If an article up for Vfd has potential for expansion and/or is expanded during the course of the Vfd, people vote to keep it. If it can never ever <i>ever</i> be improved in the eyes of the Vfders, it should go. Leaving it to stagnate just to cushion newcomers isn't going to help anyone. And, as an aside, a large percentage of Vfd articles are put up the second they are created, and in this case they are almost always by anon IPs and new users. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 05:35, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>The criteria on that page is "This list includes notable individuals for which there is a consensus of evidence of slave ownership." The first part of which "This list includes notable individuals" merely restates what the title of article already says, and the second of which "for which there is a consensus of evidence of slave ownership" results as a natural consequence of the Wikipedia process (in there's no conscenss it's probally going to be edited out.) If the standard "List of Holocaust victims with articles in Wikipedia" was put at the top of the page it would likely be ignored or even more likely edited out by those who did not like the standard. That is, the question of what the standard is will be left to future editors if it is not in the title. Which is no different than changing the name to "List of Holocaust victims" and not adding a standard to the top of the page.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 12:27, 20 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Delete</b>- no way to ensure that it is accurate (exact number of Holocaust victims is not known, and varies wildly between sources).

<li><b>Delete</b>: First, on of the things that Wikipedia Is Not is a memorial site. We have Wikimemorial for lists of this nature (all the 9/11 victims, e.g.), and we must reject, out of hand and a priori, any eulogy/elegy. Secondly, because the list is impossible to verify, the list fails on that score. Third, because the list cannot be completed, any inclusion is inherently POV (e.g. the list may bias toward ethnic victims as opposed to political ones, or sexual ones opposed to nationalist ones). The main reason, however, is simply that we are not a memorial. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 15:10, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>No, but it is POV if you deem some Holocaust victims notable and therefore Wikipediable and others unnotable and therefore not Wikipediable. There should be no distinguishing between notable Holocaust victims and unnotable Holocaust victims. If you make a list of Holocaust victims, you should include <i>all</i> Holocaust victims. And if some Holocaust victims are indeed notable, they should be on Wikipedia because they're notable, not because they're notable Holocaust victims. <a href="../../../a/e/c/User%7EAecis_7d64.html" title="User:Aecis">Aecis</a> 08:06, 18 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>That's exactly why I made the point that the word 'notable' should be avoided in the namespace; because it might seem offensive. However, there <i>are</i> already criteria in Wikipedia on who are notable and who are not, and there are innumerable lists based on these criteria. There is no reason why information on well-known people who were killed by the Nazis during the war should be suppressed. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 03:36, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I strongly oppose having an aticle called "List of <b>notable</b> Holocaust victims". As someone else said they are all notable. I also think it would lead to very sensitive disputes over who was notable and who was not. So I propose that if the list is kept but the name is changed that it should be change to "List of Holocaust victims with articles in Wikipedia", and that it should provide links to all of those articles.--<a href="../../../h/e/a/User%7EHeathcliff_1655.html" title="User:Heathcliff">Heathcliff</a> 23:09, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>: With all due respect, I think this discussion is getting silly. There's a page called <a href="../../../l/i/s/List_of_Norwegians_69e3.html" title="List of Norwegians">List of Norwegians</a>. This is not a list of all 4,5 million of them. This was never <i>meant</i> to be a list of all 4,5 million of them! It's implicit in the title that the list only covers notable individuals. As I said, the word 'notable' ought to be avoided, but apart from that the list is completely viable. <a href="../../../e/i/x/User%7EEixo_d259.html" title="User:Eixo">Eixo</a> 02:45, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>With its current title, it's by definition a list that is impractical to the extreme. Change to List of notable Holocaust victims -- and no, I don't buy for one second the claim that attaching a notability limitation would give rise to unresolvable disputes, because the criterion should be simple - whether the person has an article on Wikipedia. What WOULD give rise to disputes would be restricting entry to those who have articles on Wikipedia BUT leaving the title alone, since that would likely confuse new editors trying to add names and leave others with the unpleasant chore of deleting the names of some user's grandmother or great-uncle who fail to met the non-explicit criterion. --<a href="../../../c/a/l/User%7ECalton_59b6.html" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="../../../c/a/l/User_talk%7ECalton_3e8c.html" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 04:24, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>: In a few decades (would have been sooner if Nixon hadn't cut funding), we might conceivably need to split an article with a title such as RickK suggested (with most of the current content) from (Actual) <a href="../../../c/o/l/Colonization_of_the_outer_solar_system.html" title="Colonization of the outer solar system">Colonization of the outer solar system</a>.

<p>The Horse Paradox page does not explain a real paradox, but rather lays out a smattering of word plays and jokes. However, if that assessment is wrong and it does have value in its discussion of logic, it might stay with a little cleanup help. Thus, I put it to a vote.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part was described to me in a discrete math course as the <i>car</i> paradox; it's a useful illustration of a logic "hole" in induction. The rest are just jokes and are not encyclopedic. <s><b>Merge</b> the first section into <a href="../../../m/a/t/Mathematical_induction.html" title="Mathematical induction">Mathematical induction</a> or a related math page on common logic errors or suchlike.</s> <b>Keep</b> and cleanup per Gazpacho and ESkog; that sounds like a better plan. <a href="../../../a/n/d/User%7EAndroid79_3860.html" title="User:Android79">android</a>↔<a href="../../../a/n/d/User_talk%7EAndroid79_0576.html" title="User talk:Android79">talk</a> 03:52, May 17, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> the first section, drop the rest. It's widely taught.

<p>I have no real opinion on whether or not this page is deleted, even though I am one of the said members of this band. However, I want to say something to Kelly Martin, who started the deletion of this page. I read your definition of "Band", but I think you have band confused with "Notable Music Group". The difference is, a band is a group of performers that play music, no matter how many people know about them. I think that you shouldn't be allowed to vote for the deletion of band pages, because, obviously, if they aren't big (which we won't get, and are not hoping to) they don't matter, and, in response to you other comment on your profile, I think that you are the one being a dick.</p>

<li><b>Keep</b> but if there isn't much more to add, move content to Wiktionary, leaving only {{wi}} on the Wikipedia page. AFAIK that is the closest available approximation to a cross-wiki redirect.

<li>You're wrong inasmuch as Wiktionary already has <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nadir" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nadir">nadir</a>, which has no need of this content, which answers the question posed on <a href="../../../n/a/d/Talk%7ENadir_e492.html" title="Talk:Nadir">Talk:Nadir</a>, which covers the word in three languages, and which also includes its use as a proper noun. ☺ <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 18:37, 2005 May 17 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>When I said "move content to Wiktionary", I meant to add it to the Wiktionary article, not to replace what was already there. When I wrote my comment, the Wiktionary article looked like <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Nadir&amp;oldid=209103" class="external text" title="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Nadir&amp;oldid=209103" rel="nofollow">this</a> and certainly could have used such an addition, which I notice you have performed since my comment. Anyway, when I said I would love to hear I was wrong, I meant I would love to hear that there was a smooth way to turn Wikipedia entries into redirects to Wiktionary entries. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCristofani_92da.html" title="User:DanielCristofani">DanielCristofani</a> 22:44, 17 May 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>And that version of the page answered the question posed on <a href="../../../n/a/d/Talk%7ENadir_e492.html" title="Talk:Nadir">Talk:Nadir</a> and covered the word in three languages, as I said. I <i>didn't</i> "move content to Wiktionary". This article (until I rewrote it) <i>didn't cover people named with the proper noun "Nadir"</i> (a point that I obviously made too subtly) and didn't include any etymological information, so my additions of etymologies and proper noun senses to Wiktionary (with my hat on as a Wiktionarian whose attention was drawn to the article by this discussion) could not possibly have been moved content. As my edit history comment tells you, I added content <i>from Webster 1913</i>, not from Wikipedia. It has been my experiences that:
<ul>
<li>moving individual meanings from Wikipedia to Wiktionary is largely pointless — Wiktionary usually improves when Wiktionarians notice that an article needs cleanup or expansion. This very case is an example. I, with my Wiktionarian hat on, was prodded, by this debate, into looking at <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nadir" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:nadir">nadir</a>, and noticed that it needed expansion, so I added some Webster 1913 content into it.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is generally <i>bad</i> at writing dictionary content — I've seen Wiktionary come up with better dictionary articles on words in a handful of days than Wikipedia was able to grow organically in <i>years</i>. Quite a lot of those turned up when we were cleaning out the 1200-or-so article backlog in the transwiki queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This was yet another case of Wikipedians saying "move to Wiktionary" meaning moving an individual meaning of a word into an existing Wiktionary article. (It has been said before.) And as I said, Wiktionary is simply not in need of such content. <a href="../../../u/n/c/User%7EUncle_G_0090.html" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> 14:04, 2005 May 19 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I am not concerned to deny most of this. When I said "such an addition", I did not mean necessarily an addition of content transferred from Wikipedia, but an addition that would convey the same information the Wikipedia article conveyed. My point has been that:
<ul>
<li>If a Wikipedia article can never be more than a dictionary definition, in some cases the best move is to turn it into a cross-reference to Wiktionary, rather than a redirect to some vaguely related Wikipedia article; and</li>
<li>before doing this, it would be wise to make sure the relevant Wiktionary article has all the information the Wikipedia article did.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Maybe I was not clear enough about this. In any case I seem to have elicited responses appropriate to something I was not trying to say. <a href="../../../d/a/n/User%7EDanielCristofani_92da.html" title="User:DanielCristofani">DanielCristofani</a> 22:48, 19 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>I, the author, with a PHD in History have asked in my last comment for you to delete the article and yet you still rail on and on and on and on. Have any of you ever been to these places? Read first hand accounts on the pages they first were written? As i've said before, i saw a void in your little web page and tried to fill it. As i see now, this is not a place for knowledge, but for the same old Roman record keeping garbage that has stifled our knowledge of history for centuries. I suppose i could wait until the book is released and then cite it as "proof". Would that make you morons feel better? While i was in the second world war, there was no proof of genocide taking place. For years afterward, there was no proof that FDR suppressed this proof. Now there is no proof that the Jews have any historical claim to Israel. Have fun on your flat-empirical world, young fellows. I will soon be in Switzerland beginning my next book (of lies i suppose) on the Gallic War. Keep in mind that they pay me to research and write this stuff. How much do you earn to blindly dispute it? <i>unsigned comment by 68.59.230.134</i>

<li>hi. I'm a long time user and a first time poster. Maybe i'm a little "green", but didn't the author request that his post be deleted? Do you guys just like to run things into the ground? I'm not trying to be snotty or rude but haven't you got better things to do than wave your intellectual cocks in the air? I was writing a paper on Britain during the dark ages and wound up side tracked by this stupid argument. True: a few things in the article aren't credible, but this is far from the first page i've seen here that ignore facts or create new theories. Also i have read many books on the subject of King Arthur that support the idea that Magnus was the father of Constantine III. I cannot cite the sources-don't have time-and don't really care. Whenever i look something up on Wikidpedia, i always double check it. Maybe you guys should do your own homework or take the advice of the old guy who wrote this entry and delete it without further discussion. Surely you all have something better to do. Or maybe not. <i>unsigned comment by 68.59.230.134</i>

<li>If this is fiction, it needs deleting. On the other hand, if it is verifiable original research (ie a proper radical redaction of established sources) then surely it deserves a place, albeit marked in some way as theory-not-absolute-fact. Otherwise, havign read the article, I am moved to take issue with <a href="../../../k/u/r/User%7EKuralyov_a64e.html" title="User:Kuralyov">Kuralyov</a>'s comment about "Not a shred of accuracy" since quite an amount of this is generally-accepted fact in England, and much of the rest accords with one among a number of radical re-readings of Dark Age history which relocate Arthur to Scotland and make the people in the northern part of ther island substantially more civilized than Caesar and his kith were willing to give credit for. Sorry for rant. --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 06:56, 18 May 2005 (UTC)--
<ul>
<li>Any attempts to relocate Arthur to the north of England/Scotland is merely an attempt at aggrandizement for the people of those areas. There is simply too much evidence putting him in the south, and not enough for him to be in the north. An Arthur-like person, or one of the bases for Arthur, maybe, but not <i>the</i> Arthur, if he existed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And as for the Picts being more civilized than was thought: they did not have centralized government, standardized religion or language, or codified law; they did not scult, paint murals, write down their legends; they did not try to build lasting cities on purpose. I think the Romans had them beat.</p>

<li>I am systemically nominating non-notable articles for deletion. And I will continue doing so until I reach the end of the alphabet. Furthermore, it's not an "ultimatum" to demand that an article in an encylopedia meet an encylopediac standard. <a href="../../../n/e/u/User%7ENeutrality_7a9d.html" title="User:Neutrality">Neutrality</a><sup><a href="../../../n/e/u/User_talk%7ENeutrality_6997.html" title="User talk:Neutrality">talk</a></sup> 05:00, May 17, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Firstly, you know and I know that there is no consensus of non-notability as a deletion criterion. Secondly your campaign is verging on disruption. Thirdly you demand that something be done <i>within five days</i>. You may deny that this is an ultimatum, but a demand with a deadline is an ultimatum. Finally, these are all perfectly good stubs you're listing.

<li>Ultimatum? Hardly, to me it appeared that he was qualifying his delete vote/nomination... A pretty reasonable thing to do. You might think that they are good stubs, but you do not speak for the rest of the community. Quite a few disagree. .. But I understand why you are complaining, consider how often you close VFDs on these issues...<a href="../../../g/m/a/User%7EGmaxwell_5150.html" title="User:Gmaxwell">Gmaxwell</a> 06:11, 17 May 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li>Well obviously I won't be closing any schools listings--I'm voting on them instead. I do think his listing is unreasonable in the context of the forty of fifty-odd others he's done in the past three days. Adding a demand that the article should "establish notability" within five days, when there are fifty other articles around, is extremely unreasonable. I question Neutrality's reasoning here--it isn't feasible that all the stubs on Wikipedia should be turned into full articles within five days or so. Moreover there is *no* consensus on non-notability as a deletion criterion. Schools that are used by thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of students over their lifetimes, and employ scores and sometimes hundreds of teachers over that time, and play a significant part in local, region and often national life, are inherently notable. --<a href="../../../t/o/n/User%7ETony_Sidaway_8b51.html" title="User:Tony Sidaway">Tony Sidaway</a>|<a href="../../../t/o/n/User_talk%7ETony_Sidaway_de51.html" title="User talk:Tony Sidaway">Talk</a> 14:36, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>If there were an effective Wikischools project, I would be inclined to merge schools on Wikipedia into articles reflecting their type/geography (e.g. <i>high schools in California</i>) - but I fear that such a project would be an excuse to shunt them away, not an engine to grow knowledge on them. --<a href="../../../b/d/2/User%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_f725.html" title="User:BD2412/deletion debates"><font style="background: green" color="#FFC000">&#160;BD2412</font></a> <a href="../../../b/d/2/User_talk%7EBD2412_deletion_debates_49b2.html" title="User talk:BD2412/deletion debates"><sup><font color="DarkGreen"><b>thi</b></font><b><font color="red"><b>m</b></font><font color="DarkGreen"><b>k</b></font></b></sup></a><small><a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_BD2412_deletion_debates_bb2e.html" title="Special:Contributions/BD2412/deletion debates"><font color="#3399FF">act</font></a> 14:08, 2005 May 17 (UTC)</small>

<li>The flip side is that, if you just happened upon Wikipedia for the first time, would you be more impressed if you found a dozen pages of the type "[school] is a [type] school in [city], [country]. It goes from grades [x] to [y] and has [z] students", or if you saw a 12-paragraph-long article about all of the high schools in a city? My guess would be the latter. Personally, I think that consolidating articles would encourage expansion more than a bunch of individual substubs, and if the article gets too big the individual schools can always be spun out. While I'm dreaming, it would be nice if people took a top-down approach to creating school articles, by first creating articles on the city and/or schools in the district, and once those are comprehensive, moving on to individual schools. Anyway, <b>merge and redirect</b> to <a href="../../../r/e/h/Rehovot.html" title="Rehovot">Rehovot</a>. <a href="../../../j/y/o/User%7EJYolkowski_a02b.html" title="User:JYolkowski">JYolkowski</a> // <a href="../../../j/y/o/User_talk%7EJYolkowski_46ed.html" title="User talk:JYolkowski">talk</a> 22:33, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>Indeed, that's the sort of crap I saw here when I first visited WP back in... 2002? 2003? Somewhere round there. It was mostly crappy and I was unimpressed. As it is we now have thousands of pages' worth of stunning information, but we've still got some crappy hangons. Yes a Wikischools project would seem to be getting rid of them, but then this whole "schools are auto-notable!!!" problem would be gone--it would be THEIR problem to fix and Vfd the schools. Every single one of these school-deletion pages is being made to sound like it's a heartfelt "ethical" debate about things that are essential to the forwarding of mankind's collective consciousness, and that's just bull. Complete and utter bull. Either you vote or you don't, you don't try to make others' votes sound invalid based on their own perverted POV, which is the whole thing the Vfd rests upon for its conclusions. <a href="../../../m/a/s/User%7EMaster_Thief_Garrett_7af4.html" title="User:Master Thief Garrett">Master Thief Garrett</a> 03:35, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>Delete: Substub with no content. A fact is not an article. Wikipedia is not the Yellow Pages. This particular piece of mud has been on the site for about a year now. It inspired a vaccuous yelling match last time, and the usual suspects showed up, without reading it, voting automatcally, "Keep: All School Articles Must Be Kept No Matter What." It got kept. Well, it hasn't been improved in all that time. So what, exactly, is the eventualist and schoolfanboi position again? Schools should be kept because they're inherently significant (but the articles that show no significance must not be judged) and eventually someone will make it full? N.b. none of the "keep all schools" people seem to actually want to improve any of the articles, and the eventualists defer the obligation eternally onto the imagined Other.

<li><b>Keep</b> I created this page after looking at the <a href="../../../p/a/l/Palo_Alto_10e4.html" title="Palo Alto">Palo Alto</a> page and seeing a link but no page for this school. This was my elementary school and I feel the page can provide information for others. It was one of my first pages and as previously mentioned this is a great example of an entry point for myself. I am doing my best to continue to add information and others have already started to help. I would appreciate it if this article was not deleted so I can continue to expand it and work my way through the wiki process. A look should be taken at the three other elementary schools in Palo Alto with pages. Two are also up for deletion and have similiar disscussions taking place. They serve as good examples of ways to improve this article as well which I will try to add.

<li>The criteria is rather how wide-spread the use of such a term is.

</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The issue is usage. If a word is used only in a small area (Rochester, MN), it is a regionalism when it has been in use for a while. If a word is used only in a class/profession, it is jargon or slang, but it has to live for a while, and it has to have quite a few speakers. The reason it has to live for a while is that lexicons are always behind the usage (even Wiktionary). Linguistic atlases try to explain and catalog what's happening now, but all lexicons are attempting to explain to <i>someone else</i> what a word means; they are all translations. There can be no <i>someone else</i> if the word is used for a season or a month. However, all of this is kind of irrelevant, because Wikipedia is not Wiktionary. <a href="../../../g/e/o/User%7EGeogre_0ace.html" title="User:Geogre">Geogre</a> 11:19, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Keep</b>. I created the article. While I am an ex Karuna student (91-95), it can in no way be considered an ad as I have completely lost connection with them, and they are, anyway, a charitable institute, which is one of the reasons I had no hesitation in starting the article. The Institute is clearly notable, it is a nationally recognised training institute for psychotherapy (one of only 2 for transpersonal psychology) and craniosacral therapy as well. Both Maura Sills and Franklyn Sills clearly each deserve an article (perhaps now is the time to start). While I have felt it is a shame that no-one else (ex students etc) has added to this article it clearly has a vast potential as an article. The buddhist psychotherapy work they are doing is certainly unique in the UK and possibly the world. Why would anyone think this article is not encyclopedic.

<p>This is an article by an anonymous user. It is a concoction of part "original research" part selective biographies, and part deceptive "self-adulation" (then again, maybe "self-hate"), about some personalities that will surely be offensive to people of all stripes. Religious Jews will wonder how their VIPs get lumped with secular ones and secular people will wonder why their VIPs are the same as ancient rabbis. Then everyone else is bound to wonder what's next? Christian Renegades? Islamic Renegades? etc, etc, Since when is "renegades" an acceptable title for an encyclopedia article?

<li><b>D</b>elete. Unbelievably POV. The term "renegade" is loaded in itself, unless the person has declared "I am a Jewish renegade and proud of it". This cannot be said about Maimonides; like with any visionary there were initial difficulties with the acceptance of his views, but today you will not find a serious Jew who is anti-Maimonides; quite the opposite - every group has tried to colonise Maimonides to gain legitimacy (yes that is POV as well). The article is also selective - there are plenty of Jews who have had profound influence on Jewish religion, people and history.

<li><b>Comment.</b>I restate my last: "If she's a one-hit wonder, would she rate a page in a regular encyclopedia"? We kill pages off here all the time for minor artist and people who reached number one in Sheboygan. While I will admit that she hit it big in Europe (no small feat that), the fact is, she's a minor artist at the moment and not worth, IMHO, an encyclopedia entry. I wouldn't expect Sonoko Kawaii (a Japanese one-hit wonder from the 80s) to have a page here, either, would I for American, Canadian, Australian, or wherever. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitsukai_f72e.html" title="User:Mitsukai">Mitsukai</a> 17:07, 17 May 2005 (UTC)

<li>I would vote keep on an article for Sonoko Kawaii too.

<dd>Dude, you're dead wrong about the page not being helpful. Being a participant in a now-resolved lengthy edit war over getting a definition of capitalism in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article, I know that the creation and editing of the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_capitalism.html" title="Definitions of capitalism">definitions of capitalism</a> article was essential and instrumental. If it's deleted, I predict more unnecessary edit-warring from people who have no clue how capitalism is commonly defined and who are unwilling to go research tons of dictionaries, encyclopedia, and works of thinkers to find out. The article serves to consolidate all of that research in one place to avoid unnecessary battling in the <a href="../../../c/a/p/Capitalism.html" title="Capitalism">capitalism</a> article.

<li>Your argument is a false characterization. This article is <i>exactly copying entries</i> from <i>twenty-six</i> dictionaries (and three encyclopaedias), rather than "quoting one paragraph from a dictionary". If you think that copying copyrighted dictionaries and encyclopaedias into WikiMedia project articles is acceptable, then you should discuss this with the WikiMedia Foundation, and on the talk pages of the various copyright policies for all of the WikiMedia projects, which all say otherwise. (You'll have a have a hard time of it. The <a href="../../../t/e/x/Wikipedia%7EText_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License_702a.html" title="Wikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License">GFDL</a> is a <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/foundation_issues" class="extiw" title="m:foundation_issues">foundation issue</a>, and non-negotiable.) Why did you think that Wiktionarians and Wikipedians are specifically pointed in the directions of <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Webster" class="extiw" title="wiktionary:Wiktionary:Webster">Webster 1913</a> and <a href="../../../1/9/1/Wikipedia%7E1911_Encyclopaedia_Britannica_18ad.html" title="Wikipedia:1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica">Britannica 1911</a>? There's plenty of explanation, of why Wiktionary and Wikipedia must not copy (non-GFDL licenced) copyrighted dictionaries and encyclopaedias, linked to from our copyright policy, a link to which is on this and every page, and no need for us to spoon-feed it to you in this discussion.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> -- yes, wiktionary is indeed for definitions, but also for pronunciations, etc, as long as it is an aid <b>for use in language</b>. Wiktionary is also for the simple definitions of words. However, these articles address the definitions is the context of the idea or philosophy, which can never be dictionary-like, for it is no longer a <b>guide for language use</b> but rather another <b>body of knowledge</b>. I suggest though, one, to restore the articles but edit it according to the definitions of notable people, rather than dictionaries, and two, to discuss the history of how those definitions began, developed, and evolved. Making the articles like that will resolve all standing issues. --<a href="../../../h/u/m/User%7EHumble_Guy_3b88.html" title="User:Humble Guy">Humble Guy</a> 15:37, May 22, 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> -- integrate content into capitalism and socialism articles, respectively. If a consensus cannot be reached on how to define socialism and capitalism, simple give <i>multiple</i> definitions in the introductions to their two articles and explain which group uses which definition (although I really can't see why it's so hard to reach a consensus, especially on capitalism - in general, both supporters and opponents of capitalism define it in the same way). -- Mihnea Tudoreanu 21:24, 22 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not true. I just, a minute ago, had to revert a change in the definition. Somebody tried to assert that it's commonly defined as an economy where "capitalists" dictate prices, etc, rather than the market. This is probably because the <a href="../../../d/e/f/Definitions_of_capitalism.html" title="Definitions of capitalism">definitions of capitalism</a> article is unavailable right now. The definitions article helps prevent useless battles over how capitalism is commonly defined.

<li>I'd like to propose that since wikipedia is defined by reality, wikipedia can also define reality, thus giving an artist a chance to shape their own destiny. perhaps my argument is standard fare here, but i feel that no harm is done by wikipedia growing beyond where people feel it should naturally go. why would you cut all the flowers off a beautiful tree?

<li><b>Comment</b>. I'll put it this way: I live in a 4 million inhabitants city. Do you realize how many 50.000 resident complexes can be found here? Quite some. Do they need Wikipedia articles? Nope, I don't think so. I'd put an exception if the complex /district / whatever had some historical, political or educational relevance. I don't see that here. It is just 9.000 people living in a zone.

<li>Since the edit history shows that Cmapm created the article and then immediately tagged it for deletion, I'm guessing that this is a leftover after a page move. If that is the case, there are several reasons to leave it as a redirect. 1) It points the other contributors to the new location. 2) It catches any missed inbound links. (Even if you clean out "What links here", a revert can restore an old link.) 3) <i>Redirects are cheap</i>. We don't go out of our way to create new redirects for every conceivable misspelling but once one exists, we generally <b>keep</b> the redirect. (By the way, this really should have been nominated at <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Redirects for deletion</a>.) <a href="../../../r/o/s/User%7ERossami_1228.html" title="User:Rossami">Rossami</a> <a href="../../../r/o/s/User_talk%7ERossami_1b05.html" title="User talk:Rossami">(talk)</a> 01:23, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>You are absolutely right, it was my mistake and I moved it to one with correct name. Your second point is very interesting. I didn't create any links to it myself, but there IS non-zero probability that such link may be found in the history of at least one page in Wikipedia. It seems to me that it is very close to zero, though. Therefore, I don't change my vote <b>delete</b> for it, although I promise to place such things under <a href="../../../r/e/d/Wikipedia%7ERedirects_for_deletion_955c.html" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for deletion">Redirects for deletion</a> next time&#160;:-) <a href="../../../c/m/a/User%7ECmapm_ac09.html" title="User:Cmapm">Cmapm</a> 16:04, 18 May 2005 (UTC)</dd>
