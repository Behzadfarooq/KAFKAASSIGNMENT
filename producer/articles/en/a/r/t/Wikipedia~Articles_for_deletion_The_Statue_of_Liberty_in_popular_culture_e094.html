<p><b>Delete</b> as an indiscriminate list and directory seeking to capture every appearance of the SoL in any medium regardless of the importance or lack of same of the appearance either within the medium or in the real world. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 03:44, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</p>

<li>Excuse me, but you have absolutely no reason whatsoever to accuse me of making a bad faith nomination, "borderline" or otherwise. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 04:43, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think what <a href="../../../n/o/t/User%7ENotorious4life_30dc.html" title="User:Notorious4life">Notorious4life</a> probably meant was that you've basically listed almost every article from a category in a seemingly hasty attempt to get the category itself deleted, and targeting such a prestigious article as this during your mass purge seemed petty. Personally, I think you were just impatient and weren't actually reading all the articles you nominated for AfD, and likely listed this by mistake. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 05:03, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> While I dislike these pop culture articles and sections, and think this one is particularly terrible, this page serves a useful purpose. It helps keep the "pop culture" section in the main <a href="../../../s/t/a/Statue_of_Liberty_c55e.html" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a> article pared down to just what's most relevant, with all the excess junk trivia in the subarticle. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 06:36, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>This <a href="../../../u/s/e/WP%7EUSEFUL_298b.html" title="WP:USEFUL">WP:USEFUL</a> argument is brought up with all pop culture article deletions, ignoring the merits of the article itself. You shouldn't be in favour of keeping an article full of "excess junk trivia". <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 06:41, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>But I am in favour of keeping it. Subarticles, per <a href="../../../s/u/m/WP%7ESUMMARY_66b7.html" title="WP:SUMMARY">WP:SUMMARY</a>, are helpful for keeping excess trivia and detail out of the main article. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 06:59, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But also note <a href="../../../a/v/t/WP%7EAVTRIV_0d64.html" title="WP:AVTRIV">WP:AVTRIV</a>. If a trivia section is too massive for a main article it serves Wikipedia no better as a separate article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:23, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As one that is helping maintain the main article (one article out of my massive watchlist), I'd rather keep the subarticle rather than go back to having people keep adding trivia to the main article. See <a href="../../../22/i/n/Wikipedia%7E_In_popular_culture__articles_a4c6.html" title="Wikipedia:&quot;In popular culture&quot; articles">Wikipedia:"In popular culture" articles</a> (We need to stay at #3 and avoid #5). Not ideal, but doing it this way makes maintaining the article more manageable. --<a href="../../../a/u/d/User%7EAudeVivere_5149.html" title="User:AudeVivere">Aude</a> <small>(<a href="../../../a/u/d/User_talk%7EAudeVivere_8a42.html" title="User talk:AudeVivere">talk</a>)</small> 07:37, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>It is not my intention, in nominating these sorts of garbage dump articles, to make life more dificult for people who monitor articles which attract this kind of pop culture crap. However, unless the culture of Wikipedia changes so that both indiscriminate "in pop culture" sections in articles and "in pop culture" articles are both consdered unacceptable, this sort of crap will be perpetuated. If you don;t want this crap in its own article or in the main article, then take a stand in this and similar AFDs to send the message that it is not wanted anywhere on WP. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:52, 23 February 2007 (UTC)

<dd>I think that <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> is misunderstanding policies quite a bit. Articles need to be of a managable size and reasonably focused. Separating out aspects dealing with pop culture and fiction from the main article keeps everything nicer. Each article should be considered on it's own merits, and according to Wikipedia policy, not <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s personal dislikes and beliefs. Furthermore, I strongly object to <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a>'s frequent use of strong words like "crap" to characterize what <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> wants to delete. <a href="../../../m/e/r/User%7EMermaid_from_the_Baltic_Sea_fcaf.html" title="User:Mermaid from the Baltic Sea">Mermaid from the Baltic Sea</a> 05:09, 28 February 2007 (UTC)</dd>

<li>See, the problem with that is, if this information is garbage in the main SoL article, it's garbage on its own in a standalone article. <a href="../../../o/t/t/User%7EOtto4711_6b70.html" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> 07:21, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> This is a widely used icon in fiction, so there is nothing indiscriminate about listing those works where it plays a part. The article is well referenced. And I am not imporessed to agree with you by your arguing with each person who disagrees with you. You just keep repeating the same arguments. <a href="../../../i/n/k/User%7EInkpaduta_0868.html" title="User:Inkpaduta">Inkpaduta</a> 14:34, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>Don't you think that scope makes it indiscriminate? Look at the example for <i><a href="../../../n/a/t/National_Treasure_%28film%29_a425.html" title="National Treasure (film)">National Treasure</a></i>: "Brief view in an intro shot of New York City." This implies that the Statue plays as insignificant a part as it can in the movie, merely because it happens to be in the city it is set. The article is not well-referenced. Look how many {{<a href="../../../f/a/c/Template%7EFact_5696.html" title="Template:Fact">fact</a>}}'s there are. <a href="../../../p/o/m/User%7EPomte_3bc0.html" title="User:Pomte">Pomte</a> 19:17, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

</dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> with improvements. I'm certain more could be said about the topic itself - the use of the Statue in pop culture - and less emphasis on an exhaustive list of appearances. In particular the summary descriptions of each appearance creates a bloated article and those should be heavily pared down. But again, more work on making this an article <i>about</i> the Statue in pop culture and less a list of appearances, and this will be a much more encyclopedic article. <a href="../../../a/r/k/User%7EArkyan_713c.html" title="User:Arkyan">Arkyan</a> 18:42, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b> — useful and not intrinsically indiscriminate.
