<p>The way the game is set up, you kind of have to create an account to find out yourself what it is about. It is frustrating that there is a lack of independent sources with information on the game; this is one reason I've been working on this article. Some of the information in the article is the kind of thing I would have liked to have known before signing up, to help me decide whether it was worth my while. Maybe you should try playing the game, and see for yourself if it is notable. Meanwhile, here's some <a href="http://donberg.blogspot.com/2005/08/why-gokrida.html" class="external text" title="http://donberg.blogspot.com/2005/08/why-gokrida.html" rel="nofollow">food for thought</a>. Maybe you could even discuss the game with Mr. Berg; perhaps he knows of some independent sources. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 23:46, 28 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<p>As for the notability issue, I would think that the fact that the National Heritage Foundation is backing GoKrida would make it notable. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 00:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I'd like to point out that the National Heritage Foundation has about 9,000 foundations under its umbrella and blogs aren't generally accepted as sources (<a href="../../../r/s/_/WP%7ERS_be60.html" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>). It's something but not nearly enough to include it in wikipedia in my opinion. --<a href="../../../p/e/e/User%7EPeephole_c53f.html" title="User:Peephole">Peephole</a> 16:44, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> I wasn't suggesting you consider the blog a source. Just that you rather thoroughly read the GNHF site and the links in the blog for some insight, as it's probably the most useful information you're likely to get outside of participating in GoKrida. And I think it's intriguing that what is essentially a browser-based fantasy sim was considered worthy of funding by the NHF; that must have been some interesting sales pitch. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 19:07, 29 July 2006 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment:</b> There is a link there now to the National Heritage Foundation's donation page for GoKrida. I'm not sure if that counts as a reliable outside source as to notability, however I do question the basic idea of Wikipedia being only for things that are notable enough to have garnered mainstream attention. What differentiates Wikipedia from Brittanica is precisely that it is an encyclopedia of many things that are not "notable" to the mainstream press, but nonetheless may hold some interest for a niche audience. As an early example of a web browser game being recognized as an official educational or national heritage resource, that may confer upon it some degree of notability. 68.146.221.26 21:40, 30 July 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li>How should I know? That's why it needs sources. If it has developed a player culture, that suggests some significant number, though. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 18:48, 4 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment:</b>So you're just guessing it has a significant number of players?
<ul>
<li>Not exactly. I'm relying on indirect evidnece. If I said cars were commonplace in Elbonian society, that would be a strong indication that they are an industrialized society. It's quite impossible to tell how industrialized based on that. Basically, the information in the article couldn't be true without a few thousand players. I can't be more specific. <a href="../../../a/c/e/User%7EAce_of_Sevens_df30.html" title="User:Ace of Sevens">Ace of Sevens</a> 16:49, 5 August 2006 (UTC)</li>

<li><b><s>Weak</s> Delete</b>: Its relationship with the NHF gives it a shade of notability. However, searching google results <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=GoKrida&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" class="external text" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=GoKrida&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;pwst=1&amp;start=200&amp;sa=N" rel="nofollow">232 unique hits</a> half of those seem to be blogs and the other half seems to be ads related to GoKrida. --<a href="../../../m/i/t/User%7EMitaphane_7727.html" title="User:Mitaphane">Mitaphane</a> <sub><a href="../../../m/i/t/User_talk%7EMitaphane_f38a.html" title="User talk:Mitaphane">talk</a></sub> 07:08, 6 August 2006 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Maybe I should had done a little more research before relying on NHF for a notable source. In the previous AfD discuss user <a href="../../../j/o/n/User%7EJonel_e850.html" title="User:Jonel">Jonel</a> brought a good point about GoKrida's ties to the NHF. I looked it up on their website and this is all you can <a href="http://nhfdonations.newc.com/default.cfm?Action=DonationsDetail&amp;foundationID=9668" class="external text" title="http://nhfdonations.newc.com/default.cfm?Action=DonationsDetail&amp;foundationID=9668" rel="nofollow">find</a>. I decided to see what the NHF was about. I found this:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our main objectives is to popularize the use of Foundations. We want to make foundations accessible to everyone, regardless of income level. A Foundation at NHF is inexpensive to start (only $385 application fee) and inexpensive to operate. NHF does all the “administrivia” for you, including receiving all donations, writing checks and making disbursements from your foundation, sending charitable receipts for donations to your foundation, all accounting, state and federal compliance and reporting.</p>
</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>So in other words these people sell non-profit tax-exempt foundations for $385.

<li><b>Comment</b>: There has been some debate about notability, verifiability, etc. as they apply to browser-based games; they may be a unique case where the criteria should be different.

<li><b>Comment</b>: (Sorry, a bit of a rant follows.) This AfD has been relisted twice now, and it seems very few people are willing to discuss it. The previous AfD concluded the article was a keeper, and those who have participated in this one generally seem to think this article might be worth including; can't we leave it alone for now? Is it necessary to actually have a consensus? <a href="../../../a/r/t/Wikipedia%7EArticles_for_deletion_Nexus_War_c3c7.html" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Nexus War">Nexus War</a> was recently retained with no consensus, although granted that was a more spirited discussion.

<li><b>Weak Keep</b> Because of the uniqueness of the game, I think it may be worth keeping, it's very different from other games in its particular category (if there is actually one). --<a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">Ariad</a><a href="../../../e/a/_/WP%7EEA_54c2.html" title="WP:EA"><font color="green">o</font></a><a href="../../../a/r/i/User%7EAriadoss_a3f2.html" title="User:Ariadoss">ss</a> 19:20, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b>: Arguably there is a uniqueness to this game that can be seen objectively. Unfortunately, it's hard to demonstrate this without becoming a participant in GoKrida. And yes, one could also argue that participants have a vested interest in the game and would necessarily think of its uniqueness as a positive thing; but there are many who try it out and give up <i>because</i> it is so unique, and they can't quite "get" it; this could explain a regular player base that still seems small, even though GoKrida has actually been around for several years. And one would think that several years' worth of existence should have given GoKrida some sort of notability by now, yet I still can't find anything to cite from noteworthy independent sources, although I am continuing a search for such things to improve the article. <a href="../../../b/7/t/User%7EB7T_0f2e.html" title="User:B7T">B7T</a> 22:30, 14 August 2006 (UTC)</li>
