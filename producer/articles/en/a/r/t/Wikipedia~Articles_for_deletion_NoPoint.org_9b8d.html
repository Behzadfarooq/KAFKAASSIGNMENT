<li>It's not an advertisement...it's a reference. I highly doubt any random user would go onto wikipedia.org and type in NoPoint.org in the search box. You advertised the website when you put this page up for deletion, now people who never knew that the site existed, and would have never known the site existed are discovering it. The only reason this article is the only one I've editied is because I just signed up for a username on Wikipedia, I planned on editing other articles besides this one. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a></li>
<li>There's no reason for Wikipedia to manage, store, serve, and maintain the FAQ for <i>your</i> web site.

<li><b>Keep</b> Possible spam? Hogwash! Merriam-Webster defines spam as "unsolicited usually commercial e-mail sent to a large number of addresses". This article spam? I think not! I think any attempt to find a commerical connection here will be ultimately futile. Keep im mind, this article is a major work-in-progress. The final product will no doubt be a major contribution to academia.

<li>If so many people like it, why delete it? And could somebody define "non-encyclopedic" for me? It sounds like a pretty subjective parameter.

<li><b>Keep</b>. You people have no right judge the social and cultural implications of NoPoint.org based on your narrow viewpoint. For example, I do not study astrophysics, yet I do not go and mark the astrophysics page for deletion because the subject is not of immediate importance or interest to me. I understand and respect the fact that there is a community that astrophysics is important to, so I believe they are entitled to a page. Although it may not be apparent to you people sitting in front of your monitors, there is a community that appreciates the existance of a NoPoint.org wiki entry, albiet smaller than the astrophsyics community, yet no less important. Who are you to judge?

<li>Why do you guys care so much though? Can someone tell me how this page being on WP affects their daily life? <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a> 03:47, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>That's a perfectly fair question. There are two major reasons: <b>(PRECEDENT)</b> In a way, every VfD is a precedent. Nopoint.org has <i>absolutely no Alexa rank at all</i> (proof here: <a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org" class="external free" title="http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.alexa.com/data/details?url=nopoint.org</a> ) and next-to-no Google presence. If we were to keep this article just to be nice, then literally any website could argue that they deserve an article too, on the basis that Nopoint.org was kept. <b>(REPUTATION)</b> Wikipedia is, above all, an encyclopedia: a tool for people doing research. While articles like this are not personally offensive to us, a reader who finds Wikipedia to be clogged with unimportant, nonsensical, silly, trivial, and useless information is less likely to take wikipedia seriously as an information source. This is detrimental to Wikipedia as a whole and all the editors who work hard to make it a useful information source. <a href="../../../s/t/a/User%7EStarblind_b2a3.html" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan - <font color="#FF0000">St</font><font color="#FF5500">ar</font><font color="#FF8000">bli</font><font color="#FFC000">nd</font></a> 13:33, Mar 8, 2005 (UTC)

<li>Ok, I see your point. And thank you for a decent, reasonable explanation. The precedent case makes sense to me, as all the other website articles you guys shut down would want to be brought back up if you kept this one up. But can we make an exception? Ok, haha, probably not. I have to admit though, I was shocked by how passionate people are about shutting this page down. And although I do see your point about how people might not see WP as a serious information source...I'm not really sure how many people would consider WP as one. I use WP just as a hobby, but I would never use WP as a 'serious' source if I was going to write a paper, or even a short article. I can't imagine citing an open source encylcopedia ever as reference...the only thing it would be good for is perhaps references itself to other materials. Just my two cents. And also, I'd suggest some people who browse the VFDs so often read up on these: <a href="../../../h/o/b/Hobby.html" title="Hobby">hobby</a> and <a href="../../../r/e/c/Recreation.html" title="Recreation">recreation</a>. <a href="../../../k/a/n/User%7EKaneda_ae97.html" title="User:Kaneda">Kaneda</a> 22:39, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)</li>

<li>They ARE the same person! I had no idea he was on WP, we haven't had any contact with Ken since High School. (~4 years) Back in the old days he used to post crazy ramblings on my site ALL the time! What a crazy coincidence that he'd pop up here! See and you guys thought he wasn't really infamous! He just started posting on my site again you can go check it out if you'd like. Small small world! Finding out what Ken's up to made the whole thing worthwhile!!

<li>I might, but I think the point was that the other attacks were <i>unsigned</i>. If they're clearly attributed to someone, then it's easy to tell who's making the attack.
