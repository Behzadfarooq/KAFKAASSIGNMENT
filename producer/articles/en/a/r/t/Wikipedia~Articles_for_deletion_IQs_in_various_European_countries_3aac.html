</li>
<li><b>Strong delete</b> The list was obviously created to make a point. There is no other reason to compare these completely separate studies and rank them in the way that is being done. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 02:39, 19 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> This article have been created because the lack of specifing among europeans in <a href="../../../r/a/c/Race_and_Intelligence_9658.html" title="Race and Intelligence">Race and Intelligence</a>. So I do not feel that article cover this one. Whites and also Europeans are a large group. Why shall for example ashkenazi jews have an advantage of been divided from other jews and groups, while europeans/whites, blacks/africans, etc have not this advantage? Recently there was a discussion about the article <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_intelligence.html" title="Ashkenazi intelligence">Ashkenazi intelligence</a>. That article was obviously created to make a point and for highlightning advantages, like IQs in various European countries have been critized for. That article "survived". Another thing about <a href="../../../a/s/h/Ashkenazi_intelligence.html" title="Ashkenazi intelligence">Ashkenazi intelligence</a> is that 20 discussed/voted for deleting that article, while 15 discussed for keeping that article. Still the administration (read: <a href="../../../c/b/r/User%7ECbrown1023_a728.html" title="User:Cbrown1023">Cbrown1023</a>) choosed to keep it. Why shall we have disscussions/voting about the articles, if he and the administration already have decided what the results will be after the discussions??? This discussion about IQs in various European countries feels therefore hope- and pointless. <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangbush_8850.html" title="User:Cangbush">Cangbush</a><small>— <a href="../../../c/a/n/User%7ECangbush_8850.html" title="User:Cangbush">Cangbush</a> (<a href="../../../c/a/n/User_talk%7ECangbush_eefb.html" title="User talk:Cangbush">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Cangbush_37c4.html" title="Special:Contributions/Cangbush">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small>
<ul>
<li>Cangbush, just because Ashkenazi Intelligence made it through, and you're not very happy about it, please don't nominate this article for keep because you feel there should be reciprocation with that article. The Ashkenazi Intelligence page is primarily about a study, this is a complete and utter mix of studies. It's almost like our very own original research because it is comparing studies that no professional has compared, probably for a reason. I'm imploring you to reconsider based on the article's own merit. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 00:54, 23 February 2007 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Strong keep</b> There exist 3 sources on this subject, so it is some sourced. Vinko Buj and two of Richard Lynn, the one mentioned in this article and the other is the one from IQ and the wealth of countries. I think still that the one of Richard Lynn in this article is more actual for the article, since the studies there are newer/up-to-date scientific studies from Lynn. Since the average IQ is higher among some nations in the newer studies: it feels maybe more provocating for some people. The Ashkennazi Intelligence article is not heavily sourced. There is only one bigger studies on the subject. The others have very small numbers of testpersons.<a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMannfred5_39fd.html" title="User:Mannfred5">SriKorange</a><small>— <a href="../../../m/a/n/User%7EMannfred5_39fd.html" title="User:Mannfred5">Mannfred5</a> (<a href="../../../m/a/n/User_talk%7EMannfred5_53ef.html" title="User talk:Mannfred5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Mannfred5_97c7.html" title="Special:Contributions/Mannfred5">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> I can read here that the sources have been widely criticezed. Well there is an article called <a href="../../../i/q/_/IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations_495d.html" title="IQ and the Wealth of Nations">IQ and the Wealth of Nations</a> inside here. If Richard Lynn is reliable there; He should be reliable when he do new studies too. Or have he got Alzheimers, so he has become lesser reliable? <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolo5_9ea3.html" title="User:Molo5">Molo5</a><small>— <a href="../../../m/o/l/User%7EMolo5_9ea3.html" title="User:Molo5">Molo5</a> (<a href="../../../m/o/l/User_talk%7EMolo5_5fc1.html" title="User talk:Molo5">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Molo5_10c1.html" title="Special:Contributions/Molo5">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The Lynn and Buj tables are some similar, when it comes to ranking.

<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. I see that the table and article have been expanded and added with two new sources TODAY. The article is sourced and it is a bit pitty if this article was only here for one day. <a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESuganthinifromJaffna_f3b9.html" title="User:SuganthinifromJaffna">Suganthi</a><small>— <a href="../../../s/u/g/User%7ESuganthinifromJaffna_f3b9.html" title="User:SuganthinifromJaffna">SuganthinifromJaffna</a> (<a href="../../../s/u/g/User_talk%7ESuganthinifromJaffna_490e.html" title="User talk:SuganthinifromJaffna">talk</a> • <a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_SuganthinifromJaffna_38fa.html" title="Special:Contributions/SuganthinifromJaffna">contribs</a>) has made <a href="../../../s/i/n/Wikipedia%7ESingle_purpose_account_0b68.html" title="Wikipedia:Single purpose account">few or no other edits</a> outside this topic.</small></li>

<li>This is unbelievable. Can nobody see that the user who created this article was obviously trying to make a point by selecting these IQ studies? This entire article is laced with a <a href="../../../p/o/i/WP%7EPOINT_0c46.html" title="WP:POINT">WP:POINT</a> upbringing. There is no encyclopedic reason for comparing completely separate IQ studies like this. <a href="../../../u/s/e/User%7EUsedup_4065.html" title="User:Usedup">Usedup</a> 00:46, 23 February 2007 (UTC)
