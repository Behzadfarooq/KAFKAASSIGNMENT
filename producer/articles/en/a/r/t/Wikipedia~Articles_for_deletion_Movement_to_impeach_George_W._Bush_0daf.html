<p>this page should be deleted.</p>
<p>And it's not only POV, it's inaccurate and misleading. Many quoted "allegations" can not even be traced to a source. For example, Google results for 'Bush and alleged overseeing of "bribery and coercion of individuals and governments"' yields 1 result - <b>this wikipedia page</b>. The charge of 'Alleged "Concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment;"' seems to have been copied verbatim from <a href="http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.votetoimpeach.org/notes_5.htm</a>, but the source has no supporting evidence to back up this claim ... and it should also be noted that the author of the source web site in question is none other than Ramsey Clark, Saddam Hussien's and Slobadan Milosevich's lawyer, as well as a leader in the World Worker's Party - ie. not the most credible source, especially when he presents no supporting evidence to back up his claim that the US President actually was "Concealing information vital to public discussion and informed judgment"</p>
<p>at most, this topic should be a sub-section (and a small one) of the <a href="../../../g/e/o/George_W._Bush_315d.html" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> page. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryfooter_c6e7.html" title="User:Larryfooter">Larryfooter</a> 03:38, 24 July 2005 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Comment</b>: Persuasiveness comes with fewer exclamation points. Meanwhile, I'm puzzled by your harping on at the fact that Clark is/was Saddam's lawyer. I happen to think that people accused of war crimes (or of pedophilia, of embezzlement, or whatever) should be represented by good lawyers, and that a conscientious freelance lawyer is not besmirched by the crimes, etc., of his/her client even if that client is found guilty. Have I misunderstood US law? Meanwhile, your ability to judge the nonsensicality of Tiefer's book may be assisted by reading it. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 07:49, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<dd><b>Reply to Comment</b>: True Hoary - but if one examines Clark's activities over the past 20 years, then one notices a patern. He defends Slobadan Milosevich - then Saddam - before that he heads up the World Worker's Party - in short, he consistently befriends enemies of the United States of America. So then one must ask himself (or herself) "why?" Why would one take up common cause over and over again with enemies of not only the US, but enemies of freedom, human rights, and life itself (both Saddam and Milosevich were responsible for the genocide of hundreds of thousands of people) - so if he starts a "movement" to impeach the president, is that newsworthy or encyclopedic? and if so, is it encyclopedic enough to warrant its own entry, or is it just a footnote to an encyclopedic topic (ie. the President of the United States)? I've never seen any report on CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX or read any report in the NY Times, Washington Post or any other paper that leant any credibility to his "movement." There are all sorts of "movements" in the United States, and many of them are not encyclopedic - so why is this one? This falls more into the category of "silly actions of crackpots," and thus is not encyclopedic. <a href="../../../l/a/r/User%7ELarryfooter_c6e7.html" title="User:Larryfooter">Larryfooter</a> 16:05, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<dd>Generally, I would not recommend taking up a mission of removing from WP all articles about "silly actions of crackpots". Anyway, there are six bullet points in proponents section and the picadilloes of one does not dismiss the desires of many people, no matter how misguided.

<li><b>Delete</b>. A movement is "a series of organized activities working toward an objective", as, for example, the Civil Rights movement. Opinions and statements are not a movement. When people are massing in the streets clamoring for Bush's impeachment...that's the time for a "movement" article. I mean, really: Clinton was <i>impeached</i>, and it would be misleading to contend there was a <b>movement</b> for him to be impeached. - <a href="../../../n/u/n/User%7ENunh-huh_d05a.html" title="User:Nunh-huh">Nunh-huh</a> 07:56, 24 July 2005 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>: You have a point, but I think you're defining "movement" rather too narrowly. There does seem to be some evidence that there really was a "vast" (well, pretty big) right-wing conspiracy out to get Clinton; you don't need massing in the streets when you've got Fox on the boob tube, AM blowhards, Murdoch journalism, rightwing Christian fundamentalists, etc.: I'd say there was a "movement", or at least the illusion thereof. There do seem to be organized activities working toward the objective of impeachment; I happen to think that impeachment is unlikely because of lingering distaste of the preceding one, but we'll see. -- <a href="../../../h/o/a/User%7EHoary_ca70.html" title="User:Hoary">Hoary</a> 08:35, July 24, 2005 (UTC)

<p><s>If Wikipedians can put their ideology aside and vote on the merits of the article, they'll agree that that this is not a serious movement, but a random assortment of pundits and bloggers who have little connection with each other.

<li><b>Delete</b>. This is a sentiment, not a movement. Millions of people hate George W. Bush, but there is no cohesive movement to impeach him, either. If something actually comes up in Congress, then let's make an article, but until then its not encyclopedic. The article doesn't even have a particularly good grasp on the concept of impeachment, either; it mentions a move on the part of Rep. Conyers and Rep. Frank to "impeach" Karl Rove, a man who holds a position with no Congressional oversight and therefore cannot be impeached. <a href="../../../f/e/r/User%7EFernando_Rizo_ef9f.html" title="User:Fernando Rizo">Fernando Rizo</a> <a href="../../../f/e/r/User_talk%7EFernando_Rizo_69e0.html" title="User talk:Fernando Rizo"><i>T</i></a>/<a href="../../../c/o/n/Special%7EContributions_Fernando_Rizo_71a2.html" title="Special:Contributions/Fernando Rizo"><i>C</i></a> 00:05, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The Congressional standard is explicitly higher than the wiki standard of notability. Since a subway station is "notable", and a radio station notable if it broadcasts "beyond a city", setting the bar at "impeachment charges introduced" is both high and, quite frankly circular. How are charges to be filed with the judiciary if there was no movement to provide political cover? The movement to Impeach Earl Warren never even got hearings, but was mentioned in the press and in books, and was clearly "notable", even if it went nowhere in Congress. <a href="../../../s/t/i/User%7EStirling_Newberry_897e.html" title="User:Stirling Newberry">Stirling Newberry</a> 05:06, 25 July 2005 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I say <b>keep</b> it. This page is a testament to the growing feeling in this country that the President lied to the citizens of this country to fight a war that was based on altogether different motives than the one(s) presented. The massive fraud and corruption that is tied to this military action is appalling, not to mention the absolute reconstructing of the government. For example, since when does the Senate forego consent and advise for an up/down vote? One is a Constitutional responsibility. The other should come after that responsibility is discharged. Yet consent and advise was compromised away. And what of the effort to do away with the Constitutional restrictions on terms served by the President? Thjat would be the 22nd Amendment. It was presented by Representative Hoyer with several co-sponsors.(www.thomas.loc.gov) Let alone the claims of Delay to make Republican rulership permanent.(You can Google this) The ravings of a madman? I think not. - Gonzo <i>....added at or shortly after 02:59, 26 July 2005 by User:66.235.65.174:66.235.65.174</i></li>

<li>Very strong keep - Some of us started the impeachment process on January 20, 2001, when GWB falsely swore to uphold the constitution by illegally taking office after systematically stealing approximately 1.2 million votes. This is not a new movement, it is just one that has taken a long time to catch on due to corporate media protection of a man guilty of 39 crimes and misdemeanors, at last count. If we apply the same standards of evidence that he applied to the minority inmates he executed as governor of Texas, then we not only need to impeach him but should also execute him.

<li><b>Very Strong Keep</b> - This is an <b>important</b> and <b>historic movement</b>. There are several campaigns (organized and otherwise) within the U.S. with the goal of impeaching George W. Bush. That the main-stream media refuses to report on these is neither surprising nor is it a confirmation of non-existence of such a movement. Let us not get side-tracked with bellicose detractors who wish to distract us with arguments such as no "official" stamps of approval exist to provide legitimacy to the movement or the precise meaning of the word "movement" or that we should include opinions on why the president should not be impeached, and other inane contentions. This is a movement involving citizens of the United States of America against a corrupt government that continues to erode the Bill of Rights and constitutionally provided rights and liberties. One only needs to look around to realize that the citizenry is disenfranchised and is demanding redress. Such redress, which is our constitutional right to seek, has thus far been denied by this out-of-control government on several occasions. This is a bipartisan movement and should be documented here in a prominent way as it unfolds. --Light Messenger 20:06, 2005 July 27 (UTC)
