<li>He's talking about American Government Simulation, if that's what you were asking. That article was put up for VFD by members of this government simulation because of the "double standards" John Joffey is citing from this article being deleted and AGS having an article. <a href="../../../j/a/x/User%7EJaxl_09f9.html" title="User:Jaxl">Jaxl</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/x/User_talk%7EJaxl_d9b4.html" title="User talk:Jaxl">talk</a> 23:25, 21 August 2005 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Thanks Jaxl, that article reads like an encylopedic, intelligible explanation of an online political forum which simulates various aspects of government.

<li><b>Comment</b>:I find it ludicrous that there are votes to delete this. Everything in this article is 100% factual seeing as I have written all of it and I founded the game. As for it being "non-notable" it is the single most notable Government Simulation game that exists. It was the FIRST comprehensive government simulation, and I pride myself knowing that this game is very much a learning experience as everybody who plays gains significant knowledge about american politics and government. Continuing, "AGS" another government simulator that came after this one, has a page here on wikipedia, and you dont see me voting to delete that, or the biased page on "Government Simulation" written by somebody not affiliated with USG and who conviently, it seems, left USG information off that page except for 1 or 2 lines. I am relatively new to wikipedia, so excuse me that I had the line "advertising" the game. I removed it, so there are no more qualms.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:Clie, Sorry, but AGS, NPS, and PolUS arent "passing USG up" (and by the way, get your facts straight...PolUS MERGED INTO USG!, Thanks for bringing your garbage into the discussion) and USG is certainly not being "outpaced". Thank you for wasting my time. I would really like to know what all these random people have against having this page up? So far, nobody is really giving any good reasons for these votes to Delete. Now, if a Admin from Wikipedia would like to contact me to discuss making this page more suited for Wikipedia, I would have no problem editing to meet these guidelines. However, outright deletion would just uphold the double standard of letting a copycat game, AGS, have its own page on here and USG not. Also, I am not going to vote on my own page, because I dont think deletion is a valid option. If a Wikipedia Admin wants to contact me, my AIM is PillagerConclave</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:NationStates is a BUSINESS-backed game made by somebody promoting his book and the idea of corporate government. USGovsim is not a business, its is just a free web-based forum game. It is THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game, so the fact that you want to delete our page, but AGS (American Government Sim) a game that has been around alot less longer than USG and more or less a copycat game is allowed to have a page is a double standard. This is a FREE encyclopedia, and this page is 100% Fact. USG was *the* pioneer in Govsim-based gaming, so if there are going to be pages about Govsims on here, then I am going to make sure the facts are known.</li>

<li><b>Comment</b>:If this site is "THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game", then you should have no problem citing refrences that establish its notability. Unless you can cite a large google result, a media or a news source that has done a report on this game, or some other piece of material by an independent site/organisation/whatever, then there is no reason why this page cannot be mentioned in <a href="../../../g/o/v/Government_simulation.html" title="Government simulation">Government simulation</a> instead. Furthermore, this debate is not about AGS, nor does anyone here care about what % of this article is fact.

<li><b>Comment</b>. The question isn't whether the article is <i>factual</i>, but rather whether the game is <i>notable</i> enough for its own article. That a number of passionate fans of the game have come here to "stuff the ballot box" and to counter what they perceive as an attack is all-too-common. There are thousands of games out there, all who would claim to be "unique" in some way, with some passionate fans. Should they all have their own article? Wikipedia is not a webgame directory.

<li><b>Comment</b>: Mr. Joffey, calling people ignorant does not help your cause. All we are asking you to do is to give proof that your site is notable, which you repeatedly avoid doing. It should not be that difficult; after all, this site <i>is</i> "THE MOST notable of any Government Simulator game", isn't it? Also, it is irrelevant whether or not Google picks up someone mentioning this site on a message board; that does not mean it is notable. Unless you can find a good number of <i>different</i> people on <i>different</i> boards (preferably ones with a large userbase) that have mentioned this site, then there is no notability here. Groton here also mentions that this site had been on Avidgamers (a statement which I have yet to see any evidence for); and even if it was, then why is it not <i>currently</i> there? And is that the only site that this game was on? Mr. Joffey, please give evidence supporting your claims. <a href="../../../j/a/x/User%7EJaxl_09f9.html" title="User:Jaxl">Jaxl</a> | <a href="../../../j/a/x/User_talk%7EJaxl_d9b4.html" title="User talk:Jaxl">talk</a> 14:00, 18 August 2005 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>:Not a single one of you can tell me why USG cannot have its own Wikipedia page, yet AGS and the other Govsims/Internationalsims already have their own pages? DOUBLE STANDARD. You let them keep theirs, let us keep ours. We are the most notable one. Sorry that there is no "Govsim Notability Tracker."

<p>USGovSim.com was mentioned on the September 1, 2004 edition of "Cafe Politics" on WKNT Knightcast, which is student radio for the University of Central Florida. UCF is one of the largest public universities in the nation with over 40,000 students. This discussion was not advertising based and discussed government simulators in relations to the study of politics during the 2004 US Elections. If necessary, I will attempt to attain a copy of that night's show for verification. -Roary Snider, Executive Producer, Cafe Politics on Knightcast WKNT 67.8.248.211 02:48, 19 August 2005 (UTC)</p>
