<p>The result of the debate was <b>no consensus.</b> I'll probably get some disagreement, but 59% is not good enough to me when you have a split like this.

<p><b>KEEP</b>. Of course they're noteworthy enough - as are the others.

<li><i>Comment:</i> There is in fact precedent for batch nominations when the articles are significantly similar in that the arguments for deletion are appliacable as a group (see <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Kanji_articles_1b3e.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Kanji articles">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Kanji articles</a> for one recent example). There is also precedent for breaking the vote into separate votes if votes are split for some and against others. <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla"></a> — <a href="../../../g/w/a/User%7EGwalla_52c1.html" title="User:Gwalla">Gwalla</a> | <a href="../../../g/w/a/User_talk%7EGwalla_1816.html" title="User talk:Gwalla">Talk</a> 30 June 2005 04:54 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>Comment:</i> While not common, it is a tool that is used at times. Another example is <a href="../../../v/o/t/Wikipedia%7EVotes_for_deletion_Bob_Burns_23b7.html" title="Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bob Burns">Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Bob Burns</a>. Sometimes users see a group of articles "missing" and create them all in rapid fashion, before a discussion has a chance to decide what to do with such a group. Grouping them together in on VfD allows us an opportunity to discuss them as a whole, and not repeat the same discussions in a large array of VfDs. If there is a case to be made for some of the concerned articles, it will usually be made and that article or articles treated differently. Standard VfDs are easy affairs. This type of VfD is not; undoing the work of the original author is time consumptive, and requires a significant amount of attention to detail. Nevertheless, the outcome is productive, regardless of the voted result, as it pushes us ever on to a better version of the encyclopedia. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 30 June 2005 14:04 (UTC)

<li>Without wishing to attract censure for voting twice, may I comment that I find it an interesting version of a "better encyloapedia" that removes articles which a significant minority of its readers feel are worthwhile, when the main argument against them is merely non-notability. To a tone-deaf, boring old f*rt like me, endless articles on little-known rock bands are (effectively) "cruft", but I accept that someone somewhere will want to look them up. I happen to feel that the sam can be said for locales and structures which have existed for, in some cases, 50 years, under constant development. \endrant --<a href="../../../s/i/m/User%7ESimoncursitor_1173.html" title="User:Simoncursitor">Simon Cursitor</a> 30 June 2005 17:33 (UTC)

<p><b>To help clear up the tangled mess:</b> The votes so far can be broken down as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Straight keep: 9</li>
<li>Straight merge: 7</li>
<li>Keep or merge: 1</li>
<li>Delete or merge: 3</li>
<li>Merge, but retain Watford: 6</li>
<li>Using a pro-keep perspective: 10</li>
<li>Using a pro-merge perspective: 17</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, it seems likely the turnout of this will be merge. I'd like to suggest that those who have not stated anything in particular regarding Watford Gap do so in addition to their other votes, as I think we'll need some concensus with that article.

We're eight days into this VfD now, and it is likely this will close soon. While we have consensus (keep Watford, merge others), it's not a glaringly clear consensus:</p>
<ul>
<li>35% want to delete Watford, 65% keep&#160;; if we include in this the 'keep' votes as also meaning keep Watford, then it's 20% delete Watford, 80% keep which is quite clear.</li>
<li>41% for keeping all of them, 59% for merging).</li>
</ul>
<p>The most likely candidate for a merge destination is <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area_%28UK%29_9f61.html" title="Motorway service area (UK)">Motorway service area (UK)</a> (which is a stub itself).</p>
<p><br />
If anyone wants to clarify their vote further, please do so now. If anyone who has not voted wishes to speak their minds, please do so as it may help gain further consensus.</p>

<li><b>Comment</b>: Please see <a href="../../../g/u/i/Wikipedia%7EGuide_to_Votes_for_deletion_e10e.html" title="Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to Votes for deletion</a>. It is up to the administrator who closes this VfD to determine whether such concensus exists. In my opinion, there's somewhat weak concensus with 59% in favor of merging the articles. If I were an administrator, I would most likely close this VfD and indicate the contents of the articles (excepting Watford) should be merged into <a href="../../../m/o/t/Motorway_service_area_%28UK%29_9f61.html" title="Motorway service area (UK)">Motorway service area (UK)</a>. You are welcome to disagree with me. However, I'm not the person who will be closing this VfD. I'm simply trying to clarify the situation as it stands now, in a complex situation. --<a href="../../../d/u/r/User%7EDurin_0711.html" title="User:Durin">Durin</a> 8 July 2005 19:16 (UTC)</li>
