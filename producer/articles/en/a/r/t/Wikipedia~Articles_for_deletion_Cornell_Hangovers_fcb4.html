<p>doesn't meet "Notability (music)" standards of:</p>
<p>"A musician or ensemble (note that this includes a band, singer, rapper, orchestra, hip hop crew, dj etc) is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:</p>
<p>Has had a charted hit on any national music chart, in at least one large or medium-sized country[1]. Has had a record certified gold or higher in at least one large or medium-sized country. Has gone on an international concert tour, or a national concert tour in at least one large or medium-sized country[1], reported in notable and verifiable sources. Has released two or more albums on a major label or one of the more important indie labels (i.e. an independent label with a history of more than a few years and a roster of performers, many of which are notable). Has been prominently featured in any major music media. Contains at least one member who was once a part of or later joined a band that is otherwise extremely notable; note that it is often most appropriate to use redirects in place of articles on side projects, early bands and such. Has become the most prominent representative of a notable style or the local scene of a city (or both, as in British hip hop); note that the subject must still meet all ordinary Wikipedia standards, including verifiability. Has won a major music award, such as a Grammy, Juno or Mercury Music Award. Has won or placed in a major music competition. Has performed music for a work of media that is notable, e.g. a theme for a network television show. (But if this is the only claim, it is probably more appropriate to have a mention in the main article and redirect to that page.) Has been placed in rotation nationally by any major radio network. Has been the subject of a half hour or hour broadcast on a national radio network. "</p>

I went to cornell, and this article is junk. Do people watch to make sure that lies do not get posted?

In fact, over the past two days, I've rolled back dozens of inappropriate links from this user: look at all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JDoorjam" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/JDoorjam" rel="nofollow">Bates alma-mater-cruft</a> I've scrubbed off in the past few days. (I'm not the only one to notice this and roll it back, either: see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.128.84.159" class="external text" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:24.128.84.159" rel="nofollow">his talk page</a> for <a href="../../../m/u/l/User%7EMulder416_290e.html" title="User:Mulder416">User:Mulder416</a>'s comments on the issue.) But, rather than discuss his POV Bates spamming, this user has decided to come after my edits. The nominator pretty obviously is a sock puppet for the IP address, given the <i>huge</i> (not) number of edits the nominator has made. With alllll that said, the Hangovers:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>have won or placed in a major music competition (the ICCA, which is about as big a competition as collegiate a cappella has)</li>
<li>have toured Switzerland, Italy, Germany, France, England, and Brazil in the past three years.</li>

<li>Thank you. Why does AFD get dominated by kneejerk deleters who don't even notice basic things, like that nominator's only contribution was this AFD. <a href="../../../h/a/s/User%7EHasNoClue_3d03.html" title="User:HasNoClue">HasNoClue</a> 05:20, 9 February 2006 (UTC)</li>
<li>I concut with JDoorjam, we need to stop being so lenient of null-value contributors and extend indefinite banning to include lesser infractions.

<li><b>Keep</b> - In case there is any further doubt, I believe the Hangovers meet the standards of notability. The ensemble has gone on numerous international tours, traveling to Germany in 1970, and making their first solo tour to Bermuda in 1971. On a 1995 tour to Japan, they received attention by donating half of their tour profits to the Kobe Earthquake Relief Fund. They most recently toured London in June 2005 and will be touring Italy in March 2006. In March 2004, they were shown performing on the Brazilian national evening news, Jornal Nacional. Alumni include such notables as <a href="../../../a/l/a/Alan_Keyes_43a9.html" title="Alan Keyes">Alan Keyes</a>. They have competed in international competitions such as the Intercollegiate Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), advancing to the semifinals in 2001. They can be heard on the PBS American Experience documentary "Rescue at Sea." They are the second oldest a cappella group at <a href="../../../c/o/r/Cornell_University_7419.html" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, certainly the most well-traveled, and arguably the most musical. In 1980, their original single titled "Facetime" received national recognition and earned mention in Yale's "Guide to Selective Colleges." The song was recently re-recorded on the album "Blackout" with another original song, "River to the Sea," both of which received high marks from the Recorded A Cappella Review Board (RARB). The Hangovers have perfomed for <a href="../../../j/o/h/John_D._Rockefeller_a11c.html" title="John D. Rockefeller">John D.
